9485,tillage practices are known to affect soil water retention plant available water and consequently crop production impacts can be determined by assessing soil hydraulic properties and crop characteristics in this study three tillage practices were investigated with respect to vertical soil water distribution and development of soybean a specific focus was set on determining evaporation and transpiration as fractions of evapotranspiration to obtain additional information on water availability and crop water use the agricultural practices included conventional tillage reduced tillage no plow and no tillage the study site was a long term field experiment under rainfed conditions the investigations covered a vegetation period of soybean the measurements comprised weather and soil water monitoring using sensors and manual monitoring of crop development evapotranspiration and its components were determined using scintillometer measurements and an isotope based water balance technique in the researched vegetation period with limited water availability the conservative tillage practices showed better water storage water use and crop yields compared to the conventional practice the weekly evaporation and transpiration rates progressed according to the respective canopy development thus delayed plant development of the no till practice led to extended green cover and productive water use during the late season where a large part of the precipitation has fallen the tillage induced differences of soil hydraulic properties had a substantial impact on soil water distribution but a comparatively small impact on the soil surface wetness and thus directly on the evaporation rate the tillage induced impacts on soil cover by plant residues however showed the substantial reduction effect of plant residue cover on evaporation losses hence assessment of evaporation and transpiration rates contributes to the understanding of differences in water productivity and promotes the efficient use of the available water resources keywords water use evapotranspiration tillage soil water management isotope fractionation scintillometry 1 introduction increasing pressure on water resources is a fundamental and inherent problem in many parts of the world anthropogenic actions further intensify this pressure through increased water needs of a growing population degradation of land and water resources and cascading effects of warmer temperatures and erratic weather patterns schewe et al 2014 therefore farmers and scientists work on strategies to approach this growing problem by developing and applying sustainable management practices for an efficient use of the available water in this context it is crucial to comprehend water consumption processes in crop production and to quantify water fluxes on the one hand required knowledge comprises soil physical micrometeorological and agricultural aspects to reduce losses due to leaching runoff and evaporation and to ensure water availability scardigno 2020 on the other hand it comprises the agronomic and genomic aspect to obtain high transpiration efficiency by targeting the plant intrinsic trade off between carbon fixation and water loss in the course of co2 acquisition ducat and silver 2012 improvements of these aspects can be targeted through adjusted management practices which include selection of crop and variety or actions such as irrigation fertilization and tillage fan et al 2017 tillage as mechanical treatment of soil is used for seed bed preparation soil loosening weed control and integration of fertilizer and residues into the soil phillips et al 1980 together with natural compaction and associated management practices such as irrigation or residue management it alters the soil s pore characteristic and in particular the macro and mesopores buczko et al 2006 strudley et al 2008 as a consequence soil hydraulic properties and water storage capability are affected moret and arr√∫e 2007 the actual impact of a particular management action depends on the soil texture and especially on the macropore network of the local soil buczko et al 2006 consequently reviews on the effects of tillage treatments show diverse effects according to the local conditions in particular regarding total porosity and soil bulk density strudley et al 2008 unger and cassel 1991 in spite of the complexity of relationships some tillage specific trends are noticeable in particular when comparing intensive conventional and no tillage practices no tillage and conservative tillage practices with minimized mechanical disturbance of soil structure increase macropore connectivity causing increased infiltration capability and hydraulic conductivities in the low suction range ehlers 1975 dunn and phillips 1991 reynolds et al 1995 in relation to minimum soil disturbance biological activity causes well connected and elongated meso and macropore systems with large spatial heterogeneity and high soil hydraulic conductivity in the active soil layer lipiec and hatano 2003 usowicz and lipiec 2021 zhang et al 2020 moreover conservative tillage practices lead to a better near surface 0 30 cm water storage which could increase water use efficiency especially under dryer climatic conditions schwen et al 2011a thaler et al 2012 pittelkow et al 2015a as tillage induced differences are supposed to further increase under dryer climatic conditions angulo jaramillo et al 1997 xu and mermoud 2003 conservative tillage practices are expected to become more important in future the effect of tillage on crop development is similarly diverse as on soil physical properties crop development depends on the texture structure type and depth of the local soil as well as on further factors such as weather conditions and plant specific characteristics crawford et al 2018 phogat et al 2020 thus the effects of specific tillage techniques on crop development and yield are variable as they are associated with the local conditions blanco canqui and wortmann 2020 busari et al 2015 these conditions include local characteristics such as the soils response to mechanical disturbance and compaction as well as actual freeze thaw and wet dry cycles or biological activity blanco canqui and wortmann 2020 boone and veen 1994 some of the influencing factors are directly related to the tillage induced changes of soil physical properties for example conservation and provision of plant available water or soil porosity and bulk density the complex impacts of tillage on soil physical properties and crop development further affect soil water distribution and root growth boone and veen 1994 and thus plant water uptake consequently different tillage systems are expected to have an impact on actual crop evapotranspiration etc act that is et under less than ideal crop conditions e g non optimal water supply or management practices and in particular the rates of evaporation and transpiration knowing these sub processes is of particular importance with respect to evaluating and improving water use efficiency in water limited regions zheng et al 2021 in this regard the transpiring fraction t of evapotranspiration et is productively used for biomass production while the fraction of evaporation e does not directly contribute to plant growth whereas both processes occur inseparably and interactively quantification may nonetheless contribute to evaluation and improvement of management practices considering a multitude of etc act partitioning studies on various scales and research fields partitioning techniques have hardly been used to analyze management actions kool et al 2014 except for mulch techniques ding et al 2013 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 this study aims at contributing to a better understanding of how tillage systems affect soil water plant relationships at an agricultural field in particular three selected tillage techniques conventional tillage reduced tillage and no tillage were considered applied on long term tillage experiment plots cultivated with soybean the study includes effects of the three tillage practices on i profile soil water distribution storage versus percolation ii plant development yields and water requirement iii evaporation and transpiration ratios a certain focus was set on the latter by partitioning etc act using a stable isotope based method 2 material and methods 2 1 location and field trial the study was conducted in 2020 at a long term field trial and a conventionally managed field near raasdorf 48 14 n 16 35 e 156 m elevation a s l east of vienna austria the region is characterized by a flat topography and has an annual precipitation of 523 mm and an average temperature of 10 8 c 2000 2019 table 1 shows the characteristic of the climate in the marchfeld region based on annual et0 and precipitation data the monthly precipitation data in table 2 illustrate the variability of the local weather conditions et0 was determined according to allen et al 2005 with the standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for daily timesteps and short crop with an approximate height of 0 12 m similar to clipped cool season grass with the reference type constants cn 900 k mm s3 mg 1 d 1 and cd 0 34 s m 1 and the surface resistance rs of 70 s m 1 for short reference yield in this agricultural region is generally restricted by water shortage and heat stress bodner et al 2015 the climatic conditions can be described as dry subhumid with periodically occurring hot summers with high evaporative demand during the growing period of the main crop evapotranspiration generally exceeds the amount of summer precipitation and winters with frequent frosts and low evaporative demand thus winter rainfall table 2 is generally sufficient to refill the soil water storage which depletes during the summer months the soil type in the experimental field and the conventionally managed field was classified as chernozem wrb 2014 with silt loam texture according to fao classification chesworth et al 2008 pedogenesis of the chernozem indicates that etc in this area consistently exceeds precipitation during the growing period bock 2014 eyre 2017 the soil can be divided into an a horizon 0 30 cm over an ac horizon 30 60 cm over a c horizon 60 cm with matured calcareous sediments and coarse texture below 80 cm the topsoil at all treatments has a phcacl2 of 7 58 a more detailed description of the soil including soil properties and hydraulic parameters for each horizon is given in table 3 nutrient data are given in table 4 soil properties and hydraulic parameters were derived from each three measurement replicates in soil depths of 5 40 and 70 cm including tension infiltrometer measurements core sample analyses and particle size analyses infiltration measurements were done according to ankeny et al 1988 and analyzed as described by warrick 1992 chemical soil properties and nutrient data were derived from composite soil samples from 20 subsamples in 10 cm depth steps the airdried homogenized and 2 mm sieved composite soil samples were analyzed according to austrian standards caco3 √∂norm 1999b soc √∂norm 1999a nt √∂norm 2002 p √∂norm 1993 and for pmn according to kandeler 1993 respectively the long term field trial has been operated since 1997 with a focus on assessing management induced changes in soil hydraulic properties and its effect on plant development the implemented soil tillage techniques included conventional tillage con reduced tillage red and no tillage not practices the tillage variants were organized in rectangular plots with areas of 960 m2 or 1440 m2 and in three replicates conventional tillage con comprised annual moldboard plowing of the top 25 cm soil layer after harvest and seedbed preparation using a harrow in 10 cm depth for reduced tillage red a wing share cultivator has been used to a soil depth of 20 25 cm and every four years a subsoiler to a depth of 35 cm thereby the soil was not inverted and parts of plant residues remained on the soil surface seedbed preparation and sowing was done as in the con treatment no tillage not was based on a direct seeding method where the soil is just opened during sowing in coulter width the impacts of the applied soil tillage techniques on the soil penetration resistances are shown in fig 1 soil penetration resistances were measured with a cone penetrometer eijkelkamp giesbeek the netherlands to a depth of approx 40 cm cone with a 60 top angle and a base area of 1 cm2 and were provided by the experimental station gro√ü enzersdorf beside bulk density soil penetration resistance throughout the soil profile further depends on swc soc and texture marshall et al 1996 a herbicide was applied before sowing for weed control therefore weeds could be repressed effectively except for locally restricted areas of weed infestation in not these areas with weed infestation were not considered in the evaluations not can be attributed to conservation tillage practices since the soil surface was covered at least 30 with crop residues mulch after planting bergtold et al 2020 crop rotations in all treatments were based on main crops only hence the experiments were unaffected by cover crops the preceding crop winter wheat was the same for each tillage system crop residues were left on the field and incorporated according to the applied tillage technique generally tillage induced differences between the long term experimental plots have been repeatedly investigated for instance by bodner et al 2013 neugschwandtner et al 2020 2014 and schwen et al 2011b main findings were that descending intensity of tillage caused increased bulk density and penetration resistance while total porosity and hydraulic conductivity decreased the avoidance of tillage resulted in larger mean macropore size with higher connectivity and smaller tortuosity but a lower number of water conducting pores compared to tillage with artificial soil disturbance thus the smaller mean macropore size in red and con plots compared to consolidated soils not were compensated by their abundance schwen et al 2011b the preexisting soil physical characteristics due to long term tillage variants represented the initial conditions for the presented study a field near the long term field trial was chosen for additional etc act measurements the additional etc act measurement based on scintillometer data was done to check etc act based on a water balance in the con plots the field was managed like the con plots and therefore showed similar plant development with respect to leaf area index and plant height for instance the field size of approx 11 5 ha was assumed to better represent realistic conditions in terms of etc act with less boundary effects compared to the small structured replicate plots hence etc act measured at the field was used to verify that etc act at the con plots is similar to an open field in 2020 soybean glycine max l merr was sown with 50 seeds per m2 on may 7 and harvested on september 22 days after sowing das 138 at harvest date senescence was completed and above ground parts were dry in all plots yields and yield components were obtained by manually harvesting the plants on 2 m2 per plot leaf litter shed before the harvest was not considered the weather conditions with 225 mm precipitation during the vegetation period did not necessarily require irrigation the three tillage treatment systems were compared by considering vertical patterns of soil water and isotope distribution plant growth and crop yield parameters and evaporation and transpiration rates 2 2 monitoring soil water plant development and meteorological parameters at plot scale for each soil tillage technique one soil water monitoring set of probes was installed in the center of its main plot with 1440 m2 immediately after sowing volumetric soil water content vswc in cm3 cm 3 was monitored at each station within the top 5 cm with hydra probe soil moisture sensors stevens water monitoring systems inc usa and below in 10 cm increments to a probe depth of at least 70 cm with enviroscan soil moisture probes sentek pty ltd australia conversion of sensor readings to vswc values was done by applying the appropriate standard calibration for silt loam for the hydra probe sensors according to stevens 2015 and for the enviroscan sensors according to sentek pty ltd 2009 the soil texture specific calibration equations were chosen to avoid additional soil disturbance and change of growing conditions that are known to occur because of field calibration the sensors are assumed to provide satisfactory results as shown by kibirige and dobos 2021 for comparable conditions additionally vswcs from sensor readings agreed well with swcs derived from isotope soil samples plant development was determined on a weekly basis the observations comprised plant height and root system depth with measuring tapes leaf area index lai with an accupar par lai ceptometer model lp 80 meter group inc usa and soil cover fractions with an image analysis tool by bauer and strauss 2014 root system depth was measured as maximum root depth of the tap root in weekly excavated trenches a standard weather station with two temperature and relative humidity probes hmp35c campbell scientific inc usa was installed above the moisture monitoring station in the con plot additionally a rain gauge and a rainwater collector for isotope sampling palmex rain sampler rx1 were installed 2 3 determination of evaporation and transpiration rates at plot scale calculation of evaporation e and transpiration t rates was done based on a mass balance of soil water and its stable isotopes by wenninger et al 2010 and sutanto et al 2012 with modifications according to liebhard et al 2022 this mass balance bases on the conservation of soil water mass and its stable isotopes ratio in a considered soil column therefore soil water content and its stable isotope ratio were determined in a soil column as well as in the in precipitation capillary rise and outgoing evaporation transpiration percolation water and isotope fluxes similar to all other stable isotope based tracing and partitioning methods the relative mass difference between isotopes are utilized naturally occurring water molecules with stable hydrogen or oxygen isotopes e g 2h1h16o or 1h2 18o are heavier than the most abundant water molecules 1h2 16o which imparts measurable fractionations during physical and chemical reactions during evaporation the mass difference and thus the difference of vapor pressures of stable water isotopes causes the lighter isotopes to evaporate first which leads to enrichment of heavy water isotopes in the residual soil water the abundance of heavy stable isotopes in the residual soil water and knowledge about boundary conditions e g temperature and relative humidity during isotope fractionation allows estimation of evaporation in combination with the assumption that transpiration does not cause isotope fractionation during root water uptake and enrichment of isotopes in soil water williams et al 2004 e etc act and tc act etc act ratios and e and tc act rates can be calculated as residue of the mass balance with etc act from soil water mass balance in this study the mass balance was calculated for a soil column of 75 cm depth data were analyzed for weekly periods as described in the following paragraphs 2 3 1 determination of water balance components at the upper system boundary precipitation was measured with the rain gauges and collected for isotope analysis with the isotope rain collector etc act was calculated on a weekly basis as residue from a simplified soil water mass balance down to a soil depth of 75 cm using precipitation data and the change of volumetric soil water content vswc runoff was considered negligible due to the very flat topography furthermore capillary rise and deep percolation were precluded for the local conditions at the lower boundary in 75 cm depth which was checked with a hydrus 1d calculation vswc and its isotope ratio was determined at the beginning and end of each evaluation period for isotope analysis of pore water soil cores were collected with an auger down to 75 cm at depths corresponding to soil moisture sensors depths 0 5 5 15 15 25 25 35 35 45 45 55 55 65 65 75 cm three soil samples of each depth from near the moisture monitoring station were combined to one composite sample vswc of the composite samples was additionally determined to verify the vswc determined with the soil water monitoring system isotope analysis of the soil water in the composite samples was done based on the h2o liquid vapor water equilibration and laser spectroscopy method by wassenaar et al 2008 both precipitation and pore water were analyzed with a picarro l2130 i or l2140 i isotope analyzer picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa details of soil water sampling and isotope analysis were described by liebhard et al 2022 at the lower mass balance system boundary at a soil depth of 75 cm water and stable isotope fluxes percolation and capillary rise were assumed as zero capillary rise was excluded since the lower boundary was set right above a gravel layer percolation was assumed neglectable below the rooting zone as the local soil indicated that etc is in general higher than precipitation during the growing period eyre 2017 thus and similar to the previous years table 1 et0 exceeded precipitation throughout the whole year and during the investigated growing period which was a prerequisite for the chosen monitoring setup the validity of this zero flux assumption at the lower mass balance system boundary was checked with a hydrus 1d simulation 2 4 2 3 2 determination of evaporation and transpiration four of twelve water and stable isotope mass balance components were not included in the described determination from direct measurement or assumption so far they were considered as follows the isotope ratio of transpired water was equated with the weighted isotope ratio of soil water in the root zone which comprised the soil column from the soil surface down to the root system depth at that time the isotope ratio of evaporated water was derived from the actual atmospheric conditions near the soil surface which affect the intensity of isotope fractionation the fraction of transpired water was calculated as residue of the water balance thus the fraction of evaporated water could be calculated as last unknown parameter by converting the water and isotope mass balance subsequently e and tc act rates could be calculated based on the e etc act and tc act etc act ratios and etc act from mass balance the notations assumptions and calculations of the balance method were described by liebhard et al 2022 the isotope ratios in this study were expressed in Œ¥ notation referenced to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow according to craig 1961 this means that the deviation of the sample from the reference was expressed in per mil as 1 Œ¥ sample r sample r std 1 10 3 with r representing the ratios of rare and abundant isotopes of the sample and the reference respectively thus Œ¥ represents the abundance of heavy stable isotopes as relative difference in the ratio of heavy to light isotopes e g 18o 16o for 18o of a water sample compared to the reference a positive Œ¥ means that the sample contains more heavy isotopes than the standard the extent of isotope fractionation as measure for the evaporation process was illustrated with the line conditioned excess lc excess by landwehr and coplen 2006 the lc excess can be calculated as 2 lc excess Œ¥ 2 h a Œ¥ 18 o b with a as the slope and b as intercept of a local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl Œ¥2h 6 67 Œ¥18o 1 77 for this study was based on the relation between Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of local precipitation data and serves as reference deviation from the lmwl expressed with the lc excess indicates that the water experienced non equilibrium fractionation processes due to evaporation thus water that experienced evaporation has a negative lc excess 2 4 numeric simulation for mass balance check water balance components which were assumed to be almost zero but could not be measured directly percolation and capillary rise were calculated with hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 the model was set up according to measured soil hydraulic properties using the single porosity van genuchten mualem model the feddes root water uptake model observed weather and crop lai root growth data initial vswc and etc from the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 and asce penman monteith reference et walter et al 2000 for short reference et0 etc was partitioned to epot and tpot based on measured soil cover fractions according to beer s law method ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 epot describes the potential and meteorologically induced rate of vaporization and removal of soil water from the soil surface under sufficient water supply with proceeding drying of the soil the evaporation rate becomes limited by water supply and decreasing hydraulic conductivity depending on the soil water retention characteristic thus eact was calculated from epot which was limited with a minimum allowed pressure head based on weather conditions and soil surface layer properties tact was calculated from tpot which was limited by the crop characteristic stress response function by feddes et al 1978 2 5 measurement of evapotranspiration at field scale etc act from the mass balance calculation at the con plots was verified with etc act measurement at a close by field therefore turbulent fluxes for calculation of latent energy fluxes were measured with a surface layer scintillometer sls type sls20 scintec germany including a transmitter and a receiver unit calibration of the sls20 was already factory set 12 2011 and reviewed during maintenance 03 2019 by the manufacturer transmitter operates at wavelength 671 nm 0 5 nm transmitter beam separation x y 2 47 mm 0 02 mm and receiver beam separation x y 2 52 mm 0 01 mm the emitted monochromatic electromagnetic wave with constant intensity propagated through the atmosphere and was scattered and diffracted by turbulence induced eddies according to the characteristics of the eddies and their respective refractive indices the receiver measured fluctuating intensities scintillations based on these scintillations primary variables describing wave propagation were derived directly such as the inner scale length of temperature i0 the structure parameter of the refractive index cn 2 and the friction velocity u this was done by relating first and second order statistics of measured values to path averages of cn 2 and i0 with help of turbulence and electromagnetic wave propagation theory tatarskii 1961 subsequently further quantities such as the structure parameter of temperature ct 2 the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy Œµ the sensible heat flux h and consequently latent heat Œªet could be derived by application of monin obukhov similarity theory as described in thiermann and grassl 1992 van kesteren 2012 and scintec ag 2016 the propagation path length was 162 4 m with a southeast to northwest orientation considering the orientation of the rectangular field and the prevailing wind directions installation height was 2 15 m thus 3 times the height of the roughness elements to avoid a saturation process van kesteren 2012 data collection and initial data processing were performed with an internal signal processing unit spu further procession was performed with software package srun version 1 58 meteorological data required to calculate latent energy fluxes were obtained from the weather station and individual sensors net radiometer cnr1 kipp zonen b v netherlands soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux thermal sensors b v netherlands soil thermocouple probes tcav campbell scientific inc usa and water content reflectometers cs615 campbell scientific inc usa which were installed as described in campbell scientific 1998 data from the individual sensors were stored on a cr1000x data logger campbell scientific inc usa and combined during post processing diagnosis subperiod intervals for internal analysis and error computation were set to 10 s where only not error flagged measurements were buffered and combined averaging periods were set to 15 min background correction and spike removal with running means for values exceeding 6 times standard deviation for weekly averaging periods was done with the software package distinction between stable unstable and convectional atmospheric stratification was based on temperature measurements in two heights Œªet was obtained as residual from soil surface energy balance therefore sensible heat was calculated from structure parameters whereas net radiation and the soil heat flux were derived from additional measurements for calculating soil heat flux soil bulk density was measured as 1380 kg m 3 and heat capacity of 840 j kg 1 k 1 was estimated based on measured properties from comparable chernozem soils kode≈°ov√° et al 2013 3 results 3 1 stable isotope and soil water distribution effects of the tillage treatment variants con red and not on water and isotope distribution are distinguishable in figs 2 and 3 fig 2 shows averaged profiles of stable isotope distribution volumetric soil water content and lc excess of measurements throughout the vegetation season the conventionally managed plots con show the highest variation of all three parameters within the top 30 cm fig 2a c furthermore con plots have more negative lc excess values in deep soil depths compared to red and not fig 2c f i besides the vswc profile distribution in con plots is less uniform than in red and in average smaller in the top 30 cm than in not plots fig 2b e h fig 3 shows selected biweekly vswc distributions affected by the investigated tillage treatments and their associated side effects e g weed infestation crop residues plant cover the variation of vswc in the conventionally managed plots con fig 3a shows the rapid depletion of the root zone during the vegetation period and the near surface recharge after seed maturation around das 104 from the beginning of vswc monitoring at das 55 plant height of 23 cm lai of 0 78 until full plant development beginning seed maturation at das 104 the total soil water content in the top 60 cm decreased from 182 mm to 85 mm while 183 mm evapotranspired and 95 mm infiltrated from precipitation from das 104 to das 118 seed maturation precipitation 112 mm and decreasing plant water demand 52 mm et recharged the near surface water storage the variation of vswc in the plots with reduced tillage red fig 3b have a smaller extent than in the con plots with annual plowing vswc profiles in not plots fig 3c show a high near surface water storage and low depletion below the illuvial horizon at 30 cm soil depth below 60 cm soil depth vswc profiles are similar as in con and lower than in red where compaction at the illuvial horizon was mitigated the progress of volumetric soil water contents in fig 4 reflects the differences of water storage in the soil profile according to the tillage induced soil structures the vswc in the conventionally managed plot con fig 4a with ploughing of the top 25 cm soil layer showed the strongest fluctuations in the near surface layer 0 30 cm compared to conservative practices a fast plant development fig 5a b contributed to depletion of the soil water storage which lasted until the beginning of crop maturity after that soil water recharged due to heavier precipitation in autumn fig 7a the vswc progress in the plot with reduced tillage red fig 4b showed the smallest variations in each measuring depth and across the soil profile in the plot without tillage not fig 4c the vswc progress showed considerable fluctuation in the near surface layer 0 30 cm whereas the fluctuation below 30 cm was smaller than in the other treatments in particular at the beginning of the vegetation season the vswc was higher compared to con and red according to the hydrus 1d simulation percolation below 70 cm during the investigated vegetation period was low in all treatments con 7 mm red 15 mm not 3 mm 3 2 crop growth and yield parameters weekly monitored crop stand parameters showed during major part of the growing season a lower plant height and a lower leaf area index for not compared to con with red showing higher values than not but just slightly lower than con fig 5a b with maximum lai at con and the lowest for not the decay followed the same order with con first red second and not last soil cover fractions show a later coverage by plants in red and not plots compared to con plots fig 6 the different degrees of delayed green canopy cover formation fig 6 as well as plant height and lai progress fig 5 in the red and not tillage plots show a time delayed and reduced canopy development furthermore the temporal evolution of soil cover fractions illustrates the comparable high and long lasting coverage by residues during the early growing stage for not fig 6 the delay in plant development in not was also noticeable considering plant development stages while the first blossoms opened in all systems around das 60 july 6 fruit and seed development starting around das 85 july 31 was already discernably delayed in not the crop yield parameters in table 5 show the impacts of tillage treatment on yields and yield formation not had a higher above ground dry matter agdm comprising crop residues and grains and residues yield than con and a higher grain yield than con and red also the harvest index was highest in not among yield components the plant density plants m 2 pod density pods m 2 and grain density grains m 2 did not differ between tillage treatments but not had a higher tkw thousand kernel weight and more grains pod 1 than con and red 3 3 evaporation and transpiration rates fig 7b shows the difference between the daily etc rates from the con plot as calculated crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions from the dual crop coefficient method calculation and the daily etc act rates from scintillometer measurement at the conventionally managed field the temporal evolution of etc act etc fig 7b reflects limitations of water supply throughout the season with etc representing evapotranspiration under optimal well watered conditions the precipitation events with up to approx 20 mm were obviously not sufficient to enable etc act rates similar to etc for longer lasting periods the larger rain events around das 107 115 and 122 were already in the maturation and drying stage figs 5b 6 with decreasing etc rates a comparison of weekly e and tc act rates based on the water and stable isotope mass balance of all three tillage treatments is shown in fig 8 before considering the e and tc act rates from the water and stable isotope mass balance the etc act from mass balance was checked with etc act from the scintillometer measurement at the conventionally managed field the etc act at con from the water mass balance 286 mm agreed with the measured etc act 289 mm during the evaluation period for e and tc act rates thus the etc act rates from the mass balance calculation were considered as realistic basis for etc act partitioning the mass balances of each tillage practice indicated minor differences of etc act table 6 even though etc act from mass balance is fraught with uncertainty the determined water use in the experimental plots reflected the order of biomass production con 461 g m 2 red 525 g m 2 not 570 g m 2 and grain yields con 238 g m 2 red 268 g m 2 not 321 g m 2 table 5 whereas con and red had similar e and tc act rates not used more water and used it more efficiently for crop production during the vegetation period table 6 and fig 8 etc act tc act and e related parameters in table 6 comprise the etc act partitioning evaluation period from das 55 132 crop water productivity wpc comprises the whole growing period wpc as the ratio between the actual crop yield grain yield and the total water use expressed in kg m 3 according to pereira et al 2009 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotope and soil water distribution the high variation of stable isotope ratios vswc and lc excess within the top 30 cm and in particular the negative lc excess values in deep soil depths of the con plots fig 2c conform with the preexisting soil physical characteristics with higher hydraulic conductivity schwen et al 2011a in general negative lc excess values in deep soil depths indicate fast infiltration and percolation zimmermann et al 1967 the negative values originate from fast drained waters that percolated and mixed down the soil profile soil water below the evaporative zone is no more directly subject to evaporation and thus isotope fractionation processes barnes and allison 1988 gangi et al 2015 rothfuss et al 2015 the higher hydraulic conductivity in con from 30 to 60 cm depth table 3 corresponds to the consistently lower lc excess below 20 cm depth than in red or not above 20 cm soil depth where differences among tillage systems on ks are smaller no differences of the lc excess between con and red can be observed furthermore near surface soil water in the conventionally managed plots was more directly influenced by precipitation evaporative demand and water uptake by roots than in conservatively red and not managed plots the water and stable isotope distributions in plots with reduced tillage red similarly reflect the tillage induced changes of soil hydraulic properties the less negative lc excess values in lower depths compared to con fig 2c f show the smaller impact of isotope fractionation processes due to the lower conductivity and higher soil water retention in the root zone the lower hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil is attributed to the reduced tillage operations furthermore the annual ground preparation down to 20 25 cm and the quadrennial ground preparation down to 35 cm depth in red promoted a uniform vswc distribution without discontinuities fig 2e the consistency down the profile fig 2e fig 3b and higher vswc in lower depths led to less depletion of the near surface even though a slightly delayed plant development fig 5 and similar yield parameters table 5 suggest similar root water uptake as in con this observation also agrees with simulation results by xu and mermoud 2003 they investigated management induced temporal changes of soil hydraulic properties for con not and subsoiling tillage comparable to red and similarly detected a lower evaporation and a higher infiltration to deeper layers at subsoiling tillage red however it has to be considered that the vswc measuring site was located at an area with a greater soil depth since the vswc was consistently high even in depths down below 70 cm also in plots without tillage not the effects of soil consolidation are reflected in the distribution of water and stable isotopes in spite of the preexisting soil compaction due to long term tillage system effects the undisturbed near surface layer showed high volumetric soil water contents fig 2h below 30 cm compaction at the illuvial horizon below the a horizon at 30 cm in combination with a lower biological activity and contribution to the pore system decreased the water downward movement fig 2h i and water storage the comparatively higher connectivity in not was impaired by soil compaction which had the local maximum in about 35 cm soil depth fig 1 at the bottom of the pressure bulb induced by the load of farm machineries such no till pans with local minima of porosity and pore connectivity at conservative practices have been observed in comparable studies schl√ºter et al 2018 therefore the water was kept available in the upper root zone eventually the not treatment with the formation of a no till pan caused a similar vswc distribution as the con treatment with its till pan thus the formation of a compacted layer around 35 cm was most efficiently mitigated by subsoiling within the red treatment fig 1 the subsoiling also led to the lowest soil penetration resistance in 30 40 cm soil depth the soil penetration resistance must be considered together with the actual swc though an increasing vswc causes a decrease of soil penetration resistance this is due to the weakening of the soil structure caused by water absorption and a lower cohesion between soil particles caused by a reduced matric potential marshall et al 1996 in regard of vswc progresses fig 4 the progress in the con plots fig 4a reflects impeded infiltration at soil surface and higher hydraulic conductivity above the illuvial horizon compared to red and not as the water content down to 30 cm soil depth reacts more directly to rain events in particular for shallow soils the increased hydraulic conductivity after plowing implies a higher susceptibility to water loss due to percolation and decreased water storage capability compared to more conservative tillage systems such as red and not however for the local soil depth and water limited conditions the hydrus 1d predicted hardly percolation at soil surface the mechanical disturbance promotes soil aggregate breaking at raindrop impact the broken aggregates lead to soil sealing and crust formation which impedes infiltration thus the vswc in 5 cm depth indicated impeded infiltration in con and red compared to not fig 4 schwen et al 2011a who had made similar observations in their investigations on soil property alteration by these tillage treatments concluded that water efficiency could be improved with more conservative tillage systems such as red and not that increased water storing capability in the root zone the high average and small variations of vswc in the plot with reduced tillage red indicated a high water storage capability down to 70 cm and the non existence of a plow pan or another particular compacted horizon as fine textured soils such as the present silt loam soil are vulnerable to compaction gebhardt et al 2009 the tillage down to 35 cm apparently ameliorated water storage in lower depths on the other hand the mechanical disturbance of soil aggregates at the soil surface impeded infiltration of intense rain events such as on das 88 20 mm on das 107 48 mm and between das 114 and 117 7 29 mm in total 63 mm fig 4 nonetheless the high initial saturation in lower soil depths caused percolation of 15 mm based on the hydrus 1d simulation the vswc progress in not reflected the characteristics of soil without mechanical disturbance at the beginning of the vegetation season the filled soil water storage in the near surface layer 0 30 cm had been protected from disturbance the high average vswc in the near surface layer in not remained the highest compared to con and red throughout the season additionally the delayed plant development within the vegetation period and the actual distribution of precipitation caused advantageous conditions during the crop specific water sensitive periods during blossom and grain filling nonetheless the fluctuation in the near surface layer was high as rainwater rapidly infiltrated through the well connected macropore network especially the vswc in the top 5 cm layer reacted sensitively to rain events and evaporative demand during periods of lower plant cover interception figs 6c and 4c obviously the mulch protected the soil from sealing the low fluctuation below 30 cm was attributed to soil compaction at the illuvial horizon 4 2 crop growth and yield parameters the slight delay of germination and growth in not compared to con and red fig 5a b is consistent with the long term tillage induced growing conditions this includes the preexisting higher soil compaction near surface after 24 years of no tillage practice schwen et al 2011a and the wetter soil surface fig 4 caused by plant residues mulch protection of approx 30 40 fig 6 which delays plant emergence due a delayed warming effect the consideration of crop yield parameters table 5 showed that yields in con were lower than in not even though the conventional tillage facilitated crop growth in the early growing season the high yield parameters measured at the not plots may be explained in three ways first nutrient availability was best in not and worst in con table 4 second the late precipitation events could have had a more beneficial effect for the time delayed plant development in not as soybean development depends on sufficient water supply during blossom and grain filling the rain events on das 107 and das 114 could still have covered this sensible seed maturity phase in not as the precipitation events could have been already too late for the seed maturation phase for con and red this may have caused less favorable dry matter partitioning and thus lower grain yield parameters third the higher crop yield parameters in not compared to con and red may be attributed to the larger mean macropore size with higher connectivity in not the macropore network has substantial effect on plant development as roots use existing macropores as pathways of least resistance to reach deeper soil layers athmann et al 2013 stirzaker et al 1996 consequently the deeper root system depths in not and red compared to con allowed access of a deeper soil layer and higher yield production this would agree with the majority of studies on the effects of no tillage practices on soil hydraulic properties which observed well developed macropore systems and positive effects for the soil structure freese et al 1993 strudley et al 2008 dissenting studies e g josa and hereter 2005 and global meta analyses focused directly on the effect of no tillage agriculture on the yield pittelkow et al 2015b su et al 2021 reported in general decreased crop yields in not agriculture due to natural compaction which reduced the volume of macropores containing plant available water though however the authors of these meta analyses pointed out that not achieved equal or even substantially higher yields than con practices under rainfed conditions in dry climates long term winter wheat grain yields in this experiment were generally at similar levels in all tillage systems in most years but grain yields of con and red tended to be higher than those of not when higher rainfall occurred during the growing season neugschwandtner et al 2015 furthermore a comparison with other studies must be treated with caution as tillage causes a site specific hydraulic response depending on the local climate and soil characteristics strudley et al 2008 additionally soybean is adaptable to various growing conditions by modulation of yield components neugschwandtner et al 2019 this causes for example an increase of seeding density results in higher plant density but less pods per plant while the number of grains per pod and tkw keep stable 4 3 evaporation and transpiration rates the progress of weekly e and tc act rates in the con plots fig 8 goes along with the faster plant development figs 5 and 6 compared to the treatments in red and not plots tc act etc act rapidly increased with canopy development the fast progress of e and tc act rates fig 8 and plant development figs 5 and 6 in the con plots agrees with the fast depletion of the soil water storage within the root zone furthermore it is consistent with observations reported by strudley et al 2008 who described faster depletion of the soil water storage and in particular an increase of evaporation after spring tillage which may persist for several weeks after maturation and senescence of canopy tc act etc act again reacted fast and decreased close to zero before harvest tc act etc act ratios at the red plots were similar to the con plots with slightly lower tc act etc act ratios during full canopy development further the delay of plant development compared to con is hardly noticeable tc act etc act in the not plots mirrored the time delayed plant development the lower transpiration rates until full canopy and the following higher rates until harvest compared to the other tillage systems reflected the delayed plant growth development and senescence the relatively higher e rates during the vegetative growth to full canopy until period 5 could be attributed to the management induced uneven field emergence which showed its greatest effect on e and tc act before full canopy besides that the low e rates at the very first periods may be attributed to the protective mulch layer which covered about a third of the ground during the first periods fig 6 thus e rate determination showed the beneficial effect of plant residue cover regarding radiation heat exchange water movement and turbulences at the surface the evaluation crop yield vswc distribution isotope profiles and transpiration and evaporation fractions of the tillage variants in the vegetation period 2020 supports the observations reported in literature that conservative tillage systems use the available water in dry climates and rainfed conditions more efficiently pittelkow et al 2015a thaler et al 2012 the actual effect of long lasting tillage on the water balance was more pronounced in the crop yield and the water distribution than in the evaporation and transpiration ratios however the stable isotope etc act partitioning showed the strong impact of the tillage variants on the temporal progress of evaporation and transpiration during the initial periods for instance the mulch on the undisturbed surface reduced unproductive water loss from not at the end of the vegetation period the delayed plant development and senescence led to longer productive water use particularly of the larger rain events at the end of the vegetation period fig 7 table 5 therefore the isotope based measurements revealed that the tillage induced differences of soil hydraulic properties and water availability affected e etc act and tc act etc act mainly through soil cover and plant development in contrast the isotope partitioning showed that the difference of surface wetness due to different tillage had only subsidiary influence on the evaporation transpiration ratio after formation of the canopy beside the current water use the stable isotope distributions and in particular the lc excess showed the changes of infiltration properties due to long term effects of tillage management 5 conclusions tillage affects the soil structure and thus the soil water regime plant development and the efficiency of water use results from a field campaign with soybean at a long term tillage experiment including partitioning of evapotranspiration with stable isotope technique show the best crop water productivity for low tillage intensity systems for the given silt loam soil and water limited conditions no tillage direct seeding and reduced tillage cultivator use and quadrennial subsoiling have higher crop yield than conventional tillage including plowing crop water productivity is best for no tillage and worst for conventional tillage furthermore conventional and reduced tillage lose more water unproductively by evaporation compared to no tillage the temporal evolution of transpiration rates shows the tillage induced differences of canopy development with time delayed development under no tillage this means for the investigated campaign with late precipitation events an improved water availability in the no tillage plots during the water sensitive periods the temporal evolution of evaporation rates shows their dependence on the canopy and soil cover hence conventional and reduced tillage plots have large unproductive losses during the early growing stages with sparse canopy and no mulch protection compared to the no tillage plots as the results of this study base on a one year experiment findings may vary under different climate and weather conditions soil properties and management practices however knowledge of evaporation and transpiration rates shows the importance of soil cover and water availability during water sensitive growth stages and contributes to the understanding of differences in water productivity thus determination of evaporation and transpiration rates helps to minimize unproductive water losses and to optimize tillage mulching and irrigation strategies

9485,tillage practices are known to affect soil water retention plant available water and consequently crop production impacts can be determined by assessing soil hydraulic properties and crop characteristics in this study three tillage practices were investigated with respect to vertical soil water distribution and development of soybean a specific focus was set on determining evaporation and transpiration as fractions of evapotranspiration to obtain additional information on water availability and crop water use the agricultural practices included conventional tillage reduced tillage no plow and no tillage the study site was a long term field experiment under rainfed conditions the investigations covered a vegetation period of soybean the measurements comprised weather and soil water monitoring using sensors and manual monitoring of crop development evapotranspiration and its components were determined using scintillometer measurements and an isotope based water balance technique in the researched vegetation period with limited water availability the conservative tillage practices showed better water storage water use and crop yields compared to the conventional practice the weekly evaporation and transpiration rates progressed according to the respective canopy development thus delayed plant development of the no till practice led to extended green cover and productive water use during the late season where a large part of the precipitation has fallen the tillage induced differences of soil hydraulic properties had a substantial impact on soil water distribution but a comparatively small impact on the soil surface wetness and thus directly on the evaporation rate the tillage induced impacts on soil cover by plant residues however showed the substantial reduction effect of plant residue cover on evaporation losses hence assessment of evaporation and transpiration rates contributes to the understanding of differences in water productivity and promotes the efficient use of the available water resources keywords water use evapotranspiration tillage soil water management isotope fractionation scintillometry 1 introduction increasing pressure on water resources is a fundamental and inherent problem in many parts of the world anthropogenic actions further intensify this pressure through increased water needs of a growing population degradation of land and water resources and cascading effects of warmer temperatures and erratic weather patterns schewe et al 2014 therefore farmers and scientists work on strategies to approach this growing problem by developing and applying sustainable management practices for an efficient use of the available water in this context it is crucial to comprehend water consumption processes in crop production and to quantify water fluxes on the one hand required knowledge comprises soil physical micrometeorological and agricultural aspects to reduce losses due to leaching runoff and evaporation and to ensure water availability scardigno 2020 on the other hand it comprises the agronomic and genomic aspect to obtain high transpiration efficiency by targeting the plant intrinsic trade off between carbon fixation and water loss in the course of co2 acquisition ducat and silver 2012 improvements of these aspects can be targeted through adjusted management practices which include selection of crop and variety or actions such as irrigation fertilization and tillage fan et al 2017 tillage as mechanical treatment of soil is used for seed bed preparation soil loosening weed control and integration of fertilizer and residues into the soil phillips et al 1980 together with natural compaction and associated management practices such as irrigation or residue management it alters the soil s pore characteristic and in particular the macro and mesopores buczko et al 2006 strudley et al 2008 as a consequence soil hydraulic properties and water storage capability are affected moret and arr√∫e 2007 the actual impact of a particular management action depends on the soil texture and especially on the macropore network of the local soil buczko et al 2006 consequently reviews on the effects of tillage treatments show diverse effects according to the local conditions in particular regarding total porosity and soil bulk density strudley et al 2008 unger and cassel 1991 in spite of the complexity of relationships some tillage specific trends are noticeable in particular when comparing intensive conventional and no tillage practices no tillage and conservative tillage practices with minimized mechanical disturbance of soil structure increase macropore connectivity causing increased infiltration capability and hydraulic conductivities in the low suction range ehlers 1975 dunn and phillips 1991 reynolds et al 1995 in relation to minimum soil disturbance biological activity causes well connected and elongated meso and macropore systems with large spatial heterogeneity and high soil hydraulic conductivity in the active soil layer lipiec and hatano 2003 usowicz and lipiec 2021 zhang et al 2020 moreover conservative tillage practices lead to a better near surface 0 30 cm water storage which could increase water use efficiency especially under dryer climatic conditions schwen et al 2011a thaler et al 2012 pittelkow et al 2015a as tillage induced differences are supposed to further increase under dryer climatic conditions angulo jaramillo et al 1997 xu and mermoud 2003 conservative tillage practices are expected to become more important in future the effect of tillage on crop development is similarly diverse as on soil physical properties crop development depends on the texture structure type and depth of the local soil as well as on further factors such as weather conditions and plant specific characteristics crawford et al 2018 phogat et al 2020 thus the effects of specific tillage techniques on crop development and yield are variable as they are associated with the local conditions blanco canqui and wortmann 2020 busari et al 2015 these conditions include local characteristics such as the soils response to mechanical disturbance and compaction as well as actual freeze thaw and wet dry cycles or biological activity blanco canqui and wortmann 2020 boone and veen 1994 some of the influencing factors are directly related to the tillage induced changes of soil physical properties for example conservation and provision of plant available water or soil porosity and bulk density the complex impacts of tillage on soil physical properties and crop development further affect soil water distribution and root growth boone and veen 1994 and thus plant water uptake consequently different tillage systems are expected to have an impact on actual crop evapotranspiration etc act that is et under less than ideal crop conditions e g non optimal water supply or management practices and in particular the rates of evaporation and transpiration knowing these sub processes is of particular importance with respect to evaluating and improving water use efficiency in water limited regions zheng et al 2021 in this regard the transpiring fraction t of evapotranspiration et is productively used for biomass production while the fraction of evaporation e does not directly contribute to plant growth whereas both processes occur inseparably and interactively quantification may nonetheless contribute to evaluation and improvement of management practices considering a multitude of etc act partitioning studies on various scales and research fields partitioning techniques have hardly been used to analyze management actions kool et al 2014 except for mulch techniques ding et al 2013 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 this study aims at contributing to a better understanding of how tillage systems affect soil water plant relationships at an agricultural field in particular three selected tillage techniques conventional tillage reduced tillage and no tillage were considered applied on long term tillage experiment plots cultivated with soybean the study includes effects of the three tillage practices on i profile soil water distribution storage versus percolation ii plant development yields and water requirement iii evaporation and transpiration ratios a certain focus was set on the latter by partitioning etc act using a stable isotope based method 2 material and methods 2 1 location and field trial the study was conducted in 2020 at a long term field trial and a conventionally managed field near raasdorf 48 14 n 16 35 e 156 m elevation a s l east of vienna austria the region is characterized by a flat topography and has an annual precipitation of 523 mm and an average temperature of 10 8 c 2000 2019 table 1 shows the characteristic of the climate in the marchfeld region based on annual et0 and precipitation data the monthly precipitation data in table 2 illustrate the variability of the local weather conditions et0 was determined according to allen et al 2005 with the standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for daily timesteps and short crop with an approximate height of 0 12 m similar to clipped cool season grass with the reference type constants cn 900 k mm s3 mg 1 d 1 and cd 0 34 s m 1 and the surface resistance rs of 70 s m 1 for short reference yield in this agricultural region is generally restricted by water shortage and heat stress bodner et al 2015 the climatic conditions can be described as dry subhumid with periodically occurring hot summers with high evaporative demand during the growing period of the main crop evapotranspiration generally exceeds the amount of summer precipitation and winters with frequent frosts and low evaporative demand thus winter rainfall table 2 is generally sufficient to refill the soil water storage which depletes during the summer months the soil type in the experimental field and the conventionally managed field was classified as chernozem wrb 2014 with silt loam texture according to fao classification chesworth et al 2008 pedogenesis of the chernozem indicates that etc in this area consistently exceeds precipitation during the growing period bock 2014 eyre 2017 the soil can be divided into an a horizon 0 30 cm over an ac horizon 30 60 cm over a c horizon 60 cm with matured calcareous sediments and coarse texture below 80 cm the topsoil at all treatments has a phcacl2 of 7 58 a more detailed description of the soil including soil properties and hydraulic parameters for each horizon is given in table 3 nutrient data are given in table 4 soil properties and hydraulic parameters were derived from each three measurement replicates in soil depths of 5 40 and 70 cm including tension infiltrometer measurements core sample analyses and particle size analyses infiltration measurements were done according to ankeny et al 1988 and analyzed as described by warrick 1992 chemical soil properties and nutrient data were derived from composite soil samples from 20 subsamples in 10 cm depth steps the airdried homogenized and 2 mm sieved composite soil samples were analyzed according to austrian standards caco3 √∂norm 1999b soc √∂norm 1999a nt √∂norm 2002 p √∂norm 1993 and for pmn according to kandeler 1993 respectively the long term field trial has been operated since 1997 with a focus on assessing management induced changes in soil hydraulic properties and its effect on plant development the implemented soil tillage techniques included conventional tillage con reduced tillage red and no tillage not practices the tillage variants were organized in rectangular plots with areas of 960 m2 or 1440 m2 and in three replicates conventional tillage con comprised annual moldboard plowing of the top 25 cm soil layer after harvest and seedbed preparation using a harrow in 10 cm depth for reduced tillage red a wing share cultivator has been used to a soil depth of 20 25 cm and every four years a subsoiler to a depth of 35 cm thereby the soil was not inverted and parts of plant residues remained on the soil surface seedbed preparation and sowing was done as in the con treatment no tillage not was based on a direct seeding method where the soil is just opened during sowing in coulter width the impacts of the applied soil tillage techniques on the soil penetration resistances are shown in fig 1 soil penetration resistances were measured with a cone penetrometer eijkelkamp giesbeek the netherlands to a depth of approx 40 cm cone with a 60 top angle and a base area of 1 cm2 and were provided by the experimental station gro√ü enzersdorf beside bulk density soil penetration resistance throughout the soil profile further depends on swc soc and texture marshall et al 1996 a herbicide was applied before sowing for weed control therefore weeds could be repressed effectively except for locally restricted areas of weed infestation in not these areas with weed infestation were not considered in the evaluations not can be attributed to conservation tillage practices since the soil surface was covered at least 30 with crop residues mulch after planting bergtold et al 2020 crop rotations in all treatments were based on main crops only hence the experiments were unaffected by cover crops the preceding crop winter wheat was the same for each tillage system crop residues were left on the field and incorporated according to the applied tillage technique generally tillage induced differences between the long term experimental plots have been repeatedly investigated for instance by bodner et al 2013 neugschwandtner et al 2020 2014 and schwen et al 2011b main findings were that descending intensity of tillage caused increased bulk density and penetration resistance while total porosity and hydraulic conductivity decreased the avoidance of tillage resulted in larger mean macropore size with higher connectivity and smaller tortuosity but a lower number of water conducting pores compared to tillage with artificial soil disturbance thus the smaller mean macropore size in red and con plots compared to consolidated soils not were compensated by their abundance schwen et al 2011b the preexisting soil physical characteristics due to long term tillage variants represented the initial conditions for the presented study a field near the long term field trial was chosen for additional etc act measurements the additional etc act measurement based on scintillometer data was done to check etc act based on a water balance in the con plots the field was managed like the con plots and therefore showed similar plant development with respect to leaf area index and plant height for instance the field size of approx 11 5 ha was assumed to better represent realistic conditions in terms of etc act with less boundary effects compared to the small structured replicate plots hence etc act measured at the field was used to verify that etc act at the con plots is similar to an open field in 2020 soybean glycine max l merr was sown with 50 seeds per m2 on may 7 and harvested on september 22 days after sowing das 138 at harvest date senescence was completed and above ground parts were dry in all plots yields and yield components were obtained by manually harvesting the plants on 2 m2 per plot leaf litter shed before the harvest was not considered the weather conditions with 225 mm precipitation during the vegetation period did not necessarily require irrigation the three tillage treatment systems were compared by considering vertical patterns of soil water and isotope distribution plant growth and crop yield parameters and evaporation and transpiration rates 2 2 monitoring soil water plant development and meteorological parameters at plot scale for each soil tillage technique one soil water monitoring set of probes was installed in the center of its main plot with 1440 m2 immediately after sowing volumetric soil water content vswc in cm3 cm 3 was monitored at each station within the top 5 cm with hydra probe soil moisture sensors stevens water monitoring systems inc usa and below in 10 cm increments to a probe depth of at least 70 cm with enviroscan soil moisture probes sentek pty ltd australia conversion of sensor readings to vswc values was done by applying the appropriate standard calibration for silt loam for the hydra probe sensors according to stevens 2015 and for the enviroscan sensors according to sentek pty ltd 2009 the soil texture specific calibration equations were chosen to avoid additional soil disturbance and change of growing conditions that are known to occur because of field calibration the sensors are assumed to provide satisfactory results as shown by kibirige and dobos 2021 for comparable conditions additionally vswcs from sensor readings agreed well with swcs derived from isotope soil samples plant development was determined on a weekly basis the observations comprised plant height and root system depth with measuring tapes leaf area index lai with an accupar par lai ceptometer model lp 80 meter group inc usa and soil cover fractions with an image analysis tool by bauer and strauss 2014 root system depth was measured as maximum root depth of the tap root in weekly excavated trenches a standard weather station with two temperature and relative humidity probes hmp35c campbell scientific inc usa was installed above the moisture monitoring station in the con plot additionally a rain gauge and a rainwater collector for isotope sampling palmex rain sampler rx1 were installed 2 3 determination of evaporation and transpiration rates at plot scale calculation of evaporation e and transpiration t rates was done based on a mass balance of soil water and its stable isotopes by wenninger et al 2010 and sutanto et al 2012 with modifications according to liebhard et al 2022 this mass balance bases on the conservation of soil water mass and its stable isotopes ratio in a considered soil column therefore soil water content and its stable isotope ratio were determined in a soil column as well as in the in precipitation capillary rise and outgoing evaporation transpiration percolation water and isotope fluxes similar to all other stable isotope based tracing and partitioning methods the relative mass difference between isotopes are utilized naturally occurring water molecules with stable hydrogen or oxygen isotopes e g 2h1h16o or 1h2 18o are heavier than the most abundant water molecules 1h2 16o which imparts measurable fractionations during physical and chemical reactions during evaporation the mass difference and thus the difference of vapor pressures of stable water isotopes causes the lighter isotopes to evaporate first which leads to enrichment of heavy water isotopes in the residual soil water the abundance of heavy stable isotopes in the residual soil water and knowledge about boundary conditions e g temperature and relative humidity during isotope fractionation allows estimation of evaporation in combination with the assumption that transpiration does not cause isotope fractionation during root water uptake and enrichment of isotopes in soil water williams et al 2004 e etc act and tc act etc act ratios and e and tc act rates can be calculated as residue of the mass balance with etc act from soil water mass balance in this study the mass balance was calculated for a soil column of 75 cm depth data were analyzed for weekly periods as described in the following paragraphs 2 3 1 determination of water balance components at the upper system boundary precipitation was measured with the rain gauges and collected for isotope analysis with the isotope rain collector etc act was calculated on a weekly basis as residue from a simplified soil water mass balance down to a soil depth of 75 cm using precipitation data and the change of volumetric soil water content vswc runoff was considered negligible due to the very flat topography furthermore capillary rise and deep percolation were precluded for the local conditions at the lower boundary in 75 cm depth which was checked with a hydrus 1d calculation vswc and its isotope ratio was determined at the beginning and end of each evaluation period for isotope analysis of pore water soil cores were collected with an auger down to 75 cm at depths corresponding to soil moisture sensors depths 0 5 5 15 15 25 25 35 35 45 45 55 55 65 65 75 cm three soil samples of each depth from near the moisture monitoring station were combined to one composite sample vswc of the composite samples was additionally determined to verify the vswc determined with the soil water monitoring system isotope analysis of the soil water in the composite samples was done based on the h2o liquid vapor water equilibration and laser spectroscopy method by wassenaar et al 2008 both precipitation and pore water were analyzed with a picarro l2130 i or l2140 i isotope analyzer picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa details of soil water sampling and isotope analysis were described by liebhard et al 2022 at the lower mass balance system boundary at a soil depth of 75 cm water and stable isotope fluxes percolation and capillary rise were assumed as zero capillary rise was excluded since the lower boundary was set right above a gravel layer percolation was assumed neglectable below the rooting zone as the local soil indicated that etc is in general higher than precipitation during the growing period eyre 2017 thus and similar to the previous years table 1 et0 exceeded precipitation throughout the whole year and during the investigated growing period which was a prerequisite for the chosen monitoring setup the validity of this zero flux assumption at the lower mass balance system boundary was checked with a hydrus 1d simulation 2 4 2 3 2 determination of evaporation and transpiration four of twelve water and stable isotope mass balance components were not included in the described determination from direct measurement or assumption so far they were considered as follows the isotope ratio of transpired water was equated with the weighted isotope ratio of soil water in the root zone which comprised the soil column from the soil surface down to the root system depth at that time the isotope ratio of evaporated water was derived from the actual atmospheric conditions near the soil surface which affect the intensity of isotope fractionation the fraction of transpired water was calculated as residue of the water balance thus the fraction of evaporated water could be calculated as last unknown parameter by converting the water and isotope mass balance subsequently e and tc act rates could be calculated based on the e etc act and tc act etc act ratios and etc act from mass balance the notations assumptions and calculations of the balance method were described by liebhard et al 2022 the isotope ratios in this study were expressed in Œ¥ notation referenced to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow according to craig 1961 this means that the deviation of the sample from the reference was expressed in per mil as 1 Œ¥ sample r sample r std 1 10 3 with r representing the ratios of rare and abundant isotopes of the sample and the reference respectively thus Œ¥ represents the abundance of heavy stable isotopes as relative difference in the ratio of heavy to light isotopes e g 18o 16o for 18o of a water sample compared to the reference a positive Œ¥ means that the sample contains more heavy isotopes than the standard the extent of isotope fractionation as measure for the evaporation process was illustrated with the line conditioned excess lc excess by landwehr and coplen 2006 the lc excess can be calculated as 2 lc excess Œ¥ 2 h a Œ¥ 18 o b with a as the slope and b as intercept of a local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl Œ¥2h 6 67 Œ¥18o 1 77 for this study was based on the relation between Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of local precipitation data and serves as reference deviation from the lmwl expressed with the lc excess indicates that the water experienced non equilibrium fractionation processes due to evaporation thus water that experienced evaporation has a negative lc excess 2 4 numeric simulation for mass balance check water balance components which were assumed to be almost zero but could not be measured directly percolation and capillary rise were calculated with hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 the model was set up according to measured soil hydraulic properties using the single porosity van genuchten mualem model the feddes root water uptake model observed weather and crop lai root growth data initial vswc and etc from the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 and asce penman monteith reference et walter et al 2000 for short reference et0 etc was partitioned to epot and tpot based on measured soil cover fractions according to beer s law method ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2012 epot describes the potential and meteorologically induced rate of vaporization and removal of soil water from the soil surface under sufficient water supply with proceeding drying of the soil the evaporation rate becomes limited by water supply and decreasing hydraulic conductivity depending on the soil water retention characteristic thus eact was calculated from epot which was limited with a minimum allowed pressure head based on weather conditions and soil surface layer properties tact was calculated from tpot which was limited by the crop characteristic stress response function by feddes et al 1978 2 5 measurement of evapotranspiration at field scale etc act from the mass balance calculation at the con plots was verified with etc act measurement at a close by field therefore turbulent fluxes for calculation of latent energy fluxes were measured with a surface layer scintillometer sls type sls20 scintec germany including a transmitter and a receiver unit calibration of the sls20 was already factory set 12 2011 and reviewed during maintenance 03 2019 by the manufacturer transmitter operates at wavelength 671 nm 0 5 nm transmitter beam separation x y 2 47 mm 0 02 mm and receiver beam separation x y 2 52 mm 0 01 mm the emitted monochromatic electromagnetic wave with constant intensity propagated through the atmosphere and was scattered and diffracted by turbulence induced eddies according to the characteristics of the eddies and their respective refractive indices the receiver measured fluctuating intensities scintillations based on these scintillations primary variables describing wave propagation were derived directly such as the inner scale length of temperature i0 the structure parameter of the refractive index cn 2 and the friction velocity u this was done by relating first and second order statistics of measured values to path averages of cn 2 and i0 with help of turbulence and electromagnetic wave propagation theory

distribution effects of the tillage treatment variants con red and not on water and isotope distribution are distinguishable in figs 2 and 3 fig 2 shows averaged profiles of stable isotope distribution volumetric soil water content and lc excess of measurements throughout the vegetation season the conventionally managed plots con show the highest variation of all three parameters within the top 30 cm fig 2a c furthermore con plots have more negative lc excess values in deep soil depths compared to red and not fig 2c f i besides the vswc profile distribution in con plots is less uniform than in red and in average smaller in the top 30 cm than in not plots fig 2b e h fig 3 shows selected biweekly vswc distributions affected by the investigated tillage treatments and their associated side effects e g weed infestation crop residues plant cover the variation of vswc in the conventionally managed plots con fig 3a shows the rapid depletion of the root zone during the vegetation period and the near surface recharge after seed maturation around das 104 from the beginning of vswc monitoring at das 55 plant height of 23 cm lai of 0 78 until full plant development beginning seed maturation at das 104 the total soil water content in the top 60 cm decreased from 182 mm to 85 mm while 183 mm evapotranspired and 95 mm infiltrated from precipitation from das 104 to das 118 seed maturation precipitation 112 mm and decreasing plant water demand 52 mm et recharged the near surface water storage the variation of vswc in the plots with reduced tillage red fig 3b have a smaller extent than in the con plots with annual plowing vswc profiles in not plots fig 3c show a high near surface water storage and low depletion below the illuvial horizon at 30 cm soil depth below 60 cm soil depth vswc profiles are similar as in con and lower than in red where compaction at the illuvial horizon was mitigated the progress of volumetric soil water contents in fig 4 reflects the differences of water storage in the soil profile according to the tillage induced soil structures the vswc in the conventionally managed plot con fig 4a with ploughing of the top 25 cm soil layer showed the strongest fluctuations in the near surface layer 0 30 cm compared to conservative practices a fast plant development fig 5a b contributed to depletion of the soil water storage which lasted until the beginning of crop maturity after that soil water recharged due to heavier precipitation in autumn fig 7a the vswc progress in the plot with reduced tillage red fig 4b showed the smallest variations in each measuring depth and across the soil profile in the plot without tillage not fig 4c the vswc progress showed considerable fluctuation in the near surface layer 0 30 cm whereas the fluctuation below 30 cm was smaller than in the other treatments in particular at the beginning of the vegetation season the vswc was higher compared to con and red according to the hydrus 1d simulation percolation below 70 cm during the investigated vegetation period was low in all treatments con 7 mm red 15 mm not 3 mm 3 2 crop growth and yield parameters weekly monitored crop stand parameters showed during major part of the growing season a lower plant height and a lower leaf area index for not compared to con with red showing higher values than not but just slightly lower than con fig 5a b with maximum lai at con and the lowest for not the decay followed the same order with con first red second and not last soil cover fractions show a later coverage by plants in red and not plots compared to con plots fig 6 the different degrees of delayed green canopy cover formation fig 6 as well as plant height and lai progress fig 5 in the red and not tillage plots show a time delayed and reduced canopy development furthermore the temporal evolution of soil cover fractions illustrates the comparable high and long lasting coverage by residues during the early growing stage for not fig 6 the delay in plant development in not was also noticeable considering plant development stages while the first blossoms opened in all systems around das 60 july 6 fruit and seed development starting around das 85 july 31 was already discernably delayed in not the crop yield parameters in table 5 show the impacts of tillage treatment on yields and yield formation not had a higher above ground dry matter agdm comprising crop residues and grains and residues yield than con and a higher grain yield than con and red also the harvest index was highest in not among yield components the plant density plants m 2 pod density pods m 2 and grain density grains m 2 did not differ between tillage treatments but not had a higher tkw thousand kernel weight and more grains pod 1 than con and red 3 3 evaporation and transpiration rates fig 7b shows the difference between the daily etc rates from the con plot as calculated crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions from the dual crop coefficient method calculation and the daily etc act rates from scintillometer measurement at the conventionally managed field the temporal evolution of etc act etc fig 7b reflects limitations of water supply throughout the season with etc representing evapotranspiration under optimal well watered conditions the precipitation events with up to approx 20 mm were obviously not sufficient to enable etc act rates similar to etc for longer lasting periods the larger rain events around das 107 115 and 122 were already in the maturation and drying stage figs 5b 6 with decreasing etc rates a comparison of weekly e and tc act rates based on the water and stable isotope mass balance of all three tillage treatments is shown in fig 8 before considering the e and tc act rates from the water and stable isotope mass balance the etc act from mass balance was checked with etc act from the scintillometer measurement at the conventionally managed field the etc act at con from the water mass balance 286 mm agreed with the measured etc act 289 mm during the evaluation period for e and tc act rates thus the etc act rates from the mass balance calculation were considered as realistic basis for etc act partitioning the mass balances of each tillage practice indicated minor differences of etc act table 6 even though etc act from mass balance is fraught with uncertainty the determined water use in the experimental plots reflected the order of biomass production con 461 g m 2 red 525 g m 2 not 570 g m 2 and grain yields con 238 g m 2 red 268 g m 2 not 321 g m 2 table 5 whereas con and red had similar e and tc act rates not used more water and used it more efficiently for crop production during the vegetation period table 6 and fig 8 etc act tc act and e related parameters in table 6 comprise the etc act partitioning evaluation period from das 55 132 crop water productivity wpc comprises the whole growing period wpc as the ratio between the actual crop yield grain yield and the total water use expressed in kg m 3 according to pereira et al 2009 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotope and soil water distribution the high variation of stable isotope ratios vswc and lc excess within the top 30 cm and in particular the negative lc excess values in deep soil depths of the con plots fig 2c conform with the preexisting soil physical characteristics with higher hydraulic conductivity schwen et al 2011a in general negative lc excess values in deep soil depths indicate fast infiltration and percolation zimmermann et al 1967 the negative values originate from fast drained waters that percolated and mixed down the soil profile soil water below the evaporative zone is no more directly subject to evaporation and thus isotope fractionation processes barnes and allison 1988 gangi et al 2015 rothfuss et al 2015 the higher hydraulic conductivity in con from 30 to 60 cm depth table 3 corresponds to the consistently lower lc excess below 20 cm depth than in red or not above 20 cm soil depth where differences among tillage systems on ks are smaller no differences of the lc excess between con and red can be observed furthermore near surface soil water in the conventionally managed plots was more directly influenced by precipitation evaporative demand and water uptake by roots than in conservatively red and not managed plots the water and stable isotope distributions in plots with reduced tillage red similarly reflect the tillage induced changes of soil hydraulic properties the less negative lc excess values in lower depths compared to con fig 2c f show the smaller impact of isotope fractionation processes due to the lower conductivity and higher soil water retention in the root zone the lower hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil is attributed to the reduced tillage operations furthermore the annual ground preparation down to 20 25 cm and the quadrennial ground preparation down to 35 cm depth in red promoted a uniform vswc distribution without discontinuities fig 2e the consistency down the profile fig 2e fig 3b and higher vswc in lower depths led to less depletion of the near surface even though a slightly delayed plant development fig 5 and similar yield parameters table 5 suggest similar root water uptake as in con this observation also agrees with simulation results by xu and mermoud 2003 they investigated management induced temporal changes of soil hydraulic properties for con not and subsoiling tillage comparable to red and similarly detected a lower evaporation and a higher infiltration to deeper layers at subsoiling tillage red however it has to be considered that the vswc measuring site was located at an area with a greater soil depth since the vswc was consistently high even in depths down below 70 cm also in plots without tillage not the effects of soil consolidation are reflected in the distribution of water and stable isotopes in spite of the preexisting soil compaction due to long term tillage system effects the undisturbed near surface layer showed high volumetric soil water contents fig 2h below 30 cm compaction at the illuvial horizon below the a horizon at 30 cm in combination with a lower biological activity and contribution to the pore system decreased the water downward movement fig 2h i and water storage the comparatively higher connectivity in not was impaired by soil compaction which had the local maximum in about 35 cm soil depth fig 1 at the bottom of the pressure bulb induced by the load of farm machineries such no till pans with local minima of porosity and pore connectivity at conservative practices have been observed in comparable studies schl√ºter et al 2018 therefore the water was kept available in the upper root zone eventually the not treatment with the formation of a no till pan caused a similar vswc distribution as the con treatment with its till pan thus the formation of a compacted layer around 35 cm was most efficiently mitigated by subsoiling within the red treatment fig 1 the subsoiling also led to the lowest soil penetration resistance in 30 40 cm soil depth the soil penetration resistance must be considered together with the actual swc though an increasing vswc causes a decrease of soil penetration resistance this is due to the weakening of the soil structure caused by water absorption and a lower cohesion between soil particles caused by a reduced matric potential marshall et al 1996 in regard of vswc progresses fig 4 the progress in the con plots fig 4a reflects impeded infiltration at soil surface and higher hydraulic conductivity above the illuvial horizon compared to red and not as the water content down to 30 cm soil depth reacts more directly to rain events in particular for shallow soils the increased hydraulic conductivity after plowing implies a higher susceptibility to water loss due to percolation and decreased water storage capability compared to more conservative tillage systems such as red and not however for the local soil depth and water limited conditions the hydrus 1d predicted hardly percolation at soil surface the mechanical disturbance promotes soil aggregate breaking at raindrop impact the broken aggregates lead to soil sealing and crust formation which impedes infiltration thus the vswc in 5 cm depth indicated impeded infiltration in con and red compared to not fig 4 schwen et al 2011a who had made similar observations in their investigations on soil property alteration by these tillage treatments concluded that water efficiency could be improved with more conservative tillage systems such as red and not that increased water storing capability in the root zone the high average and small variations of vswc in the plot with reduced tillage red indicated a high water storage capability down to 70 cm and the non existence of a plow pan or another particular compacted horizon as fine textured soils such as the present silt loam soil are vulnerable to compaction gebhardt et al 2009 the tillage down to 35 cm apparently ameliorated water storage in lower depths on the other hand the mechanical disturbance of soil aggregates at the soil surface impeded infiltration of intense rain events such as on das 88 20 mm on das 107 48 mm and between das 114 and 117 7 29 mm in total 63 mm fig 4 nonetheless the high initial saturation in lower soil depths caused percolation of 15 mm based on the hydrus 1d simulation the vswc progress in not reflected the characteristics of soil without mechanical disturbance at the beginning of the vegetation season the filled soil water storage in the near surface layer 0 30 cm had been protected from disturbance the high average vswc in the near surface layer in not remained the highest compared to con and red throughout the season additionally the delayed plant development within the vegetation period and the actual distribution of precipitation caused advantageous conditions during the crop specific water sensitive periods during blossom and grain filling nonetheless the fluctuation in the near surface layer was high as rainwater rapidly infiltrated through the well connected macropore network especially the vswc in the top 5 cm layer reacted sensitively to rain events and evaporative demand during periods of lower plant cover interception figs 6c and 4c obviously the mulch protected the soil from sealing the low fluctuation below 30 cm was attributed to soil compaction at the illuvial horizon 4 2 crop growth and yield parameters the slight delay of germination and growth in not compared to con and red fig 5a b is consistent with the long term tillage induced growing conditions this includes the preexisting higher soil compaction near surface after 24 years of no tillage practice schwen et al 2011a and the wetter soil surface fig 4 caused by plant residues mulch protection of approx 30 40 fig 6 which delays plant emergence due a delayed warming effect the consideration of crop yield parameters table 5 showed that yields in con were lower than in not even though the conventional tillage facilitated crop growth in the early growing season the high yield parameters measured at the not plots may be explained in three ways first nutrient availability was best in not and worst in con table 4 second the late precipitation events could have had a more beneficial effect for the time delayed plant development in not as soybean development depends on sufficient water supply during blossom and grain filling the rain events on das 107 and das 114 could still have covered this sensible seed maturity phase in not as the precipitation events could have been already too late for the seed maturation phase for con and red this may have caused less favorable dry matter partitioning and thus lower grain yield parameters third the higher crop yield parameters in not compared to con and red may be attributed to the larger mean macropore size with higher connectivity in not the macropore network has substantial effect on plant development as roots use existing macropores as pathways of least resistance to reach deeper soil layers athmann et al 2013 stirzaker et al 1996 consequently the deeper root system depths in not and red compared to con allowed access of a deeper soil layer and higher yield production this would agree with the majority of studies on the effects of no tillage practices on soil hydraulic properties which observed well developed macropore systems and positive effects for the soil structure freese et al 1993 strudley et al 2008 dissenting studies e g josa and hereter 2005 and global meta analyses focused directly on the effect of no tillage agriculture on the yield pittelkow et al 2015b su et al 2021 reported in general decreased crop yields in not agriculture due to natural compaction which reduced the volume of macropores containing plant available water though however the authors of these meta analyses pointed out that not achieved equal or even substantially higher yields than con practices under rainfed conditions in dry climates long term winter wheat grain yields in this experiment were generally at similar levels in all tillage systems in most years but grain yields of con and red tended to be higher than those of not when higher rainfall occurred during the growing season neugschwandtner et al 2015 furthermore a comparison with other studies must be treated with caution as tillage causes a site specific hydraulic response depending on the local climate and soil characteristics strudley et al 2008 additionally soybean is adaptable to various growing conditions by modulation of yield components neugschwandtner et al 2019 this causes for example an increase of seeding density results in higher plant density but less pods per plant while the number of grains per pod and tkw keep stable 4 3 evaporation and transpiration rates the progress of weekly e and tc act rates in the con plots fig 8 goes along with the faster plant development figs 5 and 6 compared to the treatments in red and not plots tc act etc act rapidly increased with canopy development the fast progress of e and tc act rates fig 8 and plant development figs 5 and 6 in the con plots agrees with the fast depletion of the soil water storage within the root zone furthermore it is consistent with observations reported by strudley et al 2008 who described faster depletion of the soil water storage and in particular an increase of evaporation after spring tillage which may persist for several weeks after maturation and senescence of canopy tc act etc act again reacted fast and decreased close to zero before harvest tc act etc act ratios at the red plots were similar to the con plots with slightly lower tc act etc act ratios during full canopy development further the delay of plant development compared to con is hardly noticeable tc act etc act in the not plots mirrored the time delayed plant development the lower transpiration rates until full canopy and the following higher rates until harvest compared to the other tillage systems reflected the delayed plant growth development and senescence the relatively higher e rates during the vegetative growth to full canopy until period 5 could be attributed to the management induced uneven field emergence which showed its greatest effect on e and tc act before full canopy besides that the low e rates at the very first periods may be attributed to the protective mulch layer which covered about a third of the ground during the first periods fig 6 thus e rate determination showed the beneficial effect of plant residue cover regarding radiation heat exchange water movement and turbulences at the surface the evaluation crop yield vswc distribution isotope profiles and transpiration and evaporation fractions of the tillage variants in the vegetation period 2020 supports the observations reported in literature that conservative tillage systems use the available water in dry climates and rainfed conditions more efficiently pittelkow et al 2015a thaler et al 2012 the actual effect of long lasting tillage on the water balance was more pronounced in the crop yield and the water distribution than in the evaporation and transpiration ratios however the stable isotope etc act partitioning showed the strong impact of the tillage variants on the temporal progress of evaporation and transpiration during the initial periods for instance the mulch on the undisturbed surface reduced unproductive water loss from not at the end of the vegetation period the delayed plant development and senescence led to longer productive water use particularly of the larger rain events at the end of the vegetation period fig 7 table 5 therefore the isotope based measurements revealed that the tillage induced differences of soil hydraulic properties and water availability affected e etc act and tc act etc act mainly through soil cover and plant development in contrast the isotope partitioning showed that the difference of surface wetness due to different tillage had only subsidiary influence on the evaporation transpiration ratio after formation of the canopy beside the current water use the stable isotope distributions and in particular the lc excess showed the changes of infiltration properties due to long term effects of tillage management 5 conclusions tillage affects the soil structure and thus the soil water regime plant development and the efficiency of water use results from a field campaign with soybean at a long term tillage experiment including partitioning of evapotranspiration with stable isotope technique show the best crop water productivity for low tillage intensity systems for the given silt loam soil and water limited conditions no tillage direct seeding and reduced tillage cultivator use and quadrennial subsoiling have higher crop yield than conventional tillage including plowing crop water productivity is best for no tillage and worst for conventional tillage furthermore conventional and reduced tillage lose more water unproductively by evaporation compared to no tillage the temporal evolution of transpiration rates shows the tillage induced differences of canopy development with time delayed development under no tillage this means for the investigated campaign with late precipitation events an improved water availability in the no tillage plots during the water sensitive periods the temporal evolution of evaporation rates shows their dependence on the canopy and soil cover hence conventional and reduced tillage plots have large unproductive losses during the early growing stages with sparse canopy and no mulch protection compared to the no tillage plots as the results of this study base on a one year experiment findings may vary under different climate and weather conditions soil properties and management practices however knowledge of evaporation and transpiration rates shows the importance of soil cover and water availability during water sensitive growth stages and contributes to the understanding of differences in water productivity thus determination of evaporation and transpiration rates helps to minimize unproductive water losses and to optimize tillage mulching and irrigation strategies

9486,it is well recognized that deep roots play a vital role in increasing soil water availability to crop water use their ability in regulating the allocation of the crop water use during the growing season would also influence crop yield and water productivity experiments were conducted using tubes of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m in depth with an inner diameter of 30 5 cm and irrigation amounts varying from 90 to 500 mm for two seasons of winter wheat 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the combinations of the different tube depth and irrigation created different situations in terms of maximum rooting depth and soil water availability to assess the functions of deep roots on regulation of soil water availability to crops and if the deep root growth being economic or not in relating to crop production and water productivity wp the results showed that under the same seasonal evapotranspiration et the shallower the root depth was the lower the yield higher wp was achieved with deep root systems further analysis showed that higher proportion et occurred during the reproductive stage for the treatments with deep roots which increased the leaf photosynthetic rate and the duration of the greenness resulting in higher harvest index and wp deep roots not only increased the soil water availability for crop water use but also regulated the timing of the soil water use to favor an increased proportion of water use during the reproductive stage the root shoot ratio was slightly increased from the 0 5 m tube to 1 0 m tube but under a sufficient water supply root shoot ratio gradually decreased in the 1 5 m and 2 0 m tubes resulting in less root length corresponding to the unit grain production the treatments with deep root systems increased the root efficiency the results indicated that both the total available water and the allocation of the water consumption during the crop growing season influenced the yield and water productivity increasing rooting depth was an efficient regulation measure to optimize the allocation of water consumption and increase soil water availability to crops without increasing metabolic input in root growth keywords harvest index evapotranspiration before anthesis evapotranspiration after anthesis water productivity soil water depletion 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l production largely depends on the temporal and spatial distribution of available soil water wasson et al 2012 studies have shown that 30 40 of the seasonal evapotranspiration et of winter wheat originates from water stored in soil before sowing resulting in high yield and water productivity wp zhang et al 2008 water stored in deep soil plays an important role in improving crop production under dry conditions wasson et al 2012 subsoil water extraction was positively correlated with yield and drought resistance ober et al 2014 the utilization of available soil water by crops depends on the root distribution along the soil profile nosalewicz et al 2014 previous study has shown that when the root length density rld of winter wheat is less than 0 8 cm cm 3 roots are the restricting factor for full soil water utilization zhang et al 2020 root growth of winter wheat is limited by environmental factors such as soil texture soil structure and distribution of available soil water and nutrients hodgkinson et al 2017 optimizing root systems by its plasticity is an effective way to stabilize and improve the crop yield under dry conditions paustian et al 2016 insufficient contact area of the root soil interface generally occurs in the deep soil layer below 1 m while the rld in the topsoil layer 0 0 4 m is not a factor influencing soil water utilization zhang et al 2015 when the available water in topsoil is insufficient abscisic acid inhibits the growth of lateral roots while crop auxin promotes root growth in deeper soil layers for winter wheat bardhan et al 2020 in many cases a large amount of subsoil water is left after crop harvest because there are not enough roots to fully utilize it liu et al 2018 with a limited supply of photosynthetic products the excessive proliferation of root length in the top soil layer will limit the effectiveness of roots in capturing resources which is detrimental to the development of deep roots q fang et al 2017 y fang et al 2017 under deficit irrigation water use during vegetative growth would results in insufficient available water for crops during the reproductive stage liang et al 2018 excessive growth of roots leads to the depletion of soil water before anthesis

filling can produce an additional grain yield of 55 kg ha 1 in the arid environment of australia manschadi et al 2006 sufficient water supply during the reproductive stage and proper utilization of available water in the deep soil layer can improve crop production of winter wheat yang et al 2021 the transformation rule of crops from opportunistic populations relying on shallow soil water to conservative populations relying on deep soil water indicates that crops have environmental adaptability in root development fort et al 2017 during anthesis and grain filling photosynthetic products are mainly transported to grains instead of roots woo et al 2020 many studies have shown that increasing the rld in the deep soil layer can effectively expand the range of soil water interception and increase available water during the reproductive stage of winter wheat thereby prolonging the green time of leaves to improve crop production reynolds et al 2011 thorup kristensen et al 2020 severini et al 2020 although deep roots increase the availability of soil water to crops but a trade off that should be considered between input into root growth and the scale of its benefits a recent review paper argued that in high input agricultural systems economical root structure is conducive to improve crop yield lynch 2018 roots are the main carbon assimilates of plants consuming nearly twice as much photosynthetic output as shoots passioura et al 1983 under deficit irrigation excessive growth of roots leads to the depletion of soil water before anthesis consuming a large amount of photosynthetic assimilates mehrabi et al 2021 from this perspective root shoot ratio of crops should not exceed a certain value further increasing in the root growth will increases the carbohydrate cost boudiar et al 2021 van oosterom et al 2016 defined root system efficiency rse as transpiration per unit leaf area and per unit root mass as an analogy with mature leaf economic spectrum wright et al 2004 which means that genotypes with high rse that can maintain transpiration at low root quantity it is important that manipulating root growth needs to balance the cost and the benefit therefore balancing the crop root growth and soil water utilization to achieve higher yield and water productivity is crucial for maintaining grain production under limited water supply conditions the hypothesis of this study was that under limited water supply deep rooted wheat plants were able to access more soil water for post anthesis water consumption which would result in larger post anthesis dry matter production the increasing in deep root growth was not necessary increasing the overall cost in obtaining water for crop water use and reducing root efficiency the functions of deep roots in the regulation of soil water availability to the aboveground plant parts during crop growing season would play a significant role in achieving the goals of high yield and high water productivity 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design for two winter wheat growing seasons 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 tube experiments were conducted at the luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences 37 53 n 114 40 e 50 m asl which is located in the central part of the north china plain the tubes were buried flush with the soil surface in a winter wheat field to create atmospheric growing conditions similar as those of the surrounding field a movable shed was used to cover the tubes during rainfall events to ensure all the water supply coming from irrigation water the tubes were filled with soils collected from the surrounding field topsoil 0 20 cm at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 to create a uniform soil condition to favor root growth the initial soil water content for all tubes was set at 87 5 and 100 of the field capacity in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively field capacity was at 0 24 g g 1 the soil properties and nutrient contents were shown in table 1 four tube depths were used to simulate different maximum rooting depths of winter wheat including 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m the inner diameter of the pvc tubes was 30 5 cm and the bottom of the tubes was sealed with plastic film fig 1 when filling the tubes with soil water content was measured and soil weight for each 10 cm depth of the tube was calculated to maintain 1 4 g cm 3 soil bulk density soil was weighted for each 10 cm depth of the tube and water was added to reach 0 21 g g 1 water contents in 2019 2020 and 0 24 g g 1 in 2020 2021 after mixing the water and the soil the soil was packed into the tubes to the designed depth the top 10 cm soil layer was mixed with 2 0 g of diammonium containing 46 p2o5 and 16 n and 1 5 g of urea containing 46 n as base fertilizers there was 5 cm depth at the top for each tube without filling soil for adding irrigation water fig 1 thirty seeds were selected and planted into each tube manually on 20th oct 2019 and 2020 after sowing the soil surface was covered with 1 cm fine sand to reduce soil evaporation at three leaf stage seedlings were thinned to 24 to match the initial sowing density in the surrounding field 330 seedlings m 2

winter wheat under full irrigation supply at the experimental site ranged from 400 to 500 mm which was taken as the designated seasonal et 400 mm in 2019 2020 and 500 mm in 2020 2021 the three irrigations were 1 irrigation amount being the same as the designed seasonal et fi 2 irrigation amount was the difference between the designated seasonal et and the 50 of the asw in the tubes at sowing which assumed 50 of asw being consumed and the rest was supplied by irrigation asw 50 and 3 irrigation amount was the difference between the designated seasonal et and 100 of the asw at sowing

there were 12 treatments and totally 48 tubes were used and they were randomly arranged in the field the different irrigation amounts and tube depths in this study were designed to create different maximum rooting depths and soil availability to crops the irrigation amounts for the three irrigation treatments to each tube depth were listed in table 2 the total irrigation amount was equally

photosynthesis rate was measured using a co2 gas exchange system li 6400 li cor inc usa a thermal infrared camera flir t540 teledyne flir llc usa was shot vertically downward to measure the canopy temperature of each tube with emissivity set at 0 98 2 2 3 biomass grain yield and yield components at maturity plants in each tube were cut at ground level plant height and the spike numbers of each tube were recorded after air drying to a constant weight total biomass was recorded a single spike thresher was used to separate grains the weight of the grains 13 of water contents was recorded for each tube using the total biomass and grain weight harvest index hi was calculated as grain yield total above ground biomass total grain numbers for each tube were counted by a seed counting machine the 1000 seed weight was calculated as grain weigh seed numbers 1000 seed numbers per spike were calculated as total seed numbers spike numbers 2 2 4 soil water contents at anthesis to determine the water consumption before and after anthesis the soil water contents at thesis for each tube was determined by measuring the canopy temperature at noon the correlation of the canopy temperature with soil water contents was determined using a field irrigation study at the same site the irrigation treatments included 6 irrigation amounts which created a broad range of soil water conditions the soil water contents for the field study were automatically monitored by insentek soil water sensors eastern ecology company china which can provide hourly volumetric water contents for 10 cm increments down to 2 m depth the canopy temperature for the tubes and the field plots was measured at the same time the correlation of the soil water content of different depths with canopy temperature derived from the field was used to estimate the soil water contents in the tubes 2 2 5 soil water contents and root measurement at harvesting after the aboveground plant parts were harvested the pvc tubes were excavated and cut in half to obtain the soil columns inside the tubes each soil column was cut into 20 cm thick segments from bottom up and the thicknesses of the final segments at the top was 5 cm 15 cm 5 cm and 15 cm for the 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m tubes respectively a small amount of soil approximately 100 g was removed from each segment for measuring the soil water content by the oven drying method the soils for water content measurements were free of roots thereafter each segment was washed manually to obtain roots after manual separation of the debris from the roots root length was measured using line intersect method tennant 1975 afterward roots were oven dried and dry root weight was recorded the root length density rld was calculated as root length soil volume and total root length and root weight was the sum of all the root length and weight from all the segments for each tube the root shoot ratio was calculated as total root weight total above ground biomass root efficiency in this study was defined as the grain production per unit root length or root weight 2 2 6 evapotranspiration and water productivity seasonal evapotranspiration et et before anthesis during vegetative stage and after anthesis during reproductive stage was calculated using the following equation 1 et p i swd cr r d where et is the total seasonal evapotranspiration or evapotranspiration before and after anthesis p is precipitation mm i is the irrigation water mm swd is the soil water consumption mm cr is capillary rising r is runoff mm and d is the drainage of the soil water from the root zone mm due to the protection of the movable shelter and the plastic sealing at the bottom of the tubes p d and cr were taken as zero there was no runoff therefore et was calculated as i swd in this study water productivity at grain yield level wpg is defined as grain yield et 2 3 data analysis microsoft excel 2019 microsoft redmond ca and ibm spss statistics 21 ibm stanford usa were used for data analysis when the variance homogeneity test was successful the least significant difference lsd test was performed p 0 05 correlations among different parameters were analyzed based on the average values of four replicates for each treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 growing conditions for the two seasons fig 2 shows the daily average temperature tave and et0 changes from sowing to harvest during the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons both seasons had higher seasonal average daily temperature with 7 5 for 2019 2020 and 8 1 for 2020 2021 as compared with 6 8 the long term average during 1984 2021 after winter dormancy the average daily temperature for 2020 2021 season was 16 2 which was much higher than that in 2019 2020 13 4 and the long term average 14 0 2020 2021 was a warmer season the total seasonal sunshine hours during the growing seasons were 1218 h in 2019 2020 and 1419 h in 2020 2021 with the value for 2020 2021 season being much higher than that both in 2019 2020 and for the long term average which was 1216 h the higher temperature and longer total seasonal sunshine hours resulted in the higher et0 in the 2020 2021 season the seasonal et0 was 546 1 mm in 2019 2020 632 7 mm in 2020 2021 and the long term average value was 490 4 mm the higher atmospheric evaporation potential would increase crop water use and result in higher seasonal evapotranspiration fig 2 also shows that the higher daily et0 in 2020 2021 season mainly occurred after winter dormancy especially during the reproductive growing stages when the crop consumed more water the atmospheric growing conditions of the two seasons differed in the higher water demands in 2020 2021 season during the reproductive stages 3 2 evapotranspiration et and soil water depletion of the two seasons fig 3 shows the seasonal et and the contributions of soil water depletion swd to the seasonal et in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons seasonal et increased with the increase in the depth of the tubes and decreased with the decrease in irrigation application the contribution of soil water depletion to the seasonal et increased with the increase in tube depth and declined with the increase in water supply the contribution of swd to the seasonal et ranged from 15 to 20 for tube depth of 0 5 m and up to 80 for tube depth of 2 0 m a higher proportion of swd over seasonal et was significantly affected by the tube depths i e the soil water availability the deep tubes provided more soil water for crop water use evapotranspiration of crops is closely related to the dynamic changes in soil water content vivoni et al 2008 purdy et al 2018 under the condition of limited irrigation soil water availability to crops plays a vital role in regulating evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 the seasonal et for deep tubes was greater than that for shallow tubes under similar irrigation amounts due to the difference in their soil water availability crop et is also affected by the atmospheric evaporation potential the higher seasonal et0 in 2020 21 growing season resulted in the higher seasonal et and higher soil water depletion for the 2 0 m tubes under the asw 100 treatments fig 3 when crops grow in environments with higher atmospheric evaporation potential the ability to fully utilize the available soil water would be enhanced fisher et al 2008 the seasonal et for the fi treatments exceeded the designed seasonal et for the two seasons due to the higher atmospheric evaporation potential especially for the season of 2020 2021 the et0 in 2019 2020 was 11 4 higher and 29 0 higher in 2020 2021 than the long term average value fig 2 the seasonal et of the increased crop water use for fi was from the stored soil water before sowing all the available soil water was consumed for tubes of 0 5 m 1 0 m and 1 5 m and 74 of the total available soil water for tubes 2 0 m in 2019 2020 under fi in 2020 2021 season the designated irrigation was 100 mm greater than that in 2019 2020 and due to the high atmospheric evaporation demand in this season the contribution of swd to et was still quite high under fi the consumption of the total available water was 85 8 for 0 5 m tube 93 for 1 0 m tube 79 for 1 5 m tube and 65 for 2 0 m tube under the fi those results indicated that soil water stored before sowing of winter wheat plays key roles in supplying the water use of the crop regardless of the irrigation management under the condition of this experiment studies have shown that sufficient pre sowing soil water storage could ensure good emergence of winter wheat and promote tillering resulting in the increased numbers of effective panicles per unit area and improved grain production lawes et al 2009 peake et al 2016 deep soil layers of 1 5 m and 2 0 m tubes could store a large amount of water and continuously supply the water needed for crops to achieve high production the designated 50 of asw use occurred for all tube depths but the designated 100 of asw use for tubes of 2 m depth was not achieved approximately 75 6 of the total asw in 2019 2020 and 82 5 of that in 2020 2021 was used for the 2 0 m tube under the designated 100 asw treatment there was asw remaining in the deep soil layers that was not fully withdrawn by the crop 3 3 correlation between root distribution and soil water use fig 4 shows the soil water contents along the soil profile at harvesting for the asw 100 treatments the results indicated that the soil water consumption for tubes 0 5 m and 1 0 m could be below the wilting point while for tubes of 1 5 and 2 0 m the soil water use below the 1 m soil profile was incomplete thus there was still available soil water that was not fully utilized at harvest for the 1 5 and 2 0 m tubes for both seasons the lower root length density rld in the deep soil layers was the limiting factor for the full use of asw zhang et al 2004 2009 white 2015 zhang et al 2020 the rld among the different treatments in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons is shown in fig 5 the results of root distribution indicated that for the shallow tubes of 0 5 and 1 0 m under all irrigation treatments rld was greater than 0 8 cm cm 3 although there was a declining trend from top downward all irrigation treatments showed an increase in rld at the bottom layer indicating that the tube depth of 0 5 and 1 0 m restricted root growth and when roots met the bottom root proliferation occurred which increased the rld at the bottom of the tubes for the 1 5 and 2 0 m depth tubes rld decreased with the increase in soil depth and rld was lower than 0 8 cm cm 3 below that of the 1 m soil profile the rld below 1 m for the asw 100 and asw 50 treatments was higher than that for the fi treatments indicating that reduced irrigation promoted root growth when the available water in topsoil is insufficient abscisic acid inhibits the growth of lateral roots while crop auxin promotes root growth in deeper soil layers for winter wheat bardhan et al 2020 in many cases a large amount of subsoil water is left after harvest liu et al 2018 the soil water depletion in the topsoil layers may be below the wilting point due to the soil evaporation and the soil water content gradually increased with the increasing in soil depth and a decline in rld fig 4 and fig 5 this result was consistent with previous reports indicating that soil water use by crops is influenced by the root system when rld is the limiting factor iijima et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 insufficient soil water use is usually attributed to low root length density at deep soil layers gregory et al 1978 palta et al 2011 root length density is the most appropriate parameter to describe plant root water absorption as compared with other root characteristics carvalho and foulkes 2013 the effective rooting depth of winter wheat has attracted much attention white et al 2015 if the surface roots can obtain sufficient water root initiation will decrease exponentially with increasing soil depth gerwitz and page 1974 aziz et al 2017 palta and turner 2019 however when topsoil water was exhausted root growth in the subsoil is enhanced resulting in the improved utilization of soil water torreano and morris 1998 lv et al 2010 winter wheat has deep root characteristics that can penetrate down to a depth of 2 m and absorb deep soil water lilley and kirkegaard 2011 if rainfall and irrigation was limited then water stored in the deep soil profile would be the main water resource in the late growing season of a crop and therefore making full use of the deep soil water would be beneficial to improve grain production cui et al 2003 the results from this study indicated that 0 5 m and 1 0 m tubes restricted the root elongation of winter wheat without restrictions roots of winter wheat could reach 2 m depth but rld below 1 m decreased markedly with increasing soil depth and the less rld would restrict the full use of the available soil water in the deep soil layers 3 4 influences of seasonal et and allocation of et after anthesis on crop production and water productivity table 3 shows the yield and yield components of winter wheat under different treatments in both seasons different rooting depth created by the different depth of the tubes and different irrigation regimes resulted in large variations in seasonal et and grain production yield generally increased with the increase in tube depth and irrigation amount and the highest yield was achieved with the treatment of fi 2 0 m which also had the highest amount of seasonal et fig 3 the three yield components of spike numbers per area seed numbers per ear and seed weight were all significantly correlated with the irrigation amounts for the different tubes fig 6 shows that there was a positive linear correlation of seasonal et with grain yield but the different depths of the tubes resulted in different correlations grain yield was different among the four tube depths under the similar seasonal et with the lowest yield for the 0 5 m tube and the highest yield for the 2 0 m tube except for 2019 2020 where the 1 5 and 2 0 m tubes shared the same correlation the results indicated that the same seasonal water consumption for winter wheat could result in different grain yield related to the difference in maximum rooting depth a similar seasonal et resulting in different grain production among the four tube depths was related to the differences in the timing of water consumption using the correlation of canopy temperature with soil moisture developed at the same site at anthesis fig 7 the soil water content at anthesis was estimated for all treatments in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons previous study proved that crop canopy temperature can be used to estimate the soil water contents vogel et al 2019 luan et al 2021 the results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between soil moisture at different soil depths and crop canopy temperature suggesting that at anthesis of winter wheat canopy temperature can be used to estimate the soil water contents based on the correlations in fig 7 the average gravimetric soil water content for different tube depths was estimated at anthesis using the water balance equation eq 1 et before and after anthesis was calculated and fig 8 shows that the shallower the tube the lower the ratio of the et after anthesis on average 32 6 40 3 of seasonal et was used after anthesis for the 0 5 m tube treatments 33 3 46 5 for the 1 0 m tubes 41 1 56 1 for the 1 5 m tubes and 45 2 62 1 for the 2 0 m tubes for the two seasons a previous study indicated that post anthesis water use should be approximately 55 to achieve the maximum yield of winter wheat liang et al 2018 the treatments of 2 0 m tubes resulted in the optimized allocation of the water use before and after anthesis and the highest yield being obtained under similar seasonal et the high water consumption before anthesis for shallower rooting depth usually indicated high biomass production during the vegetative growth period and less water available during the reproductive stage would result in reduced biomass accumulation and low efficiency in dry matter allocation to the seed weight and therefore reduced the harvest index hi the average hi was 0 32 0 33 0 37 and 0 37 for tube depths of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 and they were 0 33 0 33 0 37 and 0 37 respectively in 2020 2021 table 3 a positive linear correlation was found between hi and the ratio of post anthesis water use to seasonal et fig 9 the deep rooting system of winter wheat in deep tubes contributed to the higher proportion of water use during the reproductive stage fig 8 and therefore to the higher hi under various water supply conditions biomass production should be efficiently translocated into grains to improve crop production asseng et al 2017 liang et al 2021 the results from this study indicated that deep roots could allow more water consumption during reproductive stages to increase hi and grain production under limited water supply under water deficit conditions it is important to regulate the proportion of soil water consumption between vegetative and reproductive growth to achieve high water productivity yang et al 2021 the decrease in available soil water storage leads to the aggravation of winter wheat drought after anthesis shortens the grain filling time and causes a reduction in endosperm dry matter accumulation abid et al 2016 increasing of hi was conducive to the increase in yield and water productivity reynolds et al 2011 rivera amado et al 2019 the average wpg was 1 23 1 48 1 79 and 1 74 kg m 3 for tube depths of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 under the three water treatments the values were 1 29 1 62 1 64 and 2 03 kg m 3 respectively in 2020 2021 table 3 regardless of the water supply the tube depth which determined the maximum rooting depth and significantly affected the wpg water productivity was improved with the increase in rooting depth 3 5 leaf photosynthetic rate and duration of greenness during grain filling the high soil water availability for the deep tubes during the reproductive stage resulted in higher leaf photosynthesis and longer lasting of the greenness of the flag leaves fig 10 shows the average leaf photosynthesis rate of flag leaves during grain filling in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons for different treatments the photosynthetic rate of the 2 0 m tubes was higher than that of the other depth tubes under the same irrigation treatment available soil water in shallow tubes was exhausted at the early growth stage of winter wheat fig 8 and could not meet the water consumption demand of crops during anthesis and grain filling stages resulting in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate for the asw 100 and asw 50 treatments other results also indicated that the leaf photosynthetic rate is positively correlated with the utilization of soil water by the root system lawlor and cornic 2002 kong et al 2013 photosynthesis is the main driving force affecting dry matter accumulation and organ formation determining the yield and yield components of cereal crops zlatev and lidon 2012 zhang et al 2009 reported that 60 80 of wheat grain yield came from the post anthesis products of leaf photosynthesis therefore water availability during the reproductive stages plays important roles in determining the final grain yield of winter wheat the photosynthesis rate of winter wheat flag leaves during anthesis was limited by both stomatal and nonstomatal factors the former is the decreasing in stomatal conductance and the amount of co2 entering mesophyll cells due to water deficit and the latter refers to the decrease in chlorophyll content which leads to a decrease in photochemical organ activity and accelerates the degradation of plant internal structure and storage substances hlav√°ƒçov√°a et al 2018 fig 11 shows the changes in chlorophyll content in flag leaves among different treatments at anthesis and grain filling for the two seasons similar flag leaf chlorophyll content existed among the different treatments at anthesis from anthesis to the middle of the grain filling the chlorophyll contents of flag leaves decreased significantly for the shallower tubes which caused a decrease in photosynthetic intensity and shortened greenness duration even under the fi the reduction in greenness of the flag leaves was more rapid for shallower tubes than for deep tubes indicating that both soil water conditions and root activities influenced above ground performance roots in deep soils usually occur later and their biological activities would be greater than roots in the topsoil layers in the later growing season to favor more rigorous metabolic activities zhang et al 2004 white et al 2010 irrigation played a significant role in maintaining the green holding time of flag leaves the chlorophyll content of the fi treatment at different tube depths was higher than that of the other irrigation treatments as an indicator of the dynamic change in canopy pigment density chlorophyll content has a good correlation with the photosynthetic capacity of plants feng et al 2008 many studies have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the chlorophyll content of crop leaves and the duration of photosynthetic activity maintenance the senescence of leaves with a higher content of chlorophyll was slow which ensures that they have a higher photosynthetic area giving the plant longer filling duration and higher water use efficiency during the reproductive stage of winter wheat spano et al 2003 vadez et al 2011 sade et al 2018 3 6 effects of rooting depth on root efficiency maintaining large and deep root systems would increase the cost of carbon assimilate allocation to non photosynthetic tissues there should be a balance of the costs and the benefits in regulating root growth which means that the benefit of an improvement in grain yield resulting from temporal and spatial optimization of crop water use should offset the biomass cost consumed by the proliferation of deep roots was the deep root economic the root shoot ratio among different treatments in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons was shown in fig 12 generally shallower tubes and less irrigation resulted in higher root shoot ratio for this study similar to the root system efficiency rse which was defined as the root quantity required for transpiration per unit leaf area van oosterom et al 2016 the root efficiency re was defined as grain production per unit root weight or root length requirement in this study the average re in term of grain production supported by unit root weight was 6 16 6 59 8 57 and 8 35 g g 1 for tube depths of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 under the three water treatments the values were 6 12 7 46 9 14 and 9 62 g g 1 respectively in 2020 2021 the average re in term of grain production supported by unit root length was 79 6 85 6 89 7 and 100 3 mg m 1 for the tube depths of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 and the values were 71 3 91 4 103 9 and 107 5 mg m 1 respectively in 2020 2021 the results from this study indicated that with the increase in the maximum rooting depth the root requirements to support unit grain production were in a declining trend which would reduce the cost in roots in producing grains increasing rooting depth was an efficient regulation measure to increase the soil water availability to crops without negatively increasing metabolic input in root growth it has been proved that under drought stress the greater the root weight and root length density in deep soil are the higher the soil water availability after anthesis and the higher the yield li et al 2021 an increasing of the root length density in topsoil will increase the competition among roots increase the level of abscisic acid and reduce stomatal conductance and photosynthesis all of which would negatively impact on grain production q fang et al 2017 y fang et al 2017 under the conditions of shallower rooting depth insufficient water supply might lead to excessive root proliferation without increasing the amount of soil water that crops could uptake the benefits brought by root proliferation to soil water use might not offset the biomass cost which might reduce the root efficiency under the conditions of deep rooting depth the increase in root growth in deep soil layers would increase the soil water availability and a small increase in crop water use would benefit a lot for grain production the cost in root growth would be compensated by the improved grain production to achieve a higher re therefore the practice of improving grain yield and water productivity needs to be combined to create appropriate root characteristics lilley and kirkegaard 2011 4 conclusions balancing root growth and soil water use without increasing the cost in root growth is a challenge to achieve high yield and water productivity under limited water supply the yield of winter wheat was affected by available water that could be used during the growing season as well as how the available water was allocated during the growing season the rooting depth of the crop significantly affected the soil water availability to crops as well as the timing of the soil availability to crops which significantly affected grain production and water productivity the results from this study indicated that deep soil profiles without limitations to root growth benefited both crop production and water productivity due to the regulation of the root system in terms of soil water availability and the differential allocation of water use during the vegetative and reproductive stages under various water supply conditions deep root growth did not necessarily increase the input in root growth and the root efficiency in terms of grain production per unit root was increased under deep root growth situations because shallow root system often induces redundant root growth in topsoil which would not increase soil water and nutrient availability to crops therefore soil profiles with unlimited root growth would benefit crop production regardless of the water supply conditions therefore soil management practices to favor deep crop root growth should be adopted declaration of competing interest the authors

9486,it is well recognized that deep roots play a vital role in increasing soil water availability to crop water use their ability in regulating the allocation of the crop water use during the growing season would also influence crop yield and water productivity experiments were conducted using tubes of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m in depth with an inner diameter of 30 5 cm and irrigation amounts varying from 90 to 500 mm for two seasons of winter wheat 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the combinations of the different tube depth and irrigation created different situations in terms of maximum rooting depth and soil water availability to assess the functions of deep roots on regulation of soil water availability to crops and if the deep root growth being economic or not in relating to crop production and water productivity wp the results showed that under the same seasonal evapotranspiration et the shallower the root depth was the lower the yield higher wp was achieved with deep root systems further analysis showed that higher proportion et occurred during the reproductive stage for the treatments with deep roots which increased the leaf photosynthetic rate and the duration of the greenness resulting in higher harvest index and wp deep roots not only increased the soil water availability for crop water use but also regulated the timing of the soil water use to favor an increased proportion of water use during the reproductive stage the root shoot ratio was slightly increased from the 0 5 m tube to 1 0 m tube but under a sufficient water supply root shoot ratio gradually decreased in the 1 5 m and 2 0 m tubes resulting in less root length corresponding to the unit grain production the treatments with deep root systems increased the root efficiency the results indicated that both the total available water and the allocation of the water consumption during the crop growing season influenced the yield and water productivity increasing rooting depth was an efficient regulation measure to optimize the allocation of water consumption and increase soil water availability to crops without increasing metabolic input in root growth keywords harvest index evapotranspiration before anthesis evapotranspiration after anthesis water productivity soil water depletion 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l production largely depends on the temporal and spatial distribution of available soil water wasson et al 2012 studies have shown that 30 40 of the seasonal evapotranspiration et of winter wheat originates from water stored in soil before sowing resulting in high yield and water productivity wp zhang et al 2008 water stored in deep soil plays an important role in improving crop production under dry conditions wasson et al 2012 subsoil water extraction was positively correlated with yield and drought resistance ober et al 2014 the utilization of available soil water by crops depends on the root distribution along the soil profile nosalewicz et al 2014 previous study has shown that when the root length density rld of winter wheat is less than 0 8 cm cm 3 roots are the restricting factor for full soil water utilization zhang et al 2020 root growth of winter wheat is limited by environmental factors such as soil texture soil structure and distribution of available soil water and nutrients hodgkinson et al 2017 optimizing root systems by its plasticity is an effective way to stabilize and improve the crop yield under dry conditions paustian et al 2016 insufficient contact area of the root soil interface generally occurs in the deep soil layer below 1 m while the rld in the topsoil layer 0 0 4 m is not a factor influencing soil water utilization zhang et al 2015 when the available water in topsoil is insufficient abscisic acid inhibits the growth of lateral roots while crop auxin promotes root growth in deeper soil layers for winter wheat bardhan et al 2020 in many cases a large amount of subsoil water is left after crop harvest because there are not enough roots to fully utilize it liu et al 2018 with a limited supply of photosynthetic products the excessive proliferation of root length in the top soil layer will limit the effectiveness of roots in capturing resources which is detrimental to the development of deep roots q fang et al 2017 y fang et al 2017 under deficit irrigation water use during vegetative growth would results in insufficient available water for crops during the reproductive stage liang et al 2018 excessive growth of roots leads to the depletion of soil water before anthesis consuming a large amount of photosynthetic assimilates and negatively affecting crop production mehrabi et al 2021 it has been shown that each additional millimeter of water extracted during grain filling can produce an additional grain yield of 55 kg ha 1 in the arid environment of australia manschadi et al 2006 sufficient water supply during the reproductive stage and proper utilization of available water in the deep soil layer can improve crop production of winter wheat yang et al 2021 the transformation rule of crops from opportunistic populations relying on shallow soil water to conservative populations relying on deep soil water indicates that crops have environmental adaptability in root development fort et al 2017 during anthesis and grain filling photosynthetic products are mainly transported to grains instead of roots woo et al 2020 many studies have shown that increasing the rld in the deep soil layer can effectively expand the range of soil water interception and increase available water during the reproductive stage of winter wheat thereby prolonging the green time of leaves to improve crop production reynolds et al 2011 thorup kristensen et al 2020 severini et al 2020 although deep roots increase the availability of soil water to crops but a trade off that should be considered between input into root growth and the scale of its benefits a recent review paper argued that in high input agricultural systems economical root structure is conducive to improve crop yield lynch 2018 roots are the main carbon assimilates of plants consuming nearly twice as much photosynthetic output as shoots passioura et al 1983 under deficit irrigation excessive growth of roots leads to the depletion of soil water before anthesis consuming a large amount of photosynthetic assimilates mehrabi et al 2021 from this perspective root shoot ratio of crops should not exceed a certain value further increasing in the root growth will increases the carbohydrate cost boudiar et al 2021 van oosterom et al 2016 defined root system efficiency rse as transpiration per unit leaf area and per unit root mass as an analogy with mature leaf economic spectrum wright et al 2004 which means that genotypes with high rse that can maintain transpiration at low root quantity it is important that manipulating root growth needs to balance the cost and the benefit therefore balancing the crop root growth and soil water utilization to achieve higher yield and water productivity is crucial for maintaining grain production under limited water supply conditions the hypothesis of this study was that under limited water supply deep rooted wheat plants were able to access more soil water for post anthesis water consumption which would result in larger post anthesis dry matter production the increasing in deep root growth was not necessary increasing the overall cost in obtaining water for crop water use and reducing root efficiency the functions of deep roots in the regulation of soil water availability to the aboveground plant parts during crop growing season would play a significant role in achieving the goals of high yield and high water productivity 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design for two winter wheat growing seasons 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 tube experiments were conducted at the luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences 37 53 n 114 40 e 50 m asl which is located in the central part of the north china plain the tubes were buried flush with the soil surface in a winter wheat field to create atmospheric growing conditions similar as those of the surrounding field a movable shed was used to cover the tubes during rainfall events to ensure all the water supply coming from irrigation water the tubes were filled with soils collected from the surrounding field topsoil 0 20 cm at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 to create a uniform soil condition to favor root growth the initial soil water content for all tubes was set at 87 5 and 100 of the field capacity in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively field capacity was at 0 24 g g 1 the soil properties and nutrient contents were shown in table 1 four tube depths were used to simulate different maximum rooting depths of winter wheat including 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m the inner diameter of the pvc tubes was 30 5 cm and the bottom of the tubes was sealed with plastic film fig 1 when filling the tubes with soil water content was measured and soil weight for each 10 cm depth of the tube was calculated to maintain 1 4 g cm 3 soil bulk density soil was weighted for each 10 cm depth of the tube and water was added to reach 0 21 g g 1 water contents in 2019 2020 and 0 24 g g 1 in 2020 2021 after mixing the water and the soil the soil was packed into the tubes to the designed depth the top 10 cm soil layer was mixed with 2 0 g of diammonium containing 46 p2o5 and 16 n and 1 5 g of urea containing 46 n as base fertilizers there was 5 cm depth at the top for each tube without filling soil for adding irrigation water fig 1 thirty seeds were selected and planted into each tube manually on 20th oct 2019 and 2020 after sowing the soil surface was covered with 1 cm fine sand to reduce soil evaporation at three leaf stage seedlings were thinned to 24 to match the initial sowing density in the surrounding field 330 seedlings m 2 the winter wheat cultivar used for both years was shixin 633 a popular local cultivar three irrigation treatments were set up for each of the four tube depths based on the designated seasonal evapotranspiration et and the different contributions of the available soil water stored before sowing asw asw soil water content at sowing minus wilting point the seasonal evapotranspiration of winter wheat under full irrigation supply at the experimental site ranged from 400 to 500 mm which was taken as the designated seasonal et 400 mm in 2019 2020 and 500 mm in 2020 2021 the three irrigations were 1 irrigation amount being the same as the designed seasonal et fi 2 irrigation amount was the difference between the designated seasonal et and the 50 of the asw in the tubes at sowing which assumed 50 of asw being consumed and the rest was supplied by irrigation asw 50 and 3 irrigation amount was the difference between the designated seasonal et and 100 of the asw at sowing which assumed 100 of the asw being consumed and the rest was supplied by irrigation asw 100 there were four replicates for each of the four depths of the tube and the three irrigation regimes in total there were 12 treatments and totally 48 tubes were used and they were randomly arranged in the field the different irrigation amounts and tube depths in this study were designed to create different maximum rooting depths and soil availability to crops the irrigation amounts for the three irrigation treatments to each tube depth were listed in table 2 the total irrigation amount was equally divided into seven irrigations and applied during the growing season the timings of the irrigation were at winter dormancy 42 days after sowing recovery 132 d jointing 163 d booting 177 d heading 192 d anthesis 202 d and grain filling 212 d respectively harvesting occurred on 5 june in 2019 2020 and 7 june in 2020 2021 season at jointing 2 g urea was applied to each tube by dissolving into the irrigation water 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological factors a standard automatic meteorological station located around 100 m away north of the experimental site was used to obtain hourly meteorological data which included temperature relative humidity radiation sunshine hours wind speed and rainfall daily reference evapotranspiration et0 grass as the reference crop was calculated based on the fao recommended penmen monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 2 2 agronomic and physiological parameters the density canopy coverage and phenology parameters of all tubes were regularly monitored pests diseases and weeds were prevented and did not affect crop growth four flag leaves of each tube were randomly selected to measure physiological parameters from 10 00 15 00 h local time on sunny days during the anthesis stage the leaf chlorophyll content was determined by the difference of optical density between two wavelengths spad 502dl plus spectrum technologies inc usa leaf photosynthesis rate was measured using a co2 gas exchange system li 6400 li cor inc usa a thermal infrared camera flir t540 teledyne flir llc usa was shot vertically downward to measure the canopy temperature of each tube with emissivity set at 0 98 2 2 3 biomass grain yield and yield components at maturity plants in each tube were cut at ground level plant height and the spike numbers of each tube were recorded after air drying to a constant weight total biomass was recorded a single spike thresher was used to separate grains the weight of the grains 13 of water contents was recorded for each tube using the total biomass and grain weight harvest index hi was calculated as grain yield total above ground biomass total grain numbers for each tube were counted by a seed counting machine the 1000 seed weight was calculated as grain weigh seed numbers 1000 seed numbers per spike were calculated as total seed numbers spike numbers 2 2 4 soil water contents at anthesis to determine the water consumption before and after anthesis the soil water contents at thesis for each tube was determined by measuring the canopy temperature at noon the correlation of the canopy temperature with soil water contents was determined using a field irrigation study at the same site the irrigation treatments included 6 irrigation amounts which created a broad range of soil water conditions the soil water contents for the field study were automatically monitored by insentek soil water sensors eastern ecology company china which can provide hourly volumetric water contents for 10 cm increments down to 2 m depth the canopy temperature for the tubes and the field plots was measured at the same time the correlation of the soil water content of different depths with canopy temperature derived from the field was used to estimate the soil water contents in the tubes 2 2 5 soil water contents and root measurement at harvesting after the aboveground plant parts were harvested the pvc tubes were excavated and cut in half to obtain the soil columns inside the tubes each soil column was cut into 20 cm thick segments from bottom up and the thicknesses of the final segments at the top was 5 cm 15 cm 5 cm and 15 cm for the 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m tubes respectively a small amount of soil approximately 100 g was removed from each segment for measuring the soil water content by the oven drying method the soils for water content measurements were free of roots thereafter each segment was washed manually to obtain roots after manual separation of the debris from the roots root length was measured using line intersect method tennant 1975 afterward roots were oven dried and dry root weight was recorded the root length density rld was calculated as root length soil volume and total root length and root weight was the sum of all the root length and weight from all the segments for each tube the root shoot ratio was calculated as total root weight total above ground biomass root efficiency in this study was defined as the grain production per unit root length or root weight 2 2 6 evapotranspiration and water productivity seasonal evapotranspiration et et before anthesis during vegetative stage and after anthesis during reproductive stage was calculated using the following equation 1 et p i swd cr r d where et is the total seasonal evapotranspiration or evapotranspiration before and after anthesis p is precipitation mm i is the irrigation water mm swd is the soil water consumption mm cr is capillary rising r is runoff mm and d is the drainage of the soil water from the root zone mm due to the protection of the movable shelter and the plastic sealing at the bottom of the tubes p d and cr were taken as zero there was no runoff therefore et was calculated as i swd in this study water productivity at grain yield level wpg is defined as grain yield et 2 3 data analysis microsoft excel 2019 microsoft redmond ca and ibm spss statistics 21 ibm stanford usa were used for data analysis when the variance homogeneity test was successful the least significant difference lsd test was performed p 0 05 correlations among different parameters were analyzed based on the average values of four replicates for each treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 growing conditions for the two seasons fig 2 shows the daily average temperature tave and et0 changes from sowing to harvest during the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons both seasons had higher seasonal average daily temperature with 7 5 for 2019 2020 and 8 1 for 2020 2021 as compared with 6 8 the long term average during 1984 2021 after winter dormancy the average daily temperature for 2020 2021 season was 16 2 which was much higher than that in 2019 2020 13 4 and the long term average 14 0 2020 2021 was a warmer season the total seasonal sunshine hours during the growing seasons were 1218 h in 2019 2020 and 1419 h in 2020 2021 with the value for 2020 2021 season being much higher than that both in 2019 2020 and for the long term average which was 1216 h the higher temperature and longer total seasonal sunshine hours resulted in the higher et0 in the 2020 2021 season the seasonal et0 was 546 1 mm in 2019 2020 632 7 mm in 2020 2021 and the long term average value was 490 4 mm the higher atmospheric evaporation potential would increase crop water use and result in higher seasonal evapotranspiration fig 2 also shows that the higher daily et0 in 2020 2021 season mainly occurred after winter dormancy especially during the reproductive growing stages when the crop consumed more water the atmospheric growing conditions of the two seasons differed in the higher water demands in 2020 2021 season during the reproductive stages 3 2 evapotranspiration et and soil water depletion of the two seasons fig 3 shows the seasonal et and the contributions of soil water depletion swd to the seasonal et in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons seasonal et increased with the increase in the depth of the tubes and decreased with the decrease in irrigation application the contribution of soil water depletion to the seasonal et increased with the increase in tube depth and declined with the increase in water supply the contribution of swd to the seasonal et ranged from 15 to 20 for tube depth of 0 5 m and up to 80 for tube depth of 2 0 m a higher proportion of swd over seasonal et was significantly affected by the tube depths i e the soil water availability the deep tubes provided more soil water for crop water use evapotranspiration of crops is closely related to the dynamic changes in soil water content vivoni et al 2008 purdy et al 2018 under the condition of limited irrigation soil water availability to crops plays a vital role in regulating evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 the seasonal et for deep tubes was greater than that for shallow tubes under similar irrigation amounts due to the difference in their soil water availability crop et is also affected by the atmospheric evaporation potential the higher seasonal et0 in 2020 21 growing season resulted in the higher seasonal et and higher soil water depletion for the 2 0 m tubes under the asw 100 treatments fig 3 when crops grow in environments with higher atmospheric evaporation potential the ability to fully utilize the available soil water would be enhanced fisher et al 2008 the seasonal et for the fi treatments exceeded the designed seasonal et for the two seasons due to the higher atmospheric evaporation potential especially for the season of 2020 2021 the et0 in 2019 2020 was 11 4 higher and 29 0 higher in 2020 2021 than the long term average value fig 2 the seasonal et of the increased crop water use for fi was from the stored soil water before sowing all the available soil water was consumed for tubes of 0 5 m 1 0 m and 1 5 m and 74 of the total available soil water for tubes 2 0 m in 2019 2020 under fi in 2020 2021 season the designated irrigation was 100 mm greater than that in 2019 2020 and due to the high atmospheric evaporation demand in this season the contribution of swd to et was still quite high under fi the consumption of the total available water was 85 8 for 0 5 m tube 93 for 1 0 m tube 79 for 1 5 m tube and 65 for 2 0 m tube under the fi those results indicated that soil water stored before sowing of winter wheat plays key roles in supplying the water use of the crop regardless of the irrigation management under the condition of this experiment studies have shown that sufficient pre sowing soil water storage could ensure good emergence of winter wheat and promote tillering resulting in the increased numbers of effective panicles per unit area and improved grain production lawes et al 2009 peake et al 2016 deep soil layers of 1 5 m and 2 0 m tubes could store a large amount of water and continuously supply the water needed for crops to achieve high production the designated 50 of asw use occurred for all tube depths but the designated 100 of asw use for tubes of 2 m depth was not achieved approximately 75 6 of the total asw in 2019 2020 and 82 5 of that in 2020 2021 was used for the 2 0 m tube under the designated 100 asw treatment there was asw remaining in the deep soil layers that was not fully withdrawn by the crop 3 3 correlation between root distribution and soil water use fig 4 shows the soil water contents along the soil profile at harvesting for the asw 100 treatments the results indicated that the soil water consumption for tubes 0 5 m and 1 0 m could be below the wilting point while for tubes of 1 5 and 2 0 m the soil water use below the 1 m soil profile was incomplete thus there was still available soil water that was not fully utilized at harvest for the 1 5 and 2 0 m tubes for both seasons the lower root length density rld in the deep soil layers was the limiting factor for the full use of asw zhang et al 2004 2009 white 2015 zhang et al 2020 the rld among the different treatments in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons is shown in fig 5 the results of root distribution indicated that for the shallow tubes of 0 5 and 1 0 m under all irrigation treatments rld was greater than 0 8 cm cm 3 although there was a declining trend from top downward all irrigation treatments showed an increase in rld at the bottom layer indicating that the tube depth of 0 5 and 1 0 m restricted root growth and when roots met the bottom root proliferation occurred which increased the rld at the bottom of the tubes for the 1 5 and 2 0 m depth tubes rld decreased with the increase in soil depth and rld was lower than 0 8 cm cm 3 below that of the 1 m soil profile the rld below 1 m for the asw 100 and asw 50 treatments was higher than that for the fi treatments indicating that reduced irrigation promoted root growth when the available water in topsoil is insufficient abscisic acid inhibits the growth of lateral roots while crop auxin promotes root growth in deeper soil layers for winter wheat bardhan et al 2020 in many cases a large amount of subsoil water is left after harvest liu et al 2018 the soil water depletion in the topsoil layers may be below the wilting point due to the soil evaporation and the soil water content gradually increased with the increasing in soil depth and a decline in rld fig 4 and fig 5 this result was consistent with previous reports indicating that soil water use by crops is influenced by the root system when rld is the limiting factor iijima et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 insufficient soil water use is usually attributed to low root length density at deep soil layers gregory et al 1978 palta et al 2011 root length density is the most appropriate parameter to describe plant root water absorption as compared with other root characteristics carvalho and foulkes 2013 the effective rooting depth of winter wheat has attracted much attention white et al 2015 if the surface roots can obtain sufficient water root initiation will decrease exponentially with increasing soil depth gerwitz and page 1974 aziz et al 2017 palta and turner 2019 however when topsoil water was exhausted root growth in the subsoil is enhanced resulting in the improved utilization of soil water torreano and morris 1998 lv et al 2010 winter wheat has deep root characteristics that can penetrate down to a depth of 2 m and absorb deep soil water lilley and kirkegaard 2011 if rainfall and irrigation was limited then water stored in the deep soil profile would be the main water resource in the late growing season of a crop and therefore making full use of the deep soil water would be beneficial to improve grain production cui et al 2003 the results from this study indicated that 0 5 m and 1 0 m tubes restricted the root elongation of winter wheat without restrictions roots of winter wheat could reach 2 m depth but rld below 1 m decreased markedly with increasing soil depth and the less rld would restrict the full use of the available soil water in the deep soil layers 3 4 influences of seasonal et and allocation of et after anthesis on crop production and water productivity table 3 shows the yield and yield components of winter wheat under different treatments in both seasons different rooting depth created by the different depth of the tubes and different irrigation regimes resulted in large variations in seasonal et and grain production yield generally increased with the increase in tube depth and irrigation amount and the highest yield was achieved with the treatment of fi 2 0 m which also had the highest amount of seasonal et fig 3 the three yield components of spike numbers per area seed numbers per ear and seed weight were all significantly correlated with the irrigation amounts for the different tubes fig 6 shows that there was a positive linear correlation of seasonal et with grain yield but the different depths of the tubes resulted in different correlations grain yield was different among the four tube depths under the similar seasonal et with the lowest yield for the 0 5 m tube and the highest yield for the 2 0 m tube except for 2019 2020 where the 1 5 and 2 0 m tubes shared the same correlation the results indicated that the same seasonal water consumption for winter wheat could result in different grain yield related to the difference in maximum rooting depth a similar seasonal et resulting in different grain production among the four tube depths was related to the differences in the timing of water consumption using the correlation of canopy temperature with soil moisture developed at the same site at anthesis fig 7 the soil water content at anthesis was estimated for all treatments in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons previous study proved that crop canopy temperature can be used to estimate the soil water contents vogel et al 2019 luan et al 2021 the results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between soil moisture at different soil depths and crop canopy temperature suggesting that at anthesis of winter wheat canopy temperature can be used to estimate the soil water contents based on the correlations in fig 7 the average gravimetric soil water content for different tube depths was estimated at anthesis using the water balance equation eq 1 et before and after anthesis was calculated and fig 8 shows that the shallower the tube the lower the ratio of the et after anthesis on average 32 6 40 3 of seasonal et was used after anthesis for the 0 5 m tube treatments 33 3 46 5 for the 1 0 m tubes 41 1 56 1 for the 1 5 m tubes and 45 2 62 1 for the 2 0 m tubes for the two seasons a previous study indicated that post anthesis water use should be approximately 55 to achieve the maximum yield of winter wheat liang et al 2018 the treatments of 2 0 m tubes resulted in the optimized allocation of the water use before and after anthesis and the highest yield being obtained under similar seasonal et the high water consumption before anthesis for shallower rooting depth usually indicated high biomass production during the vegetative growth period and less water available during the reproductive stage would result in reduced biomass accumulation and low efficiency in dry matter allocation to the seed weight and therefore reduced the harvest index hi the average hi was 0 32 0 33 0 37 and 0 37 for tube depths of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 and they were 0 33 0 33 0 37 and 0 37 respectively in 2020 2021 table 3 a positive linear correlation was found between hi and the ratio of post anthesis water use to seasonal et fig 9 the deep rooting system of winter wheat in deep tubes contributed to the higher proportion of water use during the reproductive stage fig 8 and therefore to the higher hi under various water supply conditions biomass production should be efficiently translocated into grains to improve crop production asseng et al 2017 liang et al 2021 the results from this study indicated that deep roots could allow more water consumption during reproductive stages to increase hi and grain production under limited water supply under water deficit conditions it is important to regulate the proportion of soil water consumption between vegetative and reproductive growth to achieve high water productivity yang et al 2021 the decrease in available soil water storage leads to the aggravation of winter wheat drought after anthesis shortens the grain filling time and causes a reduction in endosperm dry matter accumulation abid et al 2016 increasing of hi was conducive to the increase in yield and water productivity reynolds et al 2011 rivera amado et al 2019 the average wpg was 1 23 1 48 1 79 and 1 74 kg m 3 for tube depths of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 under the three water treatments the values were 1 29 1 62 1 64 and 2 03 kg m 3 respectively in 2020 2021 table 3 regardless of the water supply the tube depth which determined the maximum rooting depth and significantly affected the wpg water productivity was improved with the increase in rooting depth 3 5 leaf photosynthetic rate and duration of greenness during grain filling the high soil water availability for the deep tubes during the reproductive stage resulted in higher leaf photosynthesis and longer lasting of the greenness of the flag leaves fig 10 shows the average leaf photosynthesis rate of flag leaves during grain filling in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons for different treatments the photosynthetic rate of the 2 0 m tubes was higher than that of the other depth tubes under the same irrigation treatment available soil water in shallow tubes was exhausted at the early growth stage of winter wheat fig 8 and could not meet the water consumption demand of crops during anthesis and grain filling stages resulting in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate for the asw 100 and asw 50 treatments other results also indicated that the leaf photosynthetic rate is positively correlated with the utilization of soil water by the root system lawlor and cornic 2002 kong et al 2013 photosynthesis is the main driving force affecting dry matter accumulation and organ formation determining the yield and yield components of cereal crops zlatev and lidon 2012 zhang et al 2009 reported that 60 80 of wheat grain yield came from the post anthesis products of leaf photosynthesis therefore water availability during the reproductive stages plays important roles in determining the final grain yield of winter wheat the photosynthesis rate of winter wheat flag leaves during anthesis was limited by both stomatal and nonstomatal factors the former is the decreasing in stomatal conductance and the amount of co2 entering mesophyll cells due to water deficit and the latter refers to the decrease in chlorophyll content which leads to a decrease in photochemical organ activity and accelerates the degradation of plant internal structure and storage substances hlav√°ƒçov√°a et al 2018 fig 11 shows the changes in chlorophyll content in flag leaves among different treatments at anthesis and grain filling for the two seasons similar flag leaf chlorophyll content existed among the different treatments at anthesis from anthesis to the middle of the grain filling the chlorophyll contents of flag leaves decreased significantly for the shallower tubes which caused a decrease in photosynthetic intensity and shortened greenness duration even under the fi the reduction in greenness of the flag leaves was more rapid for shallower tubes than for deep tubes indicating that both soil water conditions and root activities influenced above ground performance roots in deep soils usually occur later and their biological activities would be greater than roots in the topsoil layers in the later growing season to favor more rigorous metabolic activities zhang et al 2004 white et al 2010 irrigation played a significant role in maintaining the green holding time of flag leaves the chlorophyll content of the fi treatment at different tube depths was higher than that of the other irrigation treatments as an indicator of the dynamic change in canopy pigment density chlorophyll content has a good correlation with the photosynthetic capacity of plants feng et al 2008 many studies have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the chlorophyll content of crop leaves and the duration of photosynthetic activity maintenance the senescence of leaves with a higher content of chlorophyll was slow which ensures that they have a higher photosynthetic area giving the plant longer filling duration and higher water use efficiency during the reproductive stage of winter wheat spano et al 2003 vadez et al 2011 sade et al 2018 3 6 effects of rooting depth on root efficiency maintaining large and deep root systems would increase the cost of carbon assimilate allocation to non photosynthetic tissues there should be a balance of the costs and the benefits in regulating root growth which means that the benefit of an improvement in grain yield resulting from temporal and spatial optimization of crop water use should offset the biomass cost consumed by the proliferation of deep roots was the deep root economic the root shoot ratio among different treatments in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons was shown in fig 12 generally shallower tubes and less irrigation resulted in higher root shoot ratio for this study similar to the root system efficiency rse which was defined as the root quantity required for transpiration per unit leaf area van oosterom et al 2016 the root efficiency re was defined as grain production per unit root weight or root length requirement in this study the average re in term of grain production supported by unit root weight was 6 16 6 59 8 57 and 8 35 g g 1 for tube depths of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 under the three water treatments the values were 6 12 7 46 9 14 and 9 62 g g 1 respectively in 2020 2021 the average re in term of grain production supported by unit root length was 79 6 85 6 89 7 and 100 3 mg m 1 for the tube depths of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m respectively in 2019 2020 and the values were 71 3 91 4 103 9 and 107 5 mg m 1 respectively in 2020 2021 the results from this study indicated that with the increase in the maximum rooting depth the root requirements to support unit grain production were in a declining trend which would reduce the cost in roots in producing grains increasing rooting depth was an efficient regulation measure to increase the soil water availability to crops without negatively increasing metabolic input in root growth it has been proved that under drought stress the greater the root weight and root length density in deep soil are the higher the soil water availability after anthesis and the higher the yield li et al 2021 an increasing of the root length density in topsoil will increase the competition among roots increase the level of abscisic acid and reduce stomatal conductance and photosynthesis all of which would negatively impact on grain production q fang et al 2017 y fang et al 2017 under the conditions of shallower rooting depth insufficient water supply might lead to excessive root proliferation without increasing the amount of soil water that crops could uptake the benefits brought by root proliferation to soil water use might not offset the biomass cost which might reduce the root efficiency under the conditions of deep rooting depth the increase in root growth in deep soil layers would increase the soil water availability and a small increase in crop water use would benefit a lot for grain production the cost in root growth would be compensated by the improved grain production to achieve a higher re therefore the practice of improving grain yield and water productivity needs to be combined to create appropriate root characteristics lilley and kirkegaard 2011 4 conclusions balancing root growth and soil water use without increasing the cost in root growth is a challenge to achieve high yield and water productivity under limited water supply the yield of winter wheat was affected by available water that could be used during the growing season as well as how the available water was allocated during the growing season the rooting depth of the crop significantly affected the soil water availability to crops as well as the timing of the soil availability to crops which significantly affected grain production and water productivity the results from this study indicated that deep soil profiles without limitations to root growth benefited both crop production and water productivity due to the regulation of the root system in terms of soil water availability and the differential allocation of water use during the vegetative and reproductive stages under various water supply conditions deep root growth did not necessarily increase the input in root growth and the root efficiency in terms of grain production per unit root was increased under deep root growth situations because shallow root system often induces redundant root growth in topsoil which would not increase soil water and nutrient availability to crops therefore soil profiles with unlimited root growth would benefit crop production regardless of the water supply conditions therefore soil management practices to favor deep crop root growth should be adopted declaration of competing interest the authors

9487,drought and water stress negatively affect many human activities with agriculture playing a crucial role in ensuring food security the drought vulnerability assessment of agricultural systems has been widely investigated in the past and the relationship between drought hazard and losses has been traditionally expressed through vulnerability curves this study develops maize drought vulnerability curves tailored to the context of the po river basin northern italy which is the largest italian agricultural area and accounts for 35 of national crop production the curves express the relationship between crop water stress and maize yield losses four crop growth stages are considered establishment vegetative flowering and yield formation since the sensitivity of maize to water stress is strictly related with the plant growth stage in addition the influence of soil texture on the maize response to water stress is investigated the agricultural production system simulator apsim is used to simulate the crop yield and the water stress apsim is calibrated on observed yield and the model skill in reproducing maize yield is satisfactorily verified pearson correlation coefficient equals to 0 87 flowering is the most sensitive stage to water deficit independently from the soil texture while the yield formation phase is most sensitive to water stress than the vegetative in the case of loam soils the achieved results suggest the importance of the use of appropriate irrigation strategies water should be provided to maize in case of a water stress during the flowering phase to avoid irreparable yield losses keywords vulnerability curves maize water stress po river basin 1 introduction impacts from recent climate related hazards have revealed the substantial vulnerability of many human systems to floods and droughts cesarini et al 2021 lu et al 2021 von christierson et al 2012 drought affects a wide range of human systems and economic activities such as power generation tourism and obviously agriculture the agricultural sector is particularly exposed to precipitation shortages high temperatures and insufficient soil moisture which lead to yield losses and crop failure monteleone et al 2020 the food and agriculture organization estimated that worldwide 83 of all documented drought caused economic losses were absorbed by agriculture with a price tag of 29 billion in developing countries andagricultureorganization 2012 andagricultureorganization 2017 andagricultureorganization 2017 the assessment of drought vulnerability of the agricultural sector has been widely investigated in the past already twenty years ago wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 proposed a framework to derive an agricultural drought vulnerability map through developing a numerical weighting scheme to evaluate the drought potential of various biophysical and social factors understanding the response of crops to droughts and water deficit is of key importance to estimate the effects of future droughts on agricultural production various studies explored the response of crops to drought yang et al 2020 evaluated the response of winter wheat to water deficit in the north china plain kamara et al 2003 investigated the response of different maize hybrids to water stress in sudan korres et al 2017 reviewed drought impacts on rice production and proposed mitigation strategies to deal with the increase in drought frequency that is expected in a climate change context traditionally the relationship between drought hazard and losses is expressed through vulnerability functions papathoma k√∂hle 2016 sometimes called drought damage functions these functions are continuous curves relating the drought intensity expressed through a drought index or indicator and the negative effects of the drought bachmair et al 2017 the development of drought vulnerability curves is challenging due to the limited availability of drought damage data bachmair et al 2016 however the attention on developing these functions for the agricultural sector has increased over the last years crop specific drought vulnerability functions have been proposed in various studies steduto et al 2012 proposed linear functions that relate crop yield with the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration during various growing stages which depend on the crop the methodology was then implemented in the aquacrop crop model which is the fao s crop water productivity simulation model food and agriculture organization 2017 the major limitation of the linear functions described by steduto et al 2012 and used by the aquacrop model lies in the fact they are not tailored to a specific geographical context the crop response to water varies according to the climatic features of the considered area the soil texture and the crop seasonality besides the abovementioned fao study further studies implemented crop drought vulnerability functions in specific national or regional contexts table 1 in addition due to the scarcity of yield data many of the cited studies use crop models to evaluate the relationship between weather and soil variables and crop yield bennett and harms 2011 applied the methodology described in allen et al 1988 to derive linear relationships between crop yield and evapotranspiration for the crops grown in southern alberta australia jia et al 2012 applied the epic environmental policy integrated climate crop model to simulate the physical vulnerability curve of a typical maize variety traditionally planted in china jayanthi et al 2014 applied a probabilistic approach to evaluate agricultural drought risk to maize southern africa and millet western sahel using observed yield data retrieved at country level and satellite observations to evaluate drought hazard intensity yin et al 2014 proposed the gepic v r model to construct vulnerability curves through setting irrigation scenarios the epic model is used to evaluate the crop response to environmental parameters the proposed vulnerability curves show the relationship between a drought hazard index dhi and yield loss for many world zones zhang et al 2015a yin et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015b mapped the drought risk of wheat maize and rice respectively at global level applying the methodology described in yin et al 2014 and provided vulnerability functions for different zones around the globe naumann et al 2015 evaluated the relationship between cereal yields and various drought indexes standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and reconnaissance drought index rdi aggregated at 3 6 and 12 months in many european countries the functions proposed in the study have different shapes which can be explained by each country s specific drought vulnerability or adaptive capacity guo et al 2016 shows a new method based on vulnerability surfaces to assess vulnerability quantitatively and continuously global maize drought risk was estimated based on these surfaces kamali et al 2018 developed a physical crop drought vulnerability index through linking the drought exposure index dei with the crop sensitivity index csi in sub saharan africa wang et al 2019 used a two dimensional normal information diffusion method to construct the vulnerability relationship between meteorological drought degree mdd and relative meteorological yield to obtain the probability distribution curve of mdd and relative meteorological yield in the eastern part of northwest china more recently su et al 2021 used precipitation fluctuations and the coefficient of variation cv of yield as indicators to construct a vulnerability curve for the cv of yield and precipitation fluctuations in the context of the north eastern usa wu et al 2021 investigated the vulnerability curve feature extraction and spatial difference analysis method in europe and took into consideration the european winter wheat again epic was the selected crop model finally zhu et al 2021 applied the aquacrop model to simulate the water stress of maize in china under different irrigation scenarios and the corresponding production this study is highly interesting since it evaluates the effect of water stress occurring at various growth stages on the final crop production as clearly shown by steduto et al 2012 the time of a drought during crop growth plays a significant role in yield reduction in fact some stages such as flowering are more sensitive to water stress and drought events occurring at that time can result in relevant yield losses in addition soil texture plays a relevant influence on crop response to water stress a proper identification of soil features is then a fundamental issue commonly soil type classification relies on the relative fractions of soil particles of different sizes to establish soil textural class boundaries soil science division staff 2017 the classification is convenient because grain size distribution can be measured relatively easily and can be estimated quickly and accurately in the field soil texture classification is traditionally used within agricultural geotechnical hydrological and other related disciplines from the 20s davis and bennett 1927 the key issue of proper soil textures representation has been approached in different ways in hydrological modelling characterizing soils with parameters to be calibrated borz√¨ et al 2019 croke et al 2002 jakeman and hornberger 1993 ivkoviƒá 2006 werner et al 2006 or in absence of data information assimilating with catchments with similar characteristics bl√∂schl et al 2013 viglione et al 2013 or with the usage of big scale distributed land surface parameter dataset schaperow et al 2021 groenendyk et al 2015 recently focused on the use of soil texture as a proxy for soil hydraulic properties this has become increasingly common with the growth in coverage and widespread use of global circulation models which require spatially distributed soil properties over large areas saxton et al 1986 webb et al 1993 wilson and henderson sellers 1985 specifically soil maps have been widely used to identify boundaries where hydraulic properties can be assumed to be constant borz√¨ and bonaccorso 2021 borz√¨ et al 2020 shaban et al 2006 storck et al 1998 and to provide guidance for parametrization of numerical models this paper aims at developing crop specific drought vulnerability curves for maize in the context of the po river basin northern italy in line with the research of zhu et al 2021 the study assesses maize response to water during various crop growth stages to identify the critical periods during which lack of water can have severe impacts in yield losses the agricultural production system simulator apsim crop model simulates the yield apsim with respect to aquacrop has been specifically designed to provide accurate predictions of crop production in relation to climate soil and management factor while addressing the long term resource management issues apsim has been preferred to aquacrop because the latter is well suited for areas where water is a key limiting factor in crop production which at present is not the case in the context of the po river basin the analyses are conducted at specific stage scale to identify which growth stage is more sensitive to water crises in terms of yield reduction and related water stress this approach has been chosen in the perspective of practical applications of this study to support water managers and farmers to a proper and more sustainable resources management during drought in addition the influence of soil texture on the crop response to water stress is evaluated this last aspect has never been considered in the previous studies on crop specific drought vulnerability curves and represents the most innovative feature of the present work in fact soil texture plays an important role determining the available crop water and therefore has a critical influence on the final yield shaxson and barber 2003 finally a vulnerability matrix is proposed to classify the crop vulnerability according to the soil texture during the considered crop growth stages the matrix can be useful to explore the effects of future droughts on maize yield in the various provinces of the po valley 2 case study the po basin is located in northern italy and develops around the po river which is the longest river in italy and flows eastward across northern italy starting from the cottian alps fig 1a the basin has an extension of about 74 000 km 2 of which about 71 000 km 2 across the italian territory the basin covers seven regions in italy piemonte valle d aosta lombardia veneto liguria emilia romagna and the trento autonomous province and has also small areas located in switzerland and france that have not been considered in the present study the basin plays a key role in the economy of italy it produces 40 of national gdp and consumes 48 of the national produced energy around 16 million of people live inside the basin the po valley is the largest agricultural area in italy and accounts for 35 of italian agricultural production the main crops grown in the region are cereals covering about 85 of the irrigated agricultural area maize rice and wheat and arboreal crops fruit orchards and horticulture musolino et al 2018 the basin is characterized by the presence of various climatic zones beck et al 2018 the main one is temperate and characterized by the absence of a dry season and a hot summer part of the basin is located on the alps and has therefore a cold climate with no dry season and a warm summer or a polar climate the basin has experienced multiple droughts since 1983 as reported by baronetti et al 2020 who evaluated the severity and duration of the various drought episodes using both spi and spei the long and severe drought from 2003 to 2008 caused relevant impacts to the agricultural sector the total economic impact of the 2005 2007 drought was estimated to be around 1 850 m musolino et al 2017 climate change projections over the italian peninsula from the prudence regional experiments palatella et al 2010 showed that the frequency and the severity of droughts in northern italy will increase in the next century due to a decrease in precipitation during critical crop growing seasons spring and summer in addition the analysis done by crespi et al 2020 showed a significant drying tendencies in both spi and spei over shorter time windows 20 30 years starting in 1980 and in 1970 for spring and summer respectively the estimation of drought impacts on agriculture is fundamental to foresee the effects that future droughts will have on the sector which plays a crucial part in the economy of the area the main crops produced in the po valley are cereals mainly maize rice and winter wheat together with orchards and vineyards the national census istat italian national institute of statistics reports data on crop production and harvested area over the period from 2006 to 2020 for each province italian national institute of statistics 2021 details on maize harvested area and yield for the ten provinces shown in fig 1b are reported in fig 1c and d respectively 3 methodology in the present study the development of maize drought vulnerability curves specific for the po river basin context is carried out following the methodological framework shown in fig 2 at first the areas suitable for agriculture in the po valley are extracted from a land use dataset then meteorological parameters and soil texture of the agricultural areas are derived for each of the ten considered provinces described in section 2 crop management practices traditionally employed in the po valley are also identified all the three inputs are used to calibrate the apsim crop model the evaluation of the model ability in reproducing observed yield over each province is then assessed apsim is calibrated over the period 2006 2011 and validated over the 2012 2020 period once that the model skill in reproducing the observed yield is verified apsim is used to simulate 1 a reference yield i e the crop yield in normal conditions at a given location jayanthi et al 2014 in each specific crop growth stage 2 a reduced yield i e the crop

agriculture organization 2012 1 establishment is the period immediately after sowing 2 the vegetative phase is the stage in which the crop develops 3 flowering includes the flag leaf stage and 4 yield formation is the final stage in which the maize grain fill the following sections provide details about the various steps described in the flowchart 3 1 extraction of agricultural areas agricultural areas in the po river basin are identified using the 2018 corine land cover produced in the framework of the copernicus land monitoring services european environment agency eea 2018 corine land cover consists of an inventory of land cover in 44 classes the map has a 100x100 m spatial resolution agricultural areas belonging to the classes non irrigated arable land permanently irrigated land annual crops associated with permanent crops and complex cultivation patterns are extracted from the dataset fig 1b only the selected areas are considered suitable for maize and wheat cultivation 3 2 meteorological parameters daily weather parameters are retrieved from the ensembles daily gridded observational dataset e obs cornes et al 2018 e obs has a 10 km grid resolution and provides daily values for multiple weather variables from 1951 to 2020 the dataset is based on the interpolation of measurements directly retrieved from meteorological stations the stations coverage over the case study area the po river basin is accurate for both rainfall and temperature cornes et al 2018 weather parameters rainfall maximum and minimum daily temperature and radiation are extracted for the 2006 2020 period and aggregated at province level over the agricultural areas retrieved from the corine land cover 3 3 soil texture soil texture of the agricultural areas is derived from the international soil reference and information centre isric soil dataset described in hengl et al 2017 soil textures are classified according to the united stated department of agriculture usda methodology soil science division staff 2017 based on the percentage of clay silt and sand seven soil layers are considered in the isric dataset 1 layer 1 0 5 cm 2 layer 2 6 15 cm 3 layer 3 16 30 cm 4 layer 4 31 60 cm

texture of the agricultural areas of the ten considered provinces four provinces have a loam soil over the entire profile three a clay loam soil over the entire profile and three have a loam over a clay loam soil 3 4 crop management practices crop management practices in place in the po valley are retrieved from a guideline for farmers released by the lombardy region regione lombardia 2020a 2020b according to that reference maize is sown in april and harvested between august and september the recommended sowing density row spacing sowing depth and amount of nitrogen fertilizers are summarized in table 2 and used as set up parameters for model simulations 3 5 yield modelling apsim is used to simulate crop yield both in ideal conditions in which the crop has full water availability and during periods of water stress apsim described in keating et al 2003 has been developed by the agricultural production systems research unit a collaborative group made up from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and queensland state government agencies the crop model has been implemented specifically to provide accurate predictions of crop production in relation to climate various parameters are required to initialize a simulation 1 daily weather data 2 soil texture 3 crop type 4 crop management practices daily weather data are obtained from the e obs dataset that has a 10x10 km grid resolution weather data have been aggregated at province level average values over agricultural areas of each province have been used to run the simulations soil texture was retrieved from the isric dataset and is homogeneous over agricultural areas at province scale three generic soils have been selected in apsim to represent the specific soil texture the choice is based on the information about soil parameters such as bulk density field capacity and soil water content reported in costantini et al 2013 a clay loam generic n 500 soil has been selected as representative of the clay loam soil texture a generic loam over clay n 375 represents the soil texture loam over clay loam and a generic loam n 659 soil represents the loam soil texture crop management practices are retrieved from the lombardy region guidelines and described in table 2 the outputs provided by the apsim are 1 crop yield y kg km 2 2 crop water supply w s mm 3 crop water demand w d mm based on the input daily weather data rainfall maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation apsim calculates effective precipitation purging evapotranspiration from rainfall the software applies the hargraves equation 1 e p 0 0022 r a Œ¥ t 0 5 t 1 where r a is the mean extra terrestrial radiation mm day which is a function of the latitude Œ¥ t 0 5 is the difference between mean daily maximum temperature and mean daily minimum temperature for the day of interest in c t is the mean air temperature in c crop yield y is computed according to a crop specific methodology that takes into account the characteristics of the considered plants this approach was first proposed in monteith and greenwood 1986 the yield y is expressed as a function of various parameters 2 y f d p a r f s c r o p p a r a m e t e r s where d is the daylength par is the photosyntetically active radiation f s is the stress factor and the crop specific parameters such as the sowing date the length of its cycle etc apsim 2018 crop water supply of the layer i w s i is computed according to the soilwat2 module apsim 2018 as 3 w s i k l i s w i l l i if i i 1 d r i d s

extraction values must be defined for each combination of crop species and soil type sw and ll depend on the soil type while d r depend on the crop type crop water demand w d is computed according to tanner and sinclair 2015 5 w d Œ¥ q r r t e where r is the respiration rate and is equal to 0 in the used version of apsim zheng et al 2015 q r is the radiation limited dry biomass accumulation and te is the transpiration efficiency q r is derived as follows 6 Œ¥ q r i n t r a d r u e f d f s f c where int rad is the intercepted radiation rue is the radiation use efficiency f d is the diffuse

used to set f t 0 when t 0 or t 35 and f t 1 when 10 t 25 8 f t h t t m a x t m i n 2 the nitrogen stress factor is the difference between leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf minimum and critical nitrogen concentration 9 f n r n c n c n m i n c n c r i t c n m i n where r n is a multiplier for nitrogen deficit effect on phenology and is equal to 1 5 zheng et al 2015 and c n is the leaf nitrogen concentration c n min is the minimum leaf nitrogen concentration and c n crit is the critical leaf nitrogen concentration zheng et al 2015 the carbon factor f c is calculated by a function of

1999 f te is the coefficient of transpiration efficiency that varies in relation with the growth stage and vpd is the vapour pressure deficit derived as in tanner and sinclair 2015 finally the water uptake w u of the crop is the minimum between the soil water supply w s and the crop water demand w d 13 w u m i n w s w d the crop water deficit f s is given by 14 f s w u w d the value ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 means the crop is not experiencing a water deficit 3 6 derivation of the vulnerability curves vulnerability curves for each growth stage are derived according to the following procedure at first the reference yield for each season s y ref s i e the yield in the absence of water stress during all the crop growth stages is computed then the reduced yield for the same season y red s is derived introducing a water stress in a single growth stage g by progressively reducing the precipitation amount during the growth stage g y red s g is the reduced yield evaluated at the end of the growing season hit by a water stress during the growth stage g the yield loss y l for the season s hit by a water stress during and the growth stage g is therefore 15 y l 1 y r e d s g y r e f s to derive vulnerability curves in which a reduction of 0 in the yield corresponds to the absence of water deficit a new parameter the water deficit def w is computed as 16 d e f w 1 f s the curves obtained for the considered crops and the analysed growing stages are derived by fitting the most appropriate functions to the model output data fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration at first apsim is calibrated to evaluate the model s ability in reproducing the observed yield in the po river basin area observed yield are retrieved from the italian national institute of statistics istat over the period from 2006 to 2020 data are aggregated at province level the period from 2006 to 2013 is used to calibrate the model while the years from 2014 to 2020 are used for the validation the use of observed yield data for the crop model calibration process is a common practice as underlined by seidel et al 2018 who reports that nearly 90 of crop model users rely on observed yield to calibrate their model fig 4 reports the results of crop model calibration a and validation b the r 2 over all the considered provinces for both the calibration and the validation stage is equal to 0 75 when single provinces are considered the r 2 for the calibration stage ranges from 0 64 pordenone to 0 98 cremona the r 2 for the validation stage from 0 66 pordenone to 0 97 ferrara the discrepancies between the observed and the reported yield for the pordenone province can be attribute to issues in the reporting of the observed production and harvested area by the italian institute of statistics both variables were estimated by expert knowledge during the years from 2009 to 2012 and 2018 2019 however the results of both model calibration and validation show that the apsim model can reproduce the observed yield in the po river basin area and therefore the model can be used to design maize drought vulnerability curves 4 2 vulnerability curves for maize based on the water deficit and the associated yield losses computed for the three selected growing stages e g vegetative flowering and yield formation drought vulnerability curves for maize were developed as described in section 3 6 the obtained data points have been fitted to the most appropriate functions in the case of the vegetative and flowering stages the michaelis menten equation eq 17 has been used 17 y g x h x while in the case of the yield formation stage the asymmetric logistic has been preferred eq 18 18 y c d c 1 e e b x a fig 5 shows the curves derived from the water deficit and yield losses for three provinces one for each soil type specifically rovigo loam over clay loam soil ferrara clay loam soil and pavia loam soil have been selected curves for the vegetative stage the flowering and the yield formation phases have been retrieved the data points exhibit a good fit with the selected functions as demonstrated by the high r 2 values which are significant at 0 01 table 3 results show that maize is more sensitive to water deficit during the flowering stage as already reported by steduto et al 2012 and underlined by zhu et al 2021 the curves for the vegetative stages show similar behavior in all three provinces the sensitivity to water deficit of the vegetative and yield formation phase is similar in rovigo fig 4a and ferrara fig 4b while in pavia fig 4c the vegetative phase is more sensitive to water deficit than the yield formation phase this can be related to the fact that the grain yield is already formed during the yield formation phase and even high water deficits do not affect the crop yield excessively the results here obtained can be compared with the ones reported in zhu et al 2021 even if the study considers four growth stages which do not overlap exactly with the ones of this work and evaluates the yield losses with respect to the dhi which is an average of the crop water stress indicator cwsi over the growth stage cwsi is computed as the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration through the aquacrop model the four stages reported in zhu et al 2021 are stage 1 corresponding to the period from sowing to the seventh leaf stage stage 2 going from the seventh leaf stage to the tasselling stage stage 3 from the tasselling to the milk stage and stage 4 from the milk stage to the physiological maturity of the crop the four growth stages considered in the present study are establishment which goes from sowing to the plant full emergence from the soil vegetative which lasts until the first flowers start to appear flowering which includes tassel and silking and yield formation which includes grain filling and ripening in the case of the po river basin the plant never experience a water stress during the first growth stage establishment or stage 1 while low yield reduction are reported in zhu et al 2021 during stage 2 vegetative yield losses in zhu et al 2021 reach 60 while in this study are around 40 while in stage 3 flowering maximum yield reduction in this study is high around 85 with respect to zhu et al 2021 in which yield losses amount at about 60 yield losses in the final stage are again higher in this study between 40 and 60 than in zhu et al 2021 where in the final growth stage no losses are reported for every value of the dhi the differences between the two studies can be attributed to various reasons at first as already described the four stages do not overlap exactly secondly the climate and the rainfall patterns of china are different from the ones of the po river basin finally as underlined by zhu et al 2021 in the chinese case study the amount of sunlight and quality of soil are poor for maize growing the soil texture influences the response of the crop to the water deficit in the flowering and the yield formation phases in the flowering stage for low water deficit the provinces with a loam soil show lower yield reduction than others while for high water deficit the yield reduction is lower in provinces with a clay loam soil texture a different situation happens during the yield formation phase in this case for all the water deficits the provinces with a loam over clay loam soil show a higher yield reduction than the others this behaviour can be explained by the properties of the different soil textures to this end groenendyk et al 2015 examined whether soil textural classifications could be useful proxies for hydraulic properties over a range of hydrologic conditions and developed an alternative approach to soil classification that can improve both quantitative analyses and visual interpretations of landscape function fig 5a illustrates the usda soil classification whereas fig 5b shows the hydraulic conductivity for different soil textures retrieved from simulations considering only the uppermost 30 cm of soil groenendyk et al 2015 the two panels show differences in hydraulic conductivity between loam and clay loam soils the loam soil type has a greater hydraulic conductivity than the clay loam one groenendyk et al 2015 work shows also that soils with a greater value in hydraulic conductivity have also a greater capacity in infiltration and drainage oppositely soils with a lower value of hydraulic conductivity have the capability to retain water at a microscopic scale thus guaranteeing water availability for plants roots for longer periods of time than other kind of soils during drought or water stress periods this feature results in a longer water availability at the root zone meaning that these kinds of soils have the ability to support plants resilience to prolonged water stress in our case this finding can explain why for higher values of water deficits clay loam soils show less yield reduction than the other ones especially in the flowering growth stage during the vegetative stage the soil texture does not play a significant influence on the response of maize to water stress probably because this growth stage shows less sensitivity to water stress and consequently the influence of soil texture is less evident as shown in fig 6 the maximum yield loss that can be obtained during the vegetative stage ranges from 0 26 brescia to 0 42 modena flowering remains the most critical stage in all the provinces with the maximum yield losses ranging from 0 67 modena to 0 94 cremona the yield formation phase shows the highest variability maximum yield losses range from 0 35 brescia to 0 54 alessandria fig 7 shows a vulnerability matrix that summarizes the main results when the maximum water stress water deficit equal to 1 is considered yield losses are computed through eq 17 for the vegetative and flowering phase and eq 18 for the yield formation phase using the constant values reported in table a 1 yield losses in the vulnerability matrix are expressed as percentage and the values represents the average yield loss over provinces with the same soil texture the establishment phase never went under water stress in the po river basin in the considered simulations therefore no yield losses are assigned to this phase during the establishment maize needs small amount of water that can be easily provided by all the three different considered soil types which as already mentioned have the capability to retain water due to their characteristic values of hydraulic conductivity flowering is the most sensitive stage to water deficit and high yield losses are reported in case of water stress during this period particularly in case of loam and loam over clay loam soils the vegetative stage is not highly influenced by the soil texture while the yield formation phase is less sensitive to water deficit in case of a loam soil texture the proposed classification could be used to support water management strategies to improve cooperation among stakeholders which is essential to ensure water and food security in the area lu et al 2021 5 conclusions stage specific drought vulnerability curves for maise tailored to the po river basin context have been developed establishment vegetative flowering and yield formation stages have been considered the curves have been developed for ten provinces with different soil texture apsim was used to compute the reference yield the yield in the absence of any water stress during all the crop growth stages the yield losses due to water stress and the water deficit associated with periods of drought happening during each of the crop growth stages the results of apsim calibration and validation were satisfactory the water deficit and the associated yield losses have been used to construct the vulnerability curves for the four growth stages the establishment phase never went under waters stress in the climatic conditions of the po valley because the amount of the water required by the crop in this phase is small and can be easily provided by the soil overall flowering has turned out to be the most sensitive stage to water deficit in all the provinces in agreement with other studies while the yield formation and the vegetative stage were less sensitive to the water stress the soil texture plays an influence on the response of the crop to the water deficit mainly in the flowering and the yield formation phases during flowering for high water deficits the yield reduction is lower in the provinces with a clay loam soil texture with respect to the others while for low water deficits the provinces with a loam soil show lower yield losses in the yield formation phase the provinces with a loam soil show a lower yield reduction than the provinces with a loam over clay loam soil for all the water deficits during the vegetative phase the soil texture did not play a significant role in determining the yield reduction associated with high water deficits the achieved results could foster a sustainable use of water resources in agriculture by suggesting the most appropriate time to rely on irrigation funding statement this work was

9487,drought and water stress negatively affect many human activities with agriculture playing a crucial role in ensuring food security the drought vulnerability assessment of agricultural systems has been widely investigated in the past and the relationship between drought hazard and losses has been traditionally expressed through vulnerability curves this study develops maize drought vulnerability curves tailored to the context of the po river basin northern italy which is the largest italian agricultural area and accounts for 35 of national crop production the curves express the relationship between crop water stress and maize yield losses four crop growth stages are considered establishment vegetative flowering and yield formation since the sensitivity of maize to water stress is strictly related with the plant growth stage in addition the influence of soil texture on the maize response to water stress is investigated the agricultural production system simulator apsim is used to simulate the crop yield and the water stress apsim is calibrated on observed yield and the model skill in reproducing maize yield is satisfactorily verified pearson correlation coefficient equals to 0 87 flowering is the most sensitive stage to water deficit independently from the soil texture while the yield formation phase is most sensitive to water stress than the vegetative in the case of loam soils the achieved results suggest the importance of the use of appropriate irrigation strategies water should be provided to maize in case of a water stress during the flowering phase to avoid irreparable yield losses keywords vulnerability curves maize water stress po river basin 1 introduction impacts from recent climate related hazards have revealed the substantial vulnerability of many human systems to floods and droughts cesarini et al 2021 lu et al 2021 von christierson et al 2012 drought affects a wide range of human systems and economic activities such as power generation tourism and obviously agriculture the agricultural sector is particularly exposed to precipitation shortages high temperatures and insufficient soil moisture which lead to yield losses and crop failure monteleone et al 2020 the food and agriculture organization estimated that worldwide 83 of all documented drought caused economic losses were absorbed by agriculture with a price tag of 29 billion in developing countries andagricultureorganization 2012 andagricultureorganization 2017 andagricultureorganization 2017 the assessment of drought vulnerability of the agricultural sector has been widely investigated in the past already twenty years ago wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 proposed a framework to derive an agricultural drought vulnerability map through developing a numerical weighting scheme to evaluate the drought potential of various biophysical and social factors understanding the response of crops to droughts and water deficit is of key importance to estimate the effects of future droughts on agricultural production various studies explored the response of crops to drought yang et al 2020 evaluated the response of winter wheat to water deficit in the north china plain kamara et al 2003 investigated the response of different maize hybrids to water stress in sudan korres et al 2017 reviewed drought impacts on rice production and proposed mitigation strategies to deal with the increase in drought frequency that is expected in a climate change context traditionally the relationship between drought hazard and losses is expressed through vulnerability functions papathoma k√∂hle 2016 sometimes called drought damage functions these functions are continuous curves relating the drought intensity expressed through a drought index or indicator and the negative effects of the drought bachmair et al 2017 the development of drought vulnerability curves is challenging due to the limited availability of drought damage data bachmair et al 2016 however the attention on developing these functions for the agricultural sector has increased over the last years crop specific drought vulnerability functions have been proposed in various studies steduto et al 2012 proposed linear functions that relate crop yield with the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration during various growing stages which depend on the crop the methodology was then implemented in the aquacrop crop model which is the fao s crop water productivity simulation model food and agriculture organization 2017 the major limitation of the linear functions described by steduto et al 2012 and used by the aquacrop model lies in the fact they are not tailored to a specific geographical context the crop response to water varies according to the climatic features of the considered area the soil texture and the crop seasonality besides the abovementioned fao study further studies implemented crop drought vulnerability functions in specific national or regional contexts table 1 in addition due to the scarcity of yield data many of the cited studies use crop models to evaluate the relationship between weather and soil variables and crop yield bennett and harms 2011 applied the methodology described in allen et al 1988 to derive linear relationships between crop yield and evapotranspiration for the crops grown in southern alberta australia jia et al 2012 applied the epic environmental policy integrated climate crop model to simulate the physical vulnerability curve of a typical maize variety traditionally planted in china jayanthi et al 2014 applied a probabilistic approach to evaluate agricultural drought risk to maize southern africa and millet western sahel using observed yield data retrieved at country level and satellite observations to evaluate drought hazard intensity yin et al 2014 proposed the gepic v r model to construct vulnerability curves through setting irrigation scenarios the epic model is used to evaluate the crop response to environmental parameters the proposed vulnerability curves show the relationship between a drought hazard index dhi and yield loss for many world zones zhang et al 2015a yin et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015b mapped the drought risk of wheat maize and rice respectively at global level applying the methodology described in yin et al 2014 and provided vulnerability functions for different zones around the globe naumann et al 2015 evaluated the relationship between cereal yields and various drought indexes standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and reconnaissance drought index rdi aggregated at 3 6 and 12 months in many european countries the functions proposed in the study have different shapes which can be explained by each country s specific drought vulnerability or adaptive capacity guo et al 2016 shows a new method based on vulnerability surfaces to assess vulnerability quantitatively and continuously global maize drought risk was estimated based on these surfaces kamali et al 2018 developed a physical crop drought vulnerability index through linking the drought exposure index dei with the crop sensitivity index csi in sub saharan africa wang et al 2019 used a two dimensional normal information diffusion method to construct the vulnerability relationship between meteorological drought degree mdd and relative meteorological yield to obtain the probability distribution curve of mdd and relative meteorological yield in the eastern part of northwest china more recently su et al 2021 used precipitation fluctuations and the coefficient of variation cv of yield as indicators to construct a vulnerability curve for the cv of yield and precipitation fluctuations in the context of the north eastern usa wu et al 2021 investigated the vulnerability curve feature extraction and spatial difference analysis method in europe and took into consideration the european winter wheat again epic was the selected crop model finally zhu et al 2021 applied the aquacrop model to simulate the water stress of maize in china under different irrigation scenarios and the corresponding production this study is highly interesting since it evaluates the effect of water stress occurring at various growth stages on the final crop production as clearly shown by steduto et al 2012 the time of a drought during crop growth plays a significant role in yield reduction in fact some stages such as flowering are more sensitive to water stress and drought events occurring at that time can result in relevant yield losses in addition soil texture plays a relevant influence on crop response to water stress a proper identification of soil features is then a fundamental issue commonly soil type classification relies on the relative fractions of soil particles of different sizes to establish soil textural class boundaries soil science division staff 2017 the classification is convenient because grain size distribution can be measured relatively easily and can be estimated quickly and accurately in the field soil texture classification is traditionally used within agricultural geotechnical hydrological and other related disciplines from the 20s davis and bennett 1927 the key issue of proper soil textures representation has been approached in different ways in hydrological modelling characterizing soils with parameters to be calibrated borz√¨ et al 2019 croke et al 2002 jakeman and hornberger 1993 ivkoviƒá 2006 werner et al 2006 or in absence of data information assimilating with catchments with similar characteristics bl√∂schl et al 2013 viglione et al 2013 or with the usage of big scale distributed land surface parameter dataset schaperow et al 2021 groenendyk et al 2015 recently focused on the use of soil texture as a proxy for soil hydraulic properties this has become increasingly common with the growth in coverage and widespread use of global circulation models which require spatially distributed soil properties over large areas saxton et al 1986 webb et al 1993 wilson and henderson sellers 1985 specifically soil maps have been widely used to identify boundaries where hydraulic properties can be assumed to be constant borz√¨ and bonaccorso 2021 borz√¨ et al 2020 shaban et al 2006 storck et al 1998 and to provide guidance for parametrization of numerical models this paper aims at developing crop specific drought vulnerability curves for maize in the context of the po river basin northern italy in line with the research of zhu et al 2021 the study assesses maize response to water during various crop growth stages to identify the critical periods during which lack of water can have severe impacts in yield losses the agricultural production system simulator apsim crop model simulates the yield apsim with respect to aquacrop has been specifically designed to provide accurate predictions of crop production in relation to climate soil and management factor while addressing the long term resource management issues apsim has been preferred to aquacrop because the latter is well suited for areas where water is a key limiting factor in crop production which at present is not the case in the context of the po river basin the analyses are conducted at specific stage scale to identify which growth stage is more sensitive to water crises in terms of yield reduction and related water stress this approach has been chosen in the perspective of practical applications of this study to support water managers and farmers to a proper and more sustainable resources management during drought in addition the influence of soil texture on the crop response to water stress is evaluated this last aspect has never been considered in the previous studies on crop specific drought vulnerability curves and represents the most innovative feature of the present work in fact soil texture plays an important role determining the available crop water and therefore has a critical influence on the final yield shaxson and barber 2003 finally a vulnerability matrix is proposed to classify the crop vulnerability according to the soil texture during the considered crop growth stages the matrix can be useful to explore the effects of future droughts on maize yield in the various provinces of the po valley 2 case study the po basin is located in northern italy and develops around the po river which is the longest river in italy and flows eastward across northern italy starting from the cottian alps fig 1a the basin has an extension of about 74 000 km 2 of which about 71 000 km 2 across the italian territory the basin covers seven regions in italy piemonte valle d aosta lombardia veneto liguria emilia romagna and the trento autonomous province and has also small areas located in switzerland and france that have not been considered in the present study the basin plays a key role in the economy of italy it produces 40 of national gdp and consumes 48 of the national produced energy around 16 million of people live inside the basin the po valley is the largest agricultural area in italy and accounts for 35 of italian agricultural production the main crops grown in the region are cereals covering about 85 of the irrigated agricultural area maize rice and wheat and arboreal crops fruit orchards and horticulture musolino et al 2018 the basin is characterized by the presence of various climatic zones beck et al 2018 the main one is temperate and characterized by the absence of a dry season and a hot summer part of the basin is located on the alps and has therefore a cold climate with no dry season and a warm summer or a polar climate the basin has experienced multiple droughts since 1983 as reported by baronetti et al 2020 who evaluated the severity and duration of the various drought episodes using both spi and spei the long and severe drought from 2003 to 2008 caused relevant impacts to the agricultural sector the total economic impact of the 2005 2007 drought was estimated to be around 1 850 m musolino et al 2017 climate change projections over the italian peninsula from the prudence regional experiments palatella et al 2010 showed that the frequency and the severity of droughts in northern italy will increase in the next century due to a decrease in precipitation during critical crop growing seasons spring and summer in addition the analysis done by crespi et al 2020 showed a significant drying tendencies in both spi and spei over shorter time windows 20 30 years starting in 1980 and in 1970 for spring and summer respectively the estimation of drought impacts on agriculture is fundamental to foresee the effects that future droughts will have on the sector which plays a crucial part in the economy of the area the main crops produced in the po valley are cereals mainly maize rice and winter wheat together with orchards and vineyards the national census istat italian national institute of statistics reports data on crop production and harvested area over the period from 2006 to 2020 for each province italian national institute of statistics 2021 details on maize harvested area and yield for the ten provinces shown in fig 1b are reported in fig 1c and d respectively 3 methodology in the present study the development of maize drought vulnerability curves specific for the po river basin context is carried out following the methodological framework shown in fig 2 at first the areas suitable for agriculture in the po valley are extracted from a land use dataset then meteorological parameters and soil texture of the agricultural areas are derived for each of the ten considered provinces described in section 2 crop management practices traditionally employed in the po valley are also identified all the three inputs are used to calibrate the apsim crop model the evaluation of the model ability in reproducing observed yield over each province is then assessed apsim is calibrated over the period 2006 2011 and validated over the 2012 2020 period once that the model skill in reproducing the observed yield is verified apsim is used to simulate 1 a reference yield i e the crop yield in normal conditions at a given location jayanthi et al 2014 in each specific crop growth stage 2 a reduced yield i e the crop

agriculture organization 2012 1 establishment is the period immediately after sowing 2 the vegetative phase is the stage in which the crop develops 3 flowering includes the flag leaf stage and 4 yield formation is the final stage in which the maize grain fill the following sections provide details about the various steps described in the flowchart 3 1 extraction of agricultural areas agricultural areas in the po river basin are identified using the 2018 corine land cover produced in the framework of the copernicus land monitoring services european environment agency eea 2018 corine land cover consists of an inventory of land cover in 44 classes the map has a 100x100 m spatial resolution agricultural areas belonging to the classes non irrigated arable land permanently irrigated land annual crops associated with permanent crops and complex cultivation patterns are extracted from the dataset fig 1b only the selected areas are considered suitable for maize and wheat cultivation 3 2 meteorological parameters daily weather parameters are retrieved from the ensembles daily gridded observational dataset e obs cornes et al 2018 e obs has a 10 km grid resolution and provides daily values for multiple weather variables from 1951 to 2020 the dataset is based on the interpolation of measurements directly retrieved from meteorological stations the stations coverage over the case study area the po river basin is accurate for both rainfall and temperature cornes et al 2018 weather parameters rainfall maximum and minimum daily temperature and radiation are extracted for the 2006 2020 period and aggregated at province level over the agricultural areas retrieved from the corine land cover 3 3 soil texture soil texture of the agricultural areas is derived from the international soil reference and information centre isric soil dataset described in hengl et al 2017 soil textures are classified according to the united stated department of agriculture usda methodology soil science division staff 2017 based on the percentage of clay silt and sand seven soil layers are considered in the isric dataset 1 layer 1 0 5 cm 2 layer 2 6 15 cm 3 layer 3 16 30 cm 4 layer 4 31 60 cm

texture of the agricultural areas of the ten considered provinces four provinces have a loam soil over the entire profile three a clay loam soil over the entire profile and three have a loam over a clay loam soil 3 4 crop management practices crop management practices in place in the po valley are retrieved from a guideline for farmers released by the lombardy region regione lombardia 2020a 2020b according to that reference maize is sown in april and harvested between august and september the recommended sowing density row spacing sowing depth and amount of nitrogen fertilizers are summarized in table 2 and used as set up parameters for model simulations 3 5 yield modelling apsim is used to simulate crop yield both in ideal conditions in which the crop has full water availability and during periods of water stress apsim described in keating et al 2003 has been developed by the agricultural production systems research unit a collaborative group made up from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and queensland state government agencies the crop model has been implemented specifically to provide accurate predictions of crop production in relation to climate various parameters are required to initialize a simulation 1 daily weather data 2 soil texture 3 crop type 4 crop management practices daily weather data are obtained from the e obs dataset that has a 10x10 km grid resolution weather data have been aggregated at province level average values over agricultural areas of each province have been used to run the simulations soil texture was retrieved from the isric dataset and is homogeneous over agricultural areas at province scale three generic soils have been selected in apsim to represent the specific soil texture the choice is based on the information about soil parameters such as bulk density field capacity and soil water content reported in costantini et al 2013 a clay loam generic n 500 soil has been selected as representative of the clay loam soil texture a generic loam over clay n 375 represents the soil texture loam over clay loam and a generic loam n 659 soil represents the loam soil texture crop management practices are retrieved from the lombardy region guidelines and described in table 2 the outputs provided by the apsim are 1 crop yield y kg km 2 2 crop water supply w s mm 3 crop water demand w d mm based on the input daily weather data rainfall maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation apsim calculates effective precipitation purging evapotranspiration from rainfall the software applies the hargraves equation 1 e p 0 0022 r a Œ¥ t 0 5 t 1 where r a is the mean extra terrestrial radiation mm day which is a function of the latitude Œ¥ t 0 5 is the difference between mean daily maximum temperature and mean daily minimum temperature for the day of interest in c t is the mean air temperature in c crop yield y is computed according to a crop specific methodology that takes into account the characteristics of the considered plants this approach was first proposed in monteith and greenwood 1986 the yield y is expressed as a function of various parameters 2 y f d p a r f s c r o p p a r a m e t e r s where d is the daylength par is the photosyntetically active radiation f s is the stress factor and the crop specific parameters such

extraction values must be defined for each combination of crop species and soil type sw and ll depend on the soil type while d r depend on the crop type crop water demand w d is computed according to tanner and sinclair 2015 5 w d Œ¥ q r r t e where r is the respiration rate and is equal to 0 in the used version of apsim zheng et al 2015 q r is the radiation limited dry biomass accumulation and te is the transpiration efficiency q r is derived as follows 6 Œ¥ q r i n t r a d r u e f d f s f c where int rad is the intercepted radiation rue is the radiation use efficiency f d is the diffuse

used to set f t 0 when t 0 or t 35 and f t 1 when 10 t 25 8 f t h t t m a x t m i n 2 the nitrogen stress factor is the difference between leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf minimum and critical nitrogen concentration 9 f n r n c n c n m i n c n c r i t c n m i n where r n is a multiplier for nitrogen deficit effect on phenology and is equal to 1 5 zheng et al 2015 and c n is the leaf nitrogen concentration c n min is the minimum leaf nitrogen concentration and c n crit is the critical leaf nitrogen concentration zheng et al 2015 the carbon factor f c is calculated by a function of

1999 f te is the coefficient of transpiration efficiency that varies in relation with the growth stage and vpd is the vapour pressure deficit derived as in tanner and sinclair 2015 finally the water uptake w u of the crop is the minimum between the soil water supply w s and the crop water demand w d 13 w u m i n w s w d the crop water deficit f s is given by 14 f s w u w d the value ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 means the crop is not experiencing a water deficit 3 6 derivation of the vulnerability curves vulnerability curves for each growth stage are derived according to the following procedure at first the reference yield for each season s y ref s i e the yield in the absence of water stress during all the crop growth stages is computed then the reduced yield for the same season y red s is derived introducing a water stress in a single growth stage g by progressively reducing the precipitation amount during the growth stage g y red s g is the reduced yield evaluated at the end of the growing season hit by a water stress during the growth stage g the yield loss y l for the season s hit by a water stress during and the growth stage g is therefore 15 y l 1 y r e d s g y r e f s to derive vulnerability curves in which a reduction of 0 in the yield corresponds to the absence of water deficit a new parameter the water deficit def w is computed as 16 d e f w 1 f s the curves obtained for the considered crops and the analysed growing stages are derived by fitting the most appropriate functions to the model output data fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration at first apsim is calibrated to evaluate the model s ability in reproducing the observed yield in the po river basin area observed yield are retrieved from the italian national institute of statistics istat over the period from 2006 to 2020 data are aggregated at province level the period from 2006 to 2013 is used to calibrate the model while the years from 2014 to 2020 are used for the validation the use of observed yield data for the crop model calibration process is a common practice as underlined by seidel et al 2018 who reports that nearly 90 of crop model users rely on observed yield to calibrate their model fig 4 reports the results of crop model calibration a and validation b the r 2 over all the considered provinces for both the calibration and the validation stage is equal to 0 75 when single provinces are considered the r 2 for the calibration stage ranges from 0 64 pordenone to 0 98 cremona the r 2 for the validation stage from 0 66 pordenone to 0 97 ferrara the discrepancies between the observed and the reported yield for the pordenone province can be attribute to issues in the reporting of the observed production and harvested area by the italian institute of statistics both variables were estimated by expert knowledge during the years from 2009 to 2012 and 2018 2019 however the results of both model calibration and validation show that the apsim model can reproduce the observed yield in the po river basin area and therefore the model can be used to design maize drought vulnerability curves 4 2 vulnerability curves for maize based on the water deficit and the associated yield losses computed for the three selected growing stages e g vegetative flowering and yield formation drought vulnerability curves for maize were developed as described in section 3 6 the obtained data points have been fitted to the most appropriate functions in the case of the vegetative and flowering stages the michaelis menten equation eq 17 has been used 17 y g x h x while in the case of the yield formation stage the asymmetric logistic has been preferred eq 18 18 y c d c 1 e e b x a fig 5 shows the curves derived from the water deficit and yield losses for three provinces one for each soil type specifically rovigo loam over clay loam soil ferrara clay loam soil and pavia loam soil have been selected curves for the vegetative stage the flowering and the yield formation phases have been retrieved the data points exhibit a good fit with the selected functions as demonstrated by the high r 2 values which are significant at 0 01 table 3 results show that maize is more sensitive to water deficit during the flowering stage as already reported by steduto et al 2012 and underlined by zhu et al 2021 the curves for the vegetative stages show similar behavior in all three provinces the sensitivity to water deficit of the vegetative and yield formation phase is similar in rovigo fig 4a and ferrara fig 4b while in pavia fig 4c the vegetative phase is more sensitive to water deficit than the yield formation phase this can be related to the fact that the grain yield is already formed during the yield formation phase and even high water deficits do not affect the crop yield excessively the results here obtained can be compared with the ones reported in zhu et al 2021 even if the study considers four growth stages which do not overlap exactly with the ones of this work and evaluates the yield losses with respect to the dhi which is an average of the crop water stress indicator cwsi over the growth stage cwsi is computed as the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration through the aquacrop model the four stages reported in zhu et al 2021 are stage 1 corresponding to the period from sowing to the seventh leaf stage stage 2 going from the seventh leaf stage to the tasselling stage stage 3 from the tasselling to the milk stage and stage 4 from the milk stage to the physiological maturity of the crop the four growth stages considered in the present study are establishment which goes from sowing to the plant full emergence from the soil vegetative which lasts until the first flowers start to appear flowering which includes tassel and silking and yield formation which includes grain filling and ripening in the case of the po river basin the plant never experience a water stress during the first growth stage establishment or stage 1 while low yield reduction are reported in zhu et al 2021 during stage 2 vegetative yield losses in zhu et al 2021 reach 60 while in this study are around 40 while in stage 3 flowering maximum yield reduction in this study is high around 85 with respect to zhu et al 2021 in which yield losses amount at about 60 yield losses in the final stage are again higher in this study between 40 and 60 than in zhu et al 2021 where in the final growth stage no losses are reported for every value of the dhi the differences between the two studies can be attributed to various reasons at first as already described the four stages do not overlap exactly secondly the climate and the rainfall patterns of china are different from the ones of the po river basin finally as underlined by zhu et al 2021 in the chinese case study the amount of sunlight and quality of soil are poor for maize growing the soil texture influences the response of the crop to the water deficit in the flowering and the yield formation phases in the flowering stage for low water deficit the provinces with a loam soil show lower yield reduction than others while for high water deficit the yield reduction is lower in provinces with a clay loam soil texture a different situation happens during the yield formation phase in this case for all the water deficits the provinces with a loam over clay loam soil show a higher yield reduction than the others this behaviour can be explained by the properties of the different soil textures to this end groenendyk et al 2015 examined whether soil textural classifications could be useful proxies for hydraulic properties over a range of hydrologic conditions and developed an alternative approach to soil classification that can improve both quantitative analyses and visual interpretations of landscape function fig 5a illustrates the usda soil classification whereas fig 5b shows the hydraulic conductivity for different soil textures retrieved from simulations considering only the uppermost 30 cm of soil groenendyk et al 2015 the two panels show differences in hydraulic conductivity between loam and clay loam soils the loam soil type has a greater hydraulic conductivity than the clay loam one groenendyk et al 2015 work shows also that soils with a greater value in hydraulic conductivity have also a greater capacity in infiltration and drainage oppositely soils with a lower value of hydraulic conductivity have the capability to retain water at a microscopic scale thus guaranteeing water availability for plants roots for longer periods of time than other kind of soils during drought or water stress periods this feature results in a longer water availability at the root zone meaning that these kinds of soils have the ability to support plants resilience to prolonged water stress in our case this finding can explain why for higher values of water deficits clay loam soils show less yield reduction than the other ones especially in the flowering growth stage during the vegetative stage the soil texture does not play a significant influence on the response of maize to water stress probably because this growth stage shows less sensitivity to water stress and consequently the influence of soil texture is less evident as shown in fig 6 the maximum yield loss that can be obtained during the vegetative stage ranges from 0 26 brescia to 0 42 modena flowering remains the most critical stage in all the provinces with the maximum yield losses ranging from 0 67 modena to 0 94 cremona the yield formation phase shows the highest variability maximum yield losses range from 0 35 brescia to 0 54 alessandria fig 7 shows a vulnerability matrix that summarizes the main results when the maximum water stress water deficit equal to 1 is considered yield losses are computed through eq 17 for the vegetative and flowering phase and eq 18 for the yield formation phase using the constant values reported in table a 1 yield losses in the vulnerability matrix are expressed as percentage and the values represents the average yield loss over provinces with the same soil texture the establishment phase never went under water stress in the po river basin in the considered simulations therefore no yield losses are assigned to this phase during the establishment maize needs small amount of water that can be easily provided by all the three different considered soil types which as already mentioned have the capability to retain water due to their characteristic values of hydraulic conductivity flowering is the most sensitive stage to water deficit and high yield losses are reported in case of water stress during this period particularly in case of loam and loam over clay loam soils the vegetative stage is not highly influenced by the soil texture while the yield formation phase is less sensitive to water deficit in case of a loam soil texture the proposed classification could be used to support water management strategies to improve cooperation among stakeholders which is essential to ensure water and food security in the area lu et al 2021 5 conclusions stage specific drought vulnerability curves for maise tailored to the po river basin context have been developed establishment vegetative flowering and yield formation stages have been considered the curves have been developed for ten provinces with different soil texture apsim was used to compute the reference yield the yield in the absence of any water stress during all the crop growth stages the yield losses due to water stress and the water deficit associated with periods of drought happening during each of the crop growth stages the results of apsim calibration and validation were satisfactory the water deficit and the associated yield losses have been used to construct the vulnerability curves for the four growth stages the establishment phase never went under waters stress in the climatic conditions of the po valley because the amount of the water required by the crop in this phase is small and can be easily provided by the soil overall flowering has turned out to be the most sensitive stage to water deficit in all the provinces in agreement with other studies while the yield formation and the vegetative stage were less sensitive to the water stress the soil texture plays an influence on the response of the crop to the water deficit mainly in the flowering and the yield formation phases during flowering for high water deficits the yield reduction is lower in the provinces with a clay loam soil texture with respect to the others while for low water deficits the provinces with a loam soil show lower yield losses in the yield formation phase the provinces with a loam soil show a lower yield reduction than the provinces with a loam over clay loam soil for all the water deficits during the vegetative phase the soil texture did not play a significant role in determining the yield reduction associated with high water deficits the achieved results could foster a sustainable use of water resources in agriculture by suggesting the most appropriate time to rely on irrigation funding statement this work was

9488,accurate crop evapotranspiration simulation is vital for reasonable irrigation planning the two step method for crop evapotranspiration estimation has been widely used for irrigation water demand management however in the two step method the crop coefficient k c is typically taken as a constant in crop growth stages which may result in a certain error in evapotranspiration estimation it is of significance to estimate k c accurately for effective water resources management based on three year lysimeter experimental data collected from the wudaogou station for hydrology and water resources this study proposes a thermal based k c method for actual crop evapotranspiration estimation the proposed thermal based k c method uses air temperature and soil heat flux as input variables which could mainly characterise the thermal effect on crop growth from the atmosphere and soil results showed that the proposed method is effective in estimating k c the estimated k c highly correlates with actual k c values which are derived from lysimeter observation with correlation coefficient above 0 87 and nash sutcliffe efficiency above 0 70 the proposed method could estimate k c daily which can be used to estimate crop evapotranspiration accurately keywords thermal stress cardinal temperature wheat adaptation crop growth model 1 introduction agriculture is one of the essential sectors to

encountered in the field differ from the reference conditions dingre and gorantiwar 2020 the stage constant models are established using the historical data to illustrate average k c during different growth stages luo et al 2022 meng et al 2021 also the days after transplanting or the ratio of days after transplanting to total crop period rdt are used to estimate k c through the non linear regression dingre and gorantiwar 2020 sepaskhah and andam 2001 the k c curves obtained by the above two methods are relatively fixed and cannot reflect the dynamic change of daily k c value thus considering that k c links to the local climate sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques are used to model k c and multiple meteorological factors elbeltagi et al 2020 fang and song 2020 saggi and jain 2020 some of them include artificial neural networks ann support vector machines and random forests he et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 such methods are beneficial to enhance k c applicability to climate change but need lots of data to train models in this context for reducing the workload and uncertainty brought by multi meteorological factors efforts are made to use fewer meteorological factors as inputs to the k c models among numerous meteorological factors the close relationship between k c and air temperature t is emphasized because of the demands of crop growth for thermo silva 2020 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2016 the k c t method uses the statistical regression approach or crop growth models to describe the relationship between the temperature indicators and k c wang et al 2019 martel et al 2018 tao et al 2014 nielsen and hinkle 1996 crop growth models are developed to predict crop growth which is associated with k c saggi and jain 2020 comparing with the statistical regression approach crop growth models have an advantage in the certain physical basis and consideration of crop development karthikeyan et al 2020 the temperature indicators include daily temperature and growing degree days gdds gdds are known as heat units and thermal time which represent the accumulation of effective temperature gdde or active temperature gdda comparing with the daily temperature gdds as cumulative values perform not well in estimating the gradient variation of the k c curves in the k c t method cardinal temperatures are used to identify temperature validity andreucci et al 2016 typically cardinal temperatures are achieved through physiological experiences which is time consuming and expensive the previous studies indicated that two issues on the k c t method need to be addressed in the further study firstly the direct use of cardinal temperatures from other regions might not suit a specific region because of spatial and temporal difference in cardinal temperature sadras and dreccer 2015 there is rare studies of a convenient and non experimental method for determining cardinal temperatures in the k c t model to improve the ability of predicting k c secondly atmospheric heat is substantially highlighted in the literature on estimating k c based on the thermal effect but less attention has been paid to other thermal sources it is not conducive to characterising ambient thermo and rationalising the thermal based k c method the objectives of this paper are i to determine cardinal temperatures according to temperature statistics ii to revise k c based on the effect of atmospheric and soil heat on crop growth iii to expand the application of the two step method firstly temperature statistics provide quantitative background for cardinal temperatures thus cardinal temperatures were determined through temperature distribution and quantiles achieved by long term temperature data in the study region secondly ambient heat in crop growth mainly encloses atmospheric and soil heat based on the additive crop growth models a revised thermal based method was provided to estimate k c through air temperature and soil heat flux finally the resulting k c curves were evaluated in the multiple groundwater levels and different climatic conditions using lysimeter data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area the experimental area is

schematic description of the lysimeter including soil containing tank sensors and balance devices lysimeters fr101a aozuo instrumentation ltd beijing china are built on the principle of water balance the groundwater table in the lysimeter is fixed through the water balancer the lysimeter mass is converted into an equivalent water depth et is determined by the daily mass change soil bulk water content at 0 1 and 0 3 m depth is measured hourly using tdr sensors 2 2 2 groundwater table design in lysimeters based on the depth to groundwater observation in local fields from 1986 to 2019 the daily depth to groundwater mainly fluctuates from 0 5 to 3 5 m during the winter wheat season the annual depth to groundwater mainly fluctuates from 1 0 to 3 5 m according to the daily and annual depth the designed depths to groundwater in lysimeters were 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m 2 2 3 experiment description winter wheat growing experiments were conducted in the field from 2017 to 2020 winter wheat was sown in november and harvested in may or june the next year the total number of days in three wheat seasons is 198 215 and 206 d respectively according to the fao methodology in allen et al 1998 the crop growth season is divided into the initial development middle and late stage details of the experiment are shown in table 1 in the 2017 11 season only two lysimeters were operational in the other two seasons four lysimeters were used for the experiment in each season two replications were implemented for each groundwater table with a complete block design due to the external disturbance lysimeter data at 1 0 m depth from may 19 29 2017 and on april 7 2020 from april 23 24 may 11 12 and may 16 17 2020 were useless as well as at 3 0 m depth from april 5 7 april 23 24 may 2 5 and may 10 12 2020 wheat seeds were sown in 28 cm rows with a seed population of 15 kg each acre without irrigation available water sources for wheat growth were rainfall soil water and groundwater to minimise edge effects we kept the crop inside the lysimeters at the same breed and vegetation amount as the crop outside the lysimeters 2 3 meteorological observation meteorological data were

permanent wilting point Œ∏ w is the water holding capacity in this study Œ∏ w and Œ∏ p during winter wheat season are 28 and 10 respectively 2 4 2 thermal revised crop coefficient k c varies with crop growth which is strongly responsive to ambient thermo barlow et al 2015 ferguson et al 2011 wang et al 2015 atmospheric heat is a kind of ambient thermo the nonlinear relationship between k c and t has been described in previous studies the common k c t method is as follows 4 k c k ct g t k 0 where k ct is the max crop coefficient dependent on atmospheric heat k 0 is the crop coefficient dependent on the crop growth and non ambient heat factors g t is the function which describes the effect of the atmospheric heat on crop coefficient however considering that ambient thermo for crop growth mainly encloses atmospheric and soil heat we proposed a thermal based k c method in the basic of the k c t method the input variables of this method are air temperature and soil heat flux which represent atmospheric and soil heat the proposed method comprises the following steps step 1 estimate the temperature probability density function f t using long term temperature data in the experimental area step 2 set the upper probability Œ± u and the base probability Œ± b and then calculate the upper quantile u a according to Œ± u and the base quantile b Œ± according to Œ± b match u a and b Œ± one by one to form the u a b Œ± combinations step 3 set the upper temperature t u equal to u a and the base temperature t b equal to b Œ± in the u a b Œ± combination and then form the corresponding t u t b combinations step 4 modify invalid temperature under each t u t b combination and estimate k c using the additive models which considers both the effect of atmospheric and soil heat on wheat 5 k c k ct g t k cg g g k 0 where k cg is the max crop coefficient dependent on soil heat g g is the function which describes the effect of the soil heat on crop coefficient step 5 under each t u t b combination use the optimisation algorithm to solve parameters in eq 5 set the objective function as eq 6 meaning that the sum of error squares ses between the actual and estimated k c achieves the minimum 6 min ses i 1 m k ci k ÀÜ ci 2 where i is the number of crop coefficient sequence k ci is the i th value in the actual crop coefficient k ÀÜ ci is the i th value in the simulated crop coefficient step 6 evaluate the proposed method performance in simulating k c for each t u t b combination compare evaluation criteria in all combinations and then choose parameter values in the t u t b combination with the best performance as the optimal solution furthermore the details of each step are described in step 1 according to the local wheat cultivation the entire wheat growth is divided into the initial development middle and late stage f t in each growth stage can be tested through the kolmogorov smirnov statistic and fitted through the frequency analysis in step 2 the relationship between quantiles and probabilities are shown in fig 3 u a and b Œ± are solved through eqs 7 and 8 in different growth stages Œ± u and Œ± b are both probabilities representing where t b and t u are in the temperature distribution Œ± u and Œ± b also measure the adaptability of wheat to high and low temperatures considering reality both Œ± u and Œ± b have a range of 0 01 0 49 if the number of Œ± u and Œ± b is n u and n b respectively the number of formed u a b Œ± combinations is n u n b 7 Œ± b b Œ± f t dt 8 Œ± u u Œ± f t dt in step 3 t u and t b are cardinal temperatures reflecting the adaptation of crop growth to temperature assuming that crop growth has poor adaptation to extreme temperature this study connects cardinal temperatures with extreme temperatures the extreme degree is quantified by the locations of quantiles in the temperature distribution in step 4 the temperature hypothesis states that t is valid within the range of t b t u and k c is determined by atmospheric and soil heat inversely t is invalid and has no effect on k c outside this range this study used the eq 9 to modify the invalid temperature 9 t t b t t b t t b t t u t u t t u considering the response curves of wheat growth to thermo had a clock like shape this study adjusted k c through the additive crop growth models siebert and ewert 2014 incorporating clock models proposed by gao et al 1989 and yan and hunt 1999 g t is obtained as follows 10 g t t t b t u t b p t u t t u t b q where p is the low temperature sensitive coefficient q is the high temperature sensitive coefficient t t b t u t b and t u t t u t b describe the nonlinearity of the temperature stress and crop adaptation within the valid range the gaussian model was chose to describe g g for its robustness kim et al 2012 11 g g e g g 0 2 2 c 2 where g 0 is the optimal soil heat flux mj m 2 c represents the width of the curve mj m 2 in this equation soil heat stress is measured by the distance from optimal soil heat flux in step 5 set the physical constraints as follows 12 c 0 0 p q 1 k c t k c g k 0 0 k c t k c g k 0 k c m a x where k cmax means the maximum wheat crop coefficient under the ideal conditions the value of k cmax is set according to local conditions the estimated parameters include k ct k cg k 0 p q and c in step 6 the determinations of the optimal parameter solution should be compared with evaluation criteria in all t u t b combinations evaluation criteria are introduced in the following section in this study we set Œ± u and Œ± b to range from 0 01 to 0 49 with a step size of 0 01 k c during the 2018 11 and 2019 11 seasons was used to calibrate parameters referring to the study on k c meng et al 2021 cui et al 2018 we set the value of k cmax to 2 according to local records of cultivation we segment wheat growth season in table 2 2 5 evaluation criteria to evaluate the method performance statistical indicators include correlation coefficient r

meteorological factors during the experiments are illustrated in table 3 during three wheat seasons t and g in the third season were higher than in other seasons long term average wind speed was higher during the second season when compared to other growing seasons rainfall and relative humidity during the first season was higher than other seasons but not well distributed total et 0 in the first season were the highest in the initial and development stage whereas total et 0 in the second season were the highest in the middle and late stage 3 1 2 soil water stress coefficient and crop evapotranspiration the average soil water stress coefficient and crop evapotranspiration during the experiment are shown in table 4 at different groundwater depths seasonal fluctuations in et were clear and the fluctuation patterns were similar the distribution of soil water stress coefficient varied significantly with et during four growth stages soil water stress mostly occurred in the middle and late stages due to increased water consumption and temperature in the same season the smaller the water depth the less the water stress 3 2 cardinal temperature combination 3 2 1 temperature distribution the frequency analysis results and the fitting curves of temperature probability density functions during four growth stages are shown in fig 4 the test results indicated that at the 0 05 level the hypothesis that t followed the normal distribution was significantly verified during four growth stages the parameters mu and sigma required to fit the normal distribution in four stages were marked in fig 4 3 2 2 quantile determination based on 49 alternative values of t b and t u obtained from the above fitting distribution 2401 cardinal temperature combinations were formed referencing to step 3 in the section 2 4 4 the scopes of t b c during four stages were 7 14 4 80 8 13 1 04 2 11 12 64 and 13 37 21 45 respectively the scopes of t u c during four stages were 5 00 16 94 1 20 10 46 12 82 23 35 and 21 59 29 67 respectively 3 3 atmospheric and soil thermal based crop coefficient estimation 3 3 1 parameter calibration daily k c was estimated using thermal factors including t and g optimal parameter solutions are shown in table 5 t u and t b were seasonal t u centered stably on the first 20 of temperature distribution whereas t b centered on the late 40 the values of p and q represent the sensitivity of k c to temperature in the initial and development stage wheat responded positively to cold temperatures in the middle stage temperature sensitivity varied with depth to groundwater in the late stage the wheat decline was more sensitive to high temperatures than low temperatures g 0 varied consistently from season to season g 0 and c which corrected actual soil heat flux reflected the difference in soil heat at various treatments k cb reflected the influence of factors other than atmospheric and soil heat on k c k cb roughly decreased with the depth to groundwater which showed the thermal effect on k c correspondingly increased as shown in fig 5 the decisive role of single heat factor on kc varied with growth stages the contribution of atmospheric heat to kc was about 32 17 25 86 30 78 and 41 25 in the initial development middle and late stage the contribution of soil heat to kc was about 12 18 29 03 48 52 and 29 13 respectively the contribution of double heat factors to kc were roughly higher in the middle and late stages than other growth stages and increased with the depth to groundwater during the whole wheat season thermo including atmosphere and soil heat accounted for approximately 43 23 55 90 57 38 and 92 41 of k c variability at the 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m depth to groundwater 3 3 2 performance evaluation comparisons of actual and estimated k c value in the 2018 11 and 2019 11 seasons are presented in fig 6 during the whole season the estimated valued of k c based on the thermal based methods had the similar trend as the actual value the propose method realised good performance in terms of statistical metrics with nse 0 70 mae 0 05 and acc 68 12 at the 0 5 m depth nse 0 81 mae 0 08 and acc 61 62 at the 1 0 m depth nse 0 74 mae 0 05 and acc 64 56 at the 2 0 m depth nse 0 85 mae 0 10 and acc 67 91 at the 3 0 m depth fig 7 shows the evaluation statistics for each growth stage the thermal based method performed well in simulating the change trend of k c with r almost above 0 60 on the growth stage scale deviations in mean value of estimated and actual k c from initial to late stage was small the mean k c averaged 0 20 in the initial stage 0 28 in the development stage 0 63 in the middle stage and 0 48 in the late stage ranging from 0 11 0 40 0 18 0 50 0 38 0 90 and 0 30 0 78 respectively but on the daily scale the method performed better in middle and late stages than initial stage std varied from 0 10 to 0 32 in the middle stage and from 0 03 to 0 15 in other growth stages rmse varied from 0 04 and 0 12 in the initial stage and from 0 07 to 0 17 in other growth stages for further verifying the thermal based method k c during the 2017 11 season was evaluated predicted and actual k c values are compared in fig 8 in the entire growth season the thermal based method was effective to predict the overall trend of k c with nse 0 77 and r 0 91 atmospheric and soil heat accounted for 50 8 of k c variability during four growth stages mae were 0 05 0 06 0 25 and 0 03 respectively this showed that errors mainly occur in the middle stage especially in these days with small k c value it was analyzed that during the middle stage the average predicted and actual k c were 0 29 and 0 53 in 25 days with k c below 0 6 whereas 1 08 and 1 15 in 26 days with k c above 0 6 4 discussion in the sections 4 1 and 4 2 we used monitoring data at the 1 0 m depth to groundwater to analyze the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the k c t method and compare the atmospheric and soil thermal based k c method proposed in our study with other methods the parameters of these models were calibrated in the 2018 11 season and performances were evaluated in the 2017 11 season the following discussion was conducted based on the performance evaluation 4 1 the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the kc t method for quantizing the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the k c t method we plug four wheat growth models into eq 4 to predict k c under various cardinal temperature combinations combination details in section 3 2 referencing to the wheat growth models summarized by wang et al 2017 we concluded four basic forms of wheat growth models gm1 gm2 gm3 gm4 in supplementary table 1 gm2 and gm4 are affected by both base and upper temperature gm1 and gm3 are only affected by the base temperature figs 9 and 10 illustrated the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the performance of the k c t method embedding in four growth models no matter what growth model was embedded in the selections of cardinal temperatures had great effect on the prediction performance the effect on gm2 was similar as gm4 with the greatest effect in the middle stage and the least effect in the late stage comparing with gm1 the effect on gm3 was greater in the middle stage and less in other stages the above research indicated that it should be noted that in the k c t method direct use of cardinal temperatures from other regions may lead to estimation errors especially in the middle stage with high water demands 4 2 the comparison of the proposed method with other k c methods to further verify the performance of the proposed method the prediction results of other five methods rdt ann gdde and gdda based k c method and the stage constant model were also given in fig 11 details of these five methods were shown in supplementary table 2 referencing to meng et al 2021 dingre and gorantiwar 2020 elbeltagi et al 2020 martel et al 2018 and detar 2004 as shown in fig 11 there were certain differences in the prediction accuracy between different methods the thermal and ann based methods with nse above 0 70 and mae below 0 14 outperformed other four methods ann was excellent for describing the nonlinear relationships as those literature shown kumar et al 2020 gupta et al 2016 aghajanloo et al 2013 the ann based method could well predict k c with small values which was the weakness of the thermal based method but the thermal based method could estimated the daily k c value during the initial and development stage and capture the peak value of k c during the middle and late stage better than the ann based method except thermal and ann based methods other four methods had prediction accuracy with nse below 0 50 and mae above 0 17 especially the gdde based method was the most ineffective for estimating k c both gdda and gdde based methods used gdds to simulate k c but the results showed that gdda performed more stably than gdde as reported in jiang et al 2018 during the 2017 11 season total gdde and gdda were 785 97 and 1742 06 respectively but during the 2018 11 season total gdde and gdda were 969 99 and 1964 33 respectively the interannual variability of gdds made the parameters portability of the gdds based models poor and thus led to noneffective predictions schultze et al 2016 hou et al 2014 the stage constant model and rdt based method were easy to implement but not good at predicting the precise k c values yang et al 2016 in the stage constant model k c in the four growth stages was 0 11 0 17 0 85 and 0 78 which was achieved using k c data during 2018 11 season but during the 2017 11 season the mean actual k c was 0 08 0 14 0 70 and 0 70 in the initial development middle and late stage respectively the difference of mean k c values over two seasons was attributed to climatic condition hou et al 2022 the rdt based method had the same drawbacks as above without consideration of environment the above research indicates that the thermal based method proposed in this study performed as well as the ann based method but other methods had poorer prediction ability comparing with the ann based method the proposed method used fewer meteorological factors to reduce the workload and uncertainty brought by multi meteorological factors at the same time the thermal based method provided a reliable alternative to other complex algorithms requiring extensive data 4 3 the reliability and inadequacy of the proposed method the proposed method included two rationales firstly assuming that cardinal temperatures related to crop adaptation the statistics were used to quantificant crop adaptation kamali et al 2022 sadras and dreccer 2015 secondly k c was effected by crop growth which was strongly responsive to ambient thermo mokhtari et al 2019 seidel et al 2019 barlow et al 2015 tabari and talaee 2014 ferguson et al 2011 thus the additive crop growth models were used to characterize the effect of both atmospheric and soil heat on k c andreucci et al 2016 and roberts et al 2006 have verified the validity of the additive models kheiri et al 2022 and dong and shi 2022 stated that an increase in annual mean temperature due to climate change could result in accelerating the development rate of crop this showed that the proposed method in our study could respond to climate change to a certain degree the normality assumption of daily temperature in fig 4 was consistent with zhou et al 2019 ogorodnikov et al 2009 and harmel et al 2002 referencing to research on cardinal temperatures of winter wheat ochagav√≠a et al 2019 sadras and dreccer 2015 white et al 2012 john and megan 1999 we got the general findings that in the initial stage t b ranged from 5 7 c and t u was above 15 c certain wheat varieties responded positively to low temperatures because of the obligate chilling requirement for flowering in the development stage t b was below 4 c and t u was above 9 c low temperatures mainly drove the wheat growth in the middle stage t b below 10 c and t u was above 20 c the sensitivity of wheat growth to temperature varied with experimental treatments and wheat varieties in the late stage t b was below 15 c and t u was above 30 c wheat in decline was more sensitive to high temperatures than low temperatures our study results in table 5 were generally similar as above findings with some differences these differences could be accepted because cardinal temperatures varied from phenological period crop cultivar and agronomic selection sadras and dreccer 2015 siebert and ewert 2014 this was also why we believed that cardinal temperature should not be directly used in other regions but rather determined by local conditions the proposed method had its drawbacks that estimation accuracy for k c with small values was poorer than k c with high values figs 6 and 11 especially in rainy days accurately predicting rainy k c was hard which was always reported malakshahi et al 2020 schwartz et al 2019 baburao et al 2013 this deficiency may be because when k c declines sharply the change of thermal environment doesn t keep pace with k c in addition soil heat was characterized by soil heat flux in this study which may not be easily accessible for farmers in practices 5 conclusions in this study a calculation method of daily wheat crop coefficient k c using temperature and soil heat flux data during the wheat seasons is proposed statistics indicators including temperature distribution functions and quantiles achieved by long term historical temperature data provide quantitative background for cardinal temperatures the additive crop growth models combine both the effect of atmospheric and soil heat effect on crop growth to estimate daily k c the method s effectiveness is evaluated based on three year lysimeter experimental data collected from the wudaogou station for hydrology and water resources the performance evaluations of different seasons show that the proposed method is efficient with correlation coefficient above 0 87 and nash sutcliffe efficiency above 0 70 moreover in the proposed method thermao including atmospheric and soil heat account for 42 93 of k c variations under various climatic conditions however we also find the prediction accuracy of the method is relatively low when k c is small and soil heat flux is not accessible for some cases in practices how to improve prediction accuracy for a small k c and to seek for an alternative easily accessible variable of soil heat flux should be enhanced in further study for supporting effective water resources management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9488,accurate crop evapotranspiration simulation is vital for reasonable irrigation planning the two step method for crop evapotranspiration estimation has been widely used for irrigation water demand management however in the two step method the crop coefficient k c is typically taken as a constant in crop growth stages which may result in a certain error in evapotranspiration estimation it is of significance to estimate k c accurately for effective water resources management based on three year lysimeter experimental data collected from the wudaogou station for hydrology and water resources this study proposes a thermal based k c method for actual crop evapotranspiration estimation the proposed thermal based k c method uses air temperature and soil heat flux as input variables which could mainly characterise the thermal effect on crop growth from the atmosphere and soil results showed that the proposed method is effective in estimating k c the estimated k c highly correlates with actual k c values which are derived from lysimeter observation with correlation coefficient above 0 87 and nash sutcliffe efficiency above 0 70 the proposed method could estimate k c daily which can be used to estimate crop evapotranspiration accurately keywords thermal stress cardinal temperature wheat adaptation crop growth model 1 introduction agriculture is one of the essential sectors to

of the two step method k c values or curves represent the ratios of et to et 0 during various crop growth stages k c calculation methods are broadly classified into two categories one category uses crop growth characteristics which are achieved through physical measurements k c represents a combined influence of three major growth characteristics which distinguish the crop from the reference grass i leaf area vegetation coverage stomatal control and soil surface wetness which determine crop soil surface resistance ii crop height which influences aerodynamic resistance iii crop soil surface albedo which depends on vegetation coverage and soil surface conditions malachy et al 2022 pereira et al 2021 gong et al 2020 malakshahi et al 2020 montoro et al 2020 another category uses factors other than crop growth characteristics the recommend k c values in fao are frequently used directly however the need for local calibration of k c is emphasized since the climatic conditions encountered in the field differ from the reference conditions dingre and gorantiwar 2020 the stage constant models are established using the historical data to illustrate average k c during different growth stages luo et al 2022 meng et al 2021 also the days after transplanting or the ratio of days after transplanting to total crop period rdt are used to estimate k c through the non linear regression dingre and gorantiwar 2020 sepaskhah and andam 2001 the k c curves obtained by the above two methods are relatively fixed and cannot reflect the dynamic change of daily k c value thus considering that k c links to the local climate sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques are used to model k c and multiple meteorological factors elbeltagi et al 2020 fang and song 2020 saggi and jain 2020 some of them include artificial neural networks ann support vector machines and random forests he et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 such methods are beneficial to enhance k c applicability to climate change but need lots of data to train models in this context for reducing the workload and uncertainty brought by multi meteorological factors efforts are made to use fewer meteorological factors as inputs to the k c models among numerous meteorological factors the close relationship between k c and air temperature t is emphasized because of the demands of crop growth for thermo silva 2020 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2016 the k c t method uses the statistical regression approach or crop growth models to describe the relationship between the temperature indicators and k c wang et al 2019 martel et al 2018 tao et al 2014 nielsen and hinkle 1996 crop growth models are developed to predict crop growth which is associated with k c saggi and jain 2020 comparing with the statistical regression approach crop growth models have an advantage in the certain physical basis and consideration of crop development karthikeyan et al 2020 the temperature indicators include daily temperature and growing degree days gdds gdds are known as heat units and thermal time which represent the accumulation of effective temperature gdde or active temperature gdda comparing with the daily temperature gdds as cumulative values perform not well in estimating the gradient variation of the k c curves in the k c t method cardinal temperatures are used to identify temperature validity andreucci et al 2016 typically cardinal temperatures are achieved through physiological experiences which is time consuming and expensive the previous studies indicated that two issues on the k c t method need to be addressed in the further study firstly the direct use of cardinal temperatures from other regions might not suit a specific region because of spatial and temporal difference in cardinal temperature sadras and dreccer 2015 there is rare studies of a convenient and non experimental method for determining cardinal temperatures in the k c t model to improve the ability of predicting k c secondly atmospheric heat is substantially highlighted in the literature on estimating k c based on the thermal effect but less attention has been paid to other thermal sources it is not conducive to characterising ambient thermo and rationalising the thermal based k c method the objectives of this paper are i to determine cardinal temperatures according to temperature statistics ii to revise k c based on the effect of atmospheric and soil heat on crop growth iii to expand the application of the two step method firstly temperature statistics provide quantitative background for cardinal temperatures thus cardinal temperatures were determined through temperature distribution and quantiles achieved by long term temperature data in the study region secondly ambient heat in crop growth mainly encloses atmospheric and soil heat based on the additive crop growth models a revised thermal based method was provided to estimate k c through air temperature and soil heat flux finally the resulting k c curves were evaluated in the multiple groundwater levels and different climatic conditions using lysimeter data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area the experimental area is

schematic description of the lysimeter including soil containing tank sensors and balance devices lysimeters fr101a aozuo instrumentation ltd beijing china are built on the principle of water balance the groundwater table in the lysimeter is fixed through the water balancer the lysimeter mass is converted into an equivalent water depth et is determined by the daily mass change soil bulk water content at 0 1 and 0 3 m depth is measured hourly using tdr sensors 2 2 2 groundwater table design in lysimeters based on the depth to groundwater observation in local fields from 1986 to 2019 the daily depth to groundwater mainly fluctuates from 0 5 to 3 5 m during the winter wheat season the annual depth to groundwater mainly fluctuates from 1 0 to 3 5 m according to the daily and annual depth the designed depths to groundwater in lysimeters were 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m 2 2 3 experiment description winter wheat growing experiments were conducted in the field from 2017 to 2020 winter wheat was sown in november and harvested in may or june the next year the total number of days in three wheat seasons is 198 215 and 206 d respectively according to the fao methodology in allen et al 1998 the crop growth season is divided into the initial development middle and late stage details of the experiment are shown in table 1 in the 2017 11 season only two lysimeters were operational in the other two seasons four lysimeters were used for the experiment in each season two replications were implemented for each groundwater table with a complete block design due to the external disturbance lysimeter data at 1 0 m depth from may 19 29 2017 and on april 7 2020 from april 23 24 may 11 12 and may 16 17 2020 were useless as well as at 3 0 m depth from april 5 7 april 23 24 may 2 5 and may 10 12 2020 wheat seeds were sown in 28 cm rows with a seed population of 15 kg each acre without irrigation available water sources for wheat growth were rainfall soil water and groundwater to minimise edge effects we kept the crop inside the lysimeters at the same breed and vegetation amount as the crop outside the lysimeters 2 3 meteorological observation meteorological data were obtained from the meteorological observatory located 200 m from the lysimeters meteorological factors including maximum air temperature t max minimum air temperature t min average air temperature t

permanent wilting point Œ∏ w is the water holding capacity in this study Œ∏ w and Œ∏ p during winter wheat season are 28 and 10 respectively 2 4 2 thermal revised crop coefficient k c varies with crop growth which is strongly responsive to ambient thermo barlow et al 2015 ferguson et al 2011 wang et al 2015 atmospheric heat is a kind of ambient thermo the nonlinear relationship between k c and t has been described in previous studies the common k c t method is as follows 4 k c k ct g t k 0 where k ct is the max crop coefficient dependent on atmospheric heat k 0 is the crop coefficient dependent on the crop growth and non ambient heat factors g t is the function which describes the effect of the atmospheric heat on crop coefficient however considering that ambient thermo for crop growth mainly encloses atmospheric and soil heat we proposed a thermal based k c method in the basic of the k c t method the input variables of this method are air temperature and soil heat flux which represent atmospheric and soil heat the proposed method comprises the following steps step 1 estimate the temperature probability density function f t using long term temperature data in the experimental area step 2 set the upper probability Œ± u and the base probability Œ± b and then calculate the upper quantile u a according to Œ± u and the base quantile b Œ± according to Œ± b match u a and b Œ± one by one to form the u a b Œ± combinations step 3 set the upper temperature t u equal to u a and the base temperature t b equal to b Œ± in the u a b Œ± combination and then form the corresponding t u t b combinations step 4 modify invalid temperature under each t u t b combination and estimate k c using the additive models which considers both the effect of atmospheric and soil heat on wheat 5 k c k ct g t k cg g g k 0 where k cg is the max crop coefficient dependent on soil heat g g is the function which describes the effect of the soil heat on crop coefficient step 5 under each t u t b combination use the optimisation algorithm to solve parameters in eq 5 set the objective function as eq 6 meaning that the sum of error squares ses between the actual and estimated k c achieves the minimum 6 min ses i 1 m k ci k ÀÜ ci 2 where i is the number of crop coefficient sequence k ci is the i th value in the actual crop coefficient k ÀÜ ci is the i th value in the simulated crop coefficient step 6 evaluate the proposed method performance in simulating k c for each t u t b combination compare evaluation criteria in all combinations and then choose parameter values in the t u t b combination with the best performance as the optimal solution furthermore the details of each step are described in step 1 according to the local wheat cultivation the entire wheat growth is divided into the initial development middle and late stage f t in each growth stage can be tested through the kolmogorov smirnov statistic and fitted through the frequency analysis in step 2 the relationship between quantiles and probabilities are shown in fig 3 u a and b Œ± are solved through eqs 7 and 8 in different growth stages Œ± u and Œ± b are both probabilities representing where t b and t u are in the temperature distribution Œ± u and Œ± b also measure the adaptability of wheat to high and low temperatures considering reality both Œ± u and Œ± b have a range of 0 01 0 49 if the number of Œ± u and Œ± b is n u and n b respectively the number of formed u a b Œ± combinations is n u n b 7 Œ± b b Œ± f t dt 8 Œ± u u Œ± f t dt in step 3 t u and t b are cardinal temperatures reflecting the adaptation of crop growth to temperature assuming that crop growth has poor adaptation to extreme temperature this study connects cardinal temperatures with extreme temperatures the extreme degree is quantified by the locations of quantiles in the temperature distribution in step 4 the temperature hypothesis states that t is valid within the range of t b t u and k c is determined by atmospheric and soil heat inversely t is invalid and has no effect on k c outside this range this study used the eq 9 to modify the invalid temperature 9 t t b t t b t t b t t u t u t t u considering the response curves of wheat growth to thermo had a clock like shape this study adjusted k c through the additive crop growth models siebert and ewert 2014 incorporating clock models proposed by gao et al 1989 and yan and hunt 1999 g t is obtained as follows 10 g t t t b t u t b p t u t t u t b q where p is the low temperature sensitive coefficient q is the high temperature sensitive coefficient t t b t u t b and t u t t u t b describe the nonlinearity of the temperature stress and crop adaptation within the valid range the gaussian model was chose to describe g g for its robustness kim et al 2012 11 g g e g g 0 2 2 c 2 where g 0 is the optimal soil heat flux mj m 2 c represents the width of the curve mj m 2 in this equation soil heat stress is measured by the distance from optimal soil heat flux in step 5 set the physical constraints as follows 12 c 0 0 p q 1 k c t k c g k 0 0 k c t k c g k 0 k c m a x where k cmax means the maximum wheat crop coefficient under the ideal conditions the value of k cmax is set according to local conditions the estimated parameters include k ct k cg k 0 p q and c in step 6 the determinations of the optimal parameter solution should be compared with evaluation criteria in all t u t b combinations evaluation criteria are introduced in the following section in this study we set Œ± u and Œ± b to range from 0 01 to 0 49 with a step size of 0 01 k c during the 2018 11 and 2019 11 seasons was used to calibrate parameters referring to the study on k c meng et al 2021 cui et al 2018 we set the value of k cmax to 2 according to local records of cultivation we segment wheat growth season in table 2 2 5 evaluation criteria to evaluate the method performance statistical indicators include correlation coefficient r

meteorological factors during the experiments are illustrated in table 3 during three wheat seasons t and g in the third season were higher than in other seasons long term average wind speed was higher during the second season when compared to other growing seasons rainfall and relative humidity during the first season was higher than other seasons but not well distributed total et 0 in the first season were the highest in the initial and development stage whereas total et 0 in the second season were the highest in the middle and late stage 3 1 2 soil water stress coefficient and crop evapotranspiration the average soil water stress coefficient and crop evapotranspiration during the experiment are shown in table 4 at different groundwater depths seasonal fluctuations in et were clear and the fluctuation patterns were similar the distribution of soil water stress coefficient varied significantly with et during four growth stages soil water stress mostly occurred in the middle and late stages due to increased water consumption and temperature in the same season the smaller the water depth the less the water stress 3 2 cardinal temperature combination 3 2 1 temperature distribution the frequency analysis results and the fitting curves of temperature probability density functions during four growth stages are shown in fig 4 the test results indicated that at the 0 05 level the hypothesis that t followed the normal distribution was significantly verified during four growth stages the parameters mu and sigma required to fit the normal distribution in four stages were marked in fig 4 3 2 2 quantile determination based on 49 alternative values of t b and t u obtained from the above fitting distribution 2401 cardinal temperature combinations were formed referencing to step 3 in the section 2 4 4 the scopes of t b c during four stages were 7 14 4 80 8 13 1 04 2 11 12 64 and 13 37 21 45 respectively the scopes of t u c during four stages were 5 00 16 94 1 20 10 46 12 82 23 35 and 21 59 29 67 respectively 3 3 atmospheric and soil thermal based crop coefficient estimation 3 3 1 parameter calibration daily k c was estimated using thermal factors including t and g optimal parameter solutions are shown in table 5 t u and t b were seasonal t u centered stably on the first 20 of temperature distribution whereas t b centered on the late 40 the values of p and q represent the sensitivity of k c to temperature in the initial and development stage wheat responded positively to cold temperatures in the middle stage temperature sensitivity varied with depth to groundwater in the late stage the wheat decline was more sensitive to high temperatures than low temperatures g 0 varied consistently from season to season g 0 and c which corrected actual soil heat flux reflected the difference in soil heat at various treatments k cb reflected the influence of factors other than atmospheric and soil heat on k c k cb roughly decreased with the depth to groundwater which showed the thermal effect on k c correspondingly increased as shown in fig 5 the decisive role of single heat factor on kc varied with growth stages the contribution of atmospheric heat to kc was about 32 17 25 86 30 78 and 41 25 in the initial development middle and late stage the contribution of soil heat to kc was about 12 18 29 03 48 52 and 29 13 respectively the contribution of double heat factors to kc were roughly higher in the middle and late stages than other growth stages and increased with the depth to groundwater during the whole wheat season thermo including atmosphere and soil heat accounted for approximately 43 23 55 90 57 38 and 92 41 of k c variability at the 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 m depth to groundwater 3 3 2 performance evaluation comparisons of actual and estimated k c value in the 2018 11 and 2019 11 seasons are presented in fig 6 during the whole season the estimated valued of k c based on the thermal based methods had the similar trend as the actual value the propose method realised good performance in terms of statistical metrics with nse 0 70 mae 0 05 and acc 68 12 at the 0 5 m depth nse 0 81 mae 0 08 and acc 61 62 at the 1 0 m depth nse 0 74 mae 0 05 and acc 64 56 at the 2 0 m depth nse 0 85 mae 0 10 and acc 67 91 at the 3 0 m depth fig 7 shows the evaluation statistics for each growth stage the thermal based method performed well in simulating the change trend of k c with r almost above 0 60 on the growth stage scale deviations in mean value of estimated and actual k c from initial to late stage was small the mean k c averaged 0 20 in the initial stage 0 28 in the development stage 0 63 in the middle stage and 0 48 in the late stage ranging from 0 11 0 40 0 18 0 50 0 38 0 90 and 0 30 0 78 respectively but on the daily scale the method performed better in middle and late stages than initial stage std varied from 0 10 to 0 32 in the middle stage and from 0 03 to 0 15 in other growth stages rmse varied from 0 04 and 0 12 in the initial stage and from 0 07 to 0 17 in other growth stages for further verifying the thermal based method k c during the 2017 11 season was evaluated predicted and actual k c values are compared in fig 8 in the entire growth season the thermal based method was effective to predict the overall trend of k c with nse 0 77 and r 0 91 atmospheric and soil heat accounted for 50 8 of k c variability during four growth stages mae were 0 05 0 06 0 25 and 0 03 respectively this showed that errors mainly occur in the middle stage especially in these days with small k c value it was analyzed that during the middle stage the average predicted and actual k c were 0 29 and 0 53 in 25 days with k c below 0 6 whereas 1 08 and 1 15 in 26 days with k c above 0 6 4 discussion in the sections 4 1 and 4 2 we used monitoring data at the 1 0 m depth to groundwater to analyze the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the k c t method and compare the atmospheric and soil thermal based k c method proposed in our study with other methods the parameters of these models were calibrated in the 2018 11 season and performances were evaluated in the 2017 11 season the following discussion was conducted based on the performance evaluation 4 1 the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the kc t method for quantizing the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the k c t method we plug four wheat growth models into eq 4 to predict k c under various cardinal temperature combinations combination details in section 3 2 referencing to the wheat growth models summarized by wang et al 2017 we concluded four basic forms of wheat growth models gm1 gm2 gm3 gm4 in supplementary table 1 gm2 and gm4 are affected by both base and upper temperature gm1 and gm3 are only affected by the base temperature figs 9 and 10 illustrated the effect of cardinal temperature selection on the performance of the k c t method embedding in four growth models no matter what growth model was embedded in the selections of cardinal temperatures had great effect on the prediction performance the effect on gm2 was similar as gm4 with the greatest effect in the middle stage and the least effect in the late stage comparing with gm1 the effect on gm3 was greater in the middle stage and less in other stages the above research indicated that it should be noted that in the k c t method direct use of cardinal temperatures from other regions may lead to estimation errors especially in the middle stage with high water demands 4 2 the comparison of the proposed method with other k c methods to further verify the performance of the proposed method the prediction results of other five methods rdt ann gdde and gdda based k c method and the stage constant model were also given in fig 11 details of these five methods were shown in supplementary table 2 referencing to meng et al 2021 dingre and gorantiwar 2020 elbeltagi et al 2020 martel et al 2018 and detar 2004 as shown in fig 11 there were certain differences in the prediction accuracy between different methods the thermal and ann based methods with nse above 0 70 and mae below 0 14 outperformed other four methods ann was excellent for describing the nonlinear relationships as those literature shown kumar et al 2020 gupta et al 2016 aghajanloo et al 2013 the ann based method could well predict k c with small values which was the weakness of the thermal based method but the thermal based method could estimated the daily k c value during the initial and development stage and capture the peak value of k c during the middle and late stage better than the ann based method except thermal and ann based methods other four methods had prediction accuracy with nse below 0 50 and mae above 0 17 especially the gdde based method was the most ineffective for estimating k c both gdda and gdde based methods used gdds to simulate k c but the results showed that gdda performed more stably than gdde as reported in jiang et al 2018 during the 2017 11 season total gdde and gdda were 785 97 and 1742 06 respectively but during the 2018 11 season total gdde and gdda were 969 99 and 1964 33 respectively the interannual variability of gdds made the parameters portability of the gdds based models poor and thus led to noneffective predictions schultze et al 2016 hou et al 2014 the stage constant model and rdt based method were easy to implement but not good at predicting the precise k c values yang et al 2016 in the stage constant model k c in the four growth stages was 0 11 0 17 0 85 and 0 78 which was achieved using k c data during 2018 11 season but during the 2017 11 season the mean actual k c was 0 08 0 14 0 70 and 0 70 in the initial development middle and late stage respectively the difference of mean k c values over two seasons was attributed to climatic condition hou et al 2022 the rdt based method had the same drawbacks as above without consideration of environment the above research indicates that the thermal based method proposed in this study performed as well as the ann based method but other methods had poorer prediction ability comparing with the ann based method the proposed method used fewer meteorological factors to reduce the workload and uncertainty brought by multi meteorological factors at the same time the thermal based method provided a reliable alternative to other complex algorithms requiring extensive data 4 3 the reliability and inadequacy of the proposed method the proposed method included two rationales firstly assuming that cardinal temperatures related to crop adaptation the statistics were used to quantificant crop adaptation kamali et al 2022 sadras and dreccer 2015 secondly k c was effected by crop growth which was strongly responsive to ambient thermo mokhtari et al 2019 seidel et al 2019 barlow et al 2015 tabari and talaee 2014 ferguson et al 2011 thus the additive crop growth models were used to characterize the effect of both atmospheric and soil heat on k c andreucci et al 2016 and roberts et al 2006 have verified the validity of the additive models kheiri et al 2022 and dong and shi 2022 stated that an increase in annual mean temperature due to climate change could result in accelerating the development rate of crop this showed that the proposed method in our study could respond to climate change to a certain degree the normality assumption of daily temperature in fig 4 was consistent with zhou et al 2019 ogorodnikov et al 2009 and harmel et al 2002 referencing to research on cardinal temperatures of winter wheat ochagav√≠a et al 2019 sadras and dreccer 2015 white et al 2012 john and megan 1999 we got the general findings that in the initial stage t b ranged from 5 7 c and t u was above 15 c certain wheat varieties responded positively to low temperatures because of the obligate chilling requirement for flowering in the development stage t b was below 4 c and t u was above 9 c low temperatures mainly drove the wheat growth in the middle stage t b below 10 c and t u was above 20 c the sensitivity of wheat growth to temperature varied with experimental treatments and wheat varieties in the late stage t b was below 15 c and t u was above 30 c wheat in decline was more sensitive to high temperatures than low temperatures our study results in table 5 were generally similar as above findings with some differences these differences could be accepted because cardinal temperatures varied from phenological period crop cultivar and agronomic selection sadras and dreccer 2015 siebert and ewert 2014 this was also why we believed that cardinal temperature should not be directly used in other regions but rather determined by local conditions the proposed method had its drawbacks that estimation accuracy for k c with small values was poorer than k c with high values figs 6 and 11 especially in rainy days accurately predicting rainy k c was hard which was always reported malakshahi et al 2020 schwartz et al 2019 baburao et al 2013 this deficiency may be because when k c declines sharply the change of thermal environment doesn t keep pace with k c in addition soil heat was characterized by soil heat flux in this study which may not be easily accessible for farmers in practices 5 conclusions in this study a calculation method of daily wheat crop coefficient k c using temperature and soil heat flux data during the wheat seasons is proposed statistics indicators including temperature distribution functions and quantiles achieved by long term historical temperature data provide quantitative background for cardinal temperatures the additive crop growth models combine both the effect of atmospheric and soil heat effect on crop growth to estimate daily k c the method s effectiveness is evaluated based on three year lysimeter experimental data collected from the wudaogou station for hydrology and water resources the performance evaluations of different seasons show that the proposed method is efficient with correlation coefficient above 0 87 and nash sutcliffe efficiency above 0 70 moreover in the proposed method thermao including atmospheric and soil heat account for 42 93 of k c variations under various climatic conditions however we also find the prediction accuracy of the method is relatively low when k c is small and soil heat flux is not accessible for some cases in practices how to improve prediction accuracy for a small k c and to seek for an alternative easily accessible variable of soil heat flux should be enhanced in further study for supporting effective water resources management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

same time global warming further exacerbates crop water stress as the increasing temperature will raise water demand zhu and burney 2021 jin et al 2022 to increase agricultural production under the threat of water scarcity and climate change increasing crop water use efficiency and reducing agricultural vulnerability are of great importance which relies on the detailed analysis of crop water use evapotranspiration et also known as crop water use in the agricultural sector or latent heat flux in surface energy balance indicates water stress and heat stress anderson et al 2016 fisher et al 2017 it consists of transpiration the water transpired or lost to the atmosphere from plant leaves and stems soil evaporation and canopy interception zhang et al 2016 in croplands et is the predominant pathway of water loss when the crop suffers from water stress the stomata close and the transpiration declines feng et al 2017 as transpiration dominates et more than 60 jasechko et al 2013 good et al 2015 decreasing transpiration would reduce et et also accounts for evaporative cooling acting as an indicator of heat stress zeng et al 2017 wu et al 2022 thus accurate quantification of et and its components is critical for the water use eÔ¨Éciency evaluation and precision agriculture management gong et al 2017a remote sensing data of et is an effective way to monitor crop water use unlike

states hook and cawse nicholson 2021 anderson et al 2021 prior studies have implemented the ecostress products for various practical applications since its launch for example poulos et al 2021 investigated the impact of fire on ecosystem et as quantified by ecostress pt jpl products in a pine oak forest in the usa wilder and kinoshita 2022 also applied ecostress pt jpl data to analyze the response of catchment water balance to fire they highlighted the importance of high spatiotemporal resolution ecostress data in identifying areas under potentially high risk of fire and assessing post fire vegetation recovery these practical applications call for the comprehensive assessment of ecostress products fisher et al 2020 performed the first evaluation of ecostress pt jpl product at 82 eddy covariance ec sites across the globe the results revealed that clear sky et from ecostress was in good agreement with site measurements in various ecosystems another study assessing ecostress pt jpl product for reference et i e et over well watered standardized pastures estimates also showed good performance of the products in california kohli et al 2020 the evaluation of ecostress disalexi product has also been accomplished at 26 eddy covariance sites over the contiguous united states the results demonstrated that pixels with high aerosol optical depth or high view zenith angles considerably impacted the ecostress estimates cawse nicholson et al 2021 based on these evaluations the capability of ecostress has been demonstrated to some extent yet its performance for crop water use quantification in agroecosystems remains unknown in this study we selected a subset of paired ameriflux cropland sites to investigate ecostress s capability to capture the magnitude diurnal cycle seasonal cycle and the spatial distribution of et over the agroecosystems our analysis addresses three questions 1 can ecostress et capture et at cropland sites 2 which ecostress et product pt jpl vs disalexi performs better in estimating crop et 3 can ecostress identify crop types and agricultural management practices over heterogeneous land surfaces 2 materials and methods 2 1 ameriflux in situ data we used measured fluxes and associated biophysical and ancillary data at ameriflux sites https ameriflux lbl gov ameriflux is one of the regional networks of the fluxnet with hundreds of flux towers around the world baldocchi et al 2001 baldocchi 2008 equipped with ec systems it provides reliable ground observations of water energy carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and biosphere we selected sites located in croplands international geosphere biosphere programme classification cro with at least one year of complete data available from jul 2018 to dec 2020 during which ecostress data are also fully available and with paired sites at least two sites with similar climates with distance 10 km following the criteria we selected 15 sites and grouped them into six categories table 1 fig 1 shows the geographic locations and landscape characteristics of the sites in each group all the selected 15 sites are located in the usa with different agricultural lands for food crops e g corn maize wheat potato and grass for bioenergy and grazing with or without irrigation the maximum distance between the paired sites is 6347 m between us cs1 and us cs4 and the minimum distance is 369 m between us kl2 and us kl3 local climates at these sites vary substantially with 2 climate types across the 15 sites hot summer mediterranean climate csa 2 sites and hot summer humid continental climate dfa 13 sites mean annual temperature mat ranging from 6 4 to 16 c and mean annual precipitation map ranging from 338 to 1027 mm differ sharply across the sites latent heat flux le and micrometeorological data were collected at the 15 ameriflux sites three sites offered hourly data us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 while others provided half hourly data missing data marked as 9999 were gap filled following the method of reichstein et al 2005 to reduce the le uncertainty induced by the energy imbalance issue we further corrected le by energy balance closure jiang et al 2021 the correction requires another three energy balance components in addition to le net radiation rn sensible heat flux h and soil heat flux g we corrected the le at 8 sites where all the four energy balance components are available us bi1 us bi2 us km4 us ne1 us ne2 us ne3 us ro5 and us ro6 table 2 some sites also provided le and h storage sle and sh respectively table 2 if available these storage fluxes were also considered in the energy balance closure correction 2 2 ecostress and other satellite data ecostress provides high spatiotemporal resolution observations of plant water use and carbon assimilation at a sub daily scale xiao et al 2021 in this study we focus on crop water use i e et assessment using two ecostress et products eco3etptjpl v001 referred to as pt jpl and eco3etalexi v001 referred to as disalexi for pt jpl developed by fisher et al 2020 et is calculated from potential et pet also known as actual et when soil is fully wetted using priestley taylor pt model priestley and taylor 1972 fisher et al 2008 and 2020 1 p e t Œ± Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n where pet is the potential et w m 2 Œ± is a unitless coefficient of 1 26 Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation to vapor pressure curve Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant of 0 066 kpa c rn is the net radiation w m 2 pet is constrained to actual et through ecophysiological constraints dependent on climatic and vegetation indices although the parameter Œ± is highly affected by local conditions in the original pt model the pt jpl model has incorporated local conditions in its ecophysiological constraint functions a recent study also confirmed the application of a fixed value for Œ± in pt jpl mode for estimating agroecosystem et jiang et al 2022 for disalexi developed by anderson et al 2021 et is retrieved as the residual of the surface energy balance using a multi scale alexi disalexi modeling system alexi atmosphere land exchange inverse is a regional model it provides flux estimates at the coarse scale by relating time differentail lst observed from geostationary satellite to the time intergrated energy balance cawse nicholson and anderson 2021 for finer resolution an alexi flux disaggregation scheme disalexi has been developed using higher resolution lst information from different systems or platforms as for eco3etalexi product used in this study lst is derived from ecostress level 2 product the partitioning of surface fluxes into the soil and canopy is accomplished by the two source balance model we downloaded the two et products from 09 july 2018 available since then to 31 december 2020 at the 15 ameriflux cropland sites from application for extracting and exploring analysis ready samples https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov appeears pt jpl et product provides instantaneous and daily daytime et values in w m 2 the components and uncertainty of instantaneous et are also provided disalexi et product only offers daily daytime et values in mm d 1 and the associated uncertainty to match the le values at the ameriflux sites we converted disalexi et to w m 2 and expressed the site measured le as et in w m 2 in the following sections it should be noted that we defined daytime as 6 00 to 18 00 local time when converting et unit from mm d 1 to w m 2 to analyze the relationship between ecostress et and crop phenology we used modis mcd15a3h v006 leaf area index lai as an indicator of crop phenology mcd15a3h has a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 4 days 2 3 analysis flux tower has a footprint area the extent of the source area contributing to the flux measurements magnitude from 103 to 107 m2 depending on measurement heights land cover etc chu et al 2021 following fisher et al 2020 we extracted 5 5 ecostress pixels i e an area of 350 m 350 m centered on the site coordinates for ecostress scenes that overpassed the sites the median of the 5 5 pixel values was used as ecostress observations for the sites all the analyses were performed in matlab r2020a 3 results 3 1 diurnal et comparison the diurnal patterns of the observed et for the whole year from ec are distinct fig 2 at around 6 00 et began to increase the value peaked at around 14 00 and then steadily declined during the afternoon until 20 00 the analysis varies from site to site but instantaneous et from pt jpl generally matched with the ec observations pt jpl et also showed a similar diurnal pattern but the morning onset of et was about two hours earlier thus the diurnal peak was shifted to midday the early onset hour implies an overestimation of et in the morning with pt jpl et beyond the upper bound of the observation range three sites us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 are exceptions with an early onset and a late ending that result in an overestimation during the whole daytime diurnal cycles in different seasons presented similar patterns figs s1 4 it is found that pt jpl et was contained within the range of ec et during spring autumn and winter but higher than the observation in the summer thus we ascribed the overestimation of pt jpl et to the overestimation of et in summer in the northern hemisphere summer is the mid season stage for crops when the crops are fully developed with a larger leaf area leading to more transpiration through photosynthesis 3 2 daily et comparison the daily et from pt jpl and disalexi between the study period were compared to assess the consistency of these two products in general disalexi performed better than pt jpl in estimating daily et compared with flux tower measurements fig 3 at 11 out of 15 sites the correlation between disalexi daily et and ec observations was statistically significant p 0 05 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 82 at site us bi2 to 0 22 at siteus kl1 in contrast pt jpl tended to overestimate the daily et with six sites showing a significant but relatively weak correlation the maximum correclation coefficient was 0 60 at us ne1 the rmse also demonstrates the better performance of disalexi it should be noted that site us cs1 was excluded for comparison due to its small number of data 3 3 et seasonal cycle comparison the observed et from ec showed a clear seasonal pattern at all 15 sites with an increase during the crop development stage until reaching the maximum at the mid season stage summer in the northern hemisphere et then gradually declined until reaching the bottom in the late season stage fig 4 in general both pt jpl and disalexi captured the observed seasonal variability although data was lacking in the winter months making the seasonal cycle incomplete as for the magnitudes disalexi produced more good results close to the ec observations while pt jpl tended to overestimate the values at several sites we further evaluated the ecostress et dependency on crop phenology i e lai it is found that both pt jpl and disalexi et captured the crop phenological stages fig 4 besides both pt jpl et and disalexi et showed a positive correlation with lai at most sites except for us cs1 us cs2 and us cs4 fig 5 for each site the positive correlation in disalexi was higher than that in pt jpl illustrating the stronger dependency on crop phenology of disalexi et than pt jpl et 3 4 spatial patterns comparison to investigate the ability of the two products in identifying the heterogeneity of agroecosystems a visual comparison was made over the sites us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 as well as the surrounding area fig 6a and b these three sites were chosen because they have different crop types and agricultural management practices allowing us to assess if ecostress can capture cropland et over complex land surfaces the scenes are in nebraska covering regions of approximately 204 km2 the time selection was limited to august the growing season in the us and a month with little cloud impact the comparison also included modis et retrievals from terra mod16a2gf fig 6c and aqua myd16a2gf fig 6d at 500 m spatial resolution all four scenes show a similar spatial pattern with low et in the south and north they also estimated a higher et at the cropland sites compared with the adjacent regions for the selected scenes pt jpl performed best in capturing the features of small ecosystem patches and individual croplands fig 1g and fig 6a but tended to overestimate the magnitude of et compared with other models disalexi could also identify the heterogeneity but not as fine as pt jpl it should be noted that the scenes can only represent one period so the comparison is partially valid what we focus on is the higher capability of the high resolution pt jpl and disalexi in capturing the heterogeneous features in agricultural lands compared with modis et retrievals 4 discussion 4 1 overestimation of pt jpl et our assessment revealed the overestimation of daily et as well as the higher instantaneous et in the morning and in the summer from ecostress pt jpl at 15 agricultural flux sites in america the result is inconsistent with the previous assessment carried out by fisher et al 2020 in which the evaluation of instantaneous et from pt jpl was made at 82 eddy covariance sites globally and showed a good correlation r2 0 88 several reasons account for the discrepancy first our evaluation focused on cropland an ecosystem that featured high heterogeneity which weakens the performance of pt jpl a previous study found that modeled daily et correlated better with ec for all biomes than for cropland herrmann et al 2011 another evaluation of ecostress pt jpl et in humid temperate forests also showed a considerable overestimation r2 0 43 further demonstrating the lower performance in the complex ecosystem besides the inclusion of cloudy days in our assessments may affect the evaluation result pt jpl has been reported poor performance on cloudy days liu et al 2021 previous research normally excluded the cloudy day data however to maximum the limited data in the cropland our assessment included these cloudy days the overestimation of pt jpl et in the morning was also reported by other studies for example a prior study revealed overestimation of instantaneous and daily pt jpl et in a humid temperate forest ecosystem due to misrepresenting local climatic conditions poor upscaling of instantaneous measurement to the daily scale on cloudy days and inadequately characterizing surface vegetation index liu et al 2021 our study showed an overestimation of pt jpl instantaneous data in the morning particularly when et is high on sunny days this overestimation may result from misrepresentation of micrometeorological conditions in the morning on a sunny morning local micrometeorological conditions e g rn and relative humidity shift drastically which greatly affects pt jpl estimates liu et al 2021 however the climatic inputs of pt jpl are spatially and temporally relatively coarse that cannot well capture the shifts in micrometeorological conditions leading to uncertainties in et estimates in the morning extrapolation of daily et from instantaneous values would also bring in uncertainties ecostress takes observations at the time of satellite overpass and converts them to full day et the relationship between solar radiation and et was fixed in daily scaling leading to errors despite the overestimation it should be noted that ec measurements were contained with pt jpl uncertainty confirming the reliability of the pt jpl et product 4 2 the higher fidelity of disalexi than pt jpl our comparison of et values from pt jpl and disalexi models showed that disalexi had higher fidelity even so it should be noted that the performance of disalexi varied a lot among sites for example the high correlation and low rmse at sites us ne1 and us ne2 compared with that at us kl1 and us km4 the differences in model behavior among sites may be attributed to the different local landscape characteristics us ne1 and us ne2 are typical irrigated crop sites and the surrounding regions are relatively homogeneous in contrast the adjacent land surfaces of the latter two sites are complex us kl1 and us km4 are close to the reservoir and forests respectively fig 1 the complex land surfaces with rapid change in roughness and evaporative fraction affect land atmosphere interactions and may make et more difficult to quantify resulting in poor performance of disalexi this further highlights the importance of accurately representing local conditions particularly in the complex landscape with drastic changes in the micrometeorological variables and land surface properties liu et al 2021 it could also explain the higher fidelity of disalexi than pt jpl to some extent first the input climatic and land surface property data deriving disalexi et are finer spatially than pt jpl as for the disalexi et model the inputs include land surface reflectance at 30 m from landsat lai at 500 m from modis meteorological inputs from the climate forecast system reanalysis at 0 25 and canopy characteristics land cover type at 30 m from national land cover dataset cawse nicholson et al 2020 in comparison the inputs of pt jpl et e g land surface property from modis at 500 m and meteorological data from ncep at 2 cawse nicholson et al 2020 cawse nicholson and anderson 2021 are much coarser in the spatial resolution that potentially misrepresent the heterogeneity of land surface and climates besides disalexi has typically been more regionally because it depends on geostationary observations for example disalexi derives the internal coupled atmospheric boundary layer model instead of using the prescribed above canopy air temperature conditions which helps incorporate the local land atmospheric feedback in comparison pt jpl is run globally and does not need site specific parameters fish et al 2020 4 3 the effects of field management and crop types on ecostress estimates factors affecting crop water use include the climate field management crop type and the growth stage among them field management affects the water received by crops irrigated croplands receive water from both precipitation and irrigation to wet soil thus irrigated croplands usually hold more soil moisture than adjacent rainfed croplands the higher soil moisture not only stimulates plant photosynthesis and transpiration rate but also boosts soil evaporation both of which result in higher et in our study ec measurements revealed higher et in irrigated croplands e g us ne2 irrigated maize soybean rotation site than in adjacent rainfed croplands lands us ne3 rainfed maize soybean rotation site this excess was also captured by both pt jpl fig 6a and disalexi fig 6b as for crop type it affects the duration of the growing seasons and the daily water demands of a fully grown crop for example when grown in the same area a fully developed maize with a large leaf area will demand more peak water per day than a fully grown crop of onions as shown in fig 4 ec et showed the ability to differentiate the crop types the peak daily water use of maize site us ne1 and maize soybean rotation site us ne2 us ne3 are higher than those of switchgrass us kl2 and prairie site us kl3 with a similar local climate both the two ecostress products can also isolate the differences between crop types to some extent for example both us ne2 and us ne1 irrigated continuous maize site are irrigated but with different crop types and ecostress showed higher et of us ne2 than us ne1 which aligns with in situ measurements fig 6a and b to conclude despite the small sample size 15 sites grouped into 6 categories these comparisons and validation highlight the importance and applicability of high resolution ecostress observations in heterogeneous croplands for precision agriculture management more sites with different irrigation management and crop types are needed to further demonstrate ecostrss s ability to reflect the spatial patterns of et at the local scale 4 4 high resolution data for practical applications the higher resolution ecostress level 3 and 4 products could provide practical information for local applications the ecostress pixels are at 70 m spatial resolution similar to the size of small ecosystem patches and individual croplands xiao et al 2021 thus the data could be implemented for local or field scale applications for example earlier work revealed that et from the water balance method using coarse data 0 5 with monthly interval from the gravity recovery and climate experiment are higher than estimates from the land surface model using the ecostress data this inconsistency was attributed to the fine scale irrigation not captured by models but could be detected by mass conservation pascolini campbell et al 2021 irrigation usually performed at a small scale can account for 35 of et but cannot be detected by coarse et products resulting in uncertainties in et estimates currently using other satellite observations the ecostress data can even be spatially downscaled to a finer scale than 70 m through data fusion aragon et al 2018 for example combined with landsat observations the ecostress data have been successfully downscaled to 30 m resolution for daily et mapping anderson et al 2021 the ecostress data also offer high resolution maps of crop water stress isolating farmlands that need and do not need irrigation for better precision agriculture management an application of the ecostress evaporative stress index i e the ratio of et to potential et that can describe the plant water stress has successfully categorized irrigated lands by identifying higher ecostress et than adjacent regions aragon et al 2018 the multiple observations in one day provide valuable data for diurnal analysis of regional water use previous studies have extensively revealed the diurnal cycle of plant water use at leaf plant and field scales through field experiments feng and et al 2017 2019 for example midday depression of photosynthesis resulting from stomatal closure due to higher air temperature in the summer decreases plant transpiration resulting in a diurnal cycle of photosynthesis transpiration like a bimodal curve xiao et al 2021 koyama and takemoto 2014 this phenomenon has been extensively reported at plant and field scales however regional and global patterns of midday depression of photosynthesis remain unknown the emergence of the ecostress makes this possible a previous study has reported the diurnal cycle of et using the ecostress data fisher et al 2020 our study also observed the diurnal changes in et at some ameriflux sites however due to limited data two and half year observations it is still challenging to analyze regional and global patterns of et diurnally in different biomes and climates 4 5 caveats and limitations there are some uncertainties associated with energy balance closure ebc and the footprint area ec energy fluxes like le are typically underestimated from an energy budget point of view so those fluxes have to be corrected for the ebc gap by default which means only 8 out of 15 sites with full net radiation and soil heat flux measurements meet the requirement in this research however correcting latent heat flux by ebc method may bring another uncertainty because many reasons account for the land surface energy imbalance rather than le itself to strike a balance between maximum sample size and minimum uncertainty we used all the 15 sites but added a controlled trial we compared the daily et values from the 8 sites with corrected fig 3 and uncorrected ebc fig s5 and found no distinct differences besides the pixel to footprint mismatch would also bring some uncertainties the ameriflux sites have dynamic footprints that vary in different landscapes and months chu et al 2021 thus using ecostress pixels inside the footprint area dynamically in different months and sites provide a better representation of footprints liu et al 2021 however due to the lack of ancillary data for footprint calculation in each site we cannot quantify the dynamic footprint so we adopted a fixed footprint area equivalent to 5 5 ecostress pixels in order to reduce the influence of small footprint area and land surface heterogeneity we further used a subset of 3 3 pixels i e representing an area of 210 m 210 m as an alternative following the previous study fisher et al 2020 it is found that results are almost the same as those obtained from 5 5 pixels figs s6 s8 supporting the robustness of our conclusion 5 conclusions focusing on evapotranspiration et also known as crop water use in the agricultural sector this study evaluated the two high spatiotemporal resolution ecostress et products pt jpl vs disalexi using eddy covariance observations at 15 agricultural flux sites in america between 09 july 2018 31 december 2020 it is found that pt jpl captured the diurnal variability but tended to overestimate et in the morning and in the summer both pt jpl and disalexi captured the seasonal pattern and the dependency on crop phenology of et during the study period but disalexi outperformed pt jpl in the estimation of daily et magnitude the possible explanations include differences in the resolution of the input data and the representation of local conditions despite the small sample size 15 sites grouped into 6 categories the visual comparisons and validations demonstrated the higher capability of pt jpl and disalexi in identifying crop types and agricultural management practices over heterogeneous land surfaces in agroecosystems compared with modis et retrievals which has significant implications for practical applications at local or field scales such as irrigation detection and

disalexi performs better in estimating crop et 3 can ecostress identify crop types and agricultural management practices over heterogeneous land surfaces 2 materials and methods 2 1 ameriflux in situ data we used measured fluxes and associated biophysical and ancillary data at ameriflux sites https ameriflux lbl gov ameriflux is one of the regional networks of the fluxnet with hundreds of flux towers around the world baldocchi et al 2001 baldocchi 2008 equipped with ec systems it provides reliable ground observations of water energy carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and biosphere we selected sites located in croplands international geosphere biosphere programme classification cro with at least one year of complete data available from jul 2018 to dec 2020 during which ecostress data are also fully available and with paired sites at least two sites with similar climates with distance 10 km following the criteria we selected 15 sites and grouped them into six categories table 1 fig 1 shows the geographic locations and landscape characteristics of the sites in each group all the selected 15 sites are located in the usa with different agricultural lands for food crops e g corn maize wheat potato and grass for bioenergy and grazing with or without irrigation the maximum distance between the paired sites is 6347 m between us cs1 and us cs4 and the minimum distance is 369 m between us kl2 and us kl3 local climates at these sites vary substantially with 2 climate types across the 15 sites hot summer mediterranean climate csa 2 sites and hot summer humid continental climate dfa 13 sites mean annual temperature mat ranging from 6 4 to 16 c and mean annual precipitation map ranging from 338 to 1027 mm differ sharply across the sites latent heat flux le and micrometeorological data were collected at the 15 ameriflux sites three sites offered hourly data us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 while others provided half hourly data missing data marked as 9999 were gap filled following the method of reichstein et al 2005 to reduce the le uncertainty induced by the energy imbalance issue we further corrected le by energy balance closure jiang et al 2021 the correction requires another three energy balance components in addition to le net radiation rn sensible heat flux h and soil heat flux g we corrected the le at 8 sites where all the four energy balance components are available us bi1 us bi2 us km4 us ne1 us ne2 us ne3 us ro5 and us ro6 table 2 some sites also provided le and h storage sle and sh respectively table 2 if available these storage fluxes were also considered in the energy balance closure correction 2 2 ecostress and other satellite data ecostress provides high spatiotemporal resolution observations of plant water use and carbon assimilation at a sub daily scale xiao et al 2021 in this study we focus on crop water use i e et assessment using two ecostress et products eco3etptjpl v001 referred to as pt jpl and eco3etalexi v001 referred to as disalexi for pt jpl developed by fisher et al 2020 et is calculated from potential et pet also known as actual et when soil is fully wetted using priestley taylor pt model priestley and taylor 1972 fisher et al 2008 and 2020 1 p e t Œ± Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n where pet is the potential et w m 2 Œ± is a unitless coefficient of 1 26 Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation to vapor pressure curve Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant of 0 066 kpa c rn is the net radiation w m 2 pet is constrained to actual et through ecophysiological constraints dependent on climatic and vegetation indices although the parameter Œ± is highly affected by local conditions in the original pt model the pt jpl model has incorporated local conditions in its ecophysiological constraint functions a recent study also confirmed the application of a fixed value for Œ± in pt jpl mode for estimating agroecosystem et jiang et al 2022 for disalexi developed by anderson et al 2021 et is retrieved as the residual of the surface energy balance using a multi scale alexi disalexi modeling system alexi atmosphere land exchange inverse is a regional model it provides flux estimates at the coarse scale by relating time differentail lst observed from geostationary satellite to the time intergrated energy balance cawse nicholson and anderson 2021 for finer resolution an alexi flux disaggregation scheme disalexi has been developed using higher resolution lst information from different systems or platforms as for eco3etalexi product used in this study lst is derived from ecostress level 2 product the partitioning of surface fluxes into the soil and canopy is accomplished by the two source balance model we downloaded the two et products from 09 july 2018 available since then to 31 december 2020 at the 15 ameriflux cropland sites from application for extracting and exploring analysis ready samples https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov appeears pt jpl et product provides instantaneous and daily daytime et values in w m 2 the components and uncertainty of instantaneous et are also provided disalexi et product only offers daily daytime et values in mm d 1 and the associated uncertainty to match the le values at the ameriflux sites we converted disalexi et to w m 2 and expressed the site measured le as et in w m 2 in the following sections it should be noted that we defined daytime as 6 00 to 18 00 local time when converting et unit from mm d 1 to w m 2 to analyze the relationship between ecostress et and crop phenology we used modis mcd15a3h v006 leaf area index lai as an indicator of crop phenology mcd15a3h has a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 4 days 2 3 analysis flux tower has a footprint area the extent of the source area contributing to the flux measurements magnitude from 103 to 107 m2 depending on measurement heights land cover etc chu et al 2021 following fisher et al 2020 we extracted 5 5 ecostress pixels i e an area of 350 m 350 m centered on the site coordinates for ecostress scenes that overpassed the sites the median of the 5 5 pixel values was used as ecostress observations for the sites all the analyses were performed in matlab r2020a 3 results 3 1 diurnal et comparison the diurnal patterns of the observed et for the whole year from ec are distinct fig 2 at around 6 00 et began to increase the value peaked at around 14 00 and then steadily declined during the afternoon until 20 00 the analysis varies from site to site but instantaneous et from pt jpl generally matched with the ec observations pt jpl et also showed a similar diurnal pattern but the morning onset of et was about two hours earlier thus the diurnal peak was shifted to midday the early onset hour implies an overestimation of et in the morning with pt jpl et beyond the upper bound of the observation range three sites us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 are exceptions with an early onset and a late ending that result in an overestimation during the whole daytime diurnal cycles in different seasons presented similar patterns figs s1 4 it is found that pt jpl et was contained within the range of ec et during spring autumn and winter but higher than the observation in the summer thus we ascribed the overestimation of pt jpl et to the overestimation of et in summer in the northern hemisphere summer is the mid season stage for crops when the crops are fully developed with a larger leaf area leading to more transpiration through photosynthesis 3 2 daily et comparison the daily et from pt jpl and disalexi between the study period were compared to assess the consistency of these two products in general disalexi performed better than pt jpl in estimating daily et compared with flux tower measurements fig 3 at 11 out of 15 sites the correlation between disalexi daily et and ec observations was statistically significant p 0 05 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 82 at site us bi2 to 0 22 at siteus kl1 in contrast pt jpl tended to overestimate the daily et with six sites showing a significant but relatively weak correlation the maximum correclation coefficient was 0 60 at us ne1 the rmse also demonstrates the better performance of disalexi it should be noted that site us cs1 was excluded for comparison due to its small number of data 3 3 et seasonal cycle comparison the observed et from ec showed a clear seasonal pattern at all 15 sites with an increase during the crop development stage until reaching the maximum at the mid season stage summer in the northern hemisphere et then gradually declined until reaching the bottom in the late season stage fig 4 in general both pt jpl and disalexi captured the observed seasonal variability although data was lacking in the winter months making the seasonal cycle incomplete as for the magnitudes disalexi produced more good results close to the ec observations while pt jpl tended to overestimate the values at several sites we further evaluated the ecostress et dependency on crop phenology i e lai it is found that both pt jpl and disalexi et captured the crop phenological stages fig 4 besides both pt jpl et and disalexi et showed a positive correlation with lai at most sites except for us cs1 us cs2 and us cs4 fig 5 for each site the positive correlation in disalexi was higher than that in pt jpl illustrating the stronger dependency on crop phenology of disalexi et than pt jpl et 3 4 spatial patterns comparison to investigate the ability of the two products in identifying the heterogeneity of agroecosystems a visual comparison was made over the sites us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 as well as the surrounding area fig 6a and b these three sites were chosen because they have different crop types and agricultural management practices allowing us to assess if ecostress can capture cropland et over complex land surfaces the scenes are in nebraska covering regions of approximately 204 km2 the time selection was limited to august the growing season in the us and a month with little cloud impact the comparison also included modis et retrievals from terra mod16a2gf fig 6c and aqua myd16a2gf fig 6d at 500 m spatial resolution all four scenes show a similar spatial pattern with low et in the south and north they also estimated a higher et at the cropland sites compared with the adjacent regions for the selected scenes pt jpl performed best in capturing the features of small ecosystem patches and individual croplands fig 1g and fig 6a but tended to overestimate the magnitude of et compared with other models disalexi could also identify the heterogeneity but not as fine as pt jpl it should be noted that the scenes can only represent one period so the comparison is partially valid what we focus on is the higher capability of the high resolution pt jpl and disalexi in capturing the heterogeneous features in agricultural lands compared with modis et retrievals 4 discussion 4 1 overestimation of pt jpl et our assessment revealed the overestimation of daily et as well as the higher instantaneous et in the morning and in the summer from ecostress pt jpl at 15 agricultural flux sites in america the result is inconsistent with the previous assessment carried out by fisher et al 2020 in which the evaluation of instantaneous et from pt jpl was made at 82 eddy covariance sites globally and showed a good correlation r2 0 88 several reasons account for the discrepancy first our evaluation focused on cropland an ecosystem that featured high heterogeneity which weakens the performance of pt jpl a previous study found that modeled daily et correlated better with ec for all biomes than for cropland herrmann et al 2011 another evaluation of ecostress pt jpl et in humid temperate forests also showed a considerable overestimation r2 0 43 further demonstrating the lower performance in the complex ecosystem besides the inclusion of cloudy days in our assessments may affect the evaluation result pt jpl has been reported poor performance on cloudy days liu et al 2021 previous research normally excluded the cloudy day data however to maximum the limited data in the cropland our assessment included these cloudy days the overestimation of pt jpl et in the morning was also reported by other studies for example a prior study revealed overestimation of instantaneous and daily pt jpl et in a humid temperate forest ecosystem due to misrepresenting local climatic conditions poor upscaling of instantaneous measurement to the daily scale on cloudy days and inadequately characterizing surface vegetation index liu et al 2021 our study showed an overestimation of pt jpl instantaneous data in the morning particularly when et is high on sunny days this overestimation may result from misrepresentation of micrometeorological conditions in the morning on a sunny morning local micrometeorological conditions e g rn and relative humidity shift drastically which greatly affects pt jpl estimates liu et al 2021 however the climatic inputs of pt jpl are spatially and temporally relatively coarse that cannot well capture the shifts in micrometeorological conditions leading to uncertainties in et estimates in the morning extrapolation of daily et from instantaneous values would also bring in uncertainties ecostress takes observations at the time of satellite overpass and converts them to full day et the relationship between solar radiation and et was fixed in daily scaling leading to errors despite the overestimation it should be noted that ec measurements were contained with pt jpl uncertainty confirming the reliability of the pt jpl et product 4 2 the higher fidelity of disalexi than pt jpl our comparison of et values from pt jpl and disalexi models showed that disalexi had higher fidelity even so it should be noted that the performance of disalexi varied a lot among sites for example the high correlation and low rmse at sites us ne1 and us ne2 compared with that at us kl1 and us km4 the differences in model behavior among sites may be attributed to the different local landscape characteristics us ne1 and us ne2 are typical irrigated crop sites and the surrounding regions are relatively homogeneous in contrast the adjacent land surfaces of the latter two sites are complex us kl1 and us km4 are close to the reservoir and forests respectively fig 1 the complex land surfaces with rapid change in roughness and evaporative fraction affect land atmosphere interactions and may make et more difficult to quantify resulting in poor performance of disalexi this further highlights the importance of accurately representing local conditions particularly in the complex landscape with drastic changes in the micrometeorological variables and land surface properties liu et al 2021 it could also explain the higher fidelity of disalexi than pt jpl to some extent first the input climatic and land surface property data deriving disalexi et are finer spatially than pt jpl as for the disalexi et model the inputs include land surface reflectance at 30 m from landsat lai at 500 m from modis meteorological inputs from the climate forecast system reanalysis at 0 25 and canopy characteristics land cover type at 30 m from national land cover dataset cawse nicholson et al 2020 in comparison the inputs of pt jpl et e g land surface property from modis at 500 m and meteorological data from ncep at 2 cawse nicholson et al 2020 cawse nicholson and anderson 2021 are much coarser in the spatial resolution that potentially misrepresent the heterogeneity of land surface and climates besides disalexi has typically been more regionally because it depends on geostationary observations for example disalexi derives the internal coupled atmospheric boundary layer model instead of using the prescribed above canopy air temperature conditions which helps incorporate the local land atmospheric feedback in comparison pt jpl is run globally and does not need site specific parameters fish et al 2020 4 3 the effects of field management and crop types on ecostress estimates factors affecting crop water use include the climate field management crop type and the growth stage among them field management affects the water received by crops irrigated croplands receive water from both precipitation and irrigation to wet soil thus irrigated croplands usually hold more soil moisture than adjacent rainfed croplands the higher soil moisture not only stimulates plant photosynthesis and transpiration rate but also boosts soil evaporation both of which result in higher et in our study ec measurements revealed higher et in irrigated croplands e g us ne2 irrigated maize soybean rotation site than in adjacent rainfed croplands lands us ne3 rainfed maize soybean rotation site this excess was also captured by both pt jpl fig 6a and disalexi fig 6b as for crop type it affects the duration of the growing seasons and the daily water demands of a fully grown crop for example when grown in the same area a fully developed maize with a large leaf area will demand more peak water per day than a fully grown crop of onions as shown in fig 4 ec et showed the ability to differentiate the crop types the peak daily water use of maize site us ne1 and maize soybean rotation site us ne2 us ne3 are higher than those of switchgrass us kl2 and prairie site us kl3 with a similar local climate both the two ecostress products can also isolate the differences between crop types to some extent for example both us ne2 and us ne1 irrigated continuous maize site are irrigated but with different crop types and ecostress showed higher et of us ne2 than us ne1 which aligns with in situ measurements fig 6a and b to conclude despite the small sample size 15 sites grouped into 6 categories these comparisons and validation highlight the importance and applicability of high resolution ecostress observations in heterogeneous croplands for precision agriculture management more sites with different irrigation management and crop types are needed to further demonstrate ecostrss s ability to reflect the spatial patterns of et at the local scale 4 4 high resolution data for practical applications the higher resolution ecostress level 3 and 4 products could provide practical information for local applications the ecostress pixels are at 70 m spatial resolution similar to the size of small ecosystem patches and individual croplands xiao et al 2021 thus the data could be implemented for local or field scale applications for example earlier work revealed that et from the water balance method using coarse data 0 5 with monthly interval from the gravity recovery and climate experiment are higher than estimates from the land surface model using the ecostress data this inconsistency was attributed to the fine scale irrigation not captured by models but could be detected by mass conservation pascolini campbell et al 2021 irrigation usually performed at a small scale can account for 35 of et but cannot be detected by coarse et products resulting in uncertainties in et estimates currently using other satellite observations the ecostress data can even be spatially downscaled to a finer scale than 70 m through data fusion aragon et al 2018 for example combined with landsat observations the ecostress data have been successfully downscaled to 30 m resolution for daily et mapping anderson et al 2021 the ecostress data also offer high resolution maps of crop water stress isolating farmlands that need and do not need irrigation for better precision agriculture management an application of the ecostress evaporative stress index i e the ratio of et to potential et that can describe the plant water stress has successfully categorized irrigated lands by identifying higher ecostress et than adjacent regions aragon et al 2018 the multiple observations in one day provide valuable data for diurnal analysis of regional water use previous studies have extensively revealed the diurnal cycle of plant water use at leaf plant and field scales through field experiments feng and et al 2017 2019 for example midday depression of photosynthesis resulting from stomatal closure due to higher air temperature in the summer decreases plant transpiration resulting in a diurnal cycle of photosynthesis transpiration like a bimodal curve xiao et al 2021 koyama and takemoto 2014 this phenomenon has been extensively reported at plant and field scales however regional and global patterns of midday depression of photosynthesis remain unknown the emergence of the ecostress makes this possible a previous study has reported the diurnal cycle of et using the ecostress data fisher et al 2020 our study also observed the diurnal changes in et at some ameriflux sites however due to limited data two and half year observations it is still challenging to analyze regional and global patterns of et diurnally in different biomes and climates 4 5 caveats and limitations there are some uncertainties associated with energy balance closure ebc and the footprint area ec energy fluxes like le are typically underestimated from an energy budget point of view so those fluxes have to be corrected for the ebc gap by default which means only 8 out of 15 sites with full net radiation and soil heat flux measurements meet the requirement in this research however correcting latent heat flux by ebc method may bring another uncertainty because many reasons account for the land surface energy imbalance rather than le itself to strike a balance between maximum sample size and minimum uncertainty we used all the 15 sites but added a controlled trial we compared the daily et values from the 8 sites with corrected fig 3 and uncorrected ebc fig s5 and found no distinct differences besides the pixel to footprint mismatch would also bring some uncertainties the ameriflux sites have dynamic footprints that vary in different landscapes and months chu et al 2021 thus using ecostress pixels inside the footprint area dynamically in different months and sites provide a better representation of footprints liu et al 2021 however due to the lack of ancillary data for footprint calculation in each site we cannot quantify the dynamic footprint so we adopted a fixed footprint area equivalent to 5 5 ecostress pixels in order to reduce the influence of small footprint area and land surface heterogeneity we further used a subset of 3 3 pixels i e representing an area of 210 m 210 m as an alternative following the previous study fisher et al 2020 it is found that results are almost the same as those obtained from 5 5 pixels figs s6 s8 supporting the robustness of our conclusion 5 conclusions focusing on evapotranspiration et also known as crop water use in the agricultural sector this study evaluated the two high spatiotemporal resolution ecostress et products pt jpl vs disalexi using eddy covariance observations at 15 agricultural flux sites in america between 09 july 2018 31 december 2020 it is found that pt jpl captured the diurnal variability but tended to overestimate et in the morning and in the summer both pt jpl and disalexi captured the seasonal pattern and the dependency on crop phenology of et during the study period but disalexi outperformed pt jpl in the estimation of daily et magnitude the possible explanations include differences in the resolution of the input data and the representation of local conditions despite the small sample size 15 sites grouped into 6 categories the visual comparisons and validations demonstrated the higher capability of pt jpl and disalexi in identifying crop types and agricultural management practices over heterogeneous land surfaces in agroecosystems compared with modis et retrievals which has significant implications for practical applications at local or field scales such as irrigation detection and
