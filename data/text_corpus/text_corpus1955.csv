9775,determining the irrigation demands of rice in a humid region is essential for water conservation through improving rainfall utilization in southern china in this paper six representative rice areas in southern china were selected and the daily reference evapotranspiration eto of the representative stations during 1953 2017 was calculated using the penman monteith method the daily crop evapotranspiration etc was computed using the single crop coefficient method and the irrigation scheduling under flood irrigation fi was obtained by establishing a field water balance model the characteristics and trends of the irrigation demand of early middle and late rice as well as the irrigation changes under a double to single cropping pattern were also analyzed with advanced statistical tests the results indicated that most of the abundant rainfall was concentrated in the growth period of early rice in southern china early rice required less water 135 0 mm and even no irrigation in some wet years while middle and late rice required more irrigation water 288 1 mm and 265 2 mm respectively the key reasons for the differences in irrigation demand among the three rice types are the amount and distribution characteristics of rainfall during the rice growth period in addition the irrigation demands of rice showed a downward trend as a response to a decrease in etc and the increase in rainfall in the past 60 years where rainfall was the dominant factor with this increasing trend of rainfall and its better and efficient utilization in the future rice irrigation demands may be further reduced or completely stopped under the double to single cropping pattern irrigation demand decreased by 16 on average and the irrigation frequency as well as the drainage volume burden were simultaneously reduced keywords rice southern china irrigation characteristic trend change double rice to single rice 1 introduction rice one of the most important staple food crops globally has a higher water requirement than other crops bouman et al 2007 pimentel et al 2007 faostat 2014 furthermore it accounts for 19 of the world s cultivated area and supports more than 3 billion people on the earth van nguyen and ferrero 2006 fao 2019 it is one of the three major food crops in china cao et al 2019 more than 92 of rice in china is cultivated in the southern humid regions mao 2002 and rice cultivation consumes more than 65 of the available agricultural irrigation water li et al 2016 nevertheless severe water shortages have threatened rice production in china due to the conflicts caused by population growth and the competition for water resources efficient utilization of water resources is one of the most important components for sustainable rice production and producing more rice with less water is a formidable challenge in the face of an increasingly global food demand and intensifying water shortages rijsberman 2006 tuong and bouman 2009 carracelas et al 2019 generally flooded paddy fields are used to produce large quantities of rice watanabe 2019 and water requirement for maintaining a stable water supply and continuous flooding will undoubtedly over exploit water resources in response to the great challenge of water scarcity rice water saving irrigation technologies such as non flooded mulching cultivation liu et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 aerobic rice systems belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 dang et al 2018 alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation bouman and tuong 2001 lampayan et al 2015 and rainfed rice systems goto et al 2008 hoshikawa et al 2018 have been developed since the 1990s currently these technologies have been applied in southern china liu et al 2005 ye et al 2013 wang et al 2016 however the southern regions are rich in water resources accompanied with a low irrigation water tariff webber et al 2008 resulting in a weak water saving awareness of local farmers when irrigation water is abundant and available for free or low price farmers are more inclined to irrigate liberally to save manpower material resources and management input cost pandey et al 2020 consequently the southern rice consumes a large amount of fresh water under traditional flooded irrigation zhuang et al 2019 flooded paddy fields are capable to maintain a water depth of 5 10 cm in this case paddy fields similar to small reservoirs can collect and retain water from natural rainfall rather than completely relying on artificial water management especially in southern china where rainfall is abundant during the rice growth period cao et al 2016 rainfall can be the main driving factor for the variations in irrigation demand zhang et al 2019 and provides great opportunities for water saving in rice production previous research on the combined effects of rainfall use and irrigation management of rice has mainly focused on irrigation technology and irrigation scheduling xiao et al 2008 pascual and wang 2018 while less attention has been paid to the irrigation demands of different rice types and the rainfall distributions in southern china from the long term perspective in the practice of water saving irrigation the maximum use of rainfall has been considered as a superior strategy lu et al 2018 massey et al 2018 but uncontrollable rainfall may lead to yield loss sharma and de datta 1994 carrijo et al 2017 although the theory and technology of water saving irrigation for rice is relatively proven due to the lack of a long term understanding of rice irrigation demands and rainfall distributions china is still at the stage of ensuring rice yields with high irrigation quota and natural rainfall is not efficiently utilized in the southern region li et al 2018a 2018b huang et al 2019 the rapid changes in the global climate mainly manifested in increased temperature shifted rainfall patterns and frequent extreme events have influenced rice water consumption dramatically piao et al 2010 significant increases have been found for the crop water requirements and irrigation demands of rice in southern china under climate change and the available water resources for agriculture will be insufficient due to the increasing non agricultural water requirement xiong et al 2010 wang et al 2012 ding et al 2017 therefore analyzing the characteristics of rice irrigation demand and the relationships between crop water requirement and rainfall is crucial to develop management strategies for water saving under the climate change impacts especially for maximizing rainfall capture and storage within paddy fields in addition a double to single cropping pattern has gradually dominated the southern rice region in recent years ma et al 2013 he and chen 2019 it has led to many changes in rice production systems in china such as a reduction in the cultivated area and a decrease in rice yield ge et al 2002 cheng et al 2012 previous studies have proposed that cropping systems affect the carbon emission efficiency of rice production and single cropping rice has a significantly higher emission efficiency than double cropping rice liu et al 2018 nevertheless there remain several aspects of the irrigation demand under the double to single cropping pattern such as the role of rice irrigation field drainage and effective rainfall utilization are all unclear therefore some questions need to be answered 1 there is abundant rainfall in southern china and the average rainfall during the rice growth period is greater than the crop water requirement which suggests that irrigation is not necessary is this true 2 with climate change and a trend of increasing rainfall can we reduce the amount of irrigation water in the future even without irrigation at all 3 with the development of the social economy double rice cropping is gradually being transformed into single rice cropping does the irrigation demand decrease with this change to achieve sustainable rice production in the southern areas these questions need to be answered there is no doubt that establishing the irrigation demand characteristics of early middle and late rice in southern china and understanding the relationships among rainfall rice irrigation and drainage will promote the most effective use of natural rainfall in this study our objectives are i to clarify the different irrigation demands of early middle and late sown rice in southern china ii to explore the variations in the patterns of rainfall in the growth period and rice irrigation in a long term series and iii to analyze the rice irrigation changes under the double to single cropping pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data rice cultivation in china currently takes place in six rice growing areas mei et al 1988 considering the geographical location rainfall distribution and cropping system six representative irrigation districts were selected in the south with widespread rice cultivation stable water sources and complete rice growth parameters then their representative meteorological stations were identified fig 1 and table 1 among them double season rice early rice and late rice is mainly planted at guilin gl nanchang nc and zhanjiang zj middle rice is planted at dujiangyan djy and zhongxiang zx and late rice is planted at pinghu ph the main goal of this study was to analyze the irrigation demands of rice and the effects of rainfall on its irrigation so as to provide guidance for water management to improve rainfall utilization in the rice growing region therefore the rice production of all study stations is considered to be well guaranteed under locally prevailing agricultural practices that is with application of appropriate and sufficient fertilizers as shown in fig 2 appropriate chemical pesticide thiamethoxam flubendiamide pentazol triazol pyrimethanil etc application rational farming methods mechanical ploughing manual transplanting and mechanical harvesting and full irrigation daily meteorological data of the representative stations during 1953 2017 were collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma gov cn including daily average wind speed daily sunshine hours daily average temperature daily maximum and minimum temperature daily average humidity and daily rainfall phenological data of the rice were collected from field experiments including the returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr stages date divisions of the growth stages at each station were collected from the national irrigation experiment results information service platform http ggsy jsgg com cn 9080 eisflex 2 2 calculation of crop water requirements the daily water requirement of rice was calculated by using the single crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 1 e t c k c e t 0 where et c is the crop water requirement of rice mm day k c is the single crop coefficient and et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day for middle rice the crop coefficient of each growth stage was collected from the field experiments conducted in zhanghe irrigation district li et al 2018a 2018b due to the lack of local data the crop coefficients data were used for the zx and djy stations which were 0 93 rg 1 10 et 1 52 lt 1 73 jb 1 90 hf 1 49 mi and 0 62 yr for early and late rice the crop coefficients of the initial intermediate and final stages were 1 05 1 63 and 1 03 respectively and referenced previous research allen et al 1998 without considering spatial and temporal differences daily reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated by using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 2 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 2 3 calculation of irrigation demands after the crop water requirement was obtained the irrigation scheduling was derived by building a field water balance model so as to calculate irrigation demand in the whole growth period the specific calculation steps are as follows 1 starting from the transplant the water storage capacity of the rice field before irrigation or drainage on the t day was calculated as follows 3 s t s t 1 r t e t c t p t where s t is the field water storage before irrigation or drainage on the t day mm s t 1 is the field storage at the end of the previous day mm r t is the rainfall on the t day mm and p t is the amount of field leakage on the t day mm in this paper the daily field leakage was set as a constant value which was 3 mm day in guilin cao et al 2016 and was 2 mm day in other stations considering the soil type of each station 2 irrigation water demand on the t day was calculated according to the following principle 4 i t s m t s t s t s d t 0 s t s d t 5 d t s t s u t s t s u t 0 s t s u t where i t is irrigation on the t day mm d t is drainage on the t day mm s dt s mt and s ut are the lower limit of water depth upper limit of water depth after irrigation and the maximum allowable water depth after raining mm respectively considering the actual production traditional flood irrigation fi used by farmers was adopted at each station under this scheduling there was no water deficit in the paddy field and it was generally accepted that irrigation would not affect the yield according to the previous researches wang and cui 2011 guo 1980 and field experiments the criteria of field water depths for each growth stage of the three rice types are shown in table 2 3 if irrigation and drainage are carried out in strict accordance with the above calculated values the field storage capacity at the end of the t day is calculated by 6 s t s t i t d t 4 the daily irrigation demand is given by repeating the above calculation steps and then the irrigation scheduling for the entire growth period can be sorted out 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall m k method was used to analyze and test the significance of the trends of etc irrigation drainage and rainfall this method was originally proposed by mann and kendall mann 1945 kendall 1957 in the m k test h0 is assumed to be a time series and the data x 1 x n are n independent and randomly distributed samples for all k j n and k j the statistical variable s of the test is calculated as follows 7 s n 1 k 1 n j k 1 sgn x k x j 8 u m k s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where when x k x j is greater than equal to and less than 0 sgn x k x j corresponds to 1 0 and 1 respectively u m k is the standard normal statistical variable in the bilateral trend test at a given α confidence level if u m k u 1 2 it means there is a significant upward or downward trend in the time series at the α confidence level when u m k 0 the trend rises when u m k 0 the trend falls and when u m k 1 96 or 2 58 this means that the significance tests of 95 and 99 confidence are passed respectively 2 4 2 pearson correlation analysis the relationships among the rice irrigation parameters were analyzed by the pearson correlation method this is a statistical method used to measure the degree of a linear correlation between two variables pearson 1920 for the existing two sets of data x i y i i 1 n the correlation coefficient r is calculated as follows 9 r n i 1 x i x y i y n i 1 x i x 2 n i 1 y i y 2 where x and y are the average values of n samples respectively r is the measure of the linear correlation between the two random variables ranging from 1 to 1 the closer the value of r is to 1 the stronger the positive linear correlation the closer the value is to 1 the stronger the negative correlation if the value is close to 0 then the linear relationship is weak or not linear 2 4 3 maximal information coefficient mic the maximum information coefficient mic was used to measure the linear or nonlinear strength between the rice irrigation parameters which has higher accuracy than mutual information mi and is an excellent way to explore data associations reshef et al 2011 the calculation principle of this method is to use a scatter diagram to separate the two variables in two dimensional space and then divide them into certain interval numbers in the x and y directions to check the current situation of the scatter points falling into each grid mic is calculated as follows 10 m i c x y max a b b i x y log 2 min a b where a b is the number of partition lattices in the x y direction i x y is the combined probability of x y b is the variable and is set to the 0 6 power of the data quantity the value of mic x y is between 0 and 1 larger value of mic indicate a stronger correlation between the two variables 3 results and discussions 3 1 irrigation characteristics of early middle and late rice the annual average values of the irrigation indicator of each station obtained by calculating the irrigation scheduling from 1953 to 2017 are shown in table 3 the results showed that on average early rice required less irrigation water 135 0 mm than middle rice 288 1 mm and late rice 265 2 mm meanwhile the average drainage amount of early rice 414 6 mm was much more than that of middle rice 287 5 mm and late rice 168 9 mm however the irrigation demands of the same type of rice also showed differences among various stations table 4 showed the rice yields in southern china from 2013 to 2017 national bureau of statistics of china 2020 where it can be seen that even though the yields of early rice were similar the irrigation demand of early rice in zj zj e was much more than that of early rice in gl gl e and nc nc e and there was a significant difference in the irrigation demand between the middle rice in djy djy m and zx zx m though their yields were close for late rice it had the largest yield and irrigation demand 336 6 mm in pl pl l followed by nc l 324 7 mm gl l 243 7 mm and zj l 137 7 mm generally higher rice yields seem to consume more irrigation water and consequently the irrigation demand was high such as zx m ph l and nc l in addition the results showed that rainfall was inextricably bound up with irrigation and drainage in general irrigation demand should be reduced with increasing rainfall however the results in table 3 showed that the irrigation demand did not always decreased with an increase in rainfall for instance djy m and zj l had more rainfall during the growth period 710 8 mm and 707 9 mm respectively than nc e 681 0 mm nevertheless their irrigation demand was higher 146 0 mm and 137 7 mm respectively than that of nc e 87 6 mm in addition the irrigation demand of zx m was the highest among the 9 stations while the rainfall during its growth period exceeded gl l nc l and ph l these findings reveal that there is a more complex relationship between rainfall distribution and rice irrigation than just the volume of rainfall the interannual distribution of the irrigation demand of the different stations during 1953 2017 is shown in fig 3 the results showed that for gl e nc e djy m and zj l the interval values were small and the minimum values of gl e nc e and djy m can reach as low as 0 which meant that these rice did not need irrigation in some wet years concurrently it could be seen that the irrigation demand of gl e and nc e was under 100 mm in most years which meant their irrigation demand was mainly distributed with a small range among the 9 stations the widest range of zx m and ph l indicated that the distribution of their irrigation demand was scattered and there was a large range of changes meanwhile the maximum and minimum values of zx m were all higher than ph l as a whole the interannual distribution of late rice was more decentralized than that of early and middle rice furthermore the distribution of rainfall irrigation drainage and etc of the nine rice types at each growth stage are presented in fig 4 the results showed that the matching degree of rainfall and etc during the growth period significantly affected irrigation demand for gl e and nc e abundant rainfall was recorded during the whole growth stage fig 4a and b and frequent rainfall met the crop water requirement at each stage but in the growth period of gl l and nc l rainfall significantly reduced for example mi and jb are the peak periods for etc of gl l and nc l when little rainfall was recorded fig 4f and g indicating insufficient rainfall to fulfill the water requirement of late rice and thus more irrigation water was required as a result the irrigation demand for early rice was less than that for late rice in gl and nc however for zj the rainfall was mainly concentrated in the growth period of late rice especially in the mi stage of the peak etc fig 4h rainfall during the growth period of zj e was mainly concentrated in mi and yr periods and less rainfall was available for early growth fig 4c that resulted in the greater irrigation demand for zj e than that of zj l for pl l there was less rainfall during the growth period causing a large amount of irrigation water to compensate for the high etc fig 4i besides rainfall during the growth period of djy m was much more than that of zx m and far less etc was recorded for djy m than that of zx m fig 4d and e thus the low etc of djy m can be supplemented by abundant rainfall throughout the growth period in contrast to zx m where the less rainfall was not sufficient to compensate for the high etc causing a large gap in irrigation demand between djy and zx though the same rice type was cultivated the above results indicate that achieving an agreement between the high water requirement period of rice and the local rainfall distribution is the key factor in reducing irrigation demand generally the rain belt will move northward with time yin and tan 1989 yao et al 2017 resulting in the rainfall peak time at djy and zx appeared later than that at zj gl and nc although gl e nc e djy m and zj l received far more rainfall than the crop water requirement at each growth stage fig 4a b d and h suggesting that the natural rainfall could theoretically meet the growth needs but still irrigation was needed in these areas this could be due to the fact that rainfall is a random process with uncertain frequency and uncontrollable amounts knapp et al 2002 nippert et al 2006 showing significant variation at annual and monthly scales and the distribution within the month is also uneven ramos 2001 hence the total amount of rainfall far exceed than the seasonal crop water requirements but a single rainfall event might provide a major portion of this water which could be drained out without any useful impact on crop this uneven distribution of rainfall at temporal scale is the major cause of irrigation requirements in most years despite some episodes of heavy rainfall moreover the drainage volume of gl e and nc e was 7 times and 4 times more than that of irrigation respectively indicating that the uneven distribution of rainfall greatly increased field drainage and led to a great quantity of rainfall being wasted thus improving rainfall utilization and alleviating drainage loss are of critical importance in designing water saving irrigation techniques for sustainable rice production in the southern rice growing areas of china effective utilization of natural rainfall could be a promising strategy to design water saving measures in the southern rice growing region of china examples of this kind of rainfed rice cultivation systems are available in sub saharan africa raes et al 2007 southeastern tanzania biazin et al 2012 and the ganges plain sharma et al 2010 currently rainfed cultivation accounts for about 25 of global rice production studies revealed that effective utilization of early rainfall optimize rice yield potentials under rainfed cultivation system lindner et al 2016 and it was ecologically more efficient thanawong et al 2014 abundant rainfall offers great potential for the development of rainfed rice cultivation system and some preliminary researches have put forward the feasibility of this system in southern china zhou and xie 2001 zhang and pan 2011 but this system is more vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall due to its dependence on climate which is itself threatened by multiple natural and anthropogenic activities therefore relevant measures are needed to improve early rainfall utilization efficiency to ensure rice production with minimum irrigation water input for instance collecting runoff to supplement irrigation during the key growth period reducing soil infiltration and leakage regulating the rice varieties and adjusting the planting time are all feasible approaches that can be implemented 3 2 trend changes of rainfall etc and rice irrigation the trend changes of the etc irrigation drainage and rainfall in the growth period as obtained from the mann kendall test are shown in table 5 the results revealed that the irrigation demand showed a downward trend at all stations except nc e and gl l but this trend was highly significant only for nc l and significant for zx m drainage showed an upward trend except for djy m but only zj e reached a significant level the pearson correlation coefficients and mic values between etc irrigation drainage and rainfall are presented in table 6 the results showed that etc was positively correlated with irrigation and except for zj l and nc e the correlation coefficients of the other stations were above 0 4 mic value had a direct relation with r value meanwhile the correlation between etc and drainage was weak furthermore rainfall and irrigation had a significantly negative r was below 0 4 linear correlation rainfall and drainage showed an extremely significant and strong positive correlation with their all mic values above 0 7 as a result the trend change of irrigation was opposite from that of rainfall and was in line with etc while the trend change of drainage was in accordance with rainfall table 5 however for nc e irrigation did not show a downward trend in response to the extremely significant downward trend of etc this might be the negative effect of rainfall decline on irrigation exceeding the positive effect of the etc decline resulting in an upward trend in irrigation in addition the combined influence of an etc decline and a rainfall decline caused the irrigation of djy m to maintain a stable trend in the past 60 years furthermore it is important to note that for gl l the trend of drainage did not respond to the decrease in rainfall and the increase in etc and irrigation instead it showed a weak upward trend this result reveals that the water requirement law and rainfall distribution of gl l may be extremely inconsistent on the one hand little rainfall was received at the peak of crop water requirement on the other hand the rainfall increased in the low water requirement period as shown in fig 4f consequently the mismatching caused a large amount of rainfall to be wasted with the field drainage increasing in fact rice irrigation is a very complicated random process affected by many factors such as climatic conditions etc soil texture and agronomic techniques therefore the trend change of rice irrigation should be analyzed comprehensively for the southern rice growing region in china rainfall and etc are two major factors affecting irrigation and rainfall is the leading factor natural rainfall directly influences field drainage and the impact of etc on irrigation influences rainfall use and indirectly influences drainage in the past 60 years the combined influences of etc decrease and rainfall increase were mainly responsible for the irrigation reduction in southern china therefore with climate change and the increasing trend of rainfall the irrigation demand will be reduced further even to no irrigation in the future emphasizing improving the matching of rainfall and rice water requirements through technology and cultivation methods analyzing the long term changes in rainfall and irrigation demand is instrumental in guiding regional water resource allocation while in the short term field irrigation adjusting irrigation decisions through short term weather forecasts is an effective way to reduce the uncertainty of real time rainfall cao et al 2019 by forecasting rainfall events in advance to guide irrigation decisions the randomness of rainfall and irrigation matching can be decreased furthermore smart irrigation can be realized in the southern rice growing region of the country by coupling the information of water balance models field sensors and weather forecasts galioto et al 2020 to achieve precise irrigation management 3 3 effects of changing double rice to single rice on irrigation fig 5 shows the changes in rice irrigation under the cropping pattern transition under the double to single cropping pattern the irrigation demand was reduced by 16 0 54 7 mm on average in the three regions meanwhile the amount of drainage irrigation frequency and drainage frequency was reduced by 43 2 243 7 mm 49 0 7 times and 44 1 9 times respectively there were differences in the water saving effect among the three stations with water saving rates of 30 0 20 and 0 02 in gl zj and nc respectively it should be noted that although there was a very small difference in the irrigation demand at the nc station it still had a significant effect on reducing irrigation frequency and drainage which can relieve the irrigation and drainage burden on the field fig 6 shows the mean monthly rainfall and etc of middle rice and double rice in gl nc and zj the results illustrated that the crop water requirement of middle rice and double rice was different between years the etc of middle rice demonstrated a clear unimodal pattern while the double rice showed a gently humped distribution generally the peak value of water requirement of single rice was higher than that of double rice combined with the monthly distribution of rainfall the rainfall peak was in accordance with the water requirement peak of early rice in gl and nc when the middle rice was in the peak period of water requirement the rainfall distribution was in a declining period fig 6a and b the water requirement of middle rice in cl gl m did not exceed the rainfall value while that of middle rice in nc nc m exceeded the corresponding monthly rainfall with regard to zj there were two peaks of rainfall distribution in a year which matched the water requirement period of double rice reasonably well and for middle rice in zj zj m the water requirement peak also appeared in the abundant rainfall period fig 6c the water requirement of the three rice types in zj was all lower than the corresponding monthly rainfall value it is worth noting that crop was not planted in nc during the peak rainfall period april june after changing from double to single pattern which seemed to be a waste of rainfall that might have been a reason for the unsatisfactory water saving effect in nc it is worth mentioning that a lot of water is needed for rice soaking before transplanting under conventional cultivation practice therefore the results indicate that planting single rice can save irrigation water compared to double rice especially considering the decrease in rice soaking quota due to the decreased need for plot predevelopment and a decrease in unproductive water loss through drainage and percolation the double to single cropping pattern can reduce water consumption if the local rainfall distribution and rice water requirement match well increasing issue of labor shortage is another important aspect which had been a reason of changing many double rice regions of southern china to single rice since the 1980s chen and ding 2006 the reduction in rice cultivated area leads to a yield decline which is not conducive to ensuring food security in china therefore the change in cropping pattern seems to be beneficial in terms of water conservation but is detrimental to rice production considering water saving from this aspect will be extremely complicated especially the double to single pattern is also related to labor changes socio economic development and national policies in recent years rice production in southern china has maintained a good yield owing to the modernization of agriculture especially irrigation which has made a great contribution no matter which cropping pattern is adopted ensuring rice production will definitely require much water we prefer to use natural rainfall as an excellent supplementary water source as much as possible to reduce the irrigation burden but inappropriate measures may lead to reduced rice production therefore a deep understanding of rice irrigation demand and rainfall distribution and their relationships is necessary to properly guide irrigation decisions when adopting strategies to control the irrigation demand in the rice areas of southern china or other humid areas the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of local rainfall should be considered first and rice irrigation should be changed from passive waiting irrigation to active adapting to rainfall 4 conclusions in this study the eto in six representative southern rice regions during 1953 2017 was calculated using the penman monteith method with collected daily meteorological data then etc was calculated by the single crop coefficient approach and the field water balance model was constructed to deduce the rice irrigation scheduling of each year under fi after that the mean annual value of irrigation indicators was calculated and their trend changes were analyzed finally the water saving effect under the double to single cropping pattern was also considered the results indicated that most of the abundant rainfall was concentrated in the early rice growth period in southern china early rice required less irrigation water and irrigation frequency and may not even need irrigation in some wet years while middle rice and late rice required large amounts of water the main reason for the differences in the irrigation demand of the three rice types is the amount and distribution characteristics of the rainfall during the rice growth period overall the irrigation demands of rice have shown a downward trend in the past 60 years mainly due to the decrease in etc and an increase in rainfall rainfall and irrigation had an extremely significantly negative correlation and their effect on irrigation held a dominant position therefore with the increasing trend of rainfall in the future the irrigation demands of rice will probably reduce and even no irrigation can be achieved under optimal use of natural rainfall under the double to single pattern planting single rice can reduce irrigation demand compared with double rice with the irrigation water reduced by 16 0 on average it also has better performance in reducing the drainage amount irrigation frequency and drainage frequency however this conversion will lead to a decline in rice cultivated areas which ultimately affect rice yield and ensuring food security will be challenging the irrigation demand of rice in southern china is greatly influenced by the agreement between rainfall distribution and the crop water requirement distribution therefore we can consider increasing the matching of the two to improve the rainfall utilization further research is needed for realizing the smart irrigation of rice active adapting to rainfall such as better coupling of the information of the water balance models field sensors and weather forecasts improving the effective rainfall of rice irrigation reducing the irrigation needs and even achieving no irrigation will require more rigorous evaluation in the future

carracelas et al 2019 generally flooded paddy fields are used to produce large quantities of rice watanabe 2019 and water requirement for maintaining a stable water supply and continuous flooding will undoubtedly over exploit water resources in response to the great challenge of water scarcity rice water saving irrigation technologies such as non flooded mulching cultivation liu et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 aerobic rice systems belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 dang et al 2018 alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation bouman and tuong 2001 lampayan et al 2015 and rainfed rice systems goto et al 2008 hoshikawa et al 2018 have been developed since the 1990s currently these technologies have been applied in southern china liu et al 2005 ye et al 2013 wang et al 2016 however the southern regions are rich in water resources accompanied with a low irrigation water tariff webber et al 2008 resulting in a weak water saving awareness of local farmers when irrigation water is abundant and available for free or low price farmers are more inclined to irrigate liberally to save manpower material resources and management input cost pandey et al 2020 consequently the southern rice consumes a large amount of fresh water under traditional flooded irrigation zhuang et al 2019 flooded paddy fields are capable to maintain a water depth of 5 10 cm in this case paddy fields similar to small reservoirs can collect and retain water from natural rainfall rather than completely relying on artificial water management especially in southern china where rainfall is abundant during the rice growth period cao et al 2016 rainfall can be the main driving factor for the variations in irrigation demand zhang et al 2019 and provides great opportunities for water saving in rice production previous research on the combined effects of rainfall use and irrigation management of rice has mainly focused on irrigation technology and irrigation scheduling xiao et al 2008 pascual and wang 2018 while less attention has been paid to the irrigation demands of different rice types and the rainfall distributions in southern china from the long term perspective in the practice of water saving irrigation the maximum use of rainfall has been considered as a superior strategy lu et al 2018 massey et al 2018 but uncontrollable rainfall may lead to yield loss sharma and de datta 1994 carrijo et al 2017 although the theory and technology of water saving irrigation for rice is relatively proven due to the lack of a long term understanding of rice irrigation demands and rainfall distributions china is still at the stage of ensuring rice yields with high irrigation quota and natural rainfall is not efficiently utilized in the southern region li et al 2018a 2018b huang et al 2019 the rapid changes in the global climate mainly manifested in increased temperature shifted rainfall patterns and frequent extreme events have influenced rice water consumption dramatically piao et al 2010 significant increases have been found for the crop water requirements and irrigation demands of rice in southern china under climate change and the available water resources for agriculture will be insufficient due to the increasing non agricultural water requirement xiong et al 2010 wang et al 2012 ding et al 2017 therefore analyzing the characteristics of rice irrigation demand and the relationships between crop water requirement and rainfall is crucial to develop management strategies for water saving under the climate change impacts especially for maximizing rainfall capture and storage within paddy fields in addition a double to single cropping pattern has gradually dominated the southern rice region in recent years ma et al 2013 he and chen 2019 it has led to many changes in rice production systems in china such as a reduction in the cultivated area and a decrease in rice yield ge et al 2002 cheng et al 2012 previous studies have proposed that cropping systems affect the carbon emission efficiency of rice production and single cropping rice has a significantly higher emission efficiency than double cropping rice liu et al 2018 nevertheless there remain several aspects of the irrigation demand under the double to single cropping pattern such as the role of rice irrigation field drainage and effective rainfall utilization are all unclear therefore some questions need to be answered 1 there is abundant rainfall in southern china and the average rainfall during the rice growth period is greater than the crop water requirement which suggests that irrigation is not necessary is this true 2 with climate change and a trend of increasing rainfall can we reduce the amount of irrigation water in the future even without irrigation at all 3 with the development of the social economy double rice cropping is gradually being transformed into single rice cropping does the irrigation demand decrease with this change to achieve sustainable rice production in the southern areas these questions need to be answered there is no doubt that establishing the irrigation demand characteristics of early middle and late rice in southern china and understanding the relationships among rainfall rice irrigation and drainage will promote the most effective use of natural rainfall in this study our objectives are i to clarify the different irrigation demands of early middle and late sown rice in southern china ii to explore the variations in the patterns of rainfall in the growth period and rice irrigation in a long term series and iii to analyze the rice irrigation changes under the double to single cropping pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data rice cultivation in china currently takes place in six rice growing areas mei et al 1988 considering the geographical location rainfall distribution and cropping system six representative irrigation districts were selected in the south with widespread rice cultivation stable water sources and complete rice growth parameters then their representative meteorological stations were identified fig 1 and table 1 among them double season rice early rice and late rice is mainly planted at guilin gl nanchang nc and zhanjiang zj middle rice is planted at dujiangyan djy and zhongxiang zx and late rice is planted at pinghu ph the main goal of this study was to analyze the irrigation demands of rice and the effects of rainfall on its irrigation so as to provide guidance for water management to improve rainfall utilization in the rice growing region therefore the rice production of all study stations is considered to be well guaranteed under locally prevailing agricultural practices that is with application of appropriate and sufficient fertilizers as shown in fig 2 appropriate chemical pesticide thiamethoxam flubendiamide pentazol triazol pyrimethanil etc application rational farming methods mechanical ploughing manual transplanting and mechanical harvesting and full irrigation daily meteorological data of the representative stations during 1953 2017 were collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma gov cn including daily average wind speed daily sunshine hours daily average temperature daily maximum and minimum temperature daily average humidity and daily rainfall phenological data of the rice were collected from field experiments including the returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr stages date divisions of the growth stages at each station were collected from the national irrigation experiment results information service platform http ggsy jsgg com cn 9080 eisflex 2 2 calculation of crop water requirements the daily water requirement of rice was calculated by using the single crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 1 e t c k c e t 0 where et c is the crop water requirement of rice mm day k c is the single crop coefficient and et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day for middle rice the crop coefficient of each growth stage was collected from the field experiments conducted in zhanghe irrigation district li et al 2018a 2018b due to the lack of local data the crop coefficients data were used for the zx and djy stations which were 0 93 rg 1 10 et 1 52 lt 1 73 jb 1 90 hf 1 49 mi and 0 62 yr for early and late rice the crop coefficients of the initial intermediate and final stages were 1 05 1 63 and 1 03 respectively and referenced previous research allen et al 1998 without considering spatial and temporal differences daily reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated by using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 2 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34

is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 2 3 calculation of irrigation demands after the crop water requirement was obtained the irrigation scheduling was derived by building a field water balance model so as to calculate irrigation demand in the whole growth period the specific calculation steps are as follows 1 starting from the transplant the water storage capacity of the rice field before irrigation or drainage on the t day was calculated as follows 3 s t s t 1 r t e t c t p t where s t is the field water storage before irrigation or drainage on the t day mm s t 1 is the field storage at the end of the previous day mm r t is the rainfall on the t day mm and p t is the amount of field leakage on the t day mm in this paper the daily field leakage was set as a constant value which was 3 mm day in guilin cao et al 2016 and was 2 mm day in other stations considering the soil type of each station 2 irrigation water demand on the t day was calculated according to the following principle 4 i t s m t s t s t s d t 0 s t s d t 5 d t s t s u t s t s u t 0 s t s u t where i t is irrigation on the t day mm d t is drainage on the t day mm s dt s mt and s ut are the lower limit of water depth upper limit of water depth after irrigation and the maximum allowable water depth after raining mm respectively considering the actual production traditional flood irrigation fi used by farmers was adopted at each station under this scheduling there was no water deficit in the paddy field and it was generally accepted that irrigation would not affect the yield according to the previous researches wang and cui 2011 guo 1980 and field experiments the criteria of field water depths for each growth stage of the three rice types are shown in table 2 3 if irrigation and drainage are carried out in strict accordance with the above calculated values the field storage capacity at the end of the t day is calculated by 6 s t s t i t d t 4 the daily irrigation demand is given by repeating the above calculation steps and then the irrigation scheduling for the entire growth period can be sorted out 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall m k method was used to analyze and test the significance of the trends of etc irrigation drainage and rainfall this method was originally proposed by mann and kendall mann 1945 kendall 1957 in the m k test h0 is assumed to be a time series and the data x 1 x n are n independent and randomly distributed samples for all k j n and k j the statistical variable s of the test is calculated as follows 7 s n 1 k 1 n j k 1 sgn x k x j 8 u m k s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where when x k x j is greater than equal to and less than 0 sgn x k x j corresponds to 1 0 and 1 respectively u m k is the standard normal statistical variable in the bilateral trend test at a given α confidence level if u m k u 1 2 it means there is a significant upward or downward trend in the time series at the α confidence level when u m k 0 the trend rises when u m k 0 the trend falls and when u m k 1 96 or 2 58 this means that the significance tests of 95 and 99 confidence are passed respectively 2 4 2 pearson correlation analysis the relationships among the rice irrigation parameters were analyzed by the pearson correlation method this is a statistical method used to measure the degree of a linear correlation between two variables pearson 1920 for the existing two sets of data x i y i i 1 n the correlation coefficient r is calculated as follows 9 r n i 1 x i x y i y n i 1 x i x 2 n i 1 y i y 2 where x and y are the average values of n samples respectively r is the measure of the linear correlation between the two random variables ranging from 1 to 1 the closer the value of r is to 1 the stronger the positive linear correlation the closer the value is to 1 the stronger the negative correlation if the value is close to 0 then the linear relationship is weak or not linear 2 4 3 maximal information coefficient mic the maximum information coefficient mic was used to measure the linear or nonlinear strength between the rice irrigation parameters which has higher accuracy than mutual information mi and is an excellent way to explore data associations reshef et al 2011 the calculation principle of this method is to use a scatter diagram to separate the two variables in two dimensional space and then divide them into certain interval numbers in the x and y directions to check the current situation of the scatter points falling into each grid mic is calculated as follows 10 m i c x y max a b b i x y log 2 min a b where a b is the number of partition lattices in the x y direction i x y is the combined probability of x y b is the variable and is set to the 0 6 power of the data quantity the value of mic x y is between 0 and 1 larger value of mic indicate a stronger correlation between the two variables 3 results and discussions 3 1 irrigation characteristics of early middle and late rice the annual average values of the irrigation indicator of each station obtained by calculating the irrigation scheduling from 1953 to 2017 are shown in table 3 the results showed that on average early rice required less irrigation water 135 0 mm than middle rice 288 1 mm and late rice 265 2 mm meanwhile the average drainage amount of early rice 414 6 mm was much more than that of middle rice 287 5 mm and late rice 168 9 mm however the irrigation demands of the same type of rice also showed differences among various stations table 4 showed the rice yields in southern china from 2013 to 2017 national bureau of statistics of china 2020 where it can be seen that even though the yields of early rice were similar the irrigation demand of early rice in zj zj e was much more than that of early rice in gl gl e and nc nc e and there was a significant difference in the irrigation demand between the middle rice in djy djy m and zx zx m though their yields were close for late rice it had the largest yield and irrigation demand 336 6 mm in pl pl l followed by nc l 324 7 mm gl l 243 7 mm and zj l 137 7 mm generally higher rice yields seem to consume more irrigation water and consequently the irrigation demand was high such as zx m ph l and nc l in addition the results showed that rainfall was inextricably bound up with irrigation and drainage in general irrigation demand should be reduced with increasing rainfall however the results in table 3 showed that the irrigation demand did not always decreased with an increase in rainfall for instance djy m and zj l had more rainfall during the growth period 710 8 mm and 707 9 mm respectively than nc e 681 0 mm nevertheless their irrigation demand was higher 146 0 mm and 137 7 mm respectively than that of nc e 87 6 mm in addition the irrigation demand of zx m was the highest among the 9 stations while the rainfall during its growth period exceeded gl l nc l and ph l these findings reveal that there is a more complex relationship between rainfall distribution and rice irrigation than just the volume of rainfall the interannual distribution of the irrigation demand of the different stations during 1953 2017 is shown in fig 3 the results showed that for gl e nc e djy m and zj l the interval values were small and the minimum values of gl e nc e and djy m can reach as low as 0 which meant that these rice did not need irrigation in some wet years concurrently it could be seen that the irrigation demand of gl e and nc e was under 100 mm in most years which meant their irrigation demand was mainly distributed with a small range among the 9 stations the widest range of zx m and ph l indicated that the distribution of their irrigation demand was scattered and there was a large range of changes meanwhile the maximum and minimum values of zx m were all higher than ph l as a whole the interannual distribution of late rice was more decentralized than that of early and middle rice furthermore the distribution of rainfall irrigation drainage and etc of the nine rice types at each growth stage are presented in fig 4 the results showed that the matching degree of rainfall and etc during the growth period significantly affected irrigation demand for gl e and nc e abundant rainfall was recorded during the whole growth stage fig 4a and b and frequent rainfall met the crop water requirement at each stage but in the growth period of gl l and nc l rainfall significantly reduced for example mi and jb are the peak periods for etc of gl l and nc l when little rainfall was recorded fig 4f and g indicating insufficient rainfall to fulfill the water requirement of late rice and thus more irrigation water was required as a result the irrigation demand for early rice was less than that for late rice in gl and nc however for zj the rainfall was mainly concentrated in the growth period of late rice especially in the mi stage of the peak etc fig 4h rainfall during the growth period of zj e was mainly concentrated in mi and yr periods and less rainfall was available for early growth fig 4c that resulted in the greater irrigation demand for zj e than that of zj l for pl l there was less rainfall during the growth period causing a large amount of irrigation water to compensate for the high etc fig 4i besides rainfall during the growth period of djy m was much more than that of zx m and far less etc was recorded for djy m than that of zx m fig 4d and e thus the low etc of djy m can be supplemented by abundant rainfall throughout the growth period in contrast to zx m where the less rainfall was not sufficient to compensate for the high etc causing a large gap in irrigation demand between djy and zx though the same rice type was cultivated the above results indicate that achieving an agreement between the high water requirement period of rice and the local rainfall distribution is the key factor in reducing irrigation demand generally the rain belt will move northward with time yin and tan 1989 yao et al 2017 resulting in the rainfall peak time at djy and zx appeared later than that at zj gl and nc although gl e nc e djy m and zj l received far more rainfall than the crop water requirement at each growth stage fig 4a b d and h suggesting that the natural rainfall could theoretically meet the growth needs but still irrigation was needed in these areas this could be due to the fact that rainfall is a random process with uncertain frequency and uncontrollable amounts knapp et al 2002 nippert et al 2006 showing significant variation at annual and monthly scales and the distribution within the month is also uneven ramos 2001 hence the total amount of rainfall far exceed than the seasonal crop water requirements but a single rainfall event might provide a major portion of this water which could be drained out without any useful impact on crop this uneven distribution of rainfall at temporal scale is the major cause of irrigation requirements in most years despite some episodes of heavy rainfall moreover the drainage volume of gl e and nc e was 7 times and 4 times more than that of irrigation respectively indicating that the uneven distribution of rainfall greatly increased field drainage and led to a great quantity of rainfall being wasted thus improving rainfall utilization and alleviating drainage loss are of critical importance in designing water saving irrigation techniques for sustainable rice production in the southern rice growing areas of china effective utilization of natural rainfall could be a promising strategy to design water saving measures in the southern rice growing region of china examples of this kind of rainfed rice cultivation systems are available in sub saharan africa raes et al 2007 southeastern tanzania biazin et al 2012 and the ganges plain sharma et al 2010 currently rainfed cultivation accounts for about 25 of global rice production studies revealed that effective utilization of early rainfall optimize rice yield potentials under rainfed cultivation system lindner et al 2016 and it was ecologically more efficient thanawong et al 2014 abundant rainfall offers great potential for the development of rainfed rice cultivation system and some preliminary researches have put forward the feasibility of this system in southern china zhou and xie 2001 zhang and pan 2011 but this system is more vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall due to its dependence on climate which is itself threatened by multiple natural and anthropogenic activities therefore relevant measures are needed to improve early rainfall utilization efficiency to ensure rice production with minimum irrigation water input for instance collecting runoff to supplement irrigation during the key growth period reducing soil infiltration and leakage regulating the rice varieties and adjusting the planting time are all feasible approaches that can be implemented 3 2 trend changes of rainfall etc and rice irrigation the trend changes of the etc irrigation drainage and rainfall in the growth period as obtained from the mann kendall test are shown in table 5 the results revealed that the irrigation demand showed a downward trend at all stations except nc e and gl l but this trend was highly significant only for nc l and significant for zx m drainage showed an upward trend except for djy m but only zj e reached a significant level the pearson correlation coefficients and mic values between etc irrigation drainage and rainfall are presented in table 6 the results showed that etc was positively correlated with irrigation and except for zj l and nc e the correlation coefficients of the other stations were above 0 4 mic value had a direct relation with r value meanwhile the correlation between etc and drainage was weak furthermore rainfall and irrigation had a significantly negative r was below 0 4 linear correlation rainfall and drainage showed an extremely significant and strong positive correlation with their all mic values above 0 7 as a result the trend change of irrigation was opposite from that of rainfall and was in line with etc while the trend change of drainage was in accordance with rainfall table 5 however for nc e irrigation did not show a downward trend in response to the extremely significant downward trend of etc this might be the negative effect of rainfall decline on irrigation exceeding the positive effect of the etc decline resulting in an upward trend in irrigation in addition the combined influence of an etc decline and a rainfall decline caused the irrigation of djy m to maintain a stable trend in the past 60 years furthermore it is important to note that for gl l the trend of drainage did not respond to the decrease in rainfall and the increase in etc and irrigation instead it showed a weak upward trend this result reveals that the water requirement law and rainfall distribution of gl l may be extremely inconsistent on the one hand little rainfall was received at the peak of crop water requirement on the other hand the rainfall increased in the low water requirement period as shown in fig 4f consequently the mismatching caused a large amount of rainfall to be wasted with the field drainage increasing in fact rice irrigation is a very complicated random process affected by many factors such as climatic conditions etc soil texture and agronomic techniques therefore the trend change of rice irrigation should be analyzed comprehensively for the southern rice growing region in china rainfall and etc are two major factors affecting irrigation and rainfall is the leading factor natural rainfall directly influences field drainage and the impact of etc on irrigation influences rainfall use and indirectly influences drainage in the past 60 years the combined influences of etc decrease and rainfall increase were mainly responsible for the irrigation reduction in southern china therefore with climate change and the increasing trend of rainfall the irrigation demand will be reduced further even to no irrigation in the future emphasizing improving the matching of rainfall and rice water requirements through technology and cultivation methods analyzing the long term changes in rainfall and irrigation demand is instrumental in guiding regional water resource allocation while in the short term field irrigation adjusting irrigation decisions through short term weather forecasts is an effective way to reduce the uncertainty of real time rainfall cao et al 2019 by forecasting rainfall events in advance to guide irrigation decisions the randomness of rainfall and irrigation matching can be decreased furthermore smart irrigation can be realized in the southern rice growing region of the country by coupling the information of water balance models field sensors and weather forecasts galioto et al 2020 to achieve precise irrigation management 3 3 effects of changing double rice to single rice on irrigation fig 5 shows the changes in rice irrigation under the cropping pattern transition under the double to single cropping pattern the irrigation demand was reduced by 16 0 54 7 mm on average in the three regions meanwhile the amount of drainage irrigation frequency and drainage frequency was reduced by 43 2 243 7 mm 49 0 7 times and 44 1 9 times respectively there were differences in the water saving effect among the three stations with water saving rates of 30 0 20 and 0 02 in gl zj and nc respectively it should be noted that although there was a very small difference in the irrigation demand at the nc station it still had a significant effect on reducing irrigation frequency and drainage which can relieve the irrigation and drainage burden on the field fig 6 shows the mean monthly rainfall and etc of middle rice and double rice in gl nc and zj the results illustrated that the crop water requirement of middle rice and double rice was different between years the etc of middle rice demonstrated a clear unimodal pattern while the double rice showed a gently humped distribution generally the peak value of water requirement of single rice was higher than that of double rice combined with the monthly distribution of rainfall the rainfall peak was in accordance with the water requirement peak of early rice in gl and nc when the middle rice was in the peak period of water requirement the rainfall distribution was in a declining period fig 6a and b the water requirement of middle rice in cl gl m did not exceed the rainfall value while that of middle rice in nc nc m exceeded the corresponding monthly rainfall with regard to zj there were two peaks of rainfall distribution in a year which matched the water requirement period of double rice reasonably well and for middle rice in zj zj m the water requirement peak also appeared in the abundant rainfall period fig 6c the water requirement of the three rice types in zj was all lower than the corresponding monthly rainfall value it is worth noting that crop was not planted in nc during the peak rainfall period april june after changing from double to single pattern which seemed to be a waste of rainfall that might have been a reason for the unsatisfactory water saving effect in nc it is worth mentioning that a lot of water is needed for rice soaking before transplanting under conventional cultivation practice therefore the results indicate that planting single rice can save irrigation water compared to double rice especially considering the decrease in rice soaking quota due to the decreased need for plot predevelopment and a decrease in unproductive water loss through drainage and percolation the double to single cropping pattern can reduce water consumption if the local rainfall distribution and rice water requirement match well increasing issue of labor shortage is another important aspect which had been a reason of changing many double rice regions of southern china to single rice since the 1980s chen and ding 2006 the reduction in rice cultivated area leads to a yield decline which is not conducive to ensuring food security in china therefore the change in cropping pattern seems to be beneficial in terms of water conservation but is detrimental to rice production considering water saving from this aspect will be extremely complicated especially the double to single pattern is also related to labor changes socio economic development and national policies in recent years rice production in southern china has maintained a good yield owing to the modernization of agriculture especially irrigation which has made a great contribution no matter which cropping pattern is adopted ensuring rice production will definitely require much water we prefer to use natural rainfall as an excellent supplementary water source as much as possible to reduce the irrigation burden but inappropriate measures may lead to reduced rice production therefore a deep understanding of rice irrigation demand and rainfall distribution and their relationships is necessary to properly guide irrigation decisions when adopting strategies to control the irrigation demand in the rice areas of southern china or other humid areas the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of local rainfall should be considered first and rice irrigation should be changed from passive waiting irrigation to active adapting to rainfall 4 conclusions in this study the eto in six representative southern rice regions during 1953 2017 was calculated using the penman monteith method with collected daily meteorological data then etc was calculated by the single crop coefficient approach and the field water balance model was constructed to deduce the rice irrigation scheduling of each year under fi after that the mean annual value of irrigation indicators was calculated and their trend changes were analyzed finally the water saving effect under the double to single cropping pattern was also considered the results indicated that most of the abundant rainfall was concentrated in the early rice growth period in southern china early rice required less irrigation water and irrigation frequency and may not even need irrigation in some wet years while middle rice and late rice required large amounts of water the main reason for the differences in the irrigation demand of the three rice types is the amount and distribution characteristics of the rainfall during the rice growth period overall the irrigation demands of rice have shown a downward trend in the past 60 years mainly due to the decrease in etc and an increase in rainfall rainfall and irrigation had an extremely significantly negative correlation and their effect on irrigation held a dominant position therefore with the increasing trend of rainfall in the future the irrigation demands of rice will probably reduce and even no irrigation can be achieved under optimal use of natural rainfall under the double to single pattern planting single rice can reduce irrigation demand compared with double rice with the irrigation water reduced by 16 0 on average it also has better performance in reducing the drainage amount irrigation frequency and drainage frequency however this conversion will lead to a decline in rice cultivated areas which ultimately affect rice yield and ensuring food security will be challenging the irrigation demand of rice in southern china is greatly influenced by the agreement between rainfall distribution and the crop water requirement distribution therefore we can consider increasing the matching of the two to improve the rainfall utilization further research is needed for realizing the smart irrigation of rice active adapting to rainfall such as better coupling of the information of the water balance models field sensors and weather forecasts improving the effective rainfall of rice irrigation reducing the irrigation needs and even achieving no irrigation will require more rigorous evaluation in the future

both ww and wd conditions while for agronomic measurements differences were only found for quality traits under ww conditions significant relationships were detected between remote sensing and leaf level physiologic and agronomic measurements when considering all genotypes and treatments however different regressions were described for con and lsl genotypes mainly due their different physiologic

references for plant performance physiological stress status growth dynamics and fruit production and have been related to aerial remote sensing data araus et al 2018 flexas and medrano 2002 gago et al 2017 zarco tejada et al 2016 also carbon isotope composition in leaf tissues δ13c has been defined as an integrative physiological stress and wue indicator dhanapal et al 2015 farquhar and richards 1984 providing information at different levels and time scales flanagan and farquhar 2014 tambussi et al 2007 despite the correlation between δ13c and wuei is widely defined in literature their relationship may be affected by the interaction between environment and genotypic variability condon 2004 although both leaf gas exchange traits and δ13c provide highly valuable information to evaluate crop breeding performance their measurement is time consuming and economically expensive when screening a large number of plants additionally both are mostly focused at leaf rather than plant level limiting a wide overview of the crop physiology and are difficult to implement in field trials at which added to large plant numbers parameters should be measured within a narrow timescale and or in a periodic way along the season araus and cairns 2014 gago et al 2015 tomato solanum lycopersicum l is one of the most produced vegetables worldwide and its production has been almost doubled in the last 20 years from 1000 million to 1900 million tones fao 2021 despite tomato crop is widely distributed and adapted to an important range of climates cuartero and fernández muñoz 1999 it is mainly cultivated in temperate regions particularly the mediterranean basin at open field tomato is a spring summer high water demanding crop requiring more than 3 l per plant and day at maturity harmanto et al 2005 considering the predicted climate change scenario it becomes essential to explore the tomato genotypic variability to find the most resilient genotypes under stress conditions becoming valuable genetic resources to improve wue minimizing reductions in fruit production and quality under harsh conditions in this regard tomato crop is a notorious target for improvement given its worldwide importance and given it has become the model species for fleshy fruit corps giovannoni 2006 klee and giovannoni 2011 the tomato genome consortium 2012 within tomato most drought resilient genotypes have been described among local landraces in the mediterranean basin due to their selection over centuries under mediterranean summer conditions bota et al 2014 guida et al 2017 ochogavía et al 2011 patanè et al 2016 among those several long shelf life lsl landraces have improved drought tolerance as compared to modern genotypes and some of their adaptive mechanisms allowing to increase wue have already been described conesa et al 2020 fullana pericàs et al 2019 galmés et al 2013 2011 guida et al 2017 tranchida lombardo et al 2018 the lsl phenotype characterized by an extended fruit post harvest conservation exists in several west mediterranean landraces like the de ramellet tomato from the balearic islands bota et al 2014 conesa et al 2014 the de penjar tomato from the eastern iberian peninsula casals et al 2012 and in some italian sacco et al 2017 sinesio et al 2007 and greek landraces terzopoulos and bebeli 2010 extended review of lsl landraces distribution and traits can be found in conesa et al 2020 previous studies used remote sensing and htpp in tomato to increase phenotyping precision and detect early effects of abiotic stresses suggesting their implementation in large collections daniel et al 2016 janni et al 2019 johansen et al 2020 2019 ramos infante et al 2019 vuong et al 2020 in this study the physiologic and agronomic performance of 91 tomato genotypes under well watered and deficit irrigation conditions was assessed using high throughput uav phenotyping technologies and it was validated by comparing with conventional leaf level physiologic measurements at plant level the screened genotypes included 68 western mediterranean lsl landraces and 23 non lsl landraces and modern inbreeds of very diverse origin and fruit types most with evidence for improved tolerance to open field summer cultivation conditions we hypothesized a differential genotype performance regarding productivity and drought adaptation that should emerge at canopy and leaf levels thus our objectives were 1 to assess the use of remote sensing measurements to physiologically and agronomically phenotype a large and variable tomato collection and its response to water deficit and 2 to investigate if the relationships between remote sensing and leaf level physiologic measurements and agronomic traits are different depending on the tomato genotype or group 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material ninety one tomato genotypes solanum lycopersicum l were evaluated in this study two genotype groups were stablished namely control genotypes con 23 genotypes and long shelf life landraces lsl 68 genotypes the con group included non lsl landraces from the mediterranean basin and the m82 and oh8245 genotypes which were included as two non mediterranean control genotypes the lsl group included genotypes from different western mediterranean regions covering most of the variability genotype codes and seed providers are shown in table s1 a sample of genotype variability regarding leaf and fruit morphology is shown in fig s1 seeds were germinated under greenhouse conditions in plastic trays filled with peat based substrate in order to ensure seed germination and avoid the spread of fungal and virus diseases seeds were treated according to the procedure described in fullana pericàs et al 2019 2 2 experimental design and field conditions the experiment was performed at a commercial tomato field in ariany mallorca balearic islands latitude 39º38 n longitude 3º08 e altitude 79 m a s l fig 1a following commercial procedures field soil was fumigated at a rate of 300 l ha 1 with 50 metam sodium anhydrous 50 p v and enriched with 250 kg ha 1 of a granulated fertilizer composition of 12 of total n 8 of p2o5 and 16 of k2o prior transplantation field soil was clay and had an electric conductivity of 0 55 ms cm 1 a ph of 8 4 soil analyses performed before plant transplantation showed low heterogeneity in the main soil parameters not shown outdoor plant beds were 80 m long and 30 cm width distributed in two blocks separated by 6 m plants were irrigated by a black plastic covered dripping system azudpro 0 33 m emitter spacing 1 mm thickness 2 15 l h 1 at 100 kpa within each block 5 plants of each genotype were randomly planted one month after germination with a separation of 0 8 m within lines to avoid differences due to management plants were grown freely without sustain structures and with no pruning all over the experiment pests and weeds were treated following typical commercial practices monthly average temperature in ºc and relative air humidity over the experiment were 24 1 and 60 in june 25 8 and 69 in july 26 2 and 70 in august and 20 6 and 76 in september no rainfall was recorded in june while 6 0 mm 8 3 mm and 19 0 mm were registered in july august and september respectively 2 3 irrigation treatments two treatments were stablished corresponding to each block both were irrigated covering the daily crop evapotranspiration etc during the first month after field transplantation afterwards one block maintained the irrigation covering the daily etc well watered treatment ww while in the other block the irrigation was stopped water deficit treatment wd thus over all the cultivation period ww treatment received 606 mm and wd treatment 215 mm and thus only 40 of etc was covered in wd treatment over the experiment fig s2 table s2 weekly reference evapotranspiration was calculated according to fao 56 testa et al 2011 using data obtained by two nearby weather stations crop evapotranspiration etc was obtained as the product of eto and the crop coefficient k c at each growth stage allen et al 2006 the used k c were 0 6 for initial 0 9 for medium and 1 15 for mature and final stages table s2 see fullana pericàs et al 2019 for more details 2 4 leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured 50 days after field transplantation 20 days after wd treatment application simultaneously with an open infrared gas exchange analyzer system equipped with a leaf chamber fluorometer li 6400 40 li cor inc usa along the measurements the vapor pressure deficit vpd ranged between 1 1 kpa and 2 8 kpa with a mean of 2 1 kpa measurements were performed from 09 00 14 00 during eight days environmental conditions in the leaf chamber consisted of a photosynthetic photon flux density of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 with 10 blue light and a leaf temperature of 32 c measurements were performed after inducing steady state photosynthesis for at least 5 min at an ambient co2 concentration ca of 400 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 the quantum efficiency of the photosystem ii psii driven electron transport was determined using the eq 1 1 φ psii f m f s f m where fs is the steady state fluorescence in the light ppfd 1500 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and f m the maximum fluorescence obtained with a light saturating pulse 8500 μmol photon m 2 s 1 genty et al 1989 as φpsii represents the number of electrons transferred per photon absorbed by psii the rate of electron transport etr can be calculated as 2 2 etr φpsii ppfd α β where α is the leaf absorbance and β is the distribution of absorbed energy between the two photosystems the values of α and β were obtained from fullana pericàs et al 2017 2 5 leaf δ13c isotope composition leaf carbon isotope composition δ13c was determined from a young fully expanded leaf per plant replicate leaves were dried at 60 ºc until constant weight ca 72 h ground to fine powder and sampled for analysis samples were combusted in an elemental analyzer thermo flash ea 1112 series bremen germany and co2 and n2 were directly injected into a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo finnigan delta xp bremen germany for isotope analysis peach leaf standards nist 1547 were run every six samples the standard deviation of the analysis was below 0 1 results for δ13c are presented as δ vs pdb 2 6 fruit production and quality measurements fruit production was measured at 5 different times depending on the ripening stage of each genotype thus five different harvests were performed at 79 92 96 107 and 114 days after field transplantation in each harvest only red ripe fruits i e 90 turned non green color either red or yellow depending on the genotype were harvested for any plant of any genotype and treatment data shown corresponds to the sum of the five harvests which was always scored in a per plant fashion see fullana pericàs et al 2019 for more details for fruit quality a digital refractometer and electrical conductimeter pal bxacid f5 atago tokyo japan was used to measure the total soluble solids tss and the acidity in 8 healthy fruits per plant 2 7 aerial image analysis the images of the study were acquired using an unmanned aerial vehicle uav fv8 atyges malaga spain fig 1b the uav was controlled by an autopilot for autonomous flying ap04 uav navigation madrid spain and followed a flight plan using waypoints to acquire imagery from all study field aerial measurements were performed 65 days after field transplantation and were performed during the solar noon to avoid plant shadows that could hinder the image analysis the uav was equipped with a parrot sequoia sensor parrot sa paris france the parrot sequoia sensor imaged with one 16 megapixel rolling shutter rgb camera at 4608 3456 pixel resolution and four 1 5 megapixel global shutter single band cameras imaging at 1280 960 pixel resolution in green 550 nm red 660 nm red edge 735 nm and near infrared 790 nm spectral bands sensors were calibrated by a reflectance panel provided by the manufacturer just before the flight in the takeoff site this equipment includes a light sensor placed in the top of the uav that measures the incoming sun radiation during the flight and corrects the reflectance data from the 4 sensors by the fluctuating irradiance the image resolution ground pixel size was of 1 65 cm pixel at typical established flight altitude of 15 m above the terrain the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated as in rouse et al 1974 3 ndvi nir red nir red using the same multispectral bands the simple ratio index sr was calculated as 4 sr nir red the green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi was calculated using the green band 500 550 mm as 5 gndvi nir green nir green canopy projected area cpa was measured using a 16 mm lens rgb camera alpha 5000 sony tokyo japan on board measuring the area covered by each plant the field of view fov was 25 5º which delivered high rgb image resolution ground pixel size of 0 86 cm pixel at typical established flight altitude of 30 m above the terrain image post processing was carried out using pix4dpro ver 3 3 29 pix4d lausanne switzerland a total of 25 ground control points gcps were used for geo referencing of the images using this software all gcps were build covering a 20 10 cm steel plate with aluminum foil to ease its visualization in images error was assessed using the root mean square error rmse of gcps with values 0 05 m obtained maps were mounted in arcmap module of arcgis version 10 3 1 esri inc usa where individual plant shape was manually extracted following this the different spectral bands were extracted as a mean of the selected region and multispectral indices were calculated according to the previous formulas similarly cpa was extracted using the individual shapes 2 8 statistical analyses one way anova was performed in all measured parameters to reveal differences between treatments or within treatments for the genotype groups p value 0 05 after duncan post hoc test pearson s correlations r were calculated to determine the relationships among the studied parameters ancova analysis was performed to evaluate differences in intercept and slopes between different regression analyses all statistical analyses were performed using r software ver 3 2 2 r core team vienna austria 3 results 3 1 variability in leaf level physiologic parameters and correlations among them under well watered ww conditions there were no differences in the net co2 assimilation rate an and stomatal conductance gs between control con and long shelf life lsl genotypes table 1 both con and lsl had lower an and gs and higher intrinsic water use efficiency wuei under water deficit wd as compared to ww however under wd average values of lsl for an and gs were 10 and 25 respectively lower than those of con regarding wuei lsl presented lower average values than con under ww but higher under wd leaf carbon isotope composition δ13c values were 5 higher under the wd than under ww conditions having the lsl group higher δ13c average values than con regardless of the treatment table 1 concerning the correlations among leaf physiologic measurements an and gs showed a positive relationship when considering all data having con and lsl a similar behavior when considered separately fig 2a the electron transport rate etr to net co2 assimilation rate ratio etr an a physiological indicator of stress was negatively correlated to gs fig 2b similarly a negative correlation was found between wuei and gs fig 2c all these relationships were also significant when considering con and lsl separately but ancova analysis did not reveal any difference between such groups in the slope or intercept p value 0 05 a negative correlation was observed between δ13c and both an and gs fig 2d e with differences between con and lsl regressions ancova analysis revealed that lsl had higher an and gs than con at low δ13c values on the contrary there was a positive relationship between δ13c and wuei when considering all data although this relationship was only significant for lsl when considering genotype groups separately fig 2f 3 2 variability in remote sensing parameters the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the canopy projected area cpa showed similar trends in response to water treatments among genotype groups having lsl near 5 higher ndvi and 30 cpa values than con regardless of the treatment table 1 both genotype groups reduced their ndvi and cpa under wd a significant positive correlation was found between both parameters r 0 59 p value 0 001 fig s3 3 3 relationships between leaf level physiologic and remote sensing measurements the information obtained through htpp employing the uav was compared with the leaf level physiologic measurements in order to assess their reliability as a high throughput substitute of plant level measurements contrasting results were obtained when examining the relationship between ndvi and cpa with leaf gas exchange and carbon isotope composition fig 3 ndvi was positively correlated with both an and gs either when considering all genotypes and treatments together and for con and lsl separately fig 3a b under both water treatments ndvi was negatively correlated with water use efficiency related traits considering either wuei and δ13c for all genotypes together and separately in groups fig 3c d for all the relationships previously described ancova analyses revealed differences between con and lsl regressions in their intercepts p value 0 05 but not in their slopes in general cpa showed weaker or non significant relationships with the leaf level physiologic parameters as compared to the ndvi significant correlations with cpa were only observed for an gs and wuei when considering all genotypes together fig 3e f g for con genotypes cpa correlated with gs and wuei while for lsl significant correlations were found with all leaf level parameters fig 3e h for the correlations with gs and wuei where both con and lsl regressions were significant ancova analysis revealed differences in their intercepts p value 0 05 but not in their slopes other vegetation indexes were obtained from uav measurements such as the simple ratio index sr and the green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi when considering all genotypes and treatments both sr and gndvi correlated with all ground based parameters i e an gs wuei and δ13c table 2 showing a similar behavior than the previously observed for ndvi 3 4 variability in fruit related traits and the relationship with remote sensing parameters no differences in fruit production were found between lsl and con under ww conditions table 3 different to fruit production there were differences in the total soluble solids tss and acidity between lsl and con with higher values in the former group 10 for tss and 30 for acidity no differences between genotype groups were found for fruit related traits under wd conditions all genotype groups decreased their fruit production 30 and 20 reduction in con and lsl respectively and increased tss under wd as compared to ww while only con increased acidity under wd table 3 the relationships between the uav remote sensing data and the fruit production and quality parameters was further explored fruit production was positively correlated with ndvi either when considering all genotypes and treatments together and considering genotype groups separately fig 4a similar regression coefficients resulted for fruit production when correlating it to sr fig 4b and to gndvi table s3 however higher correlation coefficients were obtained when fruit production was correlated with cpa fig 4c despite ndvi and gndvi were correlated with tss when considering all genotypes and treatments fig 4d table s3 the correlation of tss with sr showed higher correlation coefficient and was significant regardless of the genotype group fig 4e on the other hand correlation between cpa and tss was only significant for lsl genotypes fig 4f any of the uav high throughput parameters was correlated with acidity except cpa when considering only lsl genotypes table s3 4 discussion the need for efficient and reliable htpp methodology is claimed as a major constraint for genetic crop breeding programs araus and kefauver 2018 and references therein despite remote sensing has important advantages related to high automation and reproducibility of measurements over time the challenge is still the reliability with common leaf level physiologic parameters or fruit related traits araus and kefauver 2018 rötter et al 2011 stylinski et al 2002 suárez et al 2008 one of the current pitfalls in most of the studies attempting to correlate remote sensing with those measurements is that include low genetic variability in the screened plant material which biases the results of the correlation to genotype related responses e g duan et al 2019 fortes et al 2015 wu et al 2008 the current study which contains 797 plants from 91 different tomato genotypes aims to test the usefulness of remote sensing and high throughput measurements to predict plant stress response in open field tomato crops the relevance of the study increases given the worldwide importance of the tomato crop and the ease to transfer results from this model crop to further horticultural fleshy fruit crops 4 1 leaf level physiologic differences among genotypes are detected with remote sensing measurements the differences in physiologic parameters between con and lsl table 1 agree with the results reported in previous studies comparing drought adapted lsl genotypes with commercial and non drought adapted genotypes denoting a different physiologic behavior between those groups fullana pericàs et al 2019 2017 galmés et al 2013 2011 giorio et al 2018 guida et al 2017 landi et al 2017 patanè et al 2016 in this study we show that these contrasting performance was also observed at whole plant level with differences between con and lsl in ndvi and cpa regardless of the treatment table 1 under field conditions multispectral indices have been related to leaf biochemical parameters such as chlorophyll content and other photosynthetic pigments jay et al 2019 le maire et al 2004 wu et al 2008 zarco tejada et al 2013b in fact those indices have been used to track changes in an in a processing tomato genotype marino et al 2015 and in corn and orange crops tan et al 2013 zarco tejada et al 2016 2013a the results of the present study where drought promoted declines in an and gs which were translated in reductions in multispectral indices and cpa fig 3 table 2 show that remote sensing htpp parameters are an efficient tool to explore drought impact over the physiologic performance of a large tomato collection 4 2 tomato groups presented different regressions between leaf level and remote sensing measurements the results of the present experiment corroborate the relationship between physiologic performance and remote sensing in a large tomato collection further ancova analysis revealed different performance of con and lsl genotypes for these relationships denoting a different physiologic behavior detected by remote sensing phenotyping for the same ndvi value lsl genotypes had lower an and gs than con fig 3a b which in turn lead to larger wuei fig 3c the higher wuei of lsl was achieved through a larger reduction in gs as compared to the reduction in an in accordance with previous reports on tomato landraces with enhanced drought tolerance galmés et al 2013 giorio et al 2018 guida et al 2017 interestingly con under wd had similar δ13c values than lsl under ww denoting the different behavior in wue between genotype groups table 1 this contrasting performance explains the differences in the relationship of δ13c with leaf gas exchange parameters between genotype groups having lsl higher an and gs than con for the same δ13c fig 2d e which in turn explains the higher ndvi for lsl genotypes for the same δ13c values fig 3d it is worthy to note that no correlation of cpa with δ13c was observed for con but a negative relationship was found for lsl fig 3i several studies related cpa with crop physiologic status growth and leaf transpiration enciso et al 2019 haboudane et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2010 hence the higher cpa and lower gs of lsl as compared to con under wd indicates that the constrained gs in lsl thus driving higher wue do not impose a detriment in plant growth table 2 aside of the vegetation indices used in this study plant s temperature directly collected by uav thermal imagery can be linked to plant water stress by stomata performance and the leaf energy balance berni et al 2009 gago et al 2017 2015 despite the relationship between leaf temperature and leaf physiology has been explored in tomato bhattarai et al 2021 camejo et al 2005 morales et al 2003 there is almost no information in literature regarding the use of thermal imagery to monitor changes in physiologic parameters in this crop hence due to the reduced resolution of the microbolometer thermal sensors and its cost its employment is reduced because of the difficulties to perform adequate high resolution thermal maps for extended field trials of herbaceous species that have a reduced canopy compared to trees and vines 4 3 fruit production and quality can also be approached using remote sensing measurements in large tomato collections fruit production reduction under wd conditions was 15 lower in lsl than in con genotypes table 3 and the changes in fruit production correlated with remote sensing measurements fig 4a c johansen et al 2020 used rgb and multispectral indices to develop biomass and fruit production prediction models in a tomato wild species other studies have also described correlations between ndvi and tomato fruit production with higher regression coefficients than that obtained in the present study campillo et al 2019 fortes et al 2014 ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 as a main difference previous studies considered only a single genotype in their trials our results show that the inclusion of large genotypic variability in phenotyping trials prevents the existence of high correlation coefficients between remote sensing and leaf level parameters hindering the obtention of reliable models that could increase htpp accuracy in tomato crop stronger correlations for fruit production were found with cpa than with multispectral indices fig 4c the weak correlations between fruit production and multispectral indices more linked with physiologic traits fig 3 were mostly explained by the low correlation coefficients observed among physiologic and agronomic parameters fig s4 alternatively those tomato genotypes with enhanced plant growth and more open canopies i e more exposed zenithally can sustain higher fruit production a large intra and inter genotypic variability in agronomic morphologic and quality traits has been described in mediterranean lsl tomato landraces bota et al 2014 cebolla cornejo et al 2013 figàs et al 2018 in fact higher correlation coefficients in the relationship between cpa and fruit production were found for con as compared to lsl fig 4c indicating that the large variability included in the lsl group was not only agronomical but also in growth behavior beyond the relationship with fruit production the present study includes at the best of our knowledge the first attempt to relate whole plant remote sensing measurements with tomato fruit quality in tomato previous studies related fruit quality with colorimetric and hyperspectral images measured directly on the tomato fruit bello et al 2020 ramos infante et al 2019 in grapevines and fruit orchards changes in ndvi plant canopy have been explored as a solution to monitor fruit maturation and estimate fruit quality with promising results meyers et al 2020 overbeck et al 2017 stagakis et al 2012 uribeetxebarria et al 2019 it has been largely described that tomato plants under water deficit conditions usually present an enhanced fruit quality i e higher tss and acidity reviewed in beckles 2012 and ripoll et al 2014 in our study fruit quality traits correlated with the main leaf level physiologic parameters fig s5 and thus relationships between fruit quality and multispectral indices should be expected fig 4 consequently our results suggest that the use of uavs equipped with multispectral cameras can be used to monitor both the plant physiologic performance and the fruit tss in open field tomato trials 4 4 concluding remarks this research provides crucial information for future htpp trials identifying traits and relationships enabling to screen high genotypic variability and its response to wd as a major constraint for fruit production and fruit quality prediction models from remote sensing data in tomato crop which could be extended to similar crops our results show that leaf physiology and fruit quality traits were better related with multispectral indices as ndvi gndvi and sr whereas fruit production was closely related to cpa nevertheless different correlations were found depending on the genotype group observed consequently uavs measurements should be mainly considered in phenotyping studies including genotypes with similar physiologic behavior and response to water deficit in cases where this is not possible or unknown our outcomes suggest that remote sensing must be combined with plant based measurements as leaf gas exchange or leaf δ13c to identify those genotypes with different physiologic behavior allowing to increase htpp accuracy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9776,field high throughput phenotyping htpp studies are highly needed to study water use efficiency wue stress tolerance capacities yield and quality in tomato to improve crop breeding strategies and adapt them to the climatic change scenario in this study uav remote sensing is tested by comparison with leaf level physiologic and agronomic measurements in a collection including 91 tomato genotypes these genotypes include long shelf life lsl and non lsl con mediterranean landraces cultivated under well watered ww covering 100 crop evapotranspiration demands and water deficit wd irrigation stopped one month after plantlet transplantation to field conditions aerial remote sensing including multispectral imaging leaf gas exchange leaf carbon isotope composition δ13c fruit production and quality measurements including total soluble solids and acidity were performed differences between con and lsl genotypes were observed in leaf level physiologic and remote sensing measurements under both ww and wd conditions while for agronomic measurements differences were only found for quality traits under ww conditions significant relationships were detected between remote sensing and leaf level physiologic and agronomic measurements when considering all genotypes and treatments however different regressions were described for con and lsl genotypes mainly due their different physiologic behavior and response to wd for instance for the same ndvi value lsl genotypes showed near 30 lower an and half gs than con and therefore higher intrinsic water use efficiency wuei also tomato fruit quality was approached through remote sensing measurements being correlated with multispectral indices in conclusion this study shows how remote sensing can help to optimize tomato physiologic and agronomic phenotyping processes however it also points out that the inclusion of genotypes with a different water use efficiency behavior and response to wd lead to a large scattering in the relationships between remote sensing and physiologic and agronomic traits and prevents to obtention of reliable models keywords field phenotyping fruit quality landraces ndvi photosynthesis remote sensing wue 1 introduction global climate models based into the climatic change predict increases in the annual mean temperature for the next decades especially in the summer season battisti and naylor 2009 in the mediterranean basin temperature increase will be accompanied by reductions in the rainfall from 25 to 50 giorgi and lionello 2008 hertig and tramblay 2017 raymond et al 2019 considering this scenario improving water use efficiency wue and stress tolerance in crops becomes a challenge to meet global food demands at the lowest agricultural water consumption the increase of plants wue is usually related to lower leaf transpiration rates leading to increased leaf temperature and results in lower photosynthetic rates plant growth and yield condon et al 2002 eamus 1991 medrano et al 2015 thus there is an urgent need to characterize the performance of large numbers of crop genotypes under field conditions in order to detect those with increased wue and drought tolerance but still sustaining acceptable commercial fruit production and quality mickelbart et al 2015 for this purpose the use of high throughput phenotyping htpp technologies usually based on remote sensing allow to obtain detailed valuable and non invasive information suitable to be related and to complement plant level measurements in order to drive novel strategies in crop improvement towards climate change araus et al 2018 the use of remote sensing technology mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs to monitor crop fields has revolutionized field phenotyping in the last years adão

comar et al 2012 gianquinto et al 2011 padilla et al 2015 zarco tejada et al 2012 and also woody crops as olive or grapevine calderón et al 2015 caruso et al 2019 zarco tejada et al 2005 among the vis the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is probably the most commonly used to estimate biomass production plant vigor stress levels yield and even as a proxy to photosynthesis fortes et al 2015 2014 gamon et al 2015 steltzer and welker 2006 virlet et al 2015 uavs htpp technology can overcome some of the previous spatial and temporal limitations intrinsic to the traditional leaf level physiologic measurements however there are still information gaps regarding the relationship between the data acquired through plant truth eco physiologic techniques and high throughput uav phenotyping therefore further integrative approaches are required to improve our understanding of the different genotypes performance at real field conditions araus et al 2018 gago et al 2015 for

relationship may be affected by the interaction between environment and genotypic variability condon 2004 although both leaf gas exchange traits and δ13c provide highly valuable information to evaluate crop breeding performance their measurement is time consuming and economically expensive when screening a large number of plants additionally both are mostly focused at leaf rather than plant level limiting a wide overview of the crop physiology and are difficult to implement in field trials at which added to large plant numbers parameters should be measured within a narrow timescale and or in a periodic way along the season araus and cairns 2014 gago et al 2015 tomato solanum lycopersicum l is one of the most produced vegetables worldwide and its production has been almost doubled in the last 20 years from 1000 million to 1900 million tones fao 2021 despite tomato crop is widely distributed and adapted to an important range of climates cuartero and fernández muñoz 1999 it is mainly cultivated in temperate regions particularly the mediterranean basin at open field tomato is a spring summer high water demanding crop requiring more than 3 l per plant and day at maturity harmanto et al 2005 considering the predicted climate change scenario it becomes essential to explore the tomato genotypic variability to find the most resilient genotypes under stress conditions becoming valuable genetic resources to improve wue minimizing reductions in fruit production and quality under harsh conditions in this regard tomato crop is a notorious target for improvement given its worldwide importance and given it has become the model species for fleshy fruit corps giovannoni 2006 klee and giovannoni 2011 the tomato genome consortium 2012 within tomato most drought resilient genotypes have been described among local landraces in the mediterranean basin due to their selection over centuries under mediterranean summer conditions bota et al 2014 guida et al 2017 ochogavía et al 2011 patanè et al 2016 among those several long shelf life lsl landraces have improved drought tolerance as compared to modern genotypes and some of their adaptive mechanisms allowing to increase wue have already been described conesa et al 2020 fullana pericàs et al 2019 galmés et al 2013 2011 guida et al 2017 tranchida lombardo et al 2018 the lsl phenotype characterized by an extended fruit post harvest conservation exists in several west mediterranean landraces like the de ramellet tomato from the balearic islands bota et al 2014 conesa et al 2014 the de penjar tomato from the eastern iberian peninsula casals et al 2012 and in some italian sacco et al 2017 sinesio et al 2007 and greek landraces terzopoulos and bebeli 2010 extended review of lsl landraces distribution and traits can be found in conesa et al 2020 previous studies used remote sensing and htpp in tomato to increase phenotyping precision and detect early effects of abiotic stresses suggesting their implementation in large collections daniel et al 2016 janni et al 2019 johansen et al 2020 2019 ramos infante et al 2019 vuong et al 2020 in this study the physiologic and agronomic performance of 91 tomato genotypes under well watered and deficit irrigation conditions was assessed using high throughput uav phenotyping technologies and it was validated by comparing with conventional leaf level physiologic measurements at plant level the screened genotypes included 68 western mediterranean lsl landraces and 23 non lsl landraces and modern inbreeds of very diverse origin and fruit types most with evidence for improved tolerance to open field summer cultivation conditions we hypothesized a differential genotype performance regarding productivity and drought adaptation that should emerge at canopy and leaf levels thus our objectives were 1 to assess the use of remote sensing measurements to physiologically and agronomically phenotype a large and variable tomato collection and its response to water deficit and 2 to investigate if the relationships between remote sensing and leaf level physiologic measurements and agronomic traits are different depending on the tomato genotype or group 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material ninety one tomato genotypes solanum lycopersicum l were evaluated in this study two genotype groups were stablished namely control genotypes con 23 genotypes and long shelf life landraces lsl 68 genotypes the con group included non lsl landraces from the mediterranean basin and the m82 and oh8245 genotypes which were included as two non mediterranean control genotypes the lsl group included genotypes from different western mediterranean regions covering most of the variability genotype codes and seed providers are shown in table s1 a sample of genotype variability regarding leaf and fruit morphology is shown in fig s1 seeds were germinated under greenhouse conditions in plastic trays filled with peat based substrate in order to ensure seed germination and avoid the spread of fungal and virus diseases seeds were treated according to the procedure described in fullana pericàs et al 2019 2 2 experimental design and field conditions the experiment was performed at a commercial tomato field in ariany mallorca balearic islands latitude 39º38 n longitude 3º08 e altitude 79 m a s l fig 1a following commercial procedures field soil was fumigated at a rate of 300 l ha 1 with 50 metam sodium anhydrous 50 p v and enriched with 250 kg ha 1 of a granulated fertilizer composition of 12 of total n 8 of p2o5 and 16 of k2o prior transplantation field soil was clay and had an electric conductivity of 0 55 ms cm 1 a ph of 8 4 soil analyses performed before plant transplantation showed low heterogeneity in the main soil parameters not shown outdoor plant beds were 80 m long and 30 cm width distributed in two blocks separated by 6 m plants were irrigated by a black plastic covered dripping system azudpro 0 33 m emitter spacing 1 mm thickness 2 15 l h 1 at 100 kpa within each block 5 plants of each genotype were randomly planted one month after germination with a separation of 0 8 m within lines to avoid differences due to management plants were grown freely without sustain structures and with no pruning all over the experiment pests and weeds were treated following typical commercial practices monthly average temperature in ºc and relative air humidity over the experiment were 24 1 and 60 in june 25 8 and 69 in july 26 2 and 70 in august and 20 6 and 76 in september no rainfall was recorded in june while 6 0 mm 8 3 mm and 19 0 mm were registered in july august and september respectively 2 3 irrigation treatments two treatments were stablished corresponding to each block both were irrigated covering the daily crop evapotranspiration etc during the first month after field transplantation afterwards one block maintained the irrigation covering the daily etc well watered treatment ww while in the other block the irrigation was stopped water deficit treatment wd thus over all the cultivation period ww treatment received 606 mm and wd treatment 215 mm and thus only 40 of etc was covered in wd treatment over the experiment fig s2 table s2 weekly reference evapotranspiration was calculated according to fao 56 testa et al 2011 using data obtained by two nearby weather stations crop evapotranspiration etc was obtained as the product of eto and the crop coefficient k c at each growth stage allen et al 2006 the used k c were 0 6 for initial 0 9 for medium and 1 15 for mature and final stages table s2 see fullana pericàs et al 2019 for more details 2 4 leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured 50 days after field transplantation 20 days after wd treatment application simultaneously with an open infrared gas exchange analyzer system equipped with a leaf chamber fluorometer li 6400 40 li cor inc usa along the measurements the vapor pressure deficit vpd ranged between 1 1 kpa and 2 8 kpa with a mean of 2 1 kpa measurements were performed from 09 00 14 00 during eight days environmental conditions in the leaf chamber consisted of a photosynthetic photon flux density of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 with 10 blue light and a leaf temperature of 32 c measurements were performed after inducing steady state photosynthesis for at least 5 min at an ambient co2 concentration ca of 400 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 the quantum efficiency of the photosystem ii psii driven electron transport was determined using the eq 1 1 φ psii f m f s f m where fs is the steady state fluorescence in the light ppfd 1500 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and f m the maximum fluorescence obtained with a light saturating pulse 8500 μmol photon m 2 s 1 genty et al 1989 as φpsii represents the number of electrons transferred per photon absorbed by psii the rate of electron transport etr can be calculated as 2 2 etr φpsii ppfd α β where α is the leaf absorbance and β is the distribution of absorbed energy between the two photosystems the values of α and β were obtained from fullana pericàs et al 2017 2 5 leaf δ13c isotope composition leaf carbon isotope composition δ13c was determined from a young fully expanded leaf per plant replicate leaves were dried at 60 ºc until constant weight ca 72 h ground to fine powder and sampled for analysis samples were combusted in an elemental analyzer thermo flash ea 1112 series bremen germany and co2 and n2 were directly injected into a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo finnigan delta xp bremen germany for isotope analysis peach leaf standards nist 1547 were run every six samples the standard deviation of the analysis was below 0 1 results for δ13c are presented as δ vs pdb 2 6 fruit production and quality measurements fruit production was measured at 5 different times depending on the ripening stage of each genotype thus five different harvests were performed at 79 92 96 107 and 114 days after field transplantation in each harvest only red ripe fruits i e 90 turned non green color either red or yellow depending on the genotype were harvested for any plant of any genotype and treatment data shown corresponds to the sum of the five harvests which was always scored in a per plant fashion see fullana pericàs et al 2019 for more details for fruit quality a digital refractometer and electrical conductimeter pal bxacid f5 atago tokyo japan was used to measure the total soluble solids tss and the acidity in 8 healthy fruits per plant 2 7 aerial image analysis the images of the study were acquired using an unmanned aerial vehicle uav fv8 atyges malaga spain fig 1b the uav was controlled by an autopilot for autonomous flying ap04 uav navigation madrid spain and followed a flight plan using waypoints to acquire imagery from all study field aerial measurements were performed 65 days after field transplantation and were performed during the solar noon to avoid plant shadows that could hinder the image analysis the uav was equipped with a parrot sequoia sensor parrot sa paris france the parrot sequoia sensor imaged with one 16 megapixel rolling shutter rgb camera at 4608 3456 pixel resolution and four 1 5 megapixel global shutter single band cameras imaging at 1280 960 pixel resolution in green 550 nm red 660 nm red edge 735 nm and near infrared 790 nm spectral bands sensors were calibrated by a reflectance panel provided by the manufacturer just before the flight in the takeoff site this equipment includes a light sensor placed in the top of the uav that measures the incoming sun radiation during the flight and corrects the reflectance data from the 4 sensors by the fluctuating irradiance the image resolution ground pixel size was of 1 65 cm pixel at typical established flight altitude of 15 m above the terrain the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated as in rouse et al 1974 3 ndvi nir red nir red using the same multispectral bands the simple ratio index sr was calculated as 4 sr nir red the green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi was calculated using the green band 500 550 mm as 5 gndvi nir green nir green canopy projected area cpa was measured using a 16 mm lens rgb camera alpha 5000 sony tokyo japan on board measuring the area covered by each plant the field of view fov was 25 5º which delivered high rgb image resolution ground pixel size of 0 86 cm pixel at typical established flight altitude of 30 m above the terrain image post processing was carried out using pix4dpro ver 3 3 29 pix4d lausanne switzerland a total of 25 ground control points gcps were used for geo referencing of the images using this software all gcps were build covering a 20 10 cm steel plate with aluminum foil to ease its visualization in images error was assessed using the root mean square error rmse of gcps with values 0 05 m obtained maps were mounted in arcmap module of arcgis version 10 3 1 esri inc usa where individual plant shape was manually extracted following this the different spectral bands were extracted as a mean of the selected region and multispectral indices were calculated according to the previous formulas similarly cpa was extracted using the individual shapes 2 8 statistical analyses one way anova was performed in all measured parameters to reveal differences between treatments or within treatments for the genotype groups p value 0 05 after duncan post hoc test pearson s correlations r were calculated to determine the relationships among the studied parameters ancova analysis was performed to evaluate differences in intercept and slopes between different regression analyses all statistical analyses were performed using r software ver 3 2 2 r core team vienna austria 3 results 3 1 variability in leaf level physiologic parameters and correlations among them under well watered ww conditions there were no differences in the net co2 assimilation rate an and stomatal conductance gs between control con and long shelf life lsl genotypes table 1 both con and lsl had lower an and gs and higher intrinsic water use efficiency wuei under water deficit wd as compared to ww however under wd average values of lsl for an and gs were 10 and 25 respectively lower than those of con regarding wuei lsl presented lower average values than con under ww but higher under wd leaf carbon isotope composition δ13c values were 5 higher under the wd than under ww conditions having the lsl group higher δ13c average values than con regardless of the treatment table 1 concerning the correlations among leaf physiologic measurements an and gs showed a positive relationship when considering all data having con and lsl a similar behavior when considered separately fig 2a the electron transport rate etr to net co2 assimilation rate ratio etr an a physiological indicator of stress was negatively correlated to gs fig 2b similarly a negative correlation was found between wuei and gs fig 2c all these relationships were also significant when considering con and lsl separately but ancova analysis did not reveal any difference between such groups in the slope or intercept p value 0 05 a negative correlation was observed between δ13c and both an and gs fig 2d e with differences between con and lsl regressions ancova analysis revealed that lsl had higher an and gs than con at low δ13c values on the contrary there was a positive relationship between δ13c and wuei when considering all data although this relationship was only significant for lsl when considering genotype groups separately fig 2f 3 2 variability in remote sensing parameters the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the canopy projected area cpa showed similar trends in response to water treatments among genotype groups having lsl near 5 higher ndvi and 30 cpa values than con regardless of the treatment table 1 both genotype groups reduced their ndvi and cpa under wd a significant positive correlation was found between both parameters r 0 59 p value 0 001 fig s3 3 3 relationships between leaf level physiologic and remote sensing measurements the information obtained through htpp employing the uav was compared with the leaf level physiologic measurements in order to assess their reliability as a high throughput substitute of plant level measurements contrasting results were obtained when examining the relationship between ndvi and cpa with leaf gas exchange and carbon isotope composition fig 3 ndvi was positively correlated with both an and gs either when considering all genotypes and treatments together and for con and lsl separately fig 3a b under both water treatments ndvi was negatively correlated with water use efficiency related traits considering either wuei and δ13c for all genotypes together and separately in groups fig 3c d for all the relationships previously described ancova analyses revealed differences between con and lsl regressions in their intercepts p value 0 05 but not in their slopes in general cpa showed weaker or non significant relationships with the leaf level physiologic parameters as compared to the ndvi significant correlations with cpa were only observed for an gs and wuei when considering all genotypes together fig 3e f g for con genotypes cpa correlated with gs and wuei while for lsl significant correlations were found with all leaf level parameters fig 3e h for the correlations with gs and wuei where both con and lsl regressions were significant ancova analysis revealed differences in their intercepts p value 0 05 but not in their slopes other vegetation indexes were obtained from uav measurements such as the simple ratio index sr and the green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi when considering all genotypes and treatments both sr and gndvi correlated with all ground based parameters i e an gs wuei and δ13c table 2 showing a similar behavior than the previously observed for ndvi 3 4 variability in fruit related traits and the relationship with remote sensing parameters no differences in fruit production were found between lsl and con under ww conditions table 3 different to fruit production there were differences in the total soluble solids tss and acidity between lsl and con with higher values in the former group 10 for tss and 30 for acidity no differences between genotype groups were found for fruit related traits under wd conditions all genotype groups decreased their fruit production 30 and 20 reduction in con and lsl respectively and increased tss under wd as compared to ww while only con increased acidity under wd table 3 the relationships between the uav remote sensing data and the fruit production and quality parameters was further explored fruit production was positively correlated with ndvi either when considering all genotypes and treatments together and considering genotype groups separately fig 4a similar regression coefficients resulted for fruit production when correlating it to sr fig 4b and to gndvi table s3 however higher correlation coefficients were obtained when fruit production was correlated with cpa fig 4c despite ndvi and gndvi were correlated with tss when considering all genotypes and treatments fig 4d table s3 the correlation of tss with sr showed higher correlation coefficient and was significant regardless of the genotype group fig 4e on the other hand correlation between cpa and tss was only significant for lsl genotypes fig 4f any of the uav high throughput parameters was correlated with acidity except cpa when considering only lsl genotypes table s3 4 discussion the need for efficient and reliable htpp methodology is claimed as a major constraint for genetic crop breeding programs araus and kefauver 2018 and references therein despite remote sensing has important advantages related to high automation and reproducibility of measurements over time the challenge is still the reliability with common leaf level physiologic parameters or fruit related traits araus and kefauver 2018 rötter et al 2011 stylinski et al 2002 suárez et al 2008 one of the current pitfalls in most of the studies attempting to correlate remote sensing with those measurements is that include low genetic variability in the screened plant material which biases the results of the correlation to genotype related responses e g duan et al 2019 fortes et al 2015 wu et al 2008 the current study which contains 797 plants from 91 different tomato genotypes aims to test the usefulness of remote sensing and high throughput measurements to predict plant stress response in open field tomato crops the relevance of the study increases given the worldwide importance of the tomato crop and the ease to transfer results from this model crop to further horticultural fleshy fruit crops 4 1 leaf level physiologic differences among genotypes are detected with remote sensing measurements the differences in physiologic parameters between con and lsl table 1 agree with the results reported in previous studies comparing drought adapted lsl genotypes with commercial and non drought adapted genotypes denoting a different physiologic behavior between those groups fullana pericàs et al 2019 2017 galmés et al 2013 2011 giorio et al 2018 guida et al 2017 landi et al 2017 patanè et al 2016 in this study we show that these contrasting performance was also observed at whole plant level with differences between con and lsl in ndvi and cpa regardless of the treatment table 1 under field conditions multispectral indices have been related to leaf biochemical parameters such as chlorophyll content and other photosynthetic pigments jay et al 2019 le maire et al 2004 wu et al 2008 zarco tejada et al 2013b in fact those indices have been used to track changes in an in a processing tomato genotype marino et al 2015 and in corn and orange crops tan et al 2013 zarco tejada et al 2016 2013a the results of the present study where drought promoted declines in an and gs which were translated in reductions in multispectral indices and cpa fig 3 table 2 show that remote sensing htpp parameters are an efficient tool to explore drought impact over the physiologic performance of a large tomato collection 4 2 tomato groups presented different regressions between leaf level and remote sensing measurements the results of the present experiment corroborate the relationship between physiologic performance and remote sensing in a large tomato collection further ancova analysis revealed different performance of con and lsl genotypes for these relationships denoting a different physiologic behavior detected by remote sensing phenotyping for the same ndvi value lsl genotypes had lower an and gs than con fig 3a b which in turn lead to larger wuei fig 3c the higher wuei of lsl was achieved through a larger reduction in gs as compared to the reduction in an in accordance with previous reports on tomato landraces with enhanced drought tolerance galmés et al 2013 giorio et al 2018 guida et al 2017 interestingly con under wd had similar δ13c values than lsl under ww denoting the different behavior in wue between genotype groups table 1 this contrasting performance explains the differences in the relationship of δ13c with leaf gas exchange parameters between genotype groups having lsl higher an and gs than con for the same δ13c fig 2d e which in turn explains the higher ndvi for lsl genotypes for the same δ13c values fig 3d it is worthy to note that no correlation of cpa with δ13c was observed for con but a negative relationship was found for lsl fig 3i several studies related cpa with crop physiologic status growth and leaf transpiration enciso et al 2019 haboudane et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2010 hence the higher cpa and lower gs of lsl as compared to con under wd indicates that the constrained gs in lsl thus driving higher wue do not impose a detriment in plant growth table 2 aside of the vegetation indices used in this study plant s temperature directly collected by uav thermal imagery can be linked to plant water stress by stomata performance and the leaf energy balance berni et al 2009 gago et al 2017 2015 despite the relationship between leaf temperature and leaf physiology has been explored in tomato bhattarai et al 2021 camejo et al 2005 morales et al 2003 there is almost no information in literature regarding the use of thermal imagery to monitor changes in physiologic parameters in this crop hence due to the reduced resolution of the microbolometer thermal sensors and its cost its employment is reduced because of the difficulties to perform adequate high resolution thermal maps for extended field trials of herbaceous species that have a reduced canopy compared to trees and vines 4 3 fruit production and quality can also be approached using remote sensing measurements in large tomato collections fruit production reduction under wd conditions was 15 lower in lsl than in con genotypes table 3 and the changes in fruit production correlated with remote sensing measurements fig 4a c johansen et al 2020 used rgb and multispectral indices to develop biomass and fruit production prediction models in a tomato wild species other studies have also described correlations between ndvi and tomato fruit production with higher regression coefficients than that obtained in the present study campillo et al 2019 fortes et al 2014 ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 as a main difference previous studies considered only a single genotype in their trials our results show that the inclusion of large genotypic variability in phenotyping trials prevents the existence of high correlation coefficients between remote sensing and leaf level parameters hindering the obtention of reliable models that could increase htpp accuracy in tomato crop stronger correlations for fruit production were found with cpa than with multispectral indices fig 4c the weak correlations between fruit production and multispectral indices more linked with physiologic traits fig 3 were mostly explained by the low correlation coefficients observed among physiologic and agronomic parameters fig s4 alternatively those tomato genotypes with enhanced plant growth and more open canopies i e more exposed zenithally can sustain higher fruit production a large intra and inter genotypic variability in agronomic morphologic and quality traits has been described in mediterranean lsl tomato landraces bota et al 2014 cebolla cornejo et al 2013 figàs et al 2018 in fact higher correlation coefficients in the relationship between cpa and fruit production were found for con as compared to lsl fig 4c indicating that the large variability included in the lsl group was not only agronomical but also in growth behavior beyond the relationship with fruit production the present study includes at the best of our knowledge the first attempt to relate whole plant remote sensing measurements with tomato fruit quality in tomato previous studies related fruit quality with colorimetric and hyperspectral images measured directly on the tomato fruit bello et al 2020 ramos infante et al 2019 in grapevines and fruit orchards changes in ndvi plant canopy have been explored as a solution to monitor fruit maturation and estimate fruit quality with promising results meyers et al 2020 overbeck et al 2017 stagakis et al 2012 uribeetxebarria et al 2019 it has been largely described that tomato plants under water deficit conditions usually present an enhanced fruit quality i e higher tss and acidity reviewed in beckles 2012 and ripoll et al 2014 in our study fruit quality traits correlated with the main leaf level physiologic parameters fig s5 and thus relationships between fruit quality and multispectral indices should be expected fig 4 consequently our results suggest that the use of uavs equipped with multispectral cameras can be used to monitor both the plant physiologic performance and the fruit tss in open field tomato trials 4 4 concluding remarks this research provides crucial information for future htpp trials identifying traits and relationships enabling to screen high genotypic variability and its response to wd as a major constraint for fruit production and fruit quality prediction models from remote sensing data in tomato crop which could be extended to similar crops our results show that leaf physiology and fruit quality traits were better related with multispectral indices as ndvi gndvi and sr whereas fruit production was closely related to cpa nevertheless different correlations were found depending on the genotype group observed consequently uavs measurements should be mainly considered in phenotyping studies including genotypes with similar physiologic behavior and response to water deficit in cases where this is not possible or unknown our outcomes suggest that remote sensing must be combined with plant based measurements as leaf gas exchange or leaf δ13c to identify those genotypes with different physiologic behavior allowing to increase htpp accuracy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9777,sunflower helianthus annuus l is one of the most cultivated oil crops in the world given its high dependence on water availability its cultivation in the mediterranean area is severely threatened by climate change very hot and dry weather conditions currently occurring in the mediterranean area have a negative impact on sunflower yield many studies have pointed to earlier sowing dates as a promising strategy to prevent summer drought stress causing sunflower yield losses but the literature on winter sowing dates is scarce the aim of this research was to quantify the interplay between sowing date winter time included and water regime to sustain sunflower cultivation in the mediterranean area a field experiment and a modeling study were carried out to evaluate the effects of different sowing dates 00sd conventional sowing date in march april and earlier sowing dates in december january february depending on years under two different water regimes irrigated vs rainfed on quantitative traits of high oleic cultivars of sunflower field experiments revealed that sowing in late february mid march was the most effective strategy in terms of achene productivity achene production by sunflower was also simulated using epic under a baseline climatic scenario and for 4 hypothetical sowing dates d1 10th january d2 10th february d3 10th march d4 10th april and different irrigation strategies the most effective sowing date was d3 under rainfed conditions confirming the results of the field study irrigation from 20 days before anthesis up to flowering significantly improved achene yield for the early sowing dates d1 and d2 which almost reached their respective yield potentials this confirms that an earlier sowing date could be a viable management strategy in mediterranean areas with little water availability keywords epic sunflower yield gap sowing date water supply 1 introduction sunflower helianthus annuus l is a well adapted important oil crop in europe and a typical oil crop of the mediterranean region and italy it is valuable from different economic perspectives since i it is suited for biodiesel production pereyra irujo et al 2009 ragaglini et al 2011 ii many of its cultivars are rich in oleic acid which prevents cardiovascular diseases and thus represents an essential dietary source for humans fda 2018 and iii its crop residues are potential feedstock for biogas production monlau et al 2012 zhurka et al 2020 in the mediterranean area sunflower is cropped as a spring summer crop commonly considered a drought tolerant species and as such a valid option for regions where water resources are scant and the risk of water deficit is expected to increase garcía vila et al 2012 different studies have pointed out the high reliance of this crop on sufficient water availability during all its growth phases especially at the flowering and seed filling stages flagella et al 2002 iqbal et al 2005 ebrahimian et al 2019 under rainfed conditions sunflower sown in march april showed consistent productivity variation in the mediterranean region mainly related to rainfall occurring during the crop cycle de la vega and hall 2002 this risky trend could be further amplified by climate change projections ipcc 2014 forecasting higher day and night temperatures more variable rainfall distribution patterns higher atmospheric co2 and hydrological imbalances tariq et al 2018 from an agronomic perspective yield losses related to water deficiency and variability among years can be prevented through different management strategies such as winter planting drought escape seed priming or exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants drought tolerance iqbal et al 2005 singh et al 2015 and or irrigation provisioning debaeke and abroudrare 2004 given that the sowing date determines the amount of rainfall and temperature to which the crop will be exposed during its different growth stages zeleke and nendel 2019 some studies conducted in the mediterranean region identified an earlier sowing date as a win win solution to skip the drought phase flagella et al 2002 barros et al 2004 moreover this solution can make it possible to keep on cultivating a profitable crop for high quality oil production quiles et al 2002 and thus prevent further marginalization of drylands in most cases the hypotheses tested so far in the mediterranean region have been a conventional sowing date in late march april or even may vs an earlier sowing date in early march mid march flagella et al 2002 ferreira and abreu 2001 balalić et al 2012 in sardinia which belongs to the mediterranean region and where this experiment was carried out sunflower is generally sowed in march april the present study is structured in two parts i a field experiment testing the effects of different sowing dates rainfed or irrigated conditions on sunflower achene yield and ii a modeling study testing different irrigation strategies for different simulated sowing dates the 4 year field experiment was used to test sowing dates including winter sowing dates which are poorly investigated in the literature and their effects on crop productivity modeling was necessary to address i the interannual achene yield variability due to the treatments and climatic variability ii the yield gap between limited and unlimited water availability and iii the most effective climate adaptive irrigation strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 experimental site and design the field trial was conducted in sardinia italy at ottava 40 46 n 8 29 e 81m asl over four consecutive years from 2015 to 2018 the soils were well drained and mostly classified as lithic xerorthents madrau et al 2006 according to the usda soil taxonomy soil texture was classified as sandy clay loam deligios et al 2013 the ranges of values of the main soil characteristics were the following ph 8 3 8 4 organic carbon 1 1 1 3 nitrogen 0 10 0 12 and olsen p 1 0 3 6 ppm deligios et al 2013 the high oleic early hybrids montijo sis and p63hh69 corteva agriscience were used in 2015 16 and 2017 18 respectively a range of sowing dates was compared over the four years based on yearly rainfall and temperature patterns and the resulting field trafficability the benchmark date for all years was chosen to be 20th march 15th 25th march following the local practice and was defined as 00sd earlier sowing dates ranged from 17th dec to 23rd feb and were coded on the basis of the number of weeks ahead of 00 sd table 1 a later sowing date was tested in 2015 and coded on the basis of the number of weeks after 00sd all treatments were tested under hose irrigation i1 vs rainfed i0 conditions plot size was 45 m2 10 m 4 5 m row spacing was 0 75 m and plant spacing within the row was 0 15 m to provide a population density of about 8 8 plants m 2 the experimental trial was carried out each year as a simple 2 factor factorial irrigation x sowing date with a randomized complete block design and 4 replicates prior to sowing 30 kg ha 1 of n and 70 kg ha 1 of p2o5 were applied in the form of diammonium phosphate and an additional 35 kg ha 1 of n in the form of ammonium nitrate was top dressed glyphosate was sprayed at a concentration of 3 g l 1 of water for pre seeding weed control when necessary pre emergence weed control was performed using 900 g ha 1 of pendimethalin creoline diffusers and transparent wires were installed to prevent bird damage to seedlings at establishment seed predation by birds was also prevented by protecting the sampled capitula of each plot with non woven fabric after pollination 2 1 2 field measurements and laboratory analyses the response of sunflower to the treatments was assessed based on a multidimensional measurement protocol the phenological phase was recorded throughout the growing season according to the bbch scale for sunflower lancashire et al 1991 ten randomly selected plants per plot were tagged to be easily identified for each of the sixteen phenological observations selected during the sunflower crop cycle these records were used to calculate cumulative growing degree days cgdd c d starting from the mean temperature averaged between the maximum daily air temperature t max and the minimum daily temperature t min base temperature was set at 10 c cgdd was determined for each of the two periods between sowing and the end of anthesis at bbch 69 cgdd a and the period between sowing and crop harvest at bbch 97 cgdd h the number of plants per unit area was counted in each plot 30 days after sowing das 30 and at harvest number of capitula m 2 on a sampling area 5 m 3 m achene yield ay and yield components no of achenes per capitulum 1000 achenes weight were measured on the tagged plants used for phenological assessment the achenes of each of the 10 capitula were counted and weighed aboveground biomass agb was measured on the same 10 plants per plot achene dry matter and agb dry matter were determined after drying in a ventilated oven at 60 c till constant weight ay dry matter and agb dry matter were obtained by multiplying the average values of the 10 plants by the effective plant density of each plot then average plot data were proportionated per hectare 2 1 3 rainfall evapotranspiration irrigation and water use efficiency according to the köppen geiger climate classification map kottek et al 2006 the climate of the experimental site is predominantly hot dry summer mediterranean csa long term historical daily weather data was collected from the weather station located in the experimental field the long term 1981 2018 average annual rainfall was 512 mm with average annual reference evapotranspiration eto of 1094 mm and an aridity index of 0 47 corresponding to a semi arid climate middleton and thomas 1997 about 70 of the average annual rainfall fell between october and march and mean monthly air temperature calculated over the same period ranged from 9 9 c in january and february to 23 9 c in august annual mean 16 3 c fig 1 the mean annual rainfall during the conventional crop growing season march august was 150 mm and accounted for about 20 of the corresponding eto 770 mm monthly temperature and rainfall data were compared with the long term ones for each growing season and sowing date every year irrigation water was applied to i1 plots by hose irrigation every week starting from mid april to totally offset actual evapotranspiration eta calculated with hargreaves equation using daily input data water use efficiency wuea was expressed in kg ha 1 mm 1 and was determined as follows wuea ay eta where ay is the actual achene yield kg ha 1 eta was expressed in mm to this purpose according to mila et al 2016 the sunflower growing season was split in four intervals initial bbch 10 39 development bbch 51 59 reproductive bbch 61 69 and late season bbch 71 83 and a kc estimated under similar pedo climatic conditions with

statistical analyses were performed using an rstudio application of r software r core team 2014 environment packages nlme emmeans dplyr the significance of the differences between treatments was evaluated using tukey s test at p 0 05 2 2 crop modeling 2 2 1 calibration and application of the epic model the environmental policy integrated climate epic model version 1102 williams 1995 gassman et al 2005 izaurralde et al 2012 was calibrated and applied using input parameters derived from the above mentioned field experiments epic was used to estimate the influence of temperature and rainfall on the ay and agb of rainfed and irrigated sunflower in relation to the different sowing dates the model inputs were set using local soil and weather data information about field management as described in section 2 1 1 including irrigation volumes and fertilizer amounts and crop related data such as plant density and the duration of the crop growing period the model was calibrated for sunflower achene yield and above ground biomass the model performance was evaluated by calculating complementary indicators the relative root mean square error rrmse bellocchi et al 2002 modeling efficiency ef loague and green 1991 willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1982 loague and green 1991 and the slope and intercept of the regression line and the coefficient of determination r2 the model simulations were performed over a 50 year interval using fixed sowing dates while the harvest operations were scheduled according to heat unit accumulation the crop was harvested at 100 of total heat units required for maturity the simulations were carried out using the static soil option to avoid variation of the soil properties likely to affect crop production during the period the soil characteristics were set after initialization and reset each year to remove trends related to soil dynamics and focus on the effects of climate factors interannual achene yield variability was simulated keeping the actual management conditions already described in section 2 1 1 to assess the effects of temperature and precipitation on crop yield 2 2 2 drawing scenarios for sustainable sunflower management a baseline climate scenario was built from the data simulated with cosmo clm rockel et al 2008 using the specific 8 km horizontal resolution configuration developed for italy by centro euro mediterraneo sui cambiamenti climatici cmcc bucchignani et al 2016 zollo et al 2016 forced from the global model echam 5 4 developed by cmcc scoccimarro et al 2011 the baseline climate scenario was referred to the years 1972 2005 using a co2 concentration of 380 ppm daily generated datasets were bias corrected with monthly correction factors calculated from precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and obtained by comparing the overlapping periods of the baseline climate scenario with those of the local weather station when available the model was run using four different sowing dates d1 10th january d2 10th february d3 10th march d4 10th april under rainfed conditions setting the nitrogen fertilization input to 70 kg n ha 1 conventional management and plant density to 7 7 plants m 2 to simulate achene yield ys and the length of the growing season lgs the crop harvest date was set at maturity the simulations were used to estimate interannual achene production variability under water and nutritional conditions simulated by epic using the above mentioned crop management conditions the water limited achene yield yw was calculated as the benchmark for rainfed sunflower by removing nutritional stress the potential achene yield yp was obtained removing both water and nutritional stress the achene yield gap ygap was calculated between yw and the simulated yield ys by removing water stress for each sowing date van ittersum et al 2013 the yield gaps were also expressed as ygap 1 ys yw 100 epic was also used to identify sustainable water application strategies that might fill the yield gap between yp and yw watering strategy a wsa consisted in supplying 50 mm of water 20 days before anthesis which is the most water sensitive period for the crop according to the literature rawson and turner 1983 iqbal et al 2005 epic simulated the irrigation event 20 days before anthesis using the accumulated gdd from sowing to the 20 days before anthesis observed over the four years of the field experiment watering strategy b wsb was defined by setting one irrigation event per week starting 20 days before anthesis until the end of flowering epic simulated irrigation was aimed at compensating for water stress which was strictly a function of actual evapotranspiration divided by potential evapotranspiration 2 2 3 statistical analyses the simulated achene yields obtained under each treatment sowing date x water scenario were analyzed using a full factorial design r studio and the significance of the differences between treatments was evaluated using tukey s test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and sunflower development over the 4 years of the experiment the mean crop cycle length from sowing to harvest standard

sowing date and mid may over the 2015 18 period rainfall contributed between 7 and 36 of eto during the crop cycle across the different sowing dates on average 286 159 mm were supplied by irrigation to i1 00sd and 125 415 mm to the irrigated plots sowed earlier than 00sd irrigation did not change the duration of the sowing anthesis period but it delayed the harvesting date by about 170 gdd on average table 1 3 2 sunflower productivity yield components and biometry sunflower plant density ranged between 8 9 0 3 plants m 2 s d for 00sd and 3 3 1 1 plants m 2 for sd02 both observed in 2015 no

evaluation of the model simulation achene yield and above ground biomass the performance of the epic model was evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed achene yields and above ground biomass values under the different treatments suppl mat table 2 over the 2015 2018 period the observed ay ranged from 577 to 1589 kg ha 1 under rainfed conditions versus 1388 to 3137 kg ha 1 under irrigation the model showed a very good fit between simulated and observed ay data under both management strategies fig 2 fig 3 the fit between observed and simulated data for agb was better under rainfed than under irrigated conditions fig 2 fig 3 3 5 scenarios for sustainable sunflower management 3 5 1 epic simulation of the effects of the sowing date and water supply on sunflower yield under the baseline scenario the comparison of the four different simulated sowing dates d1 d2 d3 d4 made it evident that the crop cycle was shortened as sowing dates were delayed table 3 while the simulated achene yield ys increased the sowing date had similar effects on the water limited yield yw obtained by removing nitrogen stress following the same path as ys while the potential yield yp gradually decreased from d1 to d4 table 4 although the calculated water supply ranged between 250 and 275 mm for the 4 dates the yield gap for the earliest sowing dates d1 and d2 was much higher than for the latest sowing dates d3 and d4 table 4 fig 4 zooms in on the trends of simulated above ground biomass agbs accumulation throughout the growing season of sunflower sowed at different dates under rainfed conditions it points out d3 as the most promising sowing date in terms of achene yield the highest agbs accumulation was observed in june regardless of the sowing date fig 4 the simulated distribution of achene yield ys for the four hypothesized sowing dates under rainfed conditions highlighted greater stability 2000 kg ha 1 for d3 fig 5 based on the irrigation scenarios the hypothesis of a single irrigation of 50 mm applied 20 days before anthesis water scenario a wsa did not contribute to significantly increase achene yield compared to yw whatever the sowing date moreover this single irrigation event determined a flattening of ywsa at about 2050 kg ha 1 regardless of the sowing date table 5 ywsb for the earliest sowing dates d1 and d2 almost reached yp and saved about 100 mm compared to the water needed to achieve yp fig 6 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 field experiment the field experiment results confirmed that achene production by sunflower was heavily constrained by soil water availability under rainfed conditions and a semi arid mediterranean climate indeed the achene yield under irrigation was more than double than under rainfed conditions göksoy et al 2004 perniola et al 2006 many studies conducted on sunflower in the mediterranean region under rainfed conditions have identified an early sowing date as a good strategy to escape drought stress and preserve crop productivity ferreira and abreu 2001 flagella et al 2002 barros et al 2004 in most of the cases reported in the literature early sowing consisted in shifting from mid april or may to mid march ferreira and abreu 2001 flagella et al 2002 demir et al 2019 in our experiment the early sowing dates ranged from december to mid march while the benchmark sowing dates were centered on 20th march 1 week which was already early compared to the mid april conventional sowing dates mentioned by other authors for similar climatic regions ferreira and abreu 2001 flagella et al 2002 killi and altunbay 2005 perniola et al 2006 demir 2019 the differences in ay observed between 00 sd and sd02 in 2015 were mainly due to bird predation which halved plant density for sd02 linz et al 2011 the resulting ay was partially compensated for by the plasticity of sunflower whose aw and nac increased in the low density stands barros et al 2004 the observed achene yields except in 2018 when spring was exceptionally wet showed that sowing earlier than late february or mid march brought no substantial advantage in agreement with perniola et al 2006 this pattern was related to too low accumulation of cgdd a from sowing to anthesis and cgdd h from sowing to harvest including the seed filling phase for the earliest sowing dates many studies have highlighted the relevance of heat unit accumulation on aw during the seed filling phase between the end of anthesis and physiological maturity to prevent ay losses aguirrezábal et al 2003 qadir et al 2007 moreover ay is heavily influenced by water stress occurring during the achene filling phase and the observed ay reduction is not due to the number of achenes but to achene weight keipp et al 2020 in 2016 this pattern was clearly evident for i1 07 sd in this case irrigation started when sunflower was in the stem elongation stage bbch 31 and thus both the flowering and achene filling phases benefited from water availability a similar pattern was observed for 00 sd conversely for i1 13 sd irrigation was supplied during the flowering stage bbch 51 and it was prolonged only during the milking phase so that it was not efficient göksoy et al 2004 browne 1977 confirmed this by reporting that the greatest damage was generated when water stress occurred in the 20 days prior to flowering rawson and turner 1983 identified the two to three weeks before flowering as the optimal period for starting irrigation while negative effects of irrigation became apparent at anthesis this confirms our results moreover joshi et al 2017 identified the best watering strategy for confection sunflower to be irrigation until 50 of the disc flowers had completed flowering based on the results obtained in 2016 when more early sowing dates were tested and covered a very large sowing window it was possible to better understand the effects of the sowing dates on nac the reduced nac for the early sowing dates may have been due to reduced visits by insect pollinators because of earlier anthesis counterbalanced by the greater 1 000 achene weight compared to the later sowing dates under rainfed conditions this inverse trend between achene number and 1 000 achene weight was previously reported by de la vega and hall 2002 and related to the genotype similarly to the pattern observed for ay water use efficiency for the achene yield wuea was significantly higher for 00 sd than for the earlier sowing dates although no significant effect of the sowing date was recorded except in 2017 in our case the conventional sowing date was earlier than in other studies consequently the irrigation volumes needed under irrigated conditions were reduced and soil water availability under rainfed conditions followed an increment as the crop benefited from early spring rainfall when temperatures were mild enough this suggests mid march early april as a potential win win solution in terms of maximizing the achene yield potential and water use efficiency conversely for the earlier sowing dates sunflower failed to efficiently exploit rainfall because it occurred when the plants were in the initial developmental stages and average temperatures were still too low for achene setting this can be explained by insufficient pollination and or sub optimal weather conditions during flowering such as low radiation and too much wind scaven and raffenty 2013 4 2 epic simulation 4 2 1 model calibration the epic model successfully simulated sunflower achene and biomass production the accuracy of epic in simulating the sunflower growth dynamics was in line with studies on oilseed rape deligios et al 2013 and sunflower kiniry et al 1992 farina et al 2011 under similar agro climatic conditions nevertheless the model underestimated agb under irrigation while providing a reasonable average agb over the four years as already observed with the same model for other crop performances le et al 2018 4 2 2 sunflower productivity under a baseline scenario depending on the sowing date and water supply the baseline climate scenario confirmed that mid march early april d3 d4 were the most effective sowing times in terms of achene production compared to the earlier ones d1 d2 under semi arid mediterranean climate conditions as already discussed in section 4 2 1 these results are consistent with those reported by other studies showing advantages of early sowing dates in terms of achene yield vs end of april may d andria et al 1995 ferreira and abreu 2001 within the baseline scenario supplementary irrigation showed an interesting perspective especially under irrigation scenario b which proved to be a viable option for sunflower cultivation in the mediterranean area compared to the water needed to support the potential yield 265 mm on average water scenario b with 150 mm distributed in between 20 days before anthesis and flowering ensured an achene yield comparable to the yield potential under d3 and d4 under the same irrigation scenario the earliest dates d1 d2 led to even higher achene yield than d3 and d4 did the practical implication of the simulation made it evident that sowing in march d3 could be a promising solution to escape drought and keep high achene production under rainfed conditions conversely because early sowing occurs in winter crops are exposed to low radiation levels ferreira et al 2001 if low radiation is combined with water stress due to the absence of water this can have detrimental effects on yield nevertheless early sowing dates even in winter d1 d2 could represent a viable option for sunflower cultivation in the mediterranean region where only little water is available the apparent contradiction between the results of the field experiment and of the simulation as regards the convenience of early sowing under water availability must be interpreted considering the timing of irrigation while the irrigation strategy followed the calendar in the field experiment starting from mid april and neglecting plant phenology it was properly set to avoid plant stress in the simulation study and was successful even when little supplementary irrigation was used 5 conclusion the first outcome of the present study is that shifting sunflower sowing from april may to mid march early april could be the most appropriate cultivation strategy under rainfed mediterranean conditions the second outcome from the modeling study is that supplying water starting 20 days before anthesis up to flowering can bridge the gap between water limited achene yield and potential yield especially for the earliest sowing dates d1 d2 the practical implication of this study is that early sowing dates could be a viable strategy in the mediterranean area if supplementary irrigation is available 160 mm otherwise keeping the sowing date around mid march is the most promising strategy for high and stable achene production declaration of competing interest the authors

9777,sunflower helianthus annuus l is one of the most cultivated oil crops in the world given its high dependence on water availability its cultivation in the mediterranean area is severely threatened by climate change very hot and dry weather conditions currently occurring in the mediterranean area have a negative impact on sunflower yield many studies have pointed to earlier sowing dates as a promising strategy to prevent summer drought stress causing sunflower yield losses but the literature on winter sowing dates is scarce the aim of this research was to quantify the interplay between sowing date winter time included and water regime to sustain sunflower cultivation in the mediterranean area a field experiment and a modeling study were carried out to evaluate the effects of different sowing dates 00sd conventional sowing date in march april and earlier sowing dates in december january february depending on years under two different water regimes irrigated vs rainfed on quantitative traits of high oleic cultivars of sunflower field experiments revealed that sowing in late february mid march was the most effective strategy in terms of achene productivity achene production by sunflower was also simulated using epic under a baseline climatic scenario and for 4 hypothetical sowing dates d1 10th january d2 10th february d3 10th march d4 10th april and different irrigation strategies the most effective sowing date was d3 under rainfed conditions confirming the results of the field study irrigation from 20 days before anthesis up to flowering significantly improved achene yield for the early sowing dates d1 and d2 which almost reached their respective yield potentials this confirms that an earlier sowing date could be a viable management strategy in mediterranean areas with little water availability keywords epic sunflower yield gap sowing date water supply 1 introduction sunflower helianthus annuus l is a well adapted important oil crop in europe and a typical oil crop of the mediterranean region and italy it is valuable from different economic perspectives since i it is suited for biodiesel production pereyra irujo et al 2009 ragaglini et al 2011 ii many of its cultivars are rich in oleic acid which prevents cardiovascular diseases and thus represents an essential dietary source for humans fda 2018 and iii its crop residues are potential feedstock for biogas production monlau et al 2012 zhurka et al 2020 in the mediterranean area sunflower is cropped as a spring summer crop commonly considered a drought tolerant species and as such a valid option for regions where water resources are scant and the risk of water deficit is expected to increase garcía vila et al 2012 different studies have pointed out the high reliance of this crop on sufficient water availability during all its growth phases especially at the flowering and seed filling stages flagella et al 2002 iqbal et al 2005 ebrahimian et al 2019 under rainfed conditions sunflower sown in march april showed consistent productivity variation in the mediterranean region mainly related to rainfall occurring during the crop cycle de la vega and hall 2002 this risky trend could be further amplified by climate change projections ipcc 2014 forecasting higher day and night temperatures more variable rainfall distribution patterns higher atmospheric co2 and hydrological imbalances tariq et al 2018 from an agronomic perspective yield losses related to water deficiency and variability among years can be prevented through different management strategies such as winter planting drought escape seed priming or exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants drought tolerance iqbal et al 2005 singh et al 2015 and or irrigation provisioning debaeke and abroudrare 2004 given that the sowing date determines the amount of rainfall and temperature to which the crop will be exposed during its different growth stages zeleke and nendel 2019 some studies conducted in the mediterranean region identified an earlier sowing date as a win win solution to skip the drought phase flagella et al 2002 barros et al 2004 moreover this solution can make it possible to keep on cultivating a profitable crop for high quality oil production quiles et al 2002 and thus prevent further marginalization of drylands in most cases the hypotheses tested so far in the mediterranean region have been a conventional sowing date in late march april or even may vs an earlier sowing date in early march mid march flagella et al 2002 ferreira and abreu 2001 balalić et al 2012 in sardinia which belongs to the mediterranean region and where this experiment was carried out sunflower is generally sowed in march april the present study is structured in two parts i a field experiment testing the effects of different sowing dates rainfed or irrigated conditions on sunflower achene yield and ii a modeling study testing different irrigation strategies for different simulated sowing dates the 4 year field experiment was used to test sowing dates including winter sowing dates which are poorly investigated in the literature and their effects on crop productivity modeling was necessary to address i the interannual achene yield variability due to the treatments and climatic variability ii the yield gap between limited and unlimited water availability and iii the most effective climate adaptive irrigation strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 experimental site and design the field trial was conducted in sardinia italy at ottava 40 46

four years based on yearly rainfall and temperature patterns and the resulting field trafficability the benchmark date for all years was chosen to be 20th march 15th 25th march following the local practice and was defined as 00sd earlier sowing dates ranged from 17th dec to 23rd feb and were coded on the basis of the number of weeks ahead of 00 sd table 1 a later sowing date was tested in 2015

capitula of each plot with non woven fabric after pollination 2 1 2 field measurements and laboratory analyses the response of sunflower to the treatments was assessed based on a multidimensional measurement protocol the phenological phase was recorded throughout the growing season according to the bbch scale for sunflower lancashire et al 1991 ten randomly selected plants per plot were tagged

et al 2005 izaurralde et al 2012 was calibrated and applied using input parameters derived from the above mentioned field experiments epic was used to estimate the influence of temperature and rainfall on the ay and agb of rainfed and irrigated sunflower in relation to the different sowing dates the model inputs were set using local soil and weather data information about field management as described in section 2 1 1 including irrigation volumes and fertilizer amounts and crop related data such as plant density and the duration of the crop growing period the model was calibrated for sunflower achene yield and above ground biomass the model performance was evaluated by calculating complementary indicators the relative root mean square error rrmse bellocchi et al 2002 modeling

model simulations were performed over a 50 year interval using fixed sowing dates while the harvest operations were scheduled according to heat unit accumulation the crop was harvested at 100 of total heat units required for maturity the simulations were carried out using the static soil option to avoid variation of the soil properties likely to affect crop production during the period the soil characteristics were set after initialization and reset each year to remove trends related to soil dynamics and focus on the effects of climate factors interannual achene yield variability was simulated keeping the actual management conditions already described in section 2 1 1 to assess the effects of temperature and precipitation on crop yield 2 2 2 drawing scenarios for sustainable sunflower management a baseline climate scenario was built from the data simulated with cosmo clm rockel et al 2008 using the specific 8 km horizontal resolution configuration developed for italy by centro euro mediterraneo sui cambiamenti climatici cmcc bucchignani et al 2016 zollo et al 2016 forced from the global model echam 5 4 developed by cmcc scoccimarro et al 2011 the baseline climate scenario was referred to the years 1972 2005 using a co2 concentration of 380 ppm daily generated datasets were bias corrected with monthly correction factors calculated from precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and obtained by comparing the overlapping periods of the baseline climate scenario with those of the local weather station when available the model was run using four different sowing dates d1 10th january d2 10th february d3 10th march d4 10th april under rainfed conditions setting the nitrogen fertilization input to 70 kg n ha 1 conventional management and plant density to 7 7 plants m 2 to simulate achene yield ys and the length of the growing season lgs the crop harvest date was set at maturity the simulations were used to estimate interannual achene production variability under water and nutritional conditions simulated by epic using the above mentioned crop management conditions the water limited achene yield yw was calculated as the benchmark for rainfed sunflower by removing nutritional stress the potential achene yield yp was obtained removing both water and nutritional stress the achene yield gap ygap was calculated between yw and the simulated yield ys by removing water stress for each sowing date van ittersum et al 2013 the yield gaps were also expressed as ygap 1 ys yw 100 epic was also used to identify sustainable water application strategies that might fill the yield gap between yp and yw watering strategy a wsa consisted in supplying 50 mm of water 20 days before anthesis which is the most water sensitive period for the crop according to the literature rawson and turner 1983 iqbal et al 2005 epic simulated the irrigation event 20 days before anthesis using the accumulated gdd from sowing to the 20 days before anthesis observed over the four years of the field experiment watering strategy b wsb was defined by setting one irrigation event per week starting 20 days before anthesis until the end of flowering epic simulated irrigation was aimed at compensating for water stress which was strictly a function of actual evapotranspiration divided by potential evapotranspiration 2 2 3 statistical analyses the simulated achene yields obtained under each treatment sowing date x water scenario were analyzed using a full factorial design r studio and the significance of the differences between treatments was evaluated using tukey s test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and sunflower development over the 4 years of the experiment the mean crop cycle length from sowing to harvest standard

under irrigated conditions fig 2 fig 3 3 5 scenarios for sustainable sunflower management 3 5 1 epic simulation of the effects of the sowing date and water supply on sunflower yield under the baseline scenario the comparison of the four different simulated sowing dates d1 d2 d3 d4 made it evident that the crop cycle was shortened as sowing dates were delayed table 3 while the simulated achene yield ys increased the sowing date had similar effects on the water limited yield yw obtained by removing nitrogen stress following the same path as ys while the potential yield yp gradually decreased from d1 to d4 table 4 although the calculated water supply ranged between 250 and 275 mm for the 4 dates the yield gap for the earliest sowing dates d1 and d2 was much higher than for the latest sowing dates d3 and d4 table 4 fig 4 zooms in on the trends of simulated above ground biomass agbs accumulation throughout the growing season of sunflower sowed at different dates under rainfed conditions it points out d3 as the most promising sowing date in terms of achene yield the highest agbs accumulation was observed in june regardless of the sowing date fig 4 the simulated distribution of achene yield ys for the four hypothesized sowing dates under rainfed conditions highlighted greater stability 2000 kg ha 1 for d3 fig 5 based on the irrigation scenarios the hypothesis of a single irrigation of 50 mm applied 20 days before anthesis water scenario a wsa did not contribute to significantly increase achene yield compared to yw whatever the sowing date moreover this single irrigation event determined a flattening of ywsa at about 2050 kg ha 1 regardless of the sowing date table 5 ywsb for the earliest sowing dates d1 and d2 almost reached yp and saved about 100 mm compared to the water needed to achieve yp fig 6 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 field experiment the field experiment results confirmed that achene production by sunflower was heavily constrained by soil water availability under rainfed conditions and a semi arid mediterranean climate indeed the achene yield under irrigation was more than double than under rainfed conditions göksoy et al 2004 perniola et al 2006 many studies conducted on sunflower in the mediterranean region under rainfed conditions have identified an early sowing date as a good strategy to escape drought stress and preserve crop productivity ferreira and abreu 2001 flagella et al 2002 barros et al 2004 in most of the cases reported in the literature early sowing consisted in shifting from mid april or may to mid march ferreira and abreu 2001 flagella et al 2002 demir et al 2019 in our experiment the early sowing dates ranged from december to mid march while the benchmark sowing dates were centered on 20th march 1 week which was already early compared to the mid april conventional sowing dates mentioned by other authors for similar climatic regions ferreira and abreu 2001 flagella et al 2002 killi and altunbay 2005 perniola et al 2006 demir 2019 the differences in ay observed between 00 sd and sd02 in 2015 were mainly due to bird predation which halved plant density for sd02 linz et al 2011 the resulting ay was partially compensated for by the plasticity of sunflower whose aw and nac increased in the low density stands barros et al 2004 the observed achene yields except in 2018 when spring was exceptionally wet showed that sowing earlier than late february or mid march brought no substantial advantage in agreement with perniola et al 2006 this pattern was related to too low accumulation of cgdd a from sowing to anthesis and cgdd h from sowing to harvest including the seed filling phase for the earliest sowing dates many studies have highlighted the relevance of heat unit accumulation on aw during the seed filling phase between the end of anthesis and physiological maturity to prevent ay losses aguirrezábal et al 2003 qadir et al 2007 moreover ay is heavily influenced by water stress occurring during the achene filling phase and the observed ay reduction is not due to the number of achenes but to achene weight keipp et al 2020 in 2016 this pattern was clearly evident for i1 07 sd in this case irrigation started when sunflower was in the stem elongation stage bbch 31 and thus both the flowering and achene filling phases benefited from water availability a similar pattern was observed for 00 sd conversely for i1 13 sd irrigation was supplied during the flowering stage bbch 51 and it was prolonged only during the milking phase so that it was not efficient göksoy et al 2004 browne 1977 confirmed this by reporting that the greatest damage was generated when water stress occurred in the 20 days prior to flowering rawson and turner 1983 identified the two to three weeks before flowering as the optimal period for starting irrigation while negative effects of irrigation became apparent at anthesis this confirms our results moreover joshi et al 2017 identified the best watering strategy for confection sunflower to be irrigation until 50 of the disc flowers had completed flowering based on the results obtained in 2016 when more early sowing dates were tested and covered a very large sowing window it was possible to better understand the effects of the sowing dates on nac the reduced nac for the early sowing dates may have been due to reduced visits by insect pollinators because of earlier anthesis counterbalanced by the greater 1 000 achene weight compared to the later sowing dates under rainfed conditions this inverse trend between achene number and 1 000 achene weight was previously reported by de la vega and hall 2002 and related to the genotype similarly to the pattern observed for ay water use efficiency for the achene yield wuea was significantly higher for 00 sd than for the earlier sowing dates although no significant effect of the sowing date was recorded except in 2017 in our case the conventional sowing date was earlier than in other studies consequently the irrigation volumes needed under irrigated conditions were reduced and soil water availability under rainfed conditions followed an increment as the crop benefited from early spring rainfall when temperatures were mild enough this suggests mid march early april as a potential win win solution in terms of maximizing the achene yield potential and water use efficiency conversely for the earlier sowing dates sunflower failed to efficiently exploit rainfall because it occurred when the plants were in the initial developmental stages and average temperatures were still too low for achene setting this can be explained by insufficient pollination and or sub optimal weather conditions during flowering such as low radiation and too much wind scaven and raffenty 2013 4 2 epic simulation 4 2 1 model calibration the epic model successfully simulated sunflower achene and biomass production the accuracy of epic in simulating the sunflower growth dynamics was in line with studies on oilseed rape deligios et al 2013 and sunflower kiniry et al 1992 farina et al 2011 under similar agro climatic conditions nevertheless the model underestimated agb under irrigation while providing a reasonable average agb over the four years as already observed with the same model for other crop performances le et al 2018 4 2 2 sunflower productivity under a baseline scenario depending on the sowing date and water supply the baseline climate scenario confirmed that mid march early april d3 d4 were the most effective sowing times in terms of achene production compared to the earlier ones d1 d2 under semi arid mediterranean climate conditions as already discussed in section 4 2 1 these results are consistent with those reported by other studies showing advantages of early sowing dates in terms of achene yield vs end of april may d andria et al 1995 ferreira and abreu 2001 within the baseline scenario supplementary irrigation showed an interesting perspective especially under irrigation scenario b which proved to be a viable option for sunflower cultivation in the mediterranean area compared to the water needed to support the potential yield 265 mm on average water scenario b with 150 mm distributed in between 20 days before anthesis and flowering ensured an achene yield comparable to the yield potential under d3 and d4 under the same irrigation scenario the earliest dates d1 d2 led to even higher achene yield than d3 and d4 did the practical implication of the simulation made it evident that sowing in march d3 could be a promising solution to escape drought and keep high achene production under rainfed conditions conversely because early sowing occurs in winter crops are exposed to low radiation levels ferreira et al 2001 if low radiation is combined with water stress due to the absence of water this can have detrimental effects on yield nevertheless early sowing dates even in winter d1 d2 could represent a viable option for sunflower cultivation in the mediterranean region where only little water is available the apparent contradiction between the results of the field experiment and of the simulation as regards the convenience of early sowing under water availability must be interpreted considering the timing of irrigation while the irrigation strategy followed the calendar in the field experiment starting from mid april and neglecting plant phenology it was properly set to avoid plant stress in the simulation study and was successful even when little supplementary irrigation was used 5 conclusion the first outcome of the present study is that shifting sunflower sowing from april may to mid march early april could be the most appropriate cultivation strategy under rainfed mediterranean conditions the second outcome from the modeling study is that supplying water starting 20 days before anthesis up to flowering can bridge the gap between water limited achene yield and potential yield especially for the earliest sowing dates d1 d2 the practical implication of this study is that early sowing dates could be a viable strategy in the mediterranean area if supplementary irrigation is available 160 mm otherwise keeping the sowing date around mid march is the most promising strategy for high and stable achene production declaration of competing interest the authors

9778,subsidising irrigation is a legitimate approach that governments have used to achieve a set of social objectives yet it may simultaneously impose negative externalities especially in the form of environment degradation could subsidies be reformed to be less harmful to answer this question requires an insight into how various kinds of subsidies work the interplay between subsidies and externalities and the political complexity of subsidy reform in this paper these insights are investigated using supply demand graphs it is argued in this paper that a broad definition of subsidies should be used one that includes the implicit subsidies that result from partial cost recovery it is also shown that even without subsidies externalities due to irrigation would still exist and that any reform of existing subsidies will counter the positive impact irrigation may have which may not be a desirable outcome keywords externalities market failure reform social objectives subsidies 1 introduction irrigated agriculture by far the largest consumptive user of water globally is a heavily subsidized sector the establishment operation and maintenance of many irrigation schemes have by and large been subsidized by governments development banks and donor agencies in addition governments subsidise the agricultural sector in general increasing the price of the goods produced from irrigation water and or reducing the costs of the inputs all these actions by governments are either direct subsidies to irrigation or general interventions that happen to affect irrigation there is no universally accepted definition of a subsidy the oecd 2005 p 16 defines subsidies as a result of a government action that confers an advantage on consumers or producers it includes on budget subsidies which appear on the national accounts as government expenditures such as direct cash transfers low interest or reduced rate loans it also includes off budget subsidies which comprise indirect subsidies such as tax exemptions and rebates preferential market access limited liabilities and accelerated depreciation allowances the above definition could be broadened to also include a lack of full cost pricing 1 1 taking a historical accounting approach would lead to the value of the original subsidy on infrastructure being included in an assessment of the impacts however if a reasonable discount factor is applied then the value would be minimal thus it is more practical to take a full current account costing approach one where only the current costs and benefits arising from a subsidy are assessed this is the approach used by analysts who reduce subsidy reform to a pricing exercise where prices should be equated to covering operations and maintenance and possibly future refurbishment thus care should be exercised in determining whether the subsidies is placed capital o m and on other inputs and outputs the imposition of subsidies is seen as a beneficial act by some people like the cheaper food that can result irrigators invest on the basis of the existing subsidies needing to profit from their investment those who provide the inputs to the irrigation sector and services that are derived from it get to sell more from a subsidised industry than one that is not however subsidies can also add to and encourage the environmental destruction associated large scale irrigation many of these beneficial and negative impacts are externalities those that are not accounted for in the market system the role of subsidies and their impacts on both positive and negative externalities needs to be explored externalities which are uncompensated spill overs and impact that result in a market are typically not discussed with subsidies because they are difficult to measure due to the assumptions uncertainties and the significant economic modelling required to measure them honkatukia 2002 coady et al 2019 the definition of subsidies also needs to include consideration of non action in some cases non action e g not applying pricing to cover costs of water not internalizing externalities can also lead to prices not reflecting environmental and social costs and hence create implicit subsidies market failures arise in the water sector due to the existence of externalities and the open access nature of water which leads to the tragedy of the commons see coase 1960 in taking a welfare economics approach to subsidies i e where the market for water is assessed using the techniques of supply and demand to assess the changes in economic surplus etc would require that some form of market failure be identified before policies like subsidies are directed towards the sector using this approach government intervention is justified if the market is failing where market prices do not reflect the true costs of production and consumption however policies should not be deployed unless the benefits of intervening outweigh the costs quiggin 2019 subsidies in the water sector can be justified on the grounds of meeting societal objectives or coordinating and overcoming failures to invest in high fixed costs the flow on effects to the rest of the economy food security employment preserving foreign exchange poverty reduction etc that result from irrigation are also a form of market failure if they are not accounted for in the market process they are a positive externality the problem is that irrigation developments produce both positive and negative externalities simultaneously one way of resolving this balancing act is to impose quotas on irrigators so that the water taken does not exceed the sustainable limits needed to maintain a river s environmental condition thus minimising the negative externalities an alternative is to impose a tax on irrigators for the environmental damage they do either act i e imposing taxes or quotas will in effect do the exact opposite of what a subsidy is intended to do which is to account for the positive externalities associated with irrigation activity that leads to better social outcomes similarly subsidising production as a means of correcting for the uncompensated social benefits when negative externalities are evident exacerbates the problems of environmental damage another issue associated with the definition of subsidies occurs because of the way water is used the demand for water is derived in part from the demand for the products it is used to produce as water is an input taking this argument a little further the derived demand for water is also affected by its substitute and complementary products fertilizer electricity etc what this means is that it is possible to subsidise irrigation by subsidising the products produced from water and or by the inputs used in conjunction with water in practice what defines a subsidy is what one chooses as the baseline or counterfactual whether that is the market price cost or the social cost i e which includes the externality while a broad definition of subsidies including both full cost pricing for resources and the internalization of externalities is operationally difficult to measure it is important to recognize that implicit subsidies also exist and that they can be quite significant mostly the environment of the catchments in which water is regulated can suffer negative externalities as subsidies to irrigation often result in greater diversions of water to agriculture yet governments continue to subsidise water in order to gain a set of social objectives and benefits these social objectives and benefits can reflect positive externalities in the water market and are a legitimate reason why governments may pay subsidies for irrigation the interplay between subsidies and the range of externalities that exist in the irrigation sector needs to be appreciated when evaluating their impacts thus it is necessary to assess the precise impacts individual subsidies have first by way of an audit and then eventually through a comprehensive assessment of subsidies the impact subsidies for irrigation have on a catchment needs to be known if they are ever to be reformed or abolished even if this is not the objective just knowing the full impact a subsidy has is informative for future policy direction while the physical measurement of an externality may well exist a far greater problem lies in placing an economic value on them thus a dilemma that policy makers in the water sector need to resolve when thinking about removing subsidies is whether the benefits gained from reducing negative externalities is worth the losses that accrue when accounting for the positive externalities it could therefore be asked whether and how subsidies could be reformed to be less harmful further it must be asked if it is even possible to reform current subsidy regimes in this paper the difficulties in reforming subsidies in irrigation and the success factors that may provide lessons learnt for policy reform in other countries are highlighted to be able to address these questions some insight is required into the various kinds of irrigation subsidies that exist and how they work this is undertaken when the subsidies are classified in section 2 and with the supply demand diagrams in the annex the interplay between irrigation subsidies and externalities section 3 and the political complexity of subsidy reform section 5 are also presented the aim of this paper is to identify classify and expose the wide ranging nature of irrigation subsidies in such a way that policy makers become aware of the full costs and benefits of them the likely impacts irrigation subsidies may have on the environment and socially are discussed finally some examples of countries who have attempted to reform their subsidies are presented highlighting difficulties that they have experienced 2 classifying subsidies subsidies to any sector come in a variety of ways a distinction will be made between subsidies that affect irrigation and agriculture several which are not at first obvious through shifting any of the supply schedules in a market associated with the good in question the way various kinds of subsidies work their impact on the input and the output market is explained in annex a using basic supply and demand schedule diagrams fig a1 shows that implementing a subsidy for the good can be done per unit supply of the good as an ad valorem subsidy and a subsidy can be paid as a lump sum fig a2 shows that implementing a subsidy on the input reduces the production costs of the output fig a3 shows that a subsidy to an output will also have an impact on the input market whether subsidies will affect in practice the market clearing price of water depend on whether there is a water market in place water is rarely marketed and hence a market clearing price rarely exists hence the price is often below the market price which is a subsidy at this juncture there is a need to ascertain the role of prices as they exist in the economic concepts associated with a free market and as they do not appear to exist in the not so free water market to an economist a price exists where supply and demand interact to clear a market this could be called the free market price as it is the price at which the market is at its most efficient distributing resources in its most efficient manner it could be thought of as some theoretical and unrealistic nicety but in reality it important as it is the reference point upon which the actual prices and the existing market outcomes can be compared once prices are fixed or not paid or a subsidy is imposed or an externality exists the price observed in the market will bear no resemblance to this market price while these two prices are different it does not mean that either of them is irrelevant rather the difference between the two it becomes most important as the difference reveals the discrepancy between the subsidised externality affected market that currently exists and what could exist in an efficient market to suggest that any theoretical efficient market price should be ignored in favour of a realistic observed and in some cases non existent price misses a very fundamental point and renders any assessment of the impacts of subsidies and externalities meaningless and incomparable an easy way of segregating subsidies is to isolate them by where they are imposed a benefit of this approach whether they are either ad valorem or lump sum is that at this level they are usually quite transparent using this approach the subsidies to the water sector can be classified as those that assist the 1 direct fixed costs of irrigation like the capital needed to build and drain the systems these subsidies tend to be of a lump sum type see qs2 in fig a1 examples of these are those that contribute to the building of infrastructure which will increase the supply of water and hence reduce the prices of produce 2 direct variable costs of irrigation like assistance with the cost of pumping they tend to be ad valorem subsidies see qs3 in fig a1 examples of these are the assistance governments provide irrigators by not collecting the full charges for operations and maintenance they cause the water supply schedule to fall 3 indirect variable costs of other inputs those subsidies on the inputs to the production process other than water like fertilizer and fuel these subsidies tend to shift the input supply for water schedule downward the impact of subsidising the input is in theory to reduce the price of the finished good provided the price of water is market determined and increasing its output see qsw1 in fig a2 4 direct outputs provided to raise the prices irrigators receive for the crops they produce shifting the output supply schedule outward to qsf1 in fig a3 and 5 indirect outputs other uses of water provided for dual purpose systems those that also produce electricity flood mitigation etc these subsidies are sometimes known as cross subsidies subsidies that encourage water savings that can be used in other sectors could be included herein as they are targeted to another legitimate user of water i e the environment classifying subsidies in this way allows for a more structured approach to the problem and can result in the tabulation of the aims irrigator behaviour responses to potential reforms social and environmental impacts etc of each subsidy grouping while most if not all subsidies result in a reduction in the price of water and a concomitant increase in the quantity used the impacts on participants in the irrigation sector are different in addition the fiscal cost and dead weight social losses that arise from subsidies will differ with the type imposed and depend largely but not exclusively on the own price elasticity of demand for water by definition the own price elasticity of demand for water is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in the price as irrigators use water to produce a range of products each product will have a different own price elasticity of demand whether the quantity demanded will respond to the price depends on whether the price of water is market determined and price elastic 3 socioeconomic and environmental externalities of irrigation looking beyond the impacts subsidies for irrigation may have on the sector there is a need to examine the wider relationships they may have with society as a whole and on the environment this is required because desirable impacts on society are the usual rationale for imposing subsidies in the first place while the negative social and environmental impacts have become the rationale for reforming subsidies 3 1 socioeconomic food self sufficiency is an important reason for countries to subsidizing irrigation however increasing food production is not the only reason for subsidizing irrigation countries have a variety of reasons for subsidizing irrigation other reasons may well include improving the economic and social well being of the rural population stabilising rural regions regional growth the need to gain political support etc however changing land use and water use patterns may also have negative impacts on the social and economic structure of the project area small plots communal land use rights and conflicting traditional and legal land rights all create difficulties when land is converted to irrigate agriculture land tenure ownership patterns can be disrupted by major rehabilitation works as well as when a new irrigation project is established similar problems arise as a result of changes to rights to water increased inequity in opportunity often results from changing land use and or water use patterns irrigation projects also tend to lead to changes to the demographic and ethnic composition either because of the increased production of the area or because they are part of a resettlement project equavoen and tesfai 2012 have argued that the introduction or formalizing of irrigation is likely to affect men and women ethnic groups and social classes unequally groups that use common land to make their living or fulfil their household duties may be disadvantaged if that same land is taken over for irrigated agriculture or for building irrigation infrastructure women migrants groups and poorer social classes have often lost access to resources and gained increased workloads conversely the increased income and improved nutrition from irrigated agriculture may benefit women and children in particular 3 2 environment a major environmental impact of irrigation is represented by the spatial and temporal changes that occur to the flows of water changes in the seasonality of the flows due to irrigation can have various impacts on the environment changing the flow of a river will not only affect the timing and the amount of water involved but also what is carried within that flow in particular the flow of sediment carried in a river is greatly affected if water courses are interrupted by dams and weirs diverted by levies and sluiced through canals the carriage of sediment is critical to the formation of rivers in the upper reaches of a river where the water flows quickly sediment is gouged from the banks carried through the middle stages and eventually deposited when it slows down towards the mouth hence changes in the flow will alter the geomorphology of the river and the vegetation in rivers and on its banks it can adversely affect the ecological system and hence native species that live along rivers it can lead to river closure and may cause seawater intrusion and the destruction of estuarine environments irrigation can lead to a built up of salts in the soil and drainage will be needed to flush out the salts in the soil drainage is often subsidized as well drainage can also help the environment as the salt drained away into a salt pan does not enter a river if irrigation only exists because it is subsidised then all the impacts that arise from irrigation on the environment can be attributed to the subsidy which is usually not the case 3 3 the interplay between subsidies and externalities the interplay between subsidies and externalities is best described in diagrammatic form see fig 1 if the observed supply schedule in a market is shown as qs1 then if externalities exist this schedule will not account for all the costs of supplying the good in the market if there is say an environmental cost to the supply of the good then the true costs of the good would be higher and the true supply curve would be qs4 in fig 1 the difference between the two supply curves qs1 and qs4 is the external cost of producing the good which is not accounted for in the market at equilibrium where qw of the good is traded at price pw the external cost is equivalent to t in fig 1 in such circumstances the market price of water pw is lower than the socially acceptable price pw4 and the quantity used in the market is also greater by the difference between qw and qw4 the impact on the economic surplus is to increase it from abd to ac0 an increase of dbc0 shared between producers and consumers the deadweight social loss from ignoring this negative externality is equal to the area bec all in fig 1 a positive supply induced externality works in the opposite direction the true social supply schedule the one that accounts for all the unaccounted for benefits of production is shown by qs5 in fig 1 while the market supply schedule is shown as qs1 the difference between qs1 and qs5 equal to tt in fig 1 is the uncompensated spill overs associated with producing the good with a positive externality the price in the market pw in fig 1 is higher than that which would exist in the market without the externality pw5 and the quantity traded is lower by the difference between qw5 and qw the amount of economic surplus foregone in this case is equal to 0cfqw4 in fig 1 and the deadweight social loss is equal to the area cgf there are two suggested solutions to the existence of an externality the first is to take a coaseian approach to the problem which in essence fixes the quantity of the good at the socially optimal level qw4 in the case of a negative externality or qw5 in the case of a positive externality participants in the market then bid for the set quantity supplied resulting in the appropriate price prevailing an alternative approach to the problem is to internalise the externality with a negative externality policy makers impose a tax on the good equal to the external cost t in fig 1 that level of tax places market participants on the higher supply schedule qs4 resulting in prices rising to pw4 and the quantity traded falling to qw4 in the case of a positive externality policy makers do the opposite impose a subsidy equal to tt in fig 1 that is equal to placing participants on the true social supply schedule qs5 with prices falling to pw5 and the quantities rising to qw5 the problem for policy makers in the water sector is that both positive and negative externalities exist together the policy solution to one a subsidy or a tax is directly contrary to the other so as subsidies are paid to account for the positive externalities the impacts of the negative externalities on pollution become worse alternatively reforming removing subsidies to the water sector may well exacerbate the under supply of positive externalities evident in the market 4 the political economy of irrigation subsidies reform many analysts have researched the irrigation subsidy reform process most literature focuses on the full cost recovery approach aiming for full recovery of the capital and o m costs while conveniently ignoring the subsidies for the environmental and the social costs of irrigation the oecd 2012 and fuentes 2011 both raise the concern that adverse environmental externalities have resulted from not recovering costs wichelns 2010 makes the link between the lack of full cost pricing being a subsidy whereas molle and berkoff 2007 p 21 suggest that charging for water use or disposal is not an end in itself but an instrument for achieving one or more policy objectives including water conservation enhancing economic activity and promoting environmental sustainability barraqué and montginoul 2015 discuss how to integrate social objectives into water pricing with social tariffs while their work centred on residential water use what they found applies equally to irrigation water reforming and removing subsidies from the irrigation sector is a difficult process due to strong opposition from pressure groups such as landowners farmers lobby organisations electricity and supply companies and fertiliser producers according to the oecd 2009 the main barrier to the reform of harmful subsidies has been the resistance by vested interests and the associated difficulty of gaining political support to push for changes subsidy reforms are often politically costly politicians are rarely willing to campaign to seek a popular mandate for a policy change for the common good especially when water consuming farmers have important electoral power alkon and urpelainen 2018 toan 2016 moreover the public has little interest in supporting the reforms because the cost of agricultural and water subsidies is very thinly spread among taxpayers and not always transparently communicated while the benefits of the subsidy are visible and concentrated in the hands of a small group who can more easily organise and lobby for the status quo oecd 2007 the three main policy options for subsidy reform that exist are the complete elimination of the subsidy the gradual reduction of the amount of subsidies or decoupling the subsidies from production dinar 2018 the removal of a subsidy is likely to be perceived as the withdrawal of an entitled benefit thereby generating great resistance which may require additional compensation and increased effort to ensure farmers buy in to the idea in specific cases transitory and time bound compensation may be necessary to assist with the structural change and overcome resistance but it needs to be carefully designed when used to ease the subsidy reform process lump sum decoupled payments enable farmers to retain the same welfare farmers are given a cash transfer of an equivalent amount of the subsidy while the new price provides an incentive to undertake changes in water consumption change in crop patterns reduction of irrigated area adoption of water saving technologies ávila et al 2005 however whether this will result in an improved environmental outcome is extremely dubious there is enough work undertaken on the jevons paradox and the rebound effects in irrigation to know that improvements in efficiency can lead to an increase in demand thus this approach to subsidy reform is one that should not be recommended as it may lead to adverse outcomes research and pilot studies can be used to assess realistic solutions that result in phasing out subsides that negatively impact on water resources and used to identify the optimal option elimination gradual removal or decoupling the subsidy and the adequate scale and the scope of the reform there are several ways to make subsidy reform less sensitive unbundling policies so that different objectives attract different policies for example by providing direct income support for farmer welfare instead of subsidising water may well facilitate change another way is by a gradual increase in water pricing and by buying back rights given to a sector may all work better than just eliminating subsidies 5 discussion on approaches to reform subsidies if the reform of subsidies is to be considered then a few themes can be followed first it is necessary to recognize that nations subsidize water for a variety of reasons and not necessarily for the sole benefit of irrigators second the imposition of subsidies and their removal is intrinsically linked to the issue of both positive and negative externalities their imposition while a possible attempt at redressing the uncompensated effects of societal needs also enhances the uncompensated impacts irrigation has on the environment knowing the value of these external effects and a subsidies contribution to them should play some role in their reform third subsidies for water come in many different formats it is not enough to account for just the subsidization of water prices those that cover o m costs that need to be considered but also the subsidization of the finished products complementary inputs complementary outputs establishment costs etc in other words auditing irrigation subsidies is an essential component needed if they are to be reformed that audit process would require a recognition of why subsidies were implemented in the first place it would require knowledge of the impact irrigation has in generating both the negative and positive externalities and the contribution subsides play in promoting these externalities finally any audit would need to account for the wide range of subsidies that have been used in the irrigation sector following this line of thinking leads one to suggest that subsidy reform and or removal is all about pricing reform in other words all that is required is to make sure the price of water paid by irrigators equates to the full costs of water provision as many have found out such reforms are extremely difficult to implement molle and berkoff 2007 davidson et al 2019 examples of the difficulties of reforming subsidies are the phasing out of the electricity subsidy for groundwater pumping in mexico foster et al 2018 initiatives in india to find reform solutions malik 2007 groundwater reforms in yemen hellegers et al 2008 and a water buyback scheme in the murray darling river basin in australia wheeler et al 2020 grafton and wheeler 2018 grafton et al 2020 despite their transparency the complex ways subsidies entwine themselves through a community means that any reform process will require some degree of compensation to be paid to those who lose rationing water while subsidising technology to increase productivity would seem to be promising in capturing the benefits of irrigation while avoiding the costs as it would cap the increased demand for water use that results from the increase in productivity embedded in the rebound effect however it is difficult to cap water use in places where the volumes are usually unknown and not well controlled the approach would require the ability to measure the volumes extracted including the runoff is something not many countries can do there is a reason why in many countries area based charges are applied instead of implementing the more efficient volume based charges and these reasons have little to do with a lack of desire to achieve more efficient outcomes and more to do with the actual control water managers have over the supply and distribution of water to small holders in theory it can be done and sometimes in case of groundwater extraction may well be ideal and undertaken 6 conclusions in this paper it was shown that subsidies to the irrigation sector were not only both beneficial and harmful but that they were also far reaching insidious and complex to reform they not only included the direct subsidies one usually accounts for but also the indirect subsidies that resulted from the non internalization of externalities or the lack of full cost pricing as well it is important to note that irrigation has caused externalities and that subsidies have made these externalities worse however even without subsidies such externalities would still exist further reforming subsidies by undertaking pricing reform will go against the positive impacts that are thought to result from irrigation in sum there is an argument that irrigation usually has environmental costs that are not internalised and subsidies typically usually always exacerbate that situation thus the tension between good outcomes more food and higher rural incomes and exacerbate the bad outcomes faster aquifer depletion drying estuaries environmental degradation are there subsidy regimes that can capture the benefits while avoiding the costs subsidies directed towards environmental protection some attempts such as rationing water to acceptable levels of consumption while subsidising technologies that maximise the productivity of the limited resource would seem to be the preferable approach but are difficult to implement the gains and losses from these types of reform are questions that can only be evaluated once the effects of the mix of subsidies and externalities which are detailed in this paper are understood they should be the subject of further research further research is also needed on the political process that will lead to successful subsidy reform ultimately the decision to pay subsidies is one taken by governments in order to obtain some desirable objectives these objectives can change over time and when combined with the limited size of public budgets and negative externalities can lead governments to ultimately question the wisdom of why they subsidised irrigation in the first place decisions to reform subsidies are of course political in nature and reform processes are not the preserve of those who analyse and advise on such matters nevertheless policy makers need to have a system of classifying and objectifying subsidies in a meaningful manner declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper annex a with a normal consumer good which water is not the impacts of a subsidy can simply be shown in a basic supply and demand schedule diagram see fig a1 the unsubsidised market for water is shown by the supply and demand schedules qs1 and qd respectively in this unsubsidised market the ruling price and quantities that constitute an equilibrium pw and qw respectively yield the revenue from the market equivalent to the area pwbqw0 the value of water shown by the area abd in fig 1 can be segregated into the consumers surplus abpw and producers surplus bdpw the costs of provision are equivalent to the area bqw0d the area under the supply schedule between the origin and the quantity traded in the market qw implementing a subsidy for the good equivalent in size to s in fig a1 can be done in one of two ways first it could be a subsidy paid on the per unit supply of the good which can be referred to as an ad valorem subsidy in this case the supply schedule would rotate down to become qs3 so at qw1 the level of subsidy is equal to s but would be lower if less water were involved or greater if more water were involved an example would be the subsidisation of variable operation and maintenance costs alternatively subsidies can be paid as a lump sum in such cases the whole supply schedule would shift down parallel to the original supply schedule to qs2 in fig a1 so regardless of the quantity of water involved the subsidy remains the same in this case the total subsidy paid is s in fig a1 an example would be governments paying for infrastructure or underwriting the cost of financing the development while for the purpose of presentation both an ad valorem and lump sum subsidies shown in fig a1 have the same impacts on the prices and the quantities of the good at equilibrium reducing prices from pw to pw1 and raising the quantity consumed and produced from qw and qw1 the impacts on value are very different with an ad valorem subsidy consumer surplus increase by pwbcpw1 in fig a1 while producers surplus changes from bdpw to pw1cd the revenue changes from pwbqw0 to pw1cqw1 with a lump sum subsidy the changes in revenue prices quantities and the consumer surplus are like that of an ad valorem subsidy in fig 1 because of the way it is drawn yet the impact on the producer surplus value changes from bdpw to pw1c0 the impact of subsidies on the input and the output market given the relationship between the demand for the crop and the input any attempt to subsidise the input is going to have an impact on the demand for the output see fig a2 again simplifying the subsidy to a lump sum type although an ad valorem type will have similar broad impacts the supply schedule for the input shifts away from the origin resulting in more of the input being used out to qw1 the price of the input falls from pw to pw1 the impacts on the consumer producer and economic surplus and the deadweight social losses are as described above in fig a1 the subsidy paid on the input also reduces the production costs of the output effectively the supply schedule for the output would also move to the right in line with the fall in the input supply schedule and be parallel to qsf running through the coordinate point pf1qw1 qsf1 in fig a2 the impact of subsidising the input is to reduce the price of the finished good and increasing its output the concomitant impacts of the consumer producer and economic surplus can also be traced along with the deadweight social loss just as an input subsidy can affect the market for the finished good a subsidy to an output will also have an impact on the input market see fig a3 the subsidy shifts the finished good supply schedule to the right reducing prices of both the good itself and the inputs from pf to pf1 and from pw to pw1 respectively the quantity of the output and the input also rise altogether the surplus values change in accordance with those observed above the essence of this finding is that not only do the subsidies that directly relate to the irrigation sector needed to be assessed but also those for the all the finished goods water is used in 
9778,subsidising irrigation is a legitimate approach that governments have used to achieve a set of social objectives yet it may simultaneously impose negative externalities especially in the form of environment degradation could subsidies be reformed to be less harmful to answer this question requires an insight into how various kinds of subsidies work the interplay between subsidies and externalities and the political complexity of subsidy reform in this paper these insights are investigated using supply demand graphs it is argued in this paper that a broad definition of subsidies should be used one that includes the implicit subsidies that result from partial cost recovery it is also shown that even without subsidies externalities due to irrigation would still exist and that any reform of existing subsidies will counter the positive impact irrigation may have which may not be a desirable outcome keywords externalities market failure reform social objectives subsidies 1 introduction irrigated agriculture by far the largest consumptive user of water globally is a heavily subsidized sector the establishment operation and maintenance of many irrigation schemes have by and large been subsidized by governments development banks and donor agencies in addition governments subsidise the agricultural sector in general increasing the price of the goods produced from irrigation water and or reducing the costs of the inputs all these actions by governments are either direct subsidies to irrigation or general interventions that happen to affect irrigation there is no universally accepted definition of a subsidy the oecd 2005 p 16 defines subsidies as a result of a government action that confers an advantage on consumers or producers it includes on budget subsidies which appear on the national accounts as government expenditures such as direct cash transfers low interest or reduced rate loans it also includes off budget subsidies which comprise indirect subsidies such as tax exemptions and rebates preferential market access limited liabilities and accelerated depreciation allowances the above definition could be broadened to also include a lack of full cost pricing 1 1 taking a historical accounting approach would lead to the value of the original subsidy on infrastructure being included in an assessment of the impacts however if a reasonable discount factor is applied then the value would be minimal thus it is more practical to take a full current account costing approach one where only the current costs and benefits arising from a subsidy are assessed this is the approach used by analysts who reduce subsidy reform to a pricing exercise where prices should be equated to covering operations and maintenance and possibly future refurbishment thus care should be exercised in determining whether the subsidies is placed capital o m and on other inputs and outputs the imposition of subsidies is seen as a beneficial act by some people like the cheaper food that can result irrigators invest on the basis of the existing subsidies needing to profit from their investment those who provide the inputs to the irrigation sector and services that are derived from it get to sell more from a subsidised industry than one that is not however subsidies can also add to and encourage the environmental destruction associated large scale irrigation many of these beneficial and negative impacts are externalities those that are not accounted for in the market system the role of subsidies and their impacts on both positive and negative externalities needs to be explored externalities which are uncompensated spill overs and impact that result in a market are typically not discussed with subsidies because they are difficult to measure due to the assumptions uncertainties and the significant economic modelling required to measure them honkatukia 2002 coady et al 2019 the definition of subsidies also needs to include consideration of non action in some cases non action e g not applying pricing to cover costs of water not internalizing externalities can also lead to prices not reflecting environmental and social costs and hence create implicit subsidies market failures arise in the water sector due to the existence of externalities and the open access nature of water which leads to the tragedy of the commons see coase 1960 in taking a welfare economics approach to subsidies i e where the market for water is assessed using the techniques of supply and demand to assess the changes in economic surplus etc would require that some form of market failure be identified before policies like subsidies are directed towards the sector using this approach government intervention is justified if the market is failing where market prices do not reflect the true costs of production and consumption however policies should not be deployed unless the benefits of intervening outweigh the costs quiggin 2019 subsidies in the water sector can be justified on the grounds of meeting societal objectives or coordinating and overcoming failures to invest in high fixed costs the flow on effects to the rest of the economy food security employment preserving foreign exchange poverty reduction etc that result from irrigation are also a form of market failure if they are not accounted for in the market process they are a positive externality the problem is that irrigation developments produce both positive and negative externalities simultaneously one way of resolving this balancing act is to impose quotas on irrigators so that the water taken does not exceed the sustainable limits needed to maintain a river s environmental condition thus minimising the negative externalities an alternative is to impose a tax on irrigators for the environmental damage they do either act i e imposing taxes or quotas will in effect do the exact opposite of what a subsidy is intended to do which is to account for the positive externalities associated with irrigation activity that leads to better social outcomes similarly subsidising production as a means of correcting for the uncompensated social benefits when negative externalities are evident exacerbates the problems of environmental damage another issue associated with the definition of subsidies occurs because of the way water is used the demand for water is derived in part from the demand for the products it is used to produce as water is an input taking this argument a little further the derived demand for water is also affected by its substitute and complementary products fertilizer electricity etc what this means is that it is possible to subsidise irrigation by subsidising the products produced from water and or by the inputs used in conjunction with water in practice what defines a subsidy is what one chooses as the baseline or counterfactual whether that is the market price cost or the social cost i e which includes the externality while a broad definition of subsidies including both full cost pricing for resources and the internalization of externalities is operationally difficult to measure it is important to recognize that implicit subsidies also exist and that they can be quite significant mostly the environment of the catchments in which water is regulated can suffer negative externalities as subsidies to irrigation often result in greater diversions of water to agriculture yet governments continue to subsidise water in order to gain a set of social objectives and benefits these social objectives and benefits can reflect positive externalities in the water market and are a legitimate reason why governments may pay subsidies for irrigation the interplay between subsidies and the range of externalities that exist in the irrigation sector needs to be appreciated when evaluating their impacts thus it is necessary to assess the precise impacts individual subsidies have first by way of an audit and then eventually through a comprehensive assessment of subsidies the impact subsidies for irrigation have on a catchment needs to be known if they are ever to be reformed or abolished even if this is not the objective just knowing the full impact a subsidy has is informative for future policy direction while the physical measurement of an externality may well exist a far greater problem lies in placing an economic value on them thus a dilemma that policy makers in the water sector need to resolve when thinking about removing subsidies is whether the benefits gained from reducing negative externalities is worth the losses that accrue when accounting for the positive externalities it could therefore be asked whether and how subsidies could be reformed to be less harmful further it must be asked if it is even possible to reform current subsidy regimes in this paper the difficulties in reforming subsidies in irrigation and the success factors that may provide lessons learnt for policy reform in other countries are highlighted to be able to address these questions some insight is required into the various kinds of irrigation subsidies that exist and how they work this is undertaken when the subsidies are classified in section 2 and with the supply demand diagrams in the annex the interplay between irrigation subsidies and externalities section 3 and the political complexity of subsidy reform section 5 are also presented the aim of this paper is to identify classify and expose the wide ranging nature of irrigation subsidies in such a way that policy makers become aware of the full costs and benefits of them the likely impacts irrigation subsidies may have on the environment and socially are discussed finally some examples of countries who have attempted to reform their subsidies are presented highlighting difficulties that they have experienced 2 classifying subsidies subsidies to any sector come in a variety of ways a distinction will be made between subsidies that affect irrigation and agriculture several which are not at first obvious through shifting any of the supply schedules in a market associated with the good in question the way various kinds of subsidies work their impact on the input and the output market is explained in annex a using basic supply and demand schedule diagrams fig a1 shows that implementing a subsidy for the good can be done per unit supply of the good as an ad valorem subsidy and a subsidy can be paid as a lump sum fig a2 shows that implementing a subsidy on the input reduces the production costs of the output fig a3 shows that a subsidy to an output will also have an impact on the input market whether subsidies will affect in practice the market clearing price of water depend on whether there is a water market in place water is rarely marketed and hence a market clearing price rarely exists hence the price is often below the market price which is a subsidy at this juncture there is a need to ascertain the role of prices as they exist in the economic concepts associated with a free market and as they do not appear to exist in the not so free water market to an economist a price exists where supply and demand interact to clear a market this could be called the free market price as it is the price at which the market is at its most efficient distributing resources in its most efficient manner it could be thought of as some theoretical and unrealistic nicety but in reality it important as it is the reference point upon which the actual prices and the existing market outcomes can be compared once prices are fixed or not paid or a subsidy is imposed or an externality exists the price observed in the market will bear no resemblance to this market price while these two prices are different it does not mean that either of them is irrelevant rather the difference between the two it becomes most important as the difference reveals the discrepancy between the subsidised externality affected market that currently exists and what could exist in an efficient market to suggest that any theoretical efficient market price should be ignored in favour of a realistic observed and in some cases non existent price misses a very fundamental point and renders any assessment of the impacts of subsidies and externalities meaningless and incomparable an easy way of segregating subsidies is to isolate them by where they are imposed a benefit of this approach whether they are either ad valorem or lump sum is that at this level they are usually quite transparent using this approach the subsidies to the water sector can be classified as those that assist the 1 direct fixed costs of irrigation like the capital needed to build and drain the systems these subsidies tend to be of a lump sum type see qs2 in fig a1 examples of these are those that contribute to the building of infrastructure which will increase the supply of water and hence reduce the prices of produce 2 direct variable costs of irrigation like assistance with the cost of pumping they tend to be ad valorem subsidies see qs3 in fig a1 examples of these are the assistance governments provide irrigators by not collecting the full charges for operations and maintenance they cause the water supply schedule to fall 3 indirect variable costs of other inputs those subsidies on the inputs to the production process other than water like fertilizer and fuel these subsidies tend to shift the input supply for water schedule downward the impact of subsidising the input is in theory to reduce the price of the finished good provided the price of water is market determined and increasing its output see qsw1 in fig a2 4 direct outputs provided to raise the prices irrigators receive for the crops they produce shifting the output supply schedule outward to qsf1 in fig a3 and 5 indirect outputs other uses of water provided for dual purpose systems those that also produce electricity flood mitigation etc these subsidies are sometimes known as cross subsidies subsidies that encourage water savings that can be used in other sectors could be included herein as they are targeted to another legitimate user of water i e the environment classifying subsidies in this way allows for a more structured approach to the problem and can result in the tabulation of the aims irrigator behaviour responses to potential reforms social and environmental impacts etc of each subsidy grouping while most if not all subsidies result in a reduction in the price of water and a concomitant increase in the quantity used the impacts on participants in the irrigation sector are different in addition the fiscal cost and dead weight social losses that arise from subsidies will differ with the type imposed and depend largely but not exclusively on the own price elasticity of demand for water by definition the own price elasticity of demand for water is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in the price as irrigators use water to produce a range of products each product will have a different own price elasticity of demand whether the quantity demanded will respond to the price depends on whether the price of water is market determined and price elastic 3 socioeconomic and environmental externalities of irrigation looking beyond the impacts subsidies for irrigation may have on the sector there is a need to examine the wider relationships they may have with society as a whole and on the environment this is required because desirable impacts on society are the usual rationale for imposing subsidies in the first place while the negative social and environmental impacts have become the rationale for reforming subsidies 3 1 socioeconomic food self sufficiency is an important reason for countries to subsidizing irrigation however increasing food production is not the only reason for subsidizing irrigation countries have a variety of reasons for subsidizing irrigation other reasons may well include improving the economic and social well being of the rural population stabilising rural regions regional growth the need to gain political support etc however changing land use and water use patterns may also have negative impacts on the social and economic structure of the project area small plots communal land use rights and conflicting traditional and legal land rights all create difficulties when land is converted to irrigate agriculture land tenure ownership patterns can be disrupted by major rehabilitation works as well as when a new irrigation project is established similar problems arise as a result of changes to rights to water increased inequity in opportunity often results from changing land use and or water use patterns irrigation projects also tend to lead to changes to the demographic and ethnic composition either because of the increased production of the area or because they are part of a resettlement project equavoen and tesfai 2012 have argued that the introduction or formalizing of irrigation is likely to affect men and women ethnic groups and social classes unequally groups that use common land to make their living or fulfil their household duties may be disadvantaged if that same land is taken over for irrigated agriculture or for building irrigation infrastructure women migrants groups and poorer social classes have often lost access to resources and gained increased workloads conversely the increased income and improved nutrition from irrigated agriculture may benefit women and children in particular 3 2 environment a major environmental impact of irrigation is represented by the spatial and temporal changes that occur to the flows of water changes in the seasonality of the flows due to irrigation can have various impacts on the environment changing the flow of a river will not only affect the timing and the amount of water involved but also what is carried within that flow in particular the flow of sediment carried in a river is greatly affected if water courses are interrupted by dams and weirs diverted by levies and sluiced through canals the carriage of sediment is critical to the formation of rivers in the upper reaches of a river where the water flows quickly sediment is gouged from the banks carried through the middle stages and eventually deposited when it slows down towards the mouth hence changes in the flow will alter the geomorphology of the river and the vegetation in rivers and on its banks it can adversely affect the ecological system and hence native species that live along rivers it can lead to river closure and may cause seawater intrusion and the destruction of estuarine environments irrigation can lead to a built up of salts in the soil and drainage will be needed to flush out the salts in the soil drainage is often subsidized as well drainage can also help the environment as the salt drained away into a salt pan does not enter a river if irrigation only exists because it is subsidised then all the impacts that arise from irrigation on the environment can be attributed to the subsidy which is usually not the case 3 3 the interplay between subsidies and externalities the interplay between subsidies and externalities is best described in diagrammatic form see fig 1 if the observed supply schedule in a market is shown as qs1 then if externalities exist this schedule will not account for all the costs of supplying the good in the market if there is say an environmental cost to the supply of the good then the true costs of the good would be higher and the true supply curve would be qs4 in fig 1 the difference between the two supply curves qs1 and qs4 is the external cost of producing the good which is not accounted for in the market at equilibrium where qw of the good is traded at price pw the external cost is equivalent to t in fig 1 in such circumstances the market price of water pw is lower than the socially acceptable price pw4 and the quantity used in the market is also greater by the difference between qw and qw4 the impact on the economic surplus is to increase it from abd to ac0 an increase of dbc0 shared between producers and consumers the deadweight social loss from ignoring this negative externality is equal to the area bec all in fig 1 a positive supply induced externality works in the opposite direction the true social supply schedule the one that accounts for all the unaccounted for benefits of production is shown by qs5 in fig 1 while the market supply schedule is shown as qs1 the difference between qs1 and qs5 equal to tt in fig 1 is the uncompensated spill overs associated with producing the good with a positive externality the price in the market pw in fig 1 is higher than that which would exist in the market without the externality pw5 and the quantity traded is lower by the difference between qw5 and qw the amount of economic surplus foregone in this case is equal to 0cfqw4 in fig 1 and the deadweight social loss is equal to the area cgf there are two suggested solutions to the existence of an externality the first is to take a coaseian approach to the problem which in essence fixes the quantity of the good at the socially optimal level qw4 in the case of a negative externality or qw5 in the case of a positive externality participants in the market then bid for the set quantity supplied resulting in the appropriate price prevailing an alternative approach to the problem is to internalise the externality with a negative externality policy makers impose a tax on the good equal to the external cost t in fig 1 that level of tax places market participants on the higher supply schedule qs4 resulting in prices rising to pw4 and the quantity traded falling to qw4 in the case of a positive externality policy makers do the opposite impose a subsidy equal to tt in fig 1 that is equal to placing participants on the true social supply schedule qs5 with prices falling to pw5 and the quantities rising to qw5 the problem for policy makers in the water sector is that both positive and negative externalities exist together the policy solution to one a subsidy or a tax is directly contrary to the other so as subsidies are paid to account for the positive externalities the impacts of the negative externalities on pollution become worse alternatively reforming removing subsidies to the water sector may well exacerbate the under supply of positive externalities evident in the market 4 the political economy of irrigation subsidies reform many analysts have researched the irrigation subsidy reform process most literature focuses on the full cost recovery approach aiming for full recovery of the capital and o m costs while conveniently ignoring the subsidies for the environmental and the social costs of irrigation the oecd 2012 and fuentes 2011 both raise the concern that adverse environmental externalities have resulted from not recovering costs wichelns 2010 makes the link between the lack of full cost pricing being a subsidy whereas molle and berkoff 2007 p 21 suggest that charging for water use or disposal is not an end in itself but an instrument for achieving one or more policy objectives including water conservation enhancing economic activity and promoting environmental sustainability barraqué and montginoul 2015 discuss how to integrate social objectives into water pricing with social tariffs while their work centred on residential water use what they found applies equally to irrigation water reforming and removing subsidies from the irrigation sector is a difficult process due to strong opposition from pressure groups such as landowners farmers lobby organisations electricity and supply companies and fertiliser producers according to the oecd 2009 the main barrier to the reform of harmful subsidies has been the resistance by vested interests and the associated difficulty of gaining political support to push for changes subsidy reforms are often politically costly politicians are rarely willing to campaign to seek a popular mandate for a policy change for the common good especially when water consuming farmers have important electoral power alkon and urpelainen 2018 toan 2016 moreover the public has little interest in supporting the reforms because the cost of agricultural and water subsidies is very thinly spread among taxpayers and not always transparently communicated while the benefits of the subsidy are visible and concentrated in the hands of a small group who can more easily organise and lobby for the status quo oecd 2007 the three main policy options for subsidy reform that exist are the complete elimination of the subsidy the gradual reduction of the amount of subsidies or decoupling the subsidies from production dinar 2018 the removal of a subsidy is likely to be perceived as the withdrawal of an entitled benefit thereby generating great resistance which may require additional compensation and increased effort to ensure farmers buy in to the idea in specific cases transitory and time bound compensation may be necessary to assist with the structural change and overcome resistance but it needs to be carefully designed when used to ease the subsidy reform process lump sum decoupled payments enable farmers to retain the same welfare farmers are given a cash transfer of an equivalent amount of the subsidy while the new price provides an incentive to undertake changes in water consumption change in crop patterns reduction of irrigated area adoption of water saving technologies ávila et al 2005 however whether this will result in an improved environmental outcome is extremely dubious there is enough work undertaken on the jevons paradox and the rebound effects in irrigation to know that improvements in efficiency can lead to an increase in demand thus this approach to subsidy reform is one that should not be recommended as it may lead to adverse outcomes research and pilot studies can be used to assess realistic solutions that result in phasing out subsides that negatively impact on water resources and used to identify the optimal option elimination gradual removal or decoupling the subsidy and the adequate scale and the scope of the reform there are several ways to make subsidy reform less sensitive unbundling policies so that different objectives attract different policies for example by providing direct income support for farmer welfare instead of subsidising water may well facilitate change another way is by a gradual increase in water pricing and by buying back rights given to a sector may all work better than just eliminating subsidies 5 discussion on approaches to reform subsidies if the reform of subsidies is to be considered then a few themes can be followed first it is necessary to recognize that nations subsidize water for a variety of reasons and not necessarily for the sole benefit of irrigators second the imposition of subsidies and their removal is intrinsically linked to the issue of both positive and negative externalities their imposition while a possible attempt at redressing the uncompensated effects of societal needs also enhances the uncompensated impacts irrigation has on the environment knowing the value of these external effects and a subsidies contribution to them should play some role in their reform third subsidies for water come in many different formats it is not enough to account for just the subsidization of water prices those that cover o m costs that need to be considered but also the subsidization of the finished products complementary inputs complementary outputs establishment costs etc in other words auditing irrigation subsidies is an essential component needed if they are to be reformed that audit process would require a recognition of why subsidies were implemented in the first place it would require knowledge of the impact irrigation has in generating both the negative and positive externalities and the contribution subsides play in promoting these externalities finally any audit would need to account for the wide range of subsidies that have been used in the irrigation sector following this line of thinking leads one to suggest that subsidy reform and or removal is all about pricing reform in other words all that is required is to make sure the price of water paid by irrigators equates to the full costs of water provision as many have found out such reforms are extremely difficult to implement molle and berkoff 2007 davidson et al 2019 examples of the difficulties of reforming subsidies are the phasing out of the electricity subsidy for groundwater pumping in mexico foster et al 2018 initiatives in india to find reform solutions malik 2007 groundwater reforms in yemen hellegers et al 2008 and a water buyback scheme in the murray darling river basin in australia wheeler et al 2020 grafton and wheeler 2018 grafton et al 2020 despite their transparency the complex ways subsidies entwine themselves through a community means that any reform process will require some degree of compensation to be paid to those who lose rationing water while subsidising technology to increase productivity would seem to be promising in capturing the benefits of irrigation while avoiding the costs as it would cap the increased demand for water use that results from the increase in productivity embedded in the rebound effect however it is difficult to cap water use in places where the volumes are usually unknown and not well controlled the approach would require the ability to measure the volumes extracted including the runoff is something not many countries can do there is a reason why in many countries area based charges are applied instead of implementing the more efficient volume based charges and these reasons have little to do with a lack of desire to achieve more efficient outcomes and more to do with the actual control water managers have over the supply and distribution of water to small holders in theory it can be done and sometimes in case of groundwater extraction may well be ideal and undertaken 6 conclusions in this paper it was shown that subsidies to the irrigation sector were not only both beneficial and harmful but that they were also far reaching insidious and complex to reform they not only included the direct subsidies one usually accounts for but also the indirect subsidies that resulted from the non internalization of externalities or the lack of full cost pricing as well it is important to note that irrigation has caused externalities and that subsidies have made these externalities worse however even without subsidies such externalities would still exist further reforming subsidies by undertaking pricing reform will go against the positive impacts that are thought to result from irrigation in sum there is an argument that irrigation usually has environmental costs that are not internalised and subsidies typically usually always exacerbate that situation thus the tension between good outcomes more food and higher rural incomes and exacerbate the bad outcomes faster aquifer depletion drying estuaries environmental degradation are there subsidy regimes that can capture the benefits while avoiding the costs subsidies directed towards environmental protection some attempts such as rationing water to acceptable levels of consumption while subsidising technologies that maximise the productivity of the limited resource would seem to be the preferable approach but are difficult to implement the gains and losses from these types of reform are questions that can only be evaluated once the effects of the mix of subsidies and externalities which are detailed in this paper are understood they should be the subject of further research further research is also needed on the political process that will lead to successful subsidy reform ultimately the decision to pay subsidies is one taken by governments in order to obtain some desirable objectives these objectives can change over time and when combined with the limited size of public budgets and negative externalities can lead governments to ultimately question the wisdom of why they subsidised irrigation in the first place decisions to reform subsidies are of course political in nature and reform processes are not the preserve of those who analyse and advise on such matters nevertheless policy makers need to have a system of classifying and objectifying subsidies in a meaningful manner declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper annex a with a normal consumer good which water is not the impacts of a subsidy can simply be shown in a basic supply and demand schedule diagram see fig a1 the unsubsidised market for water is shown by the supply and demand schedules qs1 and qd respectively in this unsubsidised market the ruling price and quantities that constitute an equilibrium pw and qw respectively yield the revenue from the market equivalent to the area pwbqw0 the value of water shown by the area abd in fig 1 can be segregated into the consumers surplus abpw and producers surplus bdpw the costs of provision are equivalent to the area bqw0d the area under the supply schedule between the origin and the quantity traded in the market qw implementing a subsidy for the good equivalent in size to s in fig a1 can be done in one of two ways first it could be a subsidy paid on the per unit supply of the good which can be referred to as an ad valorem subsidy in this case the supply schedule would rotate down to become qs3 so at qw1 the level of subsidy is equal to s but would be lower if less water were involved or greater if more water were involved an example would be the subsidisation of variable operation and maintenance costs alternatively subsidies can be paid as a lump sum in such cases the whole supply schedule would shift down parallel to the original supply schedule to qs2 in fig a1 so regardless of the quantity of water involved the subsidy remains the same in this case the total subsidy paid is s in fig a1 an example would be governments paying for infrastructure or underwriting the cost of financing the development while for the purpose of presentation both an ad valorem and lump sum subsidies shown in fig a1 have the same impacts on the prices and the quantities of the good at equilibrium reducing prices from pw to pw1 and raising the quantity consumed and produced from qw and qw1 the impacts on value are very different with an ad valorem subsidy consumer surplus increase by pwbcpw1 in fig a1 while producers surplus changes from bdpw to pw1cd the revenue changes from pwbqw0 to pw1cqw1 with a lump sum subsidy the changes in revenue prices quantities and the consumer surplus are like that of an ad valorem subsidy in fig 1 because of the way it is drawn yet the impact on the producer surplus value changes from bdpw to pw1c0 the impact of subsidies on the input and the output market given the relationship between the demand for the crop and the input any attempt to subsidise the input is going to have an impact on the demand for the output see fig a2 again simplifying the subsidy to a lump sum type although an ad valorem type will have similar broad impacts the supply schedule for the input shifts away from the origin resulting in more of the input being used out to qw1 the price of the input falls from pw to pw1 the impacts on the consumer producer and economic surplus and the deadweight social losses are as described above in fig a1 the subsidy paid on the input also reduces the production costs of the output effectively the supply schedule for the output would also move to the right in line with the fall in the input supply schedule and be parallel to qsf running through the coordinate point pf1qw1 qsf1 in fig a2 the impact of subsidising the input is to reduce the price of the finished good and increasing its output the concomitant impacts of the consumer producer and economic surplus can also be traced along with the deadweight social loss just as an input subsidy can affect the market for the finished good a subsidy to an output will also have an impact on the input market see fig a3 the subsidy shifts the finished good supply schedule to the right reducing prices of both the good itself and the inputs from pf to pf1 and from pw to pw1 respectively the quantity of the output and the input also rise altogether the surplus values change in accordance with those observed above the essence of this finding is that not only do the subsidies that directly relate to the irrigation sector needed to be assessed but also those for the all the finished goods water is used in 
9779,intercropping planting pattern under plastic film mulching pfm has been widely adopted in the arid regions to reduce soil evaporation e improve land use efficiency and increase crop yield however water competition between intercropping components in the soil plant atmosphere continuum remains largely unexplored the evaporation and radiation interception using the neighboring species model erin can effectively estimate evapotranspiration et in a different intercropping ecosystem however the effects of soil surface resistance in the mulching area on et are not considered in the erin model thus the existing et models do not accurately estimate et in the intercropping ecosystem with pfm in this study we proposed a modified erin model merin in the merin model soil surface resistance in the mulching area was taken into account and its performance was compared to erin and penman monteith pm models these models were validated against observed et and e using the water balance method and micro lysimeters in a corn intercropped tomato experiment under high hi 30 mm for corn and 22 5 mm for tomato a locally recommended irrigation depth medium mi 22 5 mm for corn and 16 9 mm for tomato

and e variation for a corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under pfm during the entire crop growth season compared to the other examined models the most intense water competition between corn and tomato was observed in stage ii the elongation and tasseling stages for corn the flowering and fruiting stages for tomato t of corn generally was higher than tomato but an opposite result was also observed in stage ii additionally the variation of water competition under different irrigation levels was similar in the intercropping ecosystem when irrigation depth decreased to 22 5 and 15 mm from

et al 2021 salehi et al 2018 it is widely used in agronomic production worldwide as it increases the land use efficiency crusciol et al 2021 yield of dominant plant species berghuijs et al 2021 and other natural resources jardim et al 2020 currently the incorporation of cereals and cash crops in the cropping system is widely employed for instance corn wheat ma et al 2020a 2020b corn soybean rodehorst et al 2020 and the corn tomato intercropping patterns li et al 2017 inter specific competition in different intercropping planting patterns varies significantly ma et al 2020a 2020b demonstrated that wheat plants are more competitive than corn plants in absorbing soil moisture during the intercropping co growth period in a study by ahmed et al 2020 a decreased co growth duration increased growth rate and resilience in soybean crops against the size asymmetric competition in the corn soybean intercropping pattern chen et al 2020b evaluated the differences in the competition between corn and tomato crops for soil nitrate they found that soil nitrate exchange between corn and bare soil regions was lower than between the tomato and bare soil regions due to the lower concentration gradients of soil nitrate in the rhizosphere previous studies have systematically elucidated the inter species competition in different intercropping planting patterns these studies were primarily focused on the competition between soil water and nutrients between different crop species in the vadose zone however water competition between intercropping components in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac needs to be explored further accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et can unravel the water competition mechanism between intercropping components qiu et al 2019 currently et estimation is primarily derived through the use of the estimation method for et primarily entails crop coefficients with either the penman monteith pm model and or shuttleworth wallace sw models however crop coefficient remains to be an indirect calculation method allen et al 1998 firstly the crop coefficient is estimated and rectified in this method and then multiplied by reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 allen et al 2005 chen et al 2019 pereira et al 2021 rallo et al 2021 miao et al 2016 developed a new method for partitioning et using plant height and fractions of ground covered by crops based on the dual crop coefficient approach in the intercropping ecosystem although the estimation accuracy of this method was satisfactory determining the accurate value for crop coefficients remains a challenging task pm and sw models a direct method directly estimates et by calculating latent heat flux based on energy balance using aerodynamic parameters and meteorological data monteith 1981 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 these models have been widely applied in multiple conditions specifically in uniform underlying surfaces del campo et al 2019 elfarkh et al 2021 however pm and sw models cannot precisely estimate et in the intercropping ecosystem as interception alters radiation and wind speed within the canopy by neighboring plant species thus there is an urgent need to devise an et model to estimate the et of the intercropping ecosystem with the complex underlying surface to estimate et of a cornfield with different plant heights kang et al 2018 proposed an improved pm model referred to as pm hereinafter based on ohm s law by inducing effective aerodynamic and soil surface resistance this model can also be employed for an accurate estimation of et in intercropping ecosystem under pfm however this model lacks the functional expression for transpiration partitioning in the intercropping ecosystem an improved model erin wallace 1997 2000 was developed considering evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring plant species in intercropping ecosystems based on the sw model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 in a study by gao et al 2013 transpiration of maize and soybean was estimated using the erin model the statistical outcome of the study by gao et al 2013 demonstrated a sound agreement between the observed and the estimated values with the mean bias error of 0 06 mm d 1 the root mean square error of 0 23 mm d 1 and the index of agreement of 0 93 erin model primarily estimates the et in the intercropping ecosystem without pfm thus the effects of pfm on et were not taken into consideration in general pfm reduces soil evaporation increases plant transpiration and alters water consumption by increasing soil surface resistance li et al 2013 zribi et al 2015 thakur and kumar 2020 the current et model which considers pfm primarily focuses on the sole crop field for instance li et al 2013 deduced a new et model for cornfield under pfm using mulched and total area ratio based on the sw model chen et al 2020a further improved the sw model by importing the disintegration area of biodegradable film and re estimating the difference in et between pfm and biodegradable film mulching although et models under mulching conditions or intercropping ecosystems were previously developed the et model for an intercropping ecosystem under pfm could not be deduced simply by the superposition of the existing model parameters in the et model for an intercropping ecosystem model total latent heat in the intercropping ecosystem under pfm needs to be reasonably divided thus it is necessary to devise an et model for an intercropping ecosystem under pfm merin and determine the water competition between intercropping components the development of such a model will overcome the disadvantages of the existing et theory and provide a theoretical foundation for the formulation of an irrigation strategy this study aimed to a develop the merin model based on the erin model b validate the estimation accuracy of merin for et and e in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem c compare the estimated et difference during different crop growth stages between pm erin and merin models d evaluate the difference in the simulation of e for erin and merin models and e quantify plant transpiration and water competition

and 20 9 c respectively before sowing five soil samples were collected by a cutting ring volume of 100 cm3 in the 0 100 cm soil depth layer at 20 cm intervals wr g each soil sample contained a total of six replicates i e 30 samples in total half of the samples were analyzed using the sieve pipette method dane and topp 2002 after air drying and sieving to the samples through a 2 mm sieve soil texture in the study area was determined as a silty sandy loam sand silt clay ratio of 7 89 4 united states department of agriculture 2010 soil properties were determined in the rest of the soil samples the bulk density and field capacity of the undisturbed soil samples was measured using the mass per volume method in intact soil cores zhu et al 2018 to determine field capacity soil samples were saturated with water from the bottom by placing them in distilled water until the water surface reached the top edge of the cutting ring the weight of water drained by gravity from the saturated samples was measured by placing soil core cylinders on a dry sand layer for 5 days w5d g finally the weight of the cutting ring containing dry soil was measured after oven drying the soil at 105 c for 48 h wcrds g field capacity was calculated using the equation provided by zhu et al 2018 fwc w5d wcrds wcrds wcr 100 the measured bulk density and field capacity of the 0 100 cm soil depth layer was 1

2019 respectively while tomato seedlings were planted into intercropping fields on may 20 and may 18 in both years respectively corn and tomato were harvested on the same dates i e september 14 and september 20 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the planting pattern was two corn rows bare area two tomato rows row spacing and crop spacing were identical for corn and tomato with 50 cm crop rows and 30 cm crop spacing the experimental design was completely randomized with three irrigation depths and three replications i e 9 field plots each plot was 6 m wide and 20 m long separated by a 1 m wide bar since the locally recommended irrigation depth combined with rainfall can meet crop s water consumption the recommended irrigation depth was adopted in this study a locally recommended irrigation depth 30 mm for corn and 22 5 mm for tomato was considered to be the high irrigation depth hi moreover as the water consumption of corn was higher than that of tomato a higher irrigation upper limit was set for corn than tomato the recommended irrigation upper limits for corn and tomato were 85 and 80 of field capacity respectively to achieve the same frequency of irrigation event identical irrigation lower limits were set for both the crops the lower limit of the irrigation set to 65 of field capacity i e irrigation was applied when soil water content was less than 0 27 cm3 cm 3 additionally two different irrigation levels were designed by decreasing irrigation depth by 25 and 50 of the hi treatment thus three levels of irrigation depth high irrigation depth hi 30 mm for corn and 22 5 mm for tomato medium irrigation depth mi 22 5 mm for corn and 16 9 mm for tomato and low irrigation depth li 15 mm for corn and 11 3 mm for tomato were used in this study the tomato and corn plants were irrigated once every 7 15 days and the irrigation events for corn and tomato were ten times and nine times in 2018 and 2019 respectively groundwater was used to as the irrigation source with average irrigation water salinity of 0 54 g l 1 and soil salinity of 1 50 mg cm 3 during the study period one drip line was introduced between two crop rows with the fraction of the surface soil wetted by irrigation of 0 32 the emitter spacing of the drip line was the same as crop spacing irrigation rate of the emitter is 2 4 l h 1 moreover the plastic film with a traditional size 0 008 mm thickness and 80 cm width was applied in each plot with the fraction of soil covered by plastic film mulching of 0 8 the fertilizer application strategy in this experiment including basal fertilizer and topdressing was identical to that mentioned by chen et al 2021 2 2 observation methods the meteorological data concerning estimated et and e for instance the rainfall air temperature relative

observation points 5 different soil layers and three different locations were present for each plot the probes were calibrated by comparing measured swc obtained from gravimetric measurements with sensor measurements soil water potential was measured using three groups of tensiometers ward precision science and trade co ltd tensio china installed in the near position of time probes to determine water flux at 100 cm depth each group included two tensiometers which were installed at 90 cm and 110 cm of soil depths soil evaporation in the bare area was determined using micro lysimeters with a diameter and height of 11 and 20 cm respectively micro lysimeters were weighed daily at 8 00 and 17 00 using an electronic scale with a measurement precision of 1 chen et al 2020a an li 6400 open gas

w a q a 3 model introduction 3 1 multi source et model erin the multi source et model erin was deduced based on the shuttleworth wallace model which couples transpiration and evaporation in multi species mixtures wallace 1997 since erin model did not consider the effects of plastic film mulching on latent heat flux thus the total latent heat flux of components in corn tomato intercropping ecosystem was written as 12 λ e t λ t c λ t t λ e s where et is total evapotranspiration to the mixed canopy w m 2 t c is plant transpiration of corn mm d 1 t t is plant transpiration of tomato mm d 1

of water consumption in the intercropping ecosystem in this study we proposed a modified multi source et model merin based on the erin model evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring species that considered soil surface resistance in the mulching area in the merin model soil surface resistance in the mulching area was assumed as an infinite value which could completely cut off water vapor transport between the soil surface and atmosphere soil texture in the intercropping ecosystem was also assumed to be completely uniform additionally the horizontal water fluxes between experimental plots were assumed to be very little due to low irrigation rate thus the total latent heat in this model includes four components i e corn canopy λt c tomato canopy λt t bare area λe s and mulched area λe m 20 λ e t λ t c λ t t 1 f m λ e s f m λ e m where e m is soil evaporation in the mulched area mm d 1 f m is the ratio of the mulched area to total area similarly the total energy

heat flux for the bare area w m 2 f c is the fraction of the incident radiation intercepted by the corn canopy and f t is the fraction of the incident radiation intercepted by the tomato canopy in the merin model the assumption of light interception for two species made in this study was identical to that proposed by wallace 1997 the fractional light interception for corn and tomato was determined using the following equation 43 f c f c s f f c d f c s 44 f t f t s 1 f f t d f t s where f is a scaling factor between 0 and 1 which depends on the plant height of corn and tomato i e h c and h t 45 f h c 2 h c 2 h t 2 the light interception in the intercropping ecosystem was divided into two categories based on the extreme conditions when corn height was more than tomato the f c and f t were calculated using the following equation 46 f c d 1 e k c l a i c 47 f t s e k c l a i c 1 e k t l a i t where k c and k t are the extinction coefficients of corn and tomato respectively previous studies have reported k c and k t for corn and tomato to be 0 39 li et al 2018 and 0 65 cruz et al 2014 respectively in planting density and row spacing as adopted in this study lai c and lai t are leaf area indices of corn and tomato respectively the superscript d indicates the dominant species in light competition and superscript s refers to subordinate species in light competition in opposite condition the f c and f t were calculated as follows 48 f t d 1 e k t l a i t 49 f c s e k t l a i t 1 e k c l a i c since vpd in the merin model refers to the value above the mixed canopy they cannot be used to obtain the latent heat of an individual component thus the partitioning of the various latent heat fluxes was determined using the following modified pm equation 50 λ t c λ t t 1 f m λ e s

is acceptable jamieson et al 1991 patle et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of model performance actual crop evapotranspiration et c act determined using soil water balance method was used to validate the estimation accuracy of merin proposed in this study erin developed by wallace 1997 and pm models deduced by kang et al 2018 in the context of et for corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under different irrigation levels these three models captured et dynamic the estimation accuracy was highest for the merin model with mre of 9 7 the corresponding rmse and nrmse for the merin model were 0 59 mm d 1 and 7 2 respectively indicating a good estimation accuracy moreover a good agreement between estimated and observed values was observed for the merin model with the r 2 of 0 88 in 2018 similarly good estimation accuracy in 2019 was observed for the merin model with mre of 10 5 the corresponding rmse and nrmse for the merin model were only 0 40 mm d 1 and 5 4 respectively moreover the r 2 of the estimated value by the merin model in 2019 was 0 85 table 1 merin model decreased mre rmse and nrmse values by 47 1 41 0 and 40 9 respectively on average than the erin model which represents that the estimation accuracy of the merin model significantly improved than erin model meanwhile merin model had a better agreement for the estimated and observed values than the erin model e g it averagely increased r 2 by 4 3 furthermore the estimation accuracy of the merin model was better than the pm model e g mre rmse and nrmse of et calculated using the merin model decreased by 53 5 39 8 and 39 7 than the pm model respectively also the r 2 of the merin model was increased by 12 8 than the pm model in general the estimation accuracy and agreement of et estimated by the merin model are better than that of erin and pm models since soil surface resistance in the mulching area was taken into account additionally evaporation e measured using micro lysimeters was employed to validate the estimation accuracy of e obtained using merin and erin models table 1 a good estimation accuracy was found for the merin model with an average mre of 15 3 the corresponding rmse and nrmse were only 0 07 mm d 1 and 6 3 respectively furthermore an agreement between estimation and observation under different irrigation levels was satisfactory for the merin model with r 2 of 0 84 since the effects of plastic film mulching on e were considered in the merin model the estimation accuracy of the merin model was apparently better than erin model for example mre rmse and nrmse of estimated e obtained using the merin model decreased by 91 8 93 0 and 93 1 respectively compared to the erin model in 2018 whereas it decreased by 88 4 89 7 and 89 3 respectively in 2019 also an agreement between estimation and observation for the merin was higher than that of the erin model r 2 of the merin model increased by 6 3 and 10 7 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with the erin model table 1 this statistic result showed that the estimation accuracy of e estimated by the merin model is significantly higher than that of the erin model and the later hardly captured real e dynamics under pfm in other words the merin model overcomes the constraint that the erin model lacks the evaporation estimation 4 2 estimation of evapotranspiration by the merin erin and pm models under plastic film mulching due to the temporal difference between corn and tomato crop growth stages et for corn tomato intercropping ecosystem represented a different variation during different crop growth stages to clearly capture et dynamic during different crop growth stages the entire crop growth season was categorized into three stages i e stages i ii and iii fig 2 stage i represents water consumption for corn the seedling stage for corn no transplanting for tomato stage ii stage represents intense water consumption for the intercropping ecosystem the elongation and tasseling stages for corn the flowering and fruiting stages for tomato and stage iii represents weakened water consumption for the intercropping ecosystem the filling and maturation stages for corn the maturation stage for tomato in stage i the estimation accuracy of merin and pm models was significantly higher fig 2 mre of et obtained using merin and pm models in 2018 were 7 5 and 13 8 respectively while mre was 9 7 for merin and 13 7 for pm in 2019 however the estimation accuracy of erin was poor as the barrier effect of plastic film on the latent heat flux was neglected in the model wallace 1997 wallace and verhoef 2000 resulting in a significant underestimation of surface soil resistance during the early crop growth stage mre of et using erin in 2018 and 2019 were 32 0 and 53 8 respectively after tomato plantation stage ii the et for the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem reached its highest value all three models showed a reliable estimation accuracy mre of et obtained using merin erin and pm models in 2018 were 7 2 5 0 and 4 4 respectively and 7 6 10 1 and 11 4 in 2019 respectively this can be primarily attributed to the a uniform canopy for the intercropping ecosystem in stage ii which improved the estimation accuracy in the fractional light interception for corn and tomato this is in line with the findings reported by previous studies li et al 2013 gao et al 2013 kang et al 2018 as tomato achieved physiological maturity earlier than corn in stage iii et for the ecosystem was apparently lower than that in stage ii fig 2 out of all the three models the estimated values of merin and erin models were closer to the observed values than the pm model mre of et obtained through merin and erin models were only 5 3 and 6 2 respectively whereas mre was 10 6 for merin and 11 1 for erin in 2019 however the pm model significantly underestimated the et value during stage iii with mre of 21 7 and 31 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the outcomes of the current study were in line with the previous study for example kang et al 2018 also indicated that the pm model overestimated canopy resistance during the late crop growth stage the main reason attributed to that the pm model calculated canopy resistance by ohm s law and the effects of canopy space overlap and the inconsistency of different canopy growth on et was absent 4 3 the differences of estimation accuracy of evaporation by merin and erin models soil evaporation e varied between different crop growth stages in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem fig 3 out of all the three stages maximum e was observed in stage i with the values of 0 55 and 0 92 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively since the impact of plastic film mulching on e was not considered in the erin model which resulted in the erin model overestimated e in stage i fig 3 thus the estimation accuracy of the merin model was remarkably higher than the erin model for example the mre between observed e and estimated e by the merin model in 2018 and 2019 decreased by 73 6 and 84 0 than that of the erin model which showed that the estimation accuracy of the merin model was better than the erin model however gao et al 2013 reported that the erin model underestimated e in the corn soybean strip intercropping system the differences in the findings might be due to the experimental layout in this study we primarily evaluated the et variation in an intercropping ecosystem under pfm whereas gao et al 2013 focused on the intercropping ecosystem without mulching additionally e in the intercropping ecosystem decreased in response to an advanced stage of crop growth fig 3 in stage ii e values in 2018 and 2019 were 0 45 and 0 61 mm d 1 respectively with a significant decrease of 79 0 and 72 1 mre of e obtained using merin were 12 9 and 18 5 respectively compared to the erin model however merin and erin models showed high accuracy for e in stage iii this indicated that the merin model could precisely capture e dynamics in corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under plastic film mulching but the erin model only showed a high estimation accuracy for e under high canopy coverage this finding is in line with previous studies for example jiang et al 2019 reported that e estimated by the erin model was only 3 6 less than that of micro lysimeters 4 4 the sensitivity of the merin model to further evaluate the sensitivity of the merin model the original model parameters r a a r a s r a c r a t r s c r s t r s s were either increased or decreased by 10 20 and 30 respectively fig 4 the outcomes of sensitivity analysis illustrated consistent sensitivity of model parameters under different irrigation levels the merin model was found to be the most sensitive to variation in r a a which showed that r a a is very important to the estimation accuracy of the merin model deviation of et in response to variation in r a a under hi mi and li treatments were 10 0 13 2 10 8 14 7 and 9 9 13 3 respectively this can be attributed to a direct correlation of r a a to a mixed canopy of the intercropping ecosystem the previous study reported similar findings for instance li et al 2013 reported that the variation in r a a can significantly affect the estimation accuracy of the sw model additionally the mrein model is sensitive to variation in r s c and r s t et deviation in response to variation in r s c under hi mi and li treatments were 6 1 8 9 6 1 8 9 and 6 4 9 5 respectively and 5 9 9 5 5 8 9 5 and 5 6 9 0 for r s t respectively similarly gao et al 2013 illustrated that the variation of canopy resistance generated apparent change in the transpiration of corn and soybeans however since the correction between r s s and crop canopy was not apparent resulting in that r s s had the lowest sensitivity of 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 and 0 4 0 4 respectively under hi mi and li 4 5 inter specific water competition between corn and tomato due to the spatial temporal difference in physiological property and growth rhythm for inter species crops the water competition between inter species crops showed a remarkable distinction during different crop growth stages to quantify the inter specific water competition in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem the merin model was employed in the current study to determine plant transpiration t the correlation of water competition between corn and tomato crops first increased and then decreased due to the growth rhythm for inter species crops during different crop growth stages fig 5 in stage i t values for corn under hi treatment in 2018 and 2019 were 1 55 and 0 67 mm d 1 respectively after tomato plantation the water competition intensity between corn and tomato increased in stage ii specifically in 2018 with the lowest cr of 192 15 the outcomes demonstrated higher t for corn than for tomato but t for tomato was apparently higher than t for corn in the special crop growth stage fig 5 t of corn and tomato during stage ii in 2018 were 3 53 and 2 07 mm d 1 respectively and 2 58 and 1 31 mm d 1 in 2019 respectively the average cr was found to be 32 90 and 42 82 respectively this phenomenon was the outcome of multiple processes of which the light competition for inter species crops was the primary process for the competition between aboveground resources ghanbari et al 2010 bedoussac et al 2015 glaze corcoran et al 2020 usually the taller plant can absorb a high amount of solar radiation than the shorter plant in the intercropping ecosystem due to the bigger canopy the water consumption of the taller plant was higher than the shorter plants for example in this study compared with tomato t of corn under hi treatment in 2018 and 2019 increased by 29 3 and 42 1 respectively fig 5 wang et al 2021 simulated the et partitioning in an apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry using an improved erin model they similarly found that the tall apple tree had 33 3 48 0 higher water consumption compared to cocksfoot however different intercropping ecosystems had different experimental results for instance ma et al 2020a reported that the water consumption of shorter wheat plants was higher than corn in the wheat corn intercropping ecosystem the difference mainly resulted from the competition between underground resources although corn absorbed higher solar radiation than wheat the root activity of wheat was higher than corn similar results were observed in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem for instance li et al 2019 illustrated that the root water uptake of corn was 7 3 times higher than tomato in general corn was the dominating species in the water competition irrespective of ground levels in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem additionally the width of the bar between experimental plots was small which may cause that corn i e the species with higher water consumption absorbed soil water from the adjoining experimental plot therefore the cr between corn and tomato may be over estimated in this experiment to further precisely quantify the water competition between intercropping components the width of buffer zone needs to be increased in the next experiment in stage iii the water competition of corn was higher than tomato due to the physiological maturity of tomato t of corn and tomato in 2018 were 3 10 and 1 79 mm d 1 respectively and 3 22 and 1 19 mm d 1 respectively the average cr in stage iii was 31 77 and 63 94 respectively gao et al 2013 have shown that t of corn was about 1 8 times more than t of soybeans in the corn soybeans intercropping ecosystem also the cr between corn and tomato reached to 46 9 however the cr between crops in this present study is apparently higher than that of ma et al 2020b the reason is mainly attributed to the difference in crop species in the current study tomatoes with relatively low water consumption were intercropped with corn approximately 200 mm ma et al 2020b planted wheat with higher water consumption approximately 300 mm thus the water competition intensity i e transpiration difference between corn and tomato was apparently higher than corn and wheat however the total water consumption in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem was low compared to the corn wheat intercropping ecosystem therefore corn intercropped tomato that is a more optimal model for saving water different irrigation levels also restrict the water consumption intensity between corn and tomato although the total water consumption of intercropping ecosystem decreased in response to a reduced irrigation depth water consumption intensity for inter species crops increased for instance cr under mi and li was 3 3 and 6 7 higher than hi respectively fig 5 in addition compared with tomatoes the water deficit resistance for corn was higher when irrigation depth was decreased to mi and li from hi t of tomato decreased by 12 9 and 22 4 respectively and t of corn decreased by 10 7 and 16 3 respectively the primary reason might be the difference in soil water content in different root zones with decreasing irrigation depth the soil water content in the corn root zone significantly decreased compared to tomato fig 6 however the horizontal gradient of hydraulic potential between the corn root zone and the tomato root zone increased resulting in a water movement from the tomato root zone high hydraulic potential to the corn root zone low hydraulic potential chen et al 2020b li et al 2019 thus the water deficit in corn could be impeded resulting in a severe water deficit for tomatoes chen et al 2020b 5 conclusion in this study we proposed a modified et model merin considering the soil surface resistance in the mulching area based on the erin model the merin model overcomes the constraint that the erin model lacks the evaporation estimation the merin model can accurately capture et and e variation for a corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under pfm during the crop growing season compared to erin and pm models however the merin erin and pm model s estimation accuracy were distinct during different crop growth stages although the et estimation accuracy of merin and pm models in stage i was high the erin model overestimated et and e as the effects of pfm on evaporation were neglected in stage ii the merin erin and pm models demonstrated a reliable estimation accuracy in stage iii out of all the three models the estimated value of merin and erin models were closer to the observed value than pm the most intense water competition between corn and tomato was observed in stage ii t of corn was higher than tomato however a reversed trend was observed during the special crop growth stage additionally the variation of water competition under different irrigation levels was identical in the intercropping ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9779,intercropping planting pattern under plastic film mulching pfm has been widely adopted in the arid regions to reduce soil evaporation e improve land use efficiency and increase crop yield however water competition between intercropping components in the soil plant atmosphere continuum remains largely unexplored the evaporation and radiation interception using the neighboring species model erin can effectively estimate evapotranspiration et in a different intercropping ecosystem however the effects of soil surface resistance in the mulching area on et are not considered in the erin model thus the existing et models do not accurately estimate et in the intercropping ecosystem with pfm in this study we proposed a modified erin model merin in the merin model soil surface resistance in the mulching area was taken into account and its performance was compared to erin and penman monteith pm models these models were validated against observed et and e using the water balance method and micro lysimeters in a corn intercropped tomato experiment under high hi 30 mm for corn and 22 5 mm for tomato a locally recommended irrigation depth medium mi 22 5 mm for corn and 16 9 mm for tomato 25 of hi and low irrigation depth li 15 mm for corn and 11 25 mm for tomato 50 of hi during 2018 2019 respectively the outcomes of this study showed that the merin model could accurately estimate et and e variation for a corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under pfm during the entire crop growth season compared to the other examined models the most intense water competition between corn and tomato was observed in stage ii the elongation and tasseling stages for corn the flowering and fruiting stages for tomato t of corn generally was higher than tomato but an opposite result was also observed in stage ii additionally the variation of water competition under different irrigation levels was similar in the intercropping ecosystem when irrigation depth decreased to 22 5 and 15 mm from 30 mm average t for corn decreased by 10 7 and 16 3 respectively and by 12 9 and 22 4 for tomato respectively in both years keywords water competition multi source et model different irrigation levels

other natural resources jardim et al 2020 currently the incorporation of cereals and cash crops in the cropping system is widely employed for instance corn wheat ma et al 2020a 2020b corn soybean rodehorst et al 2020 and the corn tomato intercropping patterns li et al 2017 inter specific competition in different intercropping planting patterns varies significantly ma et al 2020a 2020b demonstrated that wheat plants are more competitive than corn plants in absorbing soil moisture during the intercropping co growth period in a study by ahmed et al 2020 a decreased co growth duration increased growth rate and resilience in soybean crops against the size asymmetric competition in the corn soybean intercropping pattern chen et al 2020b evaluated the differences in the competition between corn and tomato crops for soil nitrate they found that soil nitrate exchange between corn and bare soil regions was lower than between the tomato and bare soil regions due to the lower concentration gradients of soil nitrate in the rhizosphere previous studies have systematically elucidated the inter species competition in different intercropping planting patterns these studies were primarily focused on the competition between soil water and nutrients between different crop species in the vadose zone however water competition between intercropping components in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac needs to be explored further accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et can unravel the water competition mechanism between intercropping components qiu et al 2019 currently et estimation is primarily derived through the use of the estimation method for et primarily entails crop coefficients with either the penman monteith pm model and or shuttleworth wallace sw models however crop coefficient remains to be an indirect calculation method allen et al 1998 firstly the crop coefficient is estimated and rectified in this method and then multiplied by reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 allen et al 2005 chen et al 2019 pereira et al 2021 rallo et al 2021 miao et al 2016 developed a new method for partitioning et using plant height and fractions of ground covered by crops based on the dual crop coefficient approach in the intercropping ecosystem although the estimation accuracy of this method was satisfactory determining the accurate value for crop coefficients remains a challenging task pm and sw models a direct method directly estimates et by calculating latent heat flux based on energy balance using aerodynamic parameters and meteorological data monteith 1981 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 these models have been widely applied in multiple conditions specifically in uniform underlying surfaces del campo et al 2019 elfarkh et al 2021 however pm and sw models cannot precisely estimate et in the intercropping ecosystem as interception alters radiation and wind speed within the canopy by neighboring plant species thus there is an urgent need to devise an et model to estimate the et of the intercropping ecosystem with the complex underlying surface to estimate et of a cornfield with different plant heights kang et al 2018 proposed an improved pm model referred to as pm hereinafter based on ohm s law by inducing effective aerodynamic and soil surface resistance this model can also be employed for an accurate estimation of et in intercropping ecosystem under pfm however this model lacks the functional expression for transpiration partitioning in the intercropping ecosystem an improved model erin wallace 1997 2000 was developed considering evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring plant species in intercropping ecosystems based on the sw model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 in a study by gao et al 2013 transpiration of maize and soybean was estimated using the erin model the statistical outcome of the study by gao et al 2013 demonstrated a sound agreement between the observed and the estimated values with the mean bias error of 0 06 mm d 1 the root mean square error of 0 23 mm d 1 and the index of agreement of 0 93 erin model primarily estimates the et in the intercropping ecosystem without pfm thus the effects of pfm on et were not taken into consideration in general pfm reduces soil evaporation increases plant transpiration and alters water consumption by increasing soil surface resistance li et al 2013 zribi et al 2015 thakur and kumar 2020 the current et model which considers pfm primarily focuses on the sole crop field for instance li et al 2013 deduced a new et model for cornfield under pfm using mulched and total area ratio based on the sw model chen et al 2020a further improved the sw model by importing the disintegration area of biodegradable film and re estimating the difference in et between pfm and biodegradable film mulching although et models under mulching conditions or intercropping ecosystems were previously developed the et model for an intercropping ecosystem under pfm could not be deduced simply by the superposition of the existing model parameters in the et model for an intercropping ecosystem model total latent heat in the intercropping ecosystem under pfm needs to be reasonably divided thus it is necessary to devise an et model for an intercropping ecosystem under pfm merin and determine the water competition between intercropping components the development of such a model will overcome the disadvantages of the existing et theory and provide a theoretical foundation for the formulation of an irrigation strategy this study aimed to a develop the merin model based on the erin model b validate the estimation accuracy of merin for et and e in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem c compare the estimated et difference during different crop growth stages between pm erin and merin models d evaluate the difference in the simulation of e for erin and merin models and e quantify plant transpiration and water competition between intercropping components under different irrigation depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design a field experiment was conducted in hetao irrigation area inner mongolia 40 41 n 107 18 e in 2018 and 2019 this experimental area was characterized by an arid climate with precipitation of 200 8 and 87 9 mm et 0 of 614 7 and 572 6 mm and air temperature of 21 5 and 20 9 c respectively before sowing five soil samples were collected by a cutting ring volume of 100 cm3 in the 0 100 cm soil depth layer at 20 cm intervals wr g each soil sample contained a total of six replicates i e 30 samples in total half of the samples were analyzed using the sieve pipette method dane and topp 2002 after air drying and sieving to the samples through a 2 mm sieve soil texture in the study area was determined as a silty sandy loam sand silt clay ratio of 7 89 4 united states department of agriculture 2010 soil properties were determined in the rest of the soil samples the bulk density and field capacity of the undisturbed soil samples was measured using the mass per volume method in intact soil cores zhu et al 2018 to determine field capacity soil samples were saturated with water from the bottom by placing them in distilled water until the water surface reached the top edge of the cutting ring the weight of water drained by gravity from the saturated samples was measured by placing soil core cylinders on a dry sand layer for 5 days w5d g finally the weight of the cutting ring containing dry soil was measured after oven drying the soil at 105 c for 48 h wcrds g field capacity was calculated using the equation provided by zhu et al 2018 fwc w5d wcrds wcrds wcr 100 the measured bulk density and field capacity of the 0 100 cm soil depth layer was 1 42 g cm 3 and 0 41 cm3 cm 3 respectively soil ph was found to be 7 6 using an ion selective electrode and soil solution 2 5 ml deionized water per gram of soil kyveryga et al 2004 soil water content at the permanent wilting point was 0 12 cm3 cm 3 as per the pot experiment in the laboratory torres et al 2021 additionally three soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm using a soil auger at 10 cm intervals to analyze soil fertilizer with six replicates available nitrogen n available phosphorous p and available potassium k contents of soil in the tillage layer 0 30 cm were found to be 0 99 0 80 and 17 0 mg g 1 using the stream distillation the colorimetry and the ammonium acetate extraction method carter and gregorich 2007 respectively corn seeds were sown on may 1 and may 4 in 2018 and 2019 respectively while tomato seedlings were planted into intercropping fields on may 20 and may 18 in both years respectively corn and tomato were harvested on the same dates i e september 14 and september 20 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the planting pattern was two corn rows bare area two tomato rows row spacing and crop spacing were identical for corn and tomato with 50 cm crop rows and 30 cm crop spacing the experimental design was completely randomized with three irrigation depths and three replications i e 9 field plots each plot was 6 m wide and 20 m long separated by a 1 m wide bar since the locally recommended irrigation depth combined with rainfall can meet crop s water consumption the recommended irrigation depth was adopted in this study a locally recommended irrigation depth 30 mm for corn and 22 5 mm for tomato was considered to be the high irrigation depth hi moreover as the water consumption of corn was higher than that of tomato a higher irrigation upper limit was set for corn than tomato the recommended irrigation upper limits for corn and tomato were 85 and 80 of field capacity respectively to achieve the same frequency of irrigation event identical irrigation lower limits were set for both the crops the lower limit of the irrigation set to 65 of field capacity i e irrigation was applied when soil water content was less than 0 27 cm3 cm 3 additionally two different irrigation levels were designed by decreasing irrigation depth by 25 and 50 of the hi treatment thus three levels of irrigation depth high irrigation depth hi 30 mm for corn and 22 5 mm for tomato medium irrigation depth mi 22 5 mm for corn and 16 9 mm for tomato and low irrigation depth li 15 mm for corn and 11 3 mm for tomato were used in this study the tomato and corn plants were irrigated once every 7 15 days and the irrigation events for corn and tomato were ten times and nine times in 2018 and 2019 respectively groundwater was used to as the irrigation source with average irrigation water salinity of 0 54 g l 1 and soil salinity of 1 50 mg cm 3 during the study period one drip line was introduced between two crop rows with the fraction of the surface soil wetted by irrigation of 0 32 the emitter spacing of the drip line was the same as crop spacing irrigation rate of the emitter is 2 4 l h 1 moreover the plastic film with a traditional size 0 008 mm thickness and 80 cm width was applied in each plot with the fraction of soil covered by plastic film mulching of 0 8 the fertilizer application strategy in this experiment including basal fertilizer and topdressing was identical to that mentioned by chen et al 2021 2 2 observation methods the meteorological data concerning estimated et and e for instance the rainfall air temperature relative humidity and atmospheric pressure at referent height were collected at 30 min intervals using an automatic meteorological station onset computer inc u30 hobo usa chen et al 2020a the corresponding values were further averaged once every 24 h three time probes imko gmbh inc iph trime pico germany were installed in the middle of the cornrows middle of the tomato rows and between corn and tomato rows at 20 cm intervals until the entire root zone for each crop a depth of 100 cm to measure soil water content swc based on time domain reflectometry method once every 3 5 days a total of 15 observation points 5 different soil layers and three different locations were present for each plot the probes were calibrated by comparing measured swc obtained from gravimetric measurements with sensor measurements soil water potential was measured using three groups of tensiometers ward precision science and trade co ltd tensio china installed in the near position of time probes to determine water flux at 100 cm depth each group included two tensiometers which were installed at 90 cm and 110 cm of soil depths soil evaporation in the bare area was determined using micro lysimeters with a diameter and height of 11 and 20 cm respectively micro lysimeters were weighed daily at 8 00 and 17 00 using an electronic scale with a measurement precision of 1 chen et al 2020a an li 6400 open gas exchange system licor inc lincoln ne usa was used to obtain stomatal conductance at 9 30 11 30 during the elongation tasseling and filling stages the parameters of the integrated fluorescence chamber head of the gas exchange system were similar to that described in a study by retta et al 2016 with incident irradiance of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 and flow velocity of 300 μmol s 1 for measurement of light response of photosynthesis leaves were first dark adapted for 25 min subsequently light intensity applied on the upper leaf surface was gradually increased in the following manner 0 20 50 100 200 500 1000 1500 and 2000 µmol m 2 s 1 the ambient co2 concentration was maintained at 250 µmol mol 1 or 1000 µmol mol 1 for 21 and 2 oxygen level respectively additionally the stomatal conductance of leaf and transpiration rate were determined at ambient co2 concentrations of 380 µmol i e actual co2 concentrations retta et al 2016 since the transpiration rate determined by the portable steady porometer method was higher than the transpiration under natural conditions zhang et al 2012 the transpiration rate was moderately revised with the speedy weight method saleem et al 2009 the water competition ratio cr was obtained by calculating the t of corn and tomato ratio t c t t t c i e when cr 0 corn was dominant in water competition and when cr 0 the tomato was dominant in water competition since tomato was not planted in stage i cr was constant i e 100 five plants were randomly selected from each plot to determine leaf area and plant height using a leaf area meter li cor inc li 3000 c li usa and a tape with 0 1 cm precision once every 7 15 days respectively during different crop growth stages fig 1 2 3 estimation of soil water balance in an intercropping ecosystem soil water balance

w a q a 3 model introduction 3 1 multi source et model erin the multi source et model erin was deduced based on the shuttleworth wallace model which couples transpiration and evaporation in multi species mixtures wallace 1997 since erin model did not consider the effects of plastic film mulching on latent heat flux thus the total latent heat flux of components in corn tomato intercropping

of water consumption in the intercropping ecosystem in this study we proposed a modified multi source et model merin based on the erin model evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring species that considered soil surface resistance in the mulching area in the merin model soil surface resistance in the mulching area was assumed as an infinite value which could completely cut off water vapor transport between the soil surface and atmosphere soil texture in the intercropping ecosystem was also assumed to be completely uniform additionally the horizontal water fluxes between experimental plots were assumed to be very little due to low irrigation rate thus the total latent heat in this model includes four components i e corn canopy λt c tomato canopy λt t bare area λe s

is acceptable jamieson et al 1991 patle et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of model performance actual crop evapotranspiration et c act determined using soil water balance method was used to validate the estimation accuracy of merin proposed in this study erin developed by wallace 1997 and pm models deduced by kang et al 2018 in the context of et for corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under different irrigation levels these three models captured et dynamic the estimation accuracy was highest for the merin model with mre of 9 7 the corresponding rmse and nrmse for the merin model were 0 59 mm d 1 and 7 2 respectively indicating a good estimation accuracy moreover a good agreement between estimated and observed values was observed for the merin model with the r 2 of 0 88 in 2018 similarly good estimation accuracy in 2019 was observed for the merin model with mre of 10 5 the corresponding rmse and nrmse for the merin model were only 0 40 mm d 1 and 5 4 respectively moreover the r 2 of the estimated value by the merin model in 2019 was 0 85 table 1 merin model decreased mre rmse and nrmse values by 47 1 41 0 and 40 9 respectively on average than the erin model which represents that the estimation accuracy of the merin model significantly improved than erin model meanwhile merin model had a better agreement for the estimated and observed values than the erin model e g it averagely increased r 2 by 4 3 furthermore the estimation accuracy of the merin model was better than the pm model e g mre rmse and nrmse of et calculated using the merin model decreased by 53 5 39 8 and 39 7 than the pm model respectively also the r 2 of the merin model was increased by 12 8 than the pm model in general the estimation accuracy and agreement of et estimated by the merin model are better than that of erin and pm models since soil surface resistance in the mulching area was taken into account additionally evaporation e measured using micro lysimeters was employed to validate the estimation accuracy of e obtained using merin and erin models table 1 a good estimation accuracy was found for the merin model with an average mre of 15 3 the corresponding rmse and nrmse were only 0 07 mm d 1 and 6 3 respectively furthermore an agreement between estimation and observation under different irrigation levels was satisfactory for the merin model with r 2 of 0 84 since the effects of plastic film mulching on e were considered in the merin model the estimation accuracy of the merin model was apparently better than erin model for example mre rmse and nrmse of estimated e obtained using the merin model decreased by 91 8 93 0 and 93 1 respectively compared to the erin model in 2018 whereas it decreased by 88 4 89 7 and 89 3 respectively in 2019 also an agreement between estimation and observation for the merin was higher than that of the erin model r 2 of the merin model increased by 6 3 and 10 7 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with the erin model table 1 this statistic result showed that the estimation accuracy of e estimated by the merin model is significantly higher than that of the erin model and the later hardly captured real e dynamics under pfm in other words the merin model overcomes the constraint that the erin model lacks the evaporation estimation 4 2 estimation of evapotranspiration by the merin erin and pm models under plastic film mulching due to the temporal difference between corn and tomato crop growth stages et for corn tomato intercropping ecosystem represented a different variation during different crop growth stages to clearly capture et dynamic during different crop growth stages the entire crop growth season was categorized into three stages i e stages i ii and iii fig 2 stage i represents water consumption for corn the seedling stage for corn no transplanting for tomato stage ii stage represents intense water consumption for the intercropping ecosystem the elongation and tasseling stages for corn the flowering and fruiting stages for tomato and stage iii represents weakened water consumption for the intercropping ecosystem the filling and maturation stages for corn the maturation stage for tomato in stage i the estimation accuracy of merin and pm models was significantly higher fig 2 mre of et obtained using merin and pm models in 2018 were 7 5 and 13 8 respectively while mre was 9 7 for merin and 13 7 for pm in 2019 however the estimation accuracy of erin was poor as the barrier effect of plastic film on the latent heat flux was neglected in the model wallace 1997 wallace and verhoef 2000 resulting in a significant underestimation of surface soil resistance during the early crop growth stage mre of et using erin in 2018 and 2019 were 32 0 and 53 8 respectively after tomato plantation stage ii the et for the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem reached its highest value all three models showed a reliable estimation accuracy mre of et obtained using merin erin and pm models in 2018 were 7 2 5 0 and 4 4 respectively and 7 6 10 1 and 11 4 in 2019 respectively this can be primarily attributed to the a uniform canopy for the intercropping ecosystem in stage ii which improved the estimation accuracy in the fractional light interception for corn and tomato this is in line with the findings reported by previous studies li et al 2013 gao et al 2013 kang et al 2018 as tomato achieved physiological maturity earlier than corn in stage iii et for the ecosystem was apparently lower than that in stage ii fig 2 out of all the three models the estimated values of merin and erin models were closer to the observed values than the pm model mre of et obtained through merin and erin models were only 5 3 and 6 2 respectively whereas mre was 10 6 for merin and 11 1 for erin in 2019 however the pm model significantly underestimated the et value during stage iii with mre of 21 7 and 31 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the outcomes of the current study were in line with the previous study for example kang et al 2018 also indicated that the pm model overestimated canopy resistance during the late crop growth stage the main reason attributed to that the pm model calculated canopy resistance by ohm s law and the effects of canopy space overlap and the inconsistency of different canopy growth on et was absent 4 3 the differences of estimation accuracy of evaporation by merin and erin models soil evaporation e varied between different crop growth stages in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem fig 3 out of all the three stages maximum e was observed in stage i with the values of 0 55 and 0 92 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively since the impact of plastic film mulching on e was not considered in the erin model which resulted in the erin model overestimated e in stage i fig 3 thus the estimation accuracy of the merin model was remarkably higher than the erin model for example the mre between observed e and estimated e by the merin model in 2018 and 2019 decreased by 73 6 and 84 0 than that of the erin model which showed that the estimation accuracy of the merin model was better than the erin model however gao et al 2013 reported that the erin model underestimated e in the corn soybean strip intercropping system the differences in the findings might be due to the experimental layout in this study we primarily evaluated the et variation in an intercropping ecosystem under pfm whereas gao et al 2013 focused on the intercropping ecosystem without mulching additionally e in the intercropping ecosystem decreased in response to an advanced stage of crop growth fig 3 in stage ii e values in 2018 and 2019 were 0 45 and 0 61 mm d 1 respectively with a significant decrease of 79 0 and 72 1 mre of e obtained using merin were 12 9 and 18 5 respectively compared to the erin model however merin and erin models showed high accuracy for e in stage iii this indicated that the merin model could precisely capture e dynamics in corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under plastic film mulching but the erin model only showed a high estimation accuracy for e under high canopy coverage this finding is in line with previous studies for example jiang et al 2019 reported that e estimated by the erin model was only 3 6 less than that of micro lysimeters 4 4 the sensitivity of the merin model to further evaluate the sensitivity of the merin model the original model parameters r a a r a s r a c r a t r s c r s t r s s were either increased or decreased by 10 20 and 30 respectively fig 4 the outcomes of sensitivity analysis illustrated consistent sensitivity of model parameters under different irrigation levels the merin model was found to be the most sensitive to variation in r a a which showed that r a a is very important to the estimation accuracy of the merin model deviation of et in response to variation in r a a under hi mi and li treatments were 10 0 13 2 10 8 14 7 and 9 9 13 3 respectively this can be attributed to a direct correlation of r a a to a mixed canopy of the intercropping ecosystem the previous study reported similar findings for instance li et al 2013 reported that the variation in r a a can significantly affect the estimation accuracy of the sw model additionally the mrein model is sensitive to variation in r s c and r s t et deviation in response to variation in r s c under hi mi and li treatments were 6 1 8 9 6 1 8 9 and 6 4 9 5 respectively and 5 9 9 5 5 8 9 5 and 5 6 9 0 for r s t respectively similarly gao et al 2013 illustrated that the variation of canopy resistance generated apparent change in the transpiration of corn and soybeans however since the correction between r s s and crop canopy was not apparent resulting in that r s s had the lowest sensitivity of 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 and 0 4 0 4 respectively under hi mi and li 4 5 inter specific water competition between corn and tomato due to the spatial temporal difference in physiological property and growth rhythm for inter species crops the water competition between inter species crops showed a remarkable distinction during different crop growth stages to quantify the inter specific water competition in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem the merin model was employed in the current study to determine plant transpiration t the correlation of water competition between corn and tomato crops first increased and then decreased due to the growth rhythm for inter species crops during different crop growth stages fig 5 in stage i t values for corn under hi treatment in 2018 and 2019 were 1 55 and 0 67 mm d 1 respectively after tomato plantation the water competition intensity between corn and tomato increased in stage ii specifically in 2018 with the lowest cr of 192 15 the outcomes demonstrated higher t for corn than for tomato but t for tomato was apparently higher than t for corn in the special crop growth stage fig 5 t of corn and tomato during stage ii in 2018 were 3 53 and 2 07 mm d 1 respectively and 2 58 and 1 31 mm d 1 in 2019 respectively the average cr was found to be 32 90 and 42 82 respectively this phenomenon was the outcome of multiple processes of which the light competition for inter species crops was the primary process for the competition between aboveground resources ghanbari et al 2010 bedoussac et al 2015 glaze corcoran et al 2020 usually the taller plant can absorb a high amount of solar radiation than the shorter plant in the intercropping ecosystem due to the bigger canopy the water consumption of the taller plant was higher than the shorter plants for example in this study compared with tomato t of corn under hi treatment in 2018 and 2019 increased by 29 3 and 42 1 respectively fig 5 wang et al 2021 simulated the et partitioning in an apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry using an improved erin model they similarly found that the tall apple tree had 33 3 48 0 higher water consumption compared to cocksfoot however different intercropping ecosystems had different experimental results for instance ma et al 2020a reported that the water consumption of shorter wheat plants was higher than corn in the wheat corn intercropping ecosystem the difference mainly resulted from the competition between underground resources although corn absorbed higher solar radiation than wheat the root activity of wheat was higher than corn similar results were observed in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem for instance li et al 2019 illustrated that the root water uptake of corn was 7 3 times higher than tomato in general corn was the dominating species in the water competition irrespective of ground levels in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem additionally the width of the bar between experimental plots was small which may cause that corn i e the species with higher water consumption absorbed soil water from the adjoining experimental plot therefore the cr between corn and tomato may be over estimated in this experiment to further precisely quantify the water competition between intercropping components the width of buffer zone needs to be increased in the next experiment in stage iii the water competition of corn was higher than tomato due to the physiological maturity of tomato t of corn and tomato in 2018 were 3 10 and 1 79 mm d 1 respectively and 3 22 and 1 19 mm d 1 respectively the average cr in stage iii was 31 77 and 63 94 respectively gao et al 2013 have shown that t of corn was about 1 8 times more than t of soybeans in the corn soybeans intercropping ecosystem also the cr between corn and tomato reached to 46 9 however the cr between crops in this present study is apparently higher than that of ma et al 2020b the reason is mainly attributed to the difference in crop species in the current study tomatoes with relatively low water consumption were intercropped with corn approximately 200 mm ma et al 2020b planted wheat with higher water consumption approximately 300 mm thus the water competition intensity i e transpiration difference between corn and tomato was apparently higher than corn and wheat however the total water consumption in the corn tomato intercropping ecosystem was low compared to the corn wheat intercropping ecosystem therefore corn intercropped tomato that is a more optimal model for saving water different irrigation levels also restrict the water consumption intensity between corn and tomato although the total water consumption of intercropping ecosystem decreased in response to a reduced irrigation depth water consumption intensity for inter species crops increased for instance cr under mi and li was 3 3 and 6 7 higher than hi respectively fig 5 in addition compared with tomatoes the water deficit resistance for corn was higher when irrigation depth was decreased to mi and li from hi t of tomato decreased by 12 9 and 22 4 respectively and t of corn decreased by 10 7 and 16 3 respectively the primary reason might be the difference in soil water content in different root zones with decreasing irrigation depth the soil water content in the corn root zone significantly decreased compared to tomato fig 6 however the horizontal gradient of hydraulic potential between the corn root zone and the tomato root zone increased resulting in a water movement from the tomato root zone high hydraulic potential to the corn root zone low hydraulic potential chen et al 2020b li et al 2019 thus the water deficit in corn could be impeded resulting in a severe water deficit for tomatoes chen et al 2020b 5 conclusion in this study we proposed a modified et model merin considering the soil surface resistance in the mulching area based on the erin model the merin model overcomes the constraint that the erin model lacks the evaporation estimation the merin model can accurately capture et and e variation for a corn tomato intercropping ecosystem under pfm during the crop growing season compared to erin and pm models however the merin erin and pm model s estimation accuracy were distinct during different crop growth stages although the et estimation accuracy of merin and pm models in stage i was high the erin model overestimated et and e as the effects of pfm on evaporation were neglected in stage ii the merin erin and pm models demonstrated a reliable estimation accuracy in stage iii out of all the three models the estimated value of merin and erin models were closer to the observed value than pm the most intense water competition between corn and tomato was observed in stage ii t of corn was higher than tomato however a reversed trend was observed during the special crop growth stage additionally the variation of water competition under different irrigation levels was identical in the intercropping ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
