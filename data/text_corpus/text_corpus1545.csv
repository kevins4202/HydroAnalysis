7725,study region tana basin is the origin of the blue nile basin located in ethiopia the lake tana s mean annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm yr and its outflow drains an area of about 15 096 km2 there is limited effort to apply nested hydrological models for flood prediction due to being poorly gauged for validation study focus the objective of this study is to show how climate simulations can be used to generate reliable local predictions of flood and runoff for the blue nile in the ethiopian highlands in this study outputs from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 were used to initialize a nested hydrological model to reveal long term trends of runoff in flood prone areas of the lake tana basin ethiopia available satellite and reanalysis datasets were used for selection of cmip6 products and the five models with best validation were used to force a nested hydrological model known as wflow sbm a model independent multi algorithm optimization estimation tool was implemented for calibration of wflow with insitu observations new hydrological insights for the region in terms of simulating runoff and flood events application of wflow sbm to the lake tana basin gave promising results this study serves as a major step towards the development and implementation of global model driven nested hydrological assessments of flood risk in future projections for lake tana basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate projection gcms cmip6 wflow sbm model flood prediction lake tana basin ethiopia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flood related hazards are becoming more frequent and globally widespread because of changes in climate and land use an accelerating hydrological cycle under global warming and also due to land use wherein vegetation cover is overgrazed and denuded brown et al 2018 future climate is expected to increase the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall causing frequent river flooding and flood hazards fleming et al 2014 shrestha and lohpaisankrit 2017 previous studies have shown that flood intensity is highly sensitive to drastic global climate change kure and tebakari 2012 habibi et al 2018 nile et al 2010 prudhomme et al 2013 salman et al 2020 many flood prediction studies have been conducted in africa the studies include flood inundation di baldassarre et al 2010 risk impact and mitigation loudyi and kantoush 2020 ntajal et al 2017 flood warning and flood disaster du plessis 2002 in ethiopia identified flood prone areas include the baro akobo basin awash river basin wabi shebelle ribb and gumara areas fogera plain gashaw and legesse 2011 the united nations humanitarian affairs coordination office 2006 reported that a total of 357 000 people were affected by flooding in 2006 from which more than 136 000 people were made homeless yet few studies have been conducted in the gauged watersheds of the lake tana basin to assess flood risks using historical datasets e g desalegn et al 2016 hagos 2011 zelalem et al 2018 moreover most previous studies may not consider the impact of future climate change on the severity of flooding or they use one dimensional hydraulic models coarse resolution climate models and unrealistic emission scenarios fekadu et al 2017 ukumo et al 2022 which increase uncertainty accurate prediction of flood inundation areas and dissemination of information on the inundation areas to the disaster risk managers and the general public are essential to reduce losses in the lake tana basin it is crucial to develop appropriate climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to properly deal with future flood hazards in flood prone areas of the ethiopian highlands this strategy should make use of recent cmip6 climate model products high resolution digital elevation models and compatible distributed hydrological models in the case of ungauged basins there are challenges on how to make the best use of available data and modelling resources for accurate prediction pagano et al 2014 though the reliability of global flood models is rapidly increasing brown et al 2018 recent studies that employ global climate models to force nested hydrological models have shown promising performances e g brown et al 2018 yin et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 exploring the potential of climate model products to drive hydrological models and investigate their influence on river flows is essential for future flood warnings the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 ensemble models offer new emission pathways that explore a wider range of outcomes than in cmip5 gidden et al 2019 cmip6 has more models more future scenarios and greater number of experiments significant advances in remote sensing techniques the coupling of meteorological and hydrological modelling capabilities and advancements in knowledge and algorithms for analysis increase the reliability of flood forecasts alaminie et al 2021 fekadu et al 2017 several hydrological models have been developed over the past decades to better understand rainfall runoff processes and have become important tools for scenario simulations and predictions and decision making e g ajami et al 2008 cloke and pappenberger 2009 the wflow sbm pcraster modelling framework is selected as it fits the purpose and requirements of this study the distributed wflow sbm hydrological model schellekens 2022 werner et al 2013 has shown good performance in basins across a large range of elevations and drainage areas e g hassaballah et al 2017 werner and cannon 2016 the structure of the wflow sbm model released by deltares is transparent can be changed by other modellers and the system allows for rapid development the pcraster is a dynamic environmental modelling programming language within a gis framework that simplifies integration of spatial environmental models imhoff et al 2020 karssenberg 2002 uhlenbrook et al 2004 including wflow and other physically based distributed hydrological models the wflow pcraster modelling framework lacks parameter estimation and objective function optimization capability so that is supplemented with a model independent tool to facilitate calibration and validation of wflow the overall objective of this study is to investigate the future flood risks in the lake tana basin using cmip6 model products to drive or force a compatible and flexible hydrological modelling framework 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area the study considers the lake tana basin which is the source of the blue nile fig 1 and drains a catchment of 15 096 km2 within 10 95 12 78 n latitude and 36 89 38 25 e longitude the lake itself covers 17 of the catchment and has a diverse topography with elevation from 1322 m to 4111 m above m s l setegn et al 2008 the major land use classes are cultivated crop area pasture grazing forestry urban residential and wetland mountainous volcanic terrain has an eastern escarpment whose orographic mean annual precipitation is 1400 mm yr according to gauge data tibebe et al 2019 the climate of lake tana basin is tropical highland monsoon with a rainy season locally known as kiremt june september and a dry season october march the temperature shows small seasonal and large diurnal variability and mean annual temperature is 20 oc tibebe et al 2019 more than 40 small rivers and streams with a total mean annual inflow of 158 cumecs reach lake tana wubneh et al 2021 the only surface outflow is the blue nile abbay river with an annual flow of 3050 cumecs at bahir dar gauge station 37 36 e and 11 62 n four major tributaries gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech contribute more than 93 of the inflow to lake tana fenta et al 2018 setegn et al 2008 gumara gilgel abay and ribb sub catchments cover an area of 1279 km2 1656 km2 and 678 15 km2 respectively these three sub catchments are the focus of this study due to data availability 2 2 methods 2 2 1 input datasets and pre processing the selected wflow sbm model described under section 2 5 requires spatially distributed data static maps such as digital elevation model land use and soil physical parameters maps and spatially distributed forcing time series data such as precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration historical forcing and streamflow data are required to calibrate and validate the model 2 2 1 1 static maps the geophysical static maps provide information about morphological physical soil and land use properties for each grid of the computational domain these maps are accessed from the usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov land use 10 m resolution soilgrids soilgrids250m 2 0 https soilgrids org soil 250 m resolution and elevation data

resolution of 200 m and cropped to basin extent using the pcraster algorithms and gdal the geospatial data abstraction library the wflow python modelling framework requires special input formats and pre preparation step 1 and step 2 python scripts of the wflow model were used to create these formats by combining the dem land cover soil and hydrological gauge locations schellekens 2022 2 2 1 2

of the baseline period 1991 2020 underwent a quality control protocol including the removal of outliers and missing values rainfall stations which had significant number of missing data 10 and extreme outliers were excluded from the analysis leaving 9 stations that were reliable and had a consistent record for the selected period of analysis 2 2 1 3 streamflow daily river discharge values for

an alternative input for the wflow sbm model merra pet computed with penman monteith and hargreaves were directly retrieved from the knmi ce and the climate engine point pet data were then interpolated into a gridded product with a resolution of 200 m 2 2 2 cmip6 products bias correction and evaluation in this study the well known climdown climdown a t werner and cannon 2016 r package with bias correction constructed analogues with quantile mapping reordering bccaq was employed to downscale cmip6 products climdown is widely applied for downscaling global climate model gcm output to a fine spatial resolution bccaq is a hybrid downscaling method that combines outputs from climate analogues ca and quantile mapping at the fine scale resolution gudmundsson et al 2012 maurer and pierce 2014 satellite and reanalysis datasets chirps tamsat gpcc merra2 cru ts4 05 ecmwf era5 gpcp and ncep were validated with local surface observations using statistical error metrics such as the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 percent of bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse these statistical measures determine different aspects of the data s accuracy for the purpose of cmip6 model validation and selection for climate projections in the lake tana basin global climate model gcms simulations commonly exhibit systematic biases in precipitation and temperature thus gcms needs to be post processed to produce reliable estimators of local scale climate in this study for precipitation and temperature bias correction non parametric reboot quantile mapping method rqunt was applied the suitability of rqunt qm method was checked using nash sutcliff efficiency nse and mean absolute error mae statistical measures of model climatology 1991 2020 before evaluating precipitation and temperature for the 24 cmip6 models biases were corrected over the basin using the rqunt method in the r software package qmap developed by the norwegian meteorological institute gudmundsson et al 2012 the skill of the 24 bias corrected cmip6 models over the basin against the reanalysis and observations were evaluated through eight error metrics on r hydrogof package in addition to these error metrics a taylor diagram was used to graphically describe how closely the patterns match ground observations taylor 2001 it considers three error metrics including correlation coefficient centered unbiased rmse and standard deviation in a single diagram to describe the temporal performance of climate models against local observation and reanalysis taylor 2001 finally from these bias corrected cmip6 models the best performing models were selected for future climate projection the compromise programming cp error minimization method was applied for ranking the gcms models salman et al 2020 the cp measures the list distance lcp of each gcm from an ideal value or frontier salman et al 2020 lcp j 1 z x j x j p 1 p where z the number of

2061 2090 future climate projections the significance of temperature and precipitation trends were then examined for period from 2021 to 2100 using the mann kendall mk trend test method mann 1945 sheng et al 2002 yue et al 2002 the z value was used to detect whether a statistically significant trend existed a growing trend in the time series is shown by a positive z value whereas a falling trend is indicated by a negative z value in this study significance p value thresholds for high 0 01 medium 0 05 and low 0 1 were applied 2 2 4 development of the hydrological model to perform past current and future hydrological analysis a distributed hydrological model based on the wflow pcraster python framework was developed using the wflow model platform bouaziz et al 2018 the wflow is a state of the art open source spatially distributed hydrological model developed by the deltares openstreams project http www openstreams nl the model is derived from the cqflow model which simulates catchment runoff in both sparse and ample data environments schellekens 2022 wflow sbm model is based on topog hydrological tool described in vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 in this study wflow sbm was chosen for its improved consideration of both infiltration and saturation excess runoff generation processes in the ethiopian highlands previous research has demonstrated that saturation excess runoff dominates in the sub humid part of the region during the monsoonal period as distinct from saturated areas in the valley bottom moges et al 2017 tilahun et al 2015 and degraded areas could be considered as infiltration excess fig 3 shows a schematized representation of wflow sbm the hydrological processes in the wflow sbm model are represented by three main routines the gash model gash et al 1995 is used to calculate interceptions which use pet to drive actual evapotranspiration based on soil water content and land cover types the topog sbm calculates the soil water storage sws processes that generate runoff vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 topog sbm was specifically designed to simulate fast runoff processes however wflow sbm has been significantly improved to make it more widely applicable schellekens et al 2011 kinematic routing is used to simulate river drainage and overland flows to estimate the average rainfall and transpiration from the wet canopy rainfall and evaporation in the saturated canopy are calculated for each event the remaining water infiltrates into the soil and when the rain falls on partially saturated soil it directly contributes to surface runoff at the same time evapotranspiration removes some of the soil water infiltrated water is exchanged between the soil s unsaturated u and saturated s stores fig 3 in wflow sbm the soil is considered as a simple bucket model with exponential decay of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat with depth schellekens et al 2011 a topographic wetness index is used to identify and scale the soil depth of the various land cover types in the model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 the runoff is calculated for each grid cell with the whole depth of the cell divided into saturated and unsaturated zones as the model is fully distributed fig 3 the model uses darcy s equation to simulate lateral flow from the saturated zone the total runoff from a given catchment is the sum of surface runoff and lateral flow discharged from the river network after routing according to slopes in the high resolution dem lake tana is considered in wflow sbm using a mass balance modified puls approach that uses an explicit relationship between storage and outflow to quantify water balance this makes it possible to calibrate lake tana s outlet which wasn t done in earlier investigations setegn et al 2008 method description https wflow readthedocs io en latest wflow funcs html highlight lake natural lakes model parameters are linked to the wflow model through lookup tables to generate input parameter maps for land use soil type and sub catchment further details of the wflow model can be found at https media readthedocs org pdf wflow latest wflow pdf wflow sbm parameter estimation is based on spatial datasets that provide information on soil properties soil depth rooting depth and etc imhoff et al 2020 developed a method for parameterizing the model for any basin in the world using regionalization methods based on pedo transfer functions and upscaling techniques from the literature here in this study the model was run with chirps and pet calculated from era5 and cfsr reanalysis wflow sbm performance was evaluated for the baseline period 1991 2020 against available daily discharge measurements at the gumera gilgel abay ribb and the basin outlets 2 2 5 model calibration and validation calibrating a spatially distributed model assigns different parameter values to different grid cells which poses a risk of artificial parameterization and has computational demands at fine resolutions that inhibits model applications to large basins beven 2006 here the ostrich calibration toolkit was automated to calibrate the wflow sbm simulations ostrich has been created as a model independent multi algorithm optimization and parameter estimation program that allows researchers to automate the processes of model calibration and design optimization ostrich can be configured to work with any modeling program that uses text based input and output file formats further details can be found on the ostrich website http www civil uwaterloo ca lsmatott ostrich ostrichmain html in this study dds dynamically dimensioned search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 and statistical error metrics pbias and nse were used to verify whether the predicted and observed streamflow agreed daily river discharges at three tributaries and the lake tana basin outlet gumera gilgel abay ribb and abbay gauging stations were used for model calibration and validation the wflow sbm model provides an option to consider the lake tana in the simulation period even with abstraction of water from the lake for irrigation and hydropower purposes after 2003 that is undocumented 2 2 6 flood prediction under cmip6 model scenarios to investigate the possible impacts of climate change on the flood risk targeted cmip6 scenarios were chosen from medium range to high forcing scenarios model outputs for the ssp245 medium forcing ssp370 medium to high forcing and ssp585 strong forcing pathway were taken from 5 ensemble means of best performing models described in section 2 4 for flood frequency analysis the wflow sbm model for the lake tana basin was run for a reference period from 1991 2020 and for the three climate projections scenarios of the near term 2021 2050 projection there is currently no universally acceptable flood frequency analysis method rather ranges of models are taken into consideration ukumo et al 2022 to understand the effects of climate change on extreme river discharges an r script for probability distribution methods gumbel evi log normal generalized pareto and generalized logistics were developed based on the l moment ratio diagram gumbel and log normal distribution methods were chosen to compute the flood magnitudes for 2 5 10 50 100 200 500 and 1000 return periods the flowchart which outlines our methodology for flood prediction is presented in fig 4 below 3 results 3 1 satellite and reanalysis climate datasets validation 1991 2020 the robust empirical quantiles rquant were used to reduce biases of satellite and reanalysis climate

shown in table 2 a b and scatter plots of fig 5 a b c the bias of all datasets was corrected by local observation before evaluation as a result the percent of bias pbias computation shows null values for all temperature datasets table 2 a b below summarizes the performance of the satellite reanalysis precipitation and temperature products for the study area 3 2 cmip6 products bias correction and evaluation the robust empirical quantiles rquant quantile mapping bias correction of satellite reanalysis and 24 cmip6 rainfall and temperature products were performed appendix a the nash sutcliff efficiency nse and mean absolute error mae values between the ground observation and the corrected showed that the robust empirical quantiles rquant was able to remove biases in cmip6 models precipitation the performance of 24 cmip6 models under different shared socio economic pathways ssps in simulating future climate variables precipitation and temperature is listed in appendix a based on efficiency criteria found under hydrogof r package after evaluating 24 cmip6 models against area average surface observations and applying the compromise programming cp error minimization method

projection in the rainy season jjas june july august september for the period 2031 2100 under ssp2 4 5 ssp3 3 7 and ssp4 8 5 scenarios showed an increasing trend fig 8a the annual mean time series of five gcms ensemble mean maximum and minimum temperature for ssp2 4 5 ssp3 3 7 and ssp4 8 5 scenarios also showed an increasing trend with the z value 3 4 12 25 and p value of less than 0 0004 which indicates that high significance levels during the twenty first century continuous warming was projected as shown in fig 8 b c for all scenarios of five gcms ensemble mean precipitation and five gcms ensemble mean maximum minimum temperature trend test it was noted that the rainy season jjas precipitation showed significantly increasing trend except for ssp3 3 7 whereas the annual maximum temperature trend was increasing with statistically high significance except in the low forcing scenario ssp2 4 5 as shown in fig 8 a b c 3 3 wflow sbm model calibration and validation using historical reanalysis climate data described under section 3 1 and measured streamflow data the wflow sbm model was calibrated and validated at the sub watershed level for gumera 1991 2018 gilgel abay 1991 2000 ribb 1995 2009 and for the tana watershed 1991 2000 the model has 14 land subsurface and river flow parameters that can be calibrated sensitive parameters were identified in the study areas using scaling point scale pedo transfer functions to seamless large domain parameter estimates for high resolution distributed hydrologic modeling imhoff et al 2020 in the appendix table c2 c5 shows the optimal parameters and their ranges as obtained through the ostrich dds algorithm the most sensitive parameters controlling the outflow were saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat residual water content thetar canopy gap fraction m parameter decay of hydraulic conductivity with depth and water content at saturation thetas and maximum depth of the soil soilthickness the model performance indices for calibration and validation are shown in table 3 below fig 9 a d illustrates the observed and simulated streamflow plots for the calibration and validation period in the lake tana watershed and its three sub watersheds the wflow sbm modelling results demonstrate the modelling approach s promise and indicate that it can be used to predict the runoff and seasonal floods in the basin pbias indicates whether the model over or under estimates streamflow at the lake tana basin outlet the streamflow was underestimated by 13 during calibration and 17 during validation for all tributaries and the lake tana basin outlet peak flow predictions varied above and below gauge likely due to inherent uncertainty in the forcing data over complex topography the model performed well in producing the spatial distribution and magnitude of different hydrological states such as saturated water depth and river runoff as shown in fig 10 a g below 3 4 flood frequency analysis under projected cmip6 scenarios the projected climate static maps and calibrated parameters were used to simulate the future runoff under three scenarios fig 11 shows the simulated discharge at the lake tana basin outlet for three projected scenarios ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 as with the expected precipitation and temperature there is no discernible rise from the baseline period for the near term 2021 2050 runoff simulation maximum annual discharge series were generated from simulated daily streamflow data and fitted to four probability distribution functions to obtain the risk of occurrence of a flood event gumbel and log normal distributions methods passed the goodness of fit test based on the l moment ratio diagram and so were chosen as the optimal method to compute floods in 2 5 10 50 100 200 500 and 1000 return periods as shown in fig 12 the results and developed flood frequency curve are presented in table 4 while the medium to high scenario ssp3 7 0 resulted approximately similar flood discharge the medium forcing and strong forcing resulted higher flood discharge for various return periods on average the medium forcing ssp2 4 5 increased the flood by 4 and the strong forcing increased by 9 from historical flood magnitudes 4 discussions 4 1 cmip6 climate models evaluation and projection in past hydrological research in the upper blue nile catchment conway and hulme 1993 getachew et al 2021 jury 2014 legesse gebre 2015 roth et al 2018 the reanalysis and satellite products were used without validation and systemic bias correction with local observation in this study bias correction was done using robust quantile mapping and validation via 9 stations forming an area averaged observation in a baseline period 1991 2020 results revealed that chirps precipitation and reanalysis temperature data from era5 and cru4 were optimal in line with previous studies in the basin dinku et al 2018 fenta mekonnen and disse 2018 and were therefore used as forcing of wflow sbm here as a result the lake tana basin s climate projections and model choices are more confidently made despite uncertainties amongst model projections of future climate almazroui et al 2017 galavi et al 2019a 2019b galavi et al 2022 galavi and mirzaei 2020 knutti and sedláček 2013 in this study the top five gcms for precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature were chosen for future climate projection and trend analysis after evaluating 24 cmip6 models several previous studies projected the basin s future climate using different generations of models and produced different results alaminie et al 2021b most studies predict a 1 7 oc increase in temperature by the end of the twenty first century the results of this study s maximum and minimum temperature change projections using ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 are similar to those found in alaminie et al 2021 legesse 2016 on the other hand the direction and intensity of precipitation change in lake tana sub basins is ambiguous and dominated by multi year dry and wet spells that overwhelm the background trend notwithstanding various downscaling methods climate models and emission scenarios fenta et al 2018 getachew et al 2021 jury 2014 legesse gebre 2015 4 2 wflow sbm model development and flood prediction the open source wflow pcraster python modelling framework is advantageous over other distributed hydrological models because of its flexibility to enable a dynamic consideration of both infiltration and saturation excess runoff generation mechanism hassaballah et al 2017 m werner et al 2013 in the ethiopian highlands previous research showed that the saturation excesses runoff mechanism generates overland flow during the wet season tilahun et al 2015 zimale et al 2018 saturation occurs when the water table rises and incoming rainfall exceeds outflow across the landscape usually in valleys or adjacent degraded hillsides tilahun et al 2015 the calibrated wflow sbm model demonstrated promising outcomes for all tributaries and the basin itself and shows ability to simulate rainfall runoff in data poor environments the overland flow in the valley bottoms close to the rivers cf fig 10 are similar to easton et al 2010 zimale et al 2018 and consistent with field observations around lake tana moges et al 2017 the modified puls approach mpa method of the lake balance uses an explicit relationship between storage and outflow that makes it possible to lake tana s outlet to the blue nile with good performance improving on earlier investigations setegn et al 2008 that used swat model which simulates hillside runoff as a function of rainfall discharge getachew and manjunatha 2022 wflow sbm performed better because of non infiltrating excess water became runoff regardless of rainfall intensity dagnew et al 2015 in addition most research using swat dile et al 2013 easton et al 2010 setegn et al 2008 van griensven et al 2012 that conducted simulations at subbasin level found model deficiencies from poorly measured streamflow and unknown abstraction of water from the lake for irrigation and hydropower purposes in terms of simulating runoff and flood events 1991 1998 2006 2017 the wflow sbm distributed hydrological model in the blue nile basin showed that the locations of overland runoff areas correspond well with field observations likely because increased spatial resolution better characterization of the drainage network better delineation of the basin and its sub basins and more accurate parameterization of soil and land cover the wflow sbm discharge and flood estimates improved on previous studies using the swat model setegn et al 2008 the projected maximum annual discharge under different climate scenarios gave probability distribution functions to obtain the risk of occurrence of a flood event which point to climate adaptation and mitigation strategies the optimal pdf were gumbel and lognormal comparable to fekadu et al 2017 ukumo et al 2022 whose distributions passed the goodness of fit test for three future scenarios further studies within the tana basin over longer time periods will be important for a comprehensive evaluation of the model to reveal the basin s hydro meteorological temporal and spatial variability however this research serves as an introduction to the added value of wflow sbm hydrological models and climate forcing products for estimating water resources and flood events within a poorly gauged river basin 4 3 conclusion in this study wflow pcraster python hydrological modelling framework with high resolution cmip6 gcm datasets were used to simulate discharge and maximum annual flood in the lake tana basin the wflow sbm calibration and validation results demonstrated that the modelling approach reasonably identified overland runoff areas in lake tana basin moreover it simulated peak flood events in the three tributaries the coupling of this model with climate model scenarios of cmip6 resulted a forecasting maximum annual discharge in the basin that helps decision makers to plan for adaptation and mitigation in general this study showed that wflow sbm can be used to compute rainfall runoff simulation in data poor environments this study serves therefore as a major step towards the development and implementation of a climate model product driven hydrological model to assess flood risks around lake tana basin under a globally warmed future however uncertainty analysis aggregated with proper choice of gcms emission scenarios downscaling techniques and hydrological

7725,study region tana basin is the origin of the blue nile basin located in ethiopia the lake tana s mean annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm yr and its outflow drains an area of about 15 096 km2 there is limited effort to apply nested hydrological models for flood prediction due to being poorly gauged for validation study focus the objective of this study is to show how climate simulations can be used to generate reliable local predictions of flood and runoff for the blue nile in the ethiopian highlands in this study outputs from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 were used to initialize a nested hydrological model to reveal long term trends of runoff in flood prone areas of the lake tana basin ethiopia available satellite and reanalysis datasets were used for selection of cmip6 products and the five models with best validation were used to force a nested hydrological model known as wflow sbm a model independent multi algorithm optimization estimation tool was implemented for calibration of wflow with insitu observations new hydrological insights for the region in terms of simulating runoff and flood events application of wflow sbm to

areas and dissemination of information on the inundation areas to the disaster risk managers and the general public are essential to reduce losses in the lake tana basin it is crucial to develop appropriate climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to properly deal with future flood hazards in flood prone areas of the ethiopian highlands this strategy should make use of recent cmip6

eastern escarpment whose orographic mean annual precipitation is 1400 mm yr according to gauge data tibebe et al 2019 the climate of lake tana basin is tropical highland monsoon with a rainy season locally known as kiremt june september and a dry season october march the temperature shows small seasonal and large diurnal variability and mean annual temperature is 20 oc tibebe et al 2019 more than 40 small rivers and streams with a total mean annual inflow of 158 cumecs reach lake tana wubneh et al 2021 the only surface outflow is the blue nile abbay river with an annual flow of 3050 cumecs at bahir dar gauge station 37 36 e and 11 62 n four major tributaries gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech contribute more than 93 of the inflow to lake tana fenta et al 2018 setegn et al 2008 gumara gilgel abay and ribb sub catchments cover an area of 1279 km2 1656 km2 and 678 15 km2 respectively these three sub catchments are the focus of this study due to data availability 2 2 methods 2

physical parameters maps and spatially distributed forcing time series data such as precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration historical forcing and streamflow data are required to calibrate and validate the model 2 2 1 1 static maps the geophysical static maps provide information about morphological physical soil and land use properties for each grid of the computational domain

interpolated into a gridded product with a resolution of 200 m 2 2 2 cmip6 products bias correction and evaluation in this study the well known climdown climdown a t werner and cannon 2016 r package with bias correction constructed analogues with quantile mapping reordering bccaq was employed to downscale cmip6 products climdown is widely applied for downscaling global climate model gcm output to a fine spatial resolution bccaq is a hybrid downscaling method that combines outputs from climate analogues ca and quantile mapping at the fine scale resolution gudmundsson et al 2012 maurer and pierce 2014 satellite and reanalysis datasets chirps tamsat gpcc merra2 cru ts4 05 ecmwf era5 gpcp and ncep were validated with local surface observations using statistical error metrics such as the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 percent of bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse these statistical measures determine different aspects of the data s accuracy for the purpose of cmip6 model validation and selection for climate projections in the lake tana basin global climate model gcms simulations commonly exhibit systematic biases in precipitation and temperature thus gcms needs to be post processed to produce reliable estimators of local scale climate in this study for precipitation and temperature bias correction non parametric reboot quantile mapping method rqunt was applied the suitability of rqunt qm method was checked using nash sutcliff efficiency nse and mean absolute error mae statistical measures of model climatology 1991 2020 before evaluating precipitation and temperature for the 24 cmip6 models biases were corrected over the basin using the rqunt method in the r software package qmap developed by the norwegian meteorological institute gudmundsson et al 2012 the skill of the 24 bias corrected cmip6 models over the basin against the reanalysis and observations were evaluated through eight error metrics on r hydrogof package in addition to these error metrics a taylor diagram was used to graphically describe how closely the patterns match ground observations taylor 2001 it considers three error metrics including correlation coefficient centered unbiased rmse and standard deviation in a single diagram to describe the temporal performance of climate models against local observation and reanalysis taylor 2001 finally from these bias corrected cmip6 models the best performing models were selected for future climate projection the compromise programming cp error minimization method was applied

2061 2090 future climate projections the significance of temperature and precipitation trends were then examined for period from 2021 to 2100 using the mann kendall mk trend test method mann 1945 sheng et al 2002 yue et al 2002 the z value was used to detect whether a statistically significant trend existed a growing trend in the time series is shown by a positive z value whereas a falling trend is indicated by a negative z value in this study significance p value thresholds for high 0 01 medium 0 05 and low 0 1 were applied 2 2 4 development of the hydrological model to perform past current and future hydrological analysis a distributed hydrological model based on the wflow pcraster python framework was developed using the wflow model platform bouaziz et al 2018 the wflow is a state of the art open source spatially distributed hydrological model developed by the deltares openstreams project http www openstreams nl the model is derived from the cqflow model which simulates catchment runoff in both sparse and ample data environments schellekens 2022 wflow sbm model is based on topog hydrological tool described in vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 in this study wflow sbm was chosen for its improved consideration of both infiltration and saturation excess runoff generation processes in the ethiopian highlands previous research has demonstrated that saturation excess runoff dominates in the sub humid part of the region during the monsoonal period as distinct from saturated areas in the valley bottom moges et al 2017 tilahun et al 2015 and degraded areas could be considered as infiltration excess fig 3 shows a schematized representation of wflow sbm the hydrological processes in the wflow sbm model are represented by three main routines the gash model gash et al 1995 is used to calculate interceptions which use pet to drive actual evapotranspiration based on soil water content and land cover types the topog sbm calculates the soil water storage sws processes that generate runoff vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 topog sbm was specifically designed to simulate fast runoff processes however wflow sbm has been significantly improved to make it more widely applicable schellekens et al 2011 kinematic routing is used to simulate river drainage and overland flows to estimate the average rainfall and transpiration from the wet canopy rainfall and evaporation in the saturated canopy are calculated for each event the remaining water infiltrates into the soil and when the rain falls on partially saturated soil it directly contributes to surface runoff at the same time evapotranspiration removes some of the soil water infiltrated water is exchanged between the soil s unsaturated u and saturated s stores fig 3 in wflow sbm the soil is considered as a simple bucket model with exponential decay of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat with depth schellekens et al 2011 a topographic wetness index is used to identify and scale the soil depth of the various land cover types in the model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 the runoff is calculated for each grid cell with the whole depth of the cell divided into saturated and unsaturated zones as the model is fully distributed fig 3 the model uses darcy s equation to simulate lateral flow from the saturated zone the total runoff from a given catchment is the sum of surface runoff and lateral flow discharged from the river network after routing according to slopes in the high resolution dem lake tana is considered in wflow sbm using a mass balance modified puls approach that uses an explicit relationship between storage and outflow to quantify water balance this makes it possible to calibrate lake tana s outlet which wasn t done in earlier investigations setegn et al 2008

spatial datasets that provide information on soil properties soil depth rooting depth and etc imhoff et al 2020 developed a method for parameterizing the model for any basin in the world using regionalization methods based on pedo transfer functions and upscaling techniques from the literature here in this study the model was run with chirps and pet calculated from era5 and cfsr reanalysis wflow sbm performance was evaluated for the baseline period 1991 2020 against available daily discharge measurements at the gumera gilgel abay ribb and the basin outlets 2 2 5 model calibration and validation calibrating a spatially distributed model assigns different parameter values to different grid cells which poses a risk of artificial parameterization and has computational demands at fine resolutions that inhibits model applications to large basins beven 2006 here the ostrich calibration toolkit was automated to calibrate the wflow sbm simulations ostrich has been created as a model independent multi algorithm optimization and parameter estimation program that allows researchers to automate the processes of model calibration and design optimization ostrich can be configured to work with any modeling program that uses text based input and output file formats further details can be found on the ostrich website http www civil uwaterloo ca lsmatott ostrich ostrichmain html in this study dds dynamically dimensioned search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 and statistical error metrics pbias and nse were used to verify whether the predicted and observed streamflow agreed daily river discharges at three tributaries and the lake tana basin outlet gumera gilgel abay ribb and abbay gauging stations were used for model calibration and validation the wflow sbm model provides an option to consider the lake tana in the simulation period even with abstraction of water from the lake for irrigation and hydropower purposes after 2003 that is undocumented 2 2 6 flood prediction under cmip6 model scenarios to investigate the possible impacts of climate change on the flood risk targeted cmip6 scenarios were chosen from medium range to high forcing scenarios model outputs for the ssp245 medium forcing ssp370 medium to high forcing and ssp585 strong forcing pathway were taken from 5 ensemble means of best performing models described in section 2 4 for flood frequency analysis the wflow sbm model for the lake tana basin was run for a reference period from 1991 2020 and for the three climate projections scenarios of the near term 2021 2050 projection there is currently no universally acceptable flood frequency analysis method rather ranges of models are taken into consideration ukumo et al 2022 to understand the effects of climate change on extreme river discharges an r script for probability distribution methods gumbel evi log normal generalized pareto and generalized logistics were developed based on the l moment ratio diagram gumbel and log normal distribution methods were chosen to compute the flood magnitudes for 2 5 10 50 100 200 500 and 1000 return periods the flowchart which outlines our methodology for flood prediction is presented

projection in the rainy season jjas june july august september for the period 2031 2100 under ssp2 4 5 ssp3 3 7 and ssp4 8 5 scenarios showed an increasing trend fig 8a the annual mean time series of five gcms ensemble mean maximum and minimum temperature for ssp2 4 5 ssp3 3 7 and ssp4 8 5 scenarios also showed an increasing trend with the z value 3 4 12 25 and p value of less than 0 0004 which indicates that high significance levels during the twenty first century continuous warming was projected as shown in fig 8 b c for all scenarios of five gcms ensemble mean precipitation and five gcms ensemble mean maximum minimum temperature trend test it was noted that the rainy season jjas precipitation showed significantly increasing trend except for ssp3 3 7 whereas the annual maximum

historical reanalysis climate data described under section 3 1 and measured streamflow data the wflow sbm model was calibrated and validated at the sub watershed level for gumera 1991 2018 gilgel abay 1991 2000 ribb 1995 2009 and for the tana watershed 1991 2000 the model has 14 land subsurface and river flow parameters that can be calibrated sensitive parameters were identified in the study areas using scaling point scale pedo transfer functions to seamless large domain parameter estimates for high resolution distributed hydrologic modeling imhoff et al 2020 in the appendix table c2 c5 shows the optimal parameters and their ranges as obtained through the ostrich dds algorithm the most sensitive parameters controlling the outflow were saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat residual water content thetar canopy gap fraction m parameter decay of hydraulic conductivity with depth and water content at saturation thetas and maximum depth of the soil soilthickness the model performance indices for calibration and validation are shown in table 3 below fig 9 a d illustrates the observed and simulated streamflow plots for the calibration and validation period in the lake tana watershed and its three sub watersheds the wflow sbm modelling results demonstrate the modelling approach s promise and indicate that it can be used to predict the runoff and seasonal floods in the basin pbias indicates whether the model over or under estimates streamflow at the lake tana basin outlet the streamflow was underestimated by 13 during calibration and 17 during validation for all tributaries and the lake tana basin outlet peak flow predictions varied above and below gauge likely due to inherent uncertainty in the forcing data over complex topography the model performed well in producing the spatial distribution and magnitude of different hydrological states such as saturated water depth and river runoff as shown in fig 10 a g below 3 4 flood frequency analysis under projected cmip6 scenarios the projected climate static maps and calibrated parameters were used to simulate the future runoff under three scenarios fig 11 shows the simulated discharge at the lake tana basin outlet for three projected scenarios ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 as with the expected precipitation and temperature there is no discernible rise from the baseline period for the near term 2021 2050 runoff simulation maximum annual discharge series were generated from simulated daily streamflow data and fitted to four probability distribution functions to obtain the risk of occurrence of a flood event gumbel and log normal distributions methods passed the goodness of fit test based on the l moment ratio diagram and so were chosen as the optimal method to compute floods in 2 5 10 50 100 200 500 and 1000 return periods as shown in fig 12 the results and developed flood frequency curve are presented in table 4 while the medium to high scenario ssp3 7 0 resulted approximately similar flood discharge the medium forcing and strong forcing resulted higher flood discharge for various return periods on average the medium forcing ssp2 4 5 increased the flood by 4 and the strong forcing increased by 9 from historical flood magnitudes 4 discussions 4 1 cmip6 climate models evaluation and projection in past hydrological research in the upper blue nile catchment conway and hulme 1993 getachew et al 2021 jury 2014 legesse gebre 2015 roth et al 2018 the reanalysis and satellite products were used without validation and systemic bias correction with local observation in this study bias correction was done using robust quantile mapping and validation via 9 stations forming an area averaged observation in a baseline period 1991 2020 results revealed that chirps precipitation and reanalysis temperature data from era5 and cru4 were optimal in line with previous studies in the basin dinku et al 2018 fenta mekonnen and disse 2018 and were therefore used as forcing of wflow sbm here as a result the lake tana basin s climate projections and model choices are more confidently made despite uncertainties amongst model projections of future climate almazroui et al 2017 galavi et

climate projection and trend analysis after evaluating 24 cmip6 models several previous studies projected the basin s future climate using different generations of models and produced different results alaminie et al 2021b most studies predict a 1 7 oc increase in temperature by the end of the twenty first century the results of this study s maximum and minimum temperature change projections using ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 are similar to those found in alaminie et al 2021 legesse 2016 on the other hand the direction and intensity of precipitation change in lake tana sub basins is ambiguous

highlands previous research showed that the saturation excesses runoff mechanism generates overland flow during the wet season tilahun et al 2015 zimale et al 2018 saturation occurs when the water table rises and incoming rainfall exceeds outflow across the landscape usually in valleys or adjacent degraded hillsides tilahun et al 2015 the calibrated wflow sbm model demonstrated promising outcomes for all tributaries and the basin itself and shows ability to simulate rainfall runoff in data poor environments the overland flow in the valley bottoms close to the rivers cf fig 10 are similar to easton et al 2010 zimale et al 2018 and consistent with field observations around lake tana moges et al 2017 the modified puls approach mpa method of the lake balance uses an explicit relationship between storage and outflow that makes it possible to lake tana s outlet to the blue nile with good performance improving on earlier investigations setegn et al 2008 that used swat model which simulates hillside runoff as a function of rainfall discharge getachew and manjunatha 2022 wflow sbm performed better because of non infiltrating excess water became runoff regardless of rainfall intensity dagnew et al 2015 in addition most research using swat dile et al 2013 easton et al 2010 setegn et al 2008 van griensven et al 2012 that conducted simulations at subbasin level found model deficiencies from poorly measured streamflow and unknown abstraction of water from the lake for irrigation and hydropower purposes in terms of simulating runoff and flood events 1991 1998 2006 2017 the wflow sbm distributed hydrological model in the blue nile basin showed that the locations of overland runoff areas correspond well with field observations likely because increased spatial resolution better characterization of the drainage network better delineation of the basin and its sub basins and more accurate parameterization of soil and land cover the wflow sbm discharge and flood estimates improved on previous studies using the swat model setegn et al 2008 the projected maximum annual discharge under different climate scenarios gave probability distribution functions to obtain the risk of occurrence of a flood event which point to climate adaptation and mitigation strategies the optimal pdf were gumbel and lognormal comparable to fekadu et al 2017 ukumo et al 2022 whose distributions passed the goodness of fit test for three future scenarios further studies within the tana basin over longer time periods will be important for a comprehensive evaluation of the model to reveal the basin s hydro meteorological temporal and spatial variability however this research serves as an introduction to the added value of wflow sbm hydrological models and climate forcing products for estimating water resources and flood events within a poorly gauged river basin 4 3 conclusion in this study wflow pcraster python hydrological modelling framework with high resolution cmip6 gcm datasets were used to simulate discharge and maximum annual flood in the lake tana basin the wflow sbm calibration and validation results demonstrated that the modelling approach reasonably identified overland runoff areas in lake tana basin moreover it simulated peak flood events in the three tributaries the coupling of this model with climate model scenarios of cmip6 resulted a forecasting maximum annual discharge in the basin that helps decision makers to plan for adaptation and mitigation in general this study showed that wflow sbm can be used to compute rainfall runoff simulation in data poor environments this study serves therefore as a major step towards the development and implementation of a climate model product driven hydrological model to assess flood risks around lake tana basin under a globally warmed future however uncertainty analysis aggregated with proper choice of gcms emission scenarios downscaling techniques and hydrological modeling parameters and techniques was not addressed in this study as uncertainty contribution of each source can vary at different temporal and spatial scales integrated uncertainty analysis and exploring the contribution of uncertainty sources could be potential future research area in local scale impact studies credit authorship contribution statement addis a alaminie conceptualization

poyet 1990 rahmati et al 2015 have been implemented successfully the guder watershed is a portion of the ubn river basin and is generally situated in western oromia it is among the least studied subbasins haregeweyn et al 2017 roth et al 2018 tessema and simane 2019 and this is the first time gis and remote sensing techniques have been used to investigate groundwater potential zones the river s basin is characterized by a high relief orographic rain landscape the guder river is among the major perennial tributaries of ethiopia s abay basin the primary goal of this research is to use gis and rs techniques to develop a groundwater zonation of the guder subbasin of the ubn river basin in the oromia region assessing and evaluating the gwpz must be vital for the government policymakers and decision makers in identifying appropriate sites and positions for borehole construction for water use and long term groundwater management the developed map may be used to appraise the geospatial factors that govern groundwater accumulation such as the relationship between geomorphology geology lithology land use drainage density lineaments soil terrain rainfall and groundwater potentiality such a study has not previously been reported in this subbasin thus this study should demonstrate an appropriate technique for rapidly assessing groundwater potential zones the accuracy evaluations such as the correlation coefficient and kappa statistics produced good results the method is also an efficient and cost effective approach to determining groundwater potential zones despite this most scholars avoid the validation section because in the absence of field data the study was established with more scientific meaning through validation as a result regions of high medium low and so on are marked on the map to inform water users and policymakers about sustainable use and groundwater resources management the study would also provide information for stakeholders the kebele administration office woreda and society to better understand areas with high and low groundwater levels in order to better manage these valuable resources the study s findings will aid management

from 6 5 c to 30 c the upper portion of the river basin obtains surface runoff from fetto bello and huluka melke and indies the middle part of the watershed collects surface runoff from dabis and in the dawn stream part gudar xiqqaa the smaller guder and gudar guddaa the bigger guder contribute to the main guder river fentaw 2018 muleta and biru 2019 nadew et al 2019 the catchment that comprises the guder watershed drains to the blue nile ethiopia s major and most important river in terms of volume of water and river size muleta and biru 2019 based on a land survey conducted by owwdse in ethiopia in 2016 the main soil types of the guder catchment are cambisols nitisols leptosols vertisols luvisols and andosols fig a1 b in decreasing order of per cent area coverage the first three soil types account for approximately 75 of the study area s soil type some of the limiting factors that reduce agricultural productivity are soil acidity depth and permeability subash et al 2017 the

delineated map was reclassified into zones ranging from very poor to very good groundwater potential the delineated groundwater potential zones were validated using borehole and well data collected in the field 3 factors influencing groundwater recharge potential preparation geospatial database groundwater occurrence and movement are influenced by geomorphology geology drainage and structure while replenishment is further influenced by land use infiltration rate and rainfall n das and goswami 2013 fagbohun 2018 mahmoud and alazba 2016 phukon et al 2012 selvam et al 2014 2015 2016a 2016b signatures et al 2020 the number of thematic layers used varied by the researcher as it could be influenced by data availability ten thematic layers were used in the whole study to investigate and assess the guder subbasin groundwater potential zone analysis including geomorphology soil type lithology soil texture geology a digital elevation model slope land use cover soil depth drainage density lineament and rainfall the relationships between all of these influencing factors are weighted based on previous research conducted in various watersheds around the world their influence on gwpz and expert judgment the sum of all the weights of a factor in the potential zone is its representative weight a factor with a higher weight has a greater impact whereas a factor with a lower weight has a smaller impact on the potential interrelationship of groundwater in the arcgis environment weighted overlay analysis is used to compute the integration of these factors with their potential weights the geomorphology provides information on the description and genesis of its landforms which are influenced by the structural evolution of geological formations kattimani et al 2018 p kumar et al 2016 in another sense the area depicts both its erosional and depositional landforms geomorphology was given the most weight among the ten different thematic layers because it is so important in groundwater movement and storage in any location kattimani et al 2018 p kumar et al 2016 the owwdse geomorphology gis data was given total and individual weights based on its impact on the occurrence of groundwater the arcgis 10 1 attribute table was used to arrange the values geomorphological features in the study area include steep side slopes undulating plains very steep side slopes low plateaus rolling hills rolling plateaus low relief hills vents and cone remnants escapements basins gently inclined foot slopes and colluvial margins the steep side slope takes up roughly 33 2 of the study area landforms such as very steep sides lopes rolling hills and rolling plateaus cover 14 3 13 0 and 11 5 of the area respectively the pie chart displayed those covers with more than 0 5 fig a1 a and fig a2 most of guduru district the eastern ginde beret and part of jeldu are dominated by ow plateaus and undulating plains excluding the northern and southern portions of northern midakegni ambo woreda the eastern parts of elifata and ginde beret the south western parts of midakegn gudurucheliya and jima rare all woredas have very steep side slopes rolling hills dominate the subbasin s middle periphery while rolling plateaus dominate the subbasin s southern and south eastern parts including jima rare cheliya toke kutaye dandi and the southern part of ambo district geology lithology is the most important factor for groundwater potential occurrence as penetration is primarily determined by the permeability or conductivity level of different rock types bera et al 2020 b das et al 2019 s das et al 2017 morsy and othman 2021 basalt is the dominant rock type in the study area according to gis data collected from owwdse but some small alluvium and sandstones can be found in the southern part and eastern parts of the guder subbasin respectively fig a3 the major geological covers in the subbasin were basalt and tuff which accounted for 3435 51 square kilometers 51 42 or roughly half of the study area as illustrated in fig a1 f this geological type tends to dominate the study area s southern middle and upper parts limestones granites and gneiss cover about 1878 697 28 0 of the land 1350 42 20 21 and 1350 42 20 21 square kilometers respectively it heavily covers the study area s middle periphery fig a1 f the geological data collected from owwdse was weighted in the arcgis 10 1 attribute table and prepared for gwpz delineation because ethiopia receives orographic rainfall indeje et al 2001 van den hende et al 2021 altitude or elevation can have a significant impact on the study area s groundwater potential elevation may be related to precipitation its magnitude and frequency and thus groundwater recharge k g berhanu and hatiye 2020 as a result higher elevations are associated with more groundwater recharge and ensure groundwater availability in low lying areas of the watershed as a result it is commonly assumed that high elevation areas favor recharge in deep settled confined aquifers located at low elevations or in low land areas arshad et al 2020 k g berhanu and hatiye 2020 todd and mays 2005 in other words highland areas can contribute some recharge via springs and play an important role in groundwater occurrence because water stores better at lower elevations than at higher elevations the low elevation of the guder river basin favors more groundwater potential hence the higher the elevation above sea level the less groundwater potential there is and vice versa the subbasin is relatively high in the south and along the boundary and lower in the midst and north where it river joins the abay river fig a4 as a result the minimum and maximum elevations of the guder river basin were determined to be 1144 m and 3288 m above sea level respectively the aster dem was clipped and projected which was originally retrieved from http www gdem aster ersdac or jp search jsp and appropriate weighting was assigned based on its influence on groundwater potentiality all of this was completed in arcgis 10 1 and the shapefile was prepared for groundwater potential delineation land use and land cover are important factors in any watershed runoff a basin s infiltration and groundwater recharge capacity guru et al 2017 and they also provide soil information such as soil moisture content groundwater and surface water and an indicator of groundwater potential ahmad et al 2020 the owwdse of ethiopia provided the classified gis data of land use and cover according to the data collected cultivated land with an aerial extent of 2037 0 km2 30 26 dominated the land cover of the guder basin followed by moderately cultivated land with an aerial extent of 1196 8 km2 17 78 dense bush land with an aerial extent of 1062 0 km2 15

covers 172 8 km2 2 57 fig a1 d riverine forests water bodies wetlands agriculture and cultivated land are thought to be the most important landcover classes for groundwater occurrence while urban land use or settlement and bushland are believed to be less important fig a5 and table 3 in preparation for groundwater potential delineation the land use cover was clipped projected and weighted in arcgis 10 1 s attribute table soil texture generally influences soil moisture content infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity soil permeability soil grain size and soil specific composition all of which have an impact on recharge potentiality clay has a lower infiltration capacity than loam and sandy loam as a result the groundwater potential of sandy loam and loam soil textures is greater than that of clayey soil textures according to an addis ababa university study the soil in the study area is classified into three types loam clay loam and sandy loam b berhanu et al 2013 more than half of the basin is covered by loam 3600 10km2 which is found along the middle and margin of the study area with sandy loam 1963 83 km2 29 covering the watershed s middle edge fig a1 e clay covers 1168 61 km2 17 of the area in the southern and middle parts of ambo district the middle and northern parts of tikur enchini the middle and northern parts of midakegn and elifata and the middle and northern parts of jeldu district fig a6 sandy loam soils have a high infiltration rate and high groundwater potential whereas clay soils have a low infiltration rate and low groundwater potential the soil texture gis data like other thematic layers was projected to a similar projection clipped to the study area and provided weightage before it was ready for delineating gwpzs these tasks were completed with the help of arcgis 10 1 software soil type conductivity and permeability all influence soil moisture capacity p kumar et al 2016 the study s soil type was also gathered from owwdse projected to similar projections and clipped to the study area extent in arcgis 10 1 this thematic layer received individual weighting as well and is just ready for gwpz delineation according to the data collected for the study fig a7 cambisols cover approximately one third of the study area 2073 9 square kilometers followed by nitisols 1660 3 kilometers leptosols 1456 6 square kilometers vertisols 872 8 square

elevation in a given area which influences runoff as well kattimani et al 2018 u kumar et al 2013 rafati and nikeghbal 2017 rajasekhar et al 2019 the slope describes the variation in altitude or elevation in a given area which influences runoff as well kattimani et al 2018 u kumar et al 2013 rafati and nikeghbal 2017 rajasekhar et al 2019 because infiltration is inversely proportional to land steepness the slope is an important parameter in groundwater investigation the gentler the slopes the slower the surface water flow and the more groundwater percolates into the ground on the contrary the steeper the slope the greater the surface runoff reducing groundwater percolation a slope map of the area under investigation was created using the aster dem satellite digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m using arcgis spatial analyst tools the slope was prepared and reclassified into five classes the weight in the attribute table was assigned based on its impact on the potential occurrence of groundwater the study area s slope ranges from 0 to 21 3 per cent fig a8 with gentle slopes in the northern and southern parts of the guder watershed in the arcgis spatial analyst tool the slopes are classified into five classes based on natural breaks gentle slopes cover approximately 40 of the study area fig a1 g depicts the slopes of 0 3 area 2679 2 km2 39 5 3 5 area

line tool in pci geomatica 2017 software and editing and watershed classification was completed in the arcgis spatial analyst tool environment high lineament densities favor groundwater potential over low lineament densities as a result high value weights are assigned to high density lineaments and low value weights to low density lineaments following the completion of the map it was reclassified into five categories very low 0 0 1945 km km2 very poor groundwater potential low 0 1945 0 389 km km2 poor groundwater potential medium 0 389 0 5836 km km2 intermediate groundwater potential and high

drainage density is calculated by dividing the total length of all streams or rivers in a drainage basin by the drainage basin s total area ajay kumar et al 2020 harini et al 2018 because drainage density is an inverse function of permeability it is an important parameter in determining the groundwater potential zone high drainage density values favor runoff and as a result indicate a low groundwater potential zone ajay kumar et al 2020 harini et al 2018 the drainage density was calculated using arcgis 10 1 s spatial analyst tool the dem was delineated under hydrology using the spatial analyst tool followed by density preparation and reclassification according to the drainage density thematic layer the drainage density value ranged from 0 to 1 80 km km2 fig 4 these are reclassified into five classes based on their effect on groundwater occurrence for analysis 0 0 35 very low very good 0 35 0 72 low good 0 72 1 07 medium intermediate 1 07 1 43 high poor and 1 43 1 80 very high very poor table 3 rainfall is important in the hydrologic cycle because it controls groundwater potential rainfall is the major source of surface and groundwater in this area and therefore the intensity of rainfall and its spatial distribution strongly control the recharge volume of the basin as stated by many scholars ahmad et al 2020 barlow and clarke 2017 k g berhanu and hatiye 2020 t kumar et al 2014 nadew et al 2019 pal et al 2020 rafati and nikeghbal 2017 groundwater recharge would be most likely in areas with high rainfall and least likely in areas with low rainfall k g berhanu and hatiye 2020 t kumar et al 2014 the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm annual rainfall is then reclassified in the arcgis spatial analyst tool the high resolution data downloaded from trmm was clipped to the study area extent projected converted from raster to point using the conversion tool and interpolated using the spatial analyst tool to simplify the analysis of groundwater potential annual rainfall was collected in millimeters and reclassified into five classes 912 1252 mm very poor 1253 1592 mm poor 1593 1932 mm intermediate 1933 2272 mm good 2273 2612 mm very good fig 5 table 3 3 1 normalized weights for thematic layers for the decision guidelines to evaluate the input layers for delineating the groundwater zone using arcgis the analytical hierarchy process ahp technique was carefully chosen the weights assigned to various thematic maps and their features were determined using field experience and expert judgment which was normalized using saaty s ahp method goepel 2013 a kumar and krishna 2018 during the analytic hierarchy process each pair of factors in a specific cluster is evaluated in terms of their relative importance one at a time a pairwise comparison matrix is developed in which aii 1 and aij 1 ai the right eigenvector which is calculated from the maximum absolute eigenvalue max 1 2 is used to calculate the weightage factor of the ranking criteria and the resulting sub criteria the eigenvector technique was used to compute the principal eigenvalue λ a kumar and krishna 2018 1 λ max wi n 1 n aw i wi 2 aw a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a

should be evaluated in this study using the consistency index ci goepel 2013 şener et al 2011 which is defined as follows 3 ci λ max n n 1 where ci is the consistency index λmax is the judgment matrix

determined using eq 4 4 cr ci rci the random consistency index is abbreviated as rci saaty s 1 9 scale was used to calculate rci the consistency ratio value cr for consistent weights should be less than 0 1 indicating the overall cohesiveness of the pairwise comparison matrix a kumar and krishna 2018 şener et al 2011 otherwise the corresponding weightage must be reconsidered to avoid inconsistency following that groundwater potential zones were defined the groundwater potential index gwpi is a dimensionless quantity that is used to estimate the gwpzs in the study area the weighted

is the rank value of each class in relation to the f layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of classes in the thematic layer 3 2 validation of the result the groundwater potential map is typically validated with well discharge or well yield data goepel 2013 a kumar and krishna 2018 şener et al 2011 but gwpzs are delineated without validation when well yield data is unavailable p kumar et al 2016 mahmoud and alazba 2016 phukon et al 2012 selvam et al 2015 2016a 2016b in this study discharge data were collected only along the main road that passes through ginchi and ambo towns 4 results and discussion table 2 shows the weightage assigned to the various groundwater influencing factors or thematic layers as well as estimated values of the normalized weightage using ahp and eigenvector techniques the consistency index ci and consistency ratio cr coefficient values in this study were 0 06 and 0 017 respectively because ten criteria were used in this study rci10 1 49 the study area s lithology geology geomorphology land use land cover slope drainage density lineament density soil type soil texture rainfall distribution and elevation shapefile were overlaid in arcgis software to determine the groundwater potential zones the analytical hierarchy procedure ahp was used in the arcgis version 10 1 environment to provide weightage ranking and reclassify these maps and the final groundwater thematic map was created by overlaying all maps a rating task was created for each class in a thematic layer based on their relative importance for groundwater potential table 3 geomorphology 25 land use 15 slope 12 lithology geology 10 soil type 7 soil texture 6 drainage density 7 slope rainfall 8 elevation and lineament density were both 5 based on weighted values based on their overall percentage weight the delineated groundwater potential zones gwpzs were reclassified into five categories very poor poor moderate good and very good groundwater potentiality table 4 and fig 6 fig 6 depicts the study area s groundwater potentiality map the extremely high gwpzs are found in the north guder subbasin beginning at the study area s longitude center and prolonged southern northwestern and southwesterly because of the presence of steep side slopes escapements rock surfaces and hills groundwater potentiality has ranged from very low to low at various distances from the center the research showed that geomorphology has a significant impact on groundwater potential when compared to other factors furthermore slope steepness geology formation type high steepness areas and limestone type of lithological formation have all been identified in areas where groundwater potential is extremely low 4 1 validation the available well discharge data were provided by ethiopia s ministry of water irrigation and energy about thirteen 13 gwpzs were discovered to validate the delineated gwpz the studies were found along the main road that goes through asgori ambo guder and babich the observed well data were highlighted in pink in fig 7 with a strong correlation coefficient the study was certain r2 schmidt and osebold 2017 selvanathan and jayabalan 2020 zamani et al 2020 and kappa statistics c t chen et al 2015 okwuashi et al 2012 rafieyan 2016 sim and wright 2005 the coefficient of correlation became 0 73 fig 7 and the mean kappa statistics calculated value was 77 as shown in table 4 indeed the study was confirmed to have a high r2 and there was significant agreement between the field observed and estimated gwpz based on the kappa statistics obtained range value table 5 5 conclusion this study uses gis and rs techniques to assess groundwater potential zones gwpzs in ethiopia s upper blue nile basin western oromia region with a case study of the guder subbasin thematic layers that significantly influence gwpzs such as geomorphology land use cover lithology geology lineament density slope soil properties soil texture soil type drainage density rainfall and elevation maps were prepared using available data such as conventional data and satellite images and individual weights were assigned along with sub class categorizations based merely on literature and expert decision the study assessment revealed that approximately 33 6 2315 km2 of the area of research has good and very good groundwater potentiality in equal magnitude whereas 22 9 1578 8 km2 20 2 1388 7 km2 and 23 3 1601 0 km2 fall under good moderate and poor respectively of the delineated total area of the guder sub basin 6883 5 km2 zones with high to extremely high gwpzs found in the are generally located in the center north eastern and southern parts of the study area whereas low potential zones are observed in the study region s west and very low to low gwpzs have been observed in the watershed s middle periphery mountainous area the best zone indicates the most adequate region for the occurrence of groundwater whereas a low zone represents the least suitable region for groundwater occurrence poor gwpzs may have been demonstrated in areas characterized by hills steep side slopes and escapements slopy surfaces and rock surfaces in comparison to other factors geomorphology has a significant impact on groundwater potential furthermore the steepness of slope and formation type geology indeed play an important role as areas with steep slopes and limestone lithological compositions have been related to areas with very low groundwater occurrence the study then uses observed well discharge data to validate the groundwater potential zone results with a strong correlation coefficient value of 0 73 and a kappa statistic value of 77 the study is certain this study also provides stakeholders kebele administration office woreda and society with cost effective time saving and rapid appraisal of groundwater resources evidence to better understand areas with high and low groundwater for easier

poyet 1990 rahmati et al 2015 have been implemented successfully the guder watershed is a portion of the ubn river basin and is generally situated in western oromia it is among the least studied subbasins haregeweyn et al 2017 roth et al 2018 tessema and simane 2019 and this is the first time gis and remote sensing techniques have been used to investigate groundwater potential zones the river s basin is characterized by a high relief orographic rain landscape the guder river is among the major perennial tributaries of ethiopia s abay basin the primary goal of this research is to use gis and rs techniques to develop a groundwater zonation of the guder subbasin of the ubn river basin in the oromia region assessing and evaluating the gwpz must be vital for the government policymakers and decision makers in identifying appropriate sites and positions for borehole construction for water use and long term groundwater management the developed map may be used to appraise the geospatial factors that govern groundwater accumulation such as the relationship between geomorphology geology lithology land use drainage density lineaments soil terrain rainfall and groundwater potentiality such a study has not previously been reported in this subbasin thus this study should demonstrate an appropriate technique for rapidly assessing groundwater potential zones the accuracy evaluations such as the correlation coefficient and kappa statistics produced good results the method is also an efficient and cost effective approach to determining groundwater potential zones despite this most scholars avoid the validation section because in the absence of field data the study was established with more scientific meaning through validation as a result regions of high medium low and so on are marked on the map to inform water users and policymakers about sustainable use and groundwater resources management the study would also provide information for stakeholders the kebele administration office woreda and society to better understand areas with high and low groundwater levels in order to better manage these valuable resources the study s findings will aid management

the dawn stream part gudar xiqqaa the smaller guder and gudar guddaa the bigger guder contribute to the main guder river fentaw 2018 muleta and biru 2019 nadew et al 2019 the catchment that comprises the guder watershed drains to the blue nile ethiopia s major and most important river in terms of volume of water and river size muleta and biru 2019 based on a land survey conducted by owwdse in ethiopia in 2016 the main soil types of the guder catchment are cambisols nitisols leptosols vertisols luvisols and andosols fig a1 b in decreasing order of per cent area coverage the first three soil types account for approximately 75 of the study area s soil type some of the limiting factors that reduce agricultural productivity are soil acidity depth and permeability subash et al 2017 the

the field 3 factors influencing groundwater recharge potential preparation geospatial database groundwater occurrence and movement are influenced by geomorphology geology drainage and structure while replenishment is further influenced by land use infiltration rate and rainfall n das and goswami 2013 fagbohun 2018 mahmoud and alazba 2016 phukon et al 2012 selvam et al 2014 2015 2016a 2016b signatures et al 2020 the number of thematic layers used varied by the researcher as it could be influenced by data availability ten thematic layers were used in the whole study to investigate and assess the guder subbasin groundwater potential zone analysis including geomorphology soil type lithology soil texture geology a digital elevation model slope land use cover soil depth drainage density lineament and rainfall the relationships between all of these influencing factors are weighted based on previous research conducted in various watersheds around the world their influence on gwpz and expert judgment the sum of all the weights of a factor in the potential zone is its representative weight a factor with a higher weight has a greater impact whereas a factor with a lower weight has a smaller impact on the potential interrelationship of groundwater in the arcgis environment weighted overlay analysis is used to compute the integration of these factors with their potential weights the geomorphology provides information on the description and genesis of its landforms which are influenced by the structural evolution of geological formations kattimani et al 2018 p kumar et al 2016 in another sense the area depicts both its erosional and depositional landforms geomorphology was given the most weight among the ten different thematic layers because it is so important in groundwater movement and storage in any location kattimani et al 2018 p kumar et al 2016 the owwdse geomorphology gis data was given total and individual weights based on its impact on the occurrence of groundwater the arcgis 10 1 attribute table was used to arrange the values geomorphological features in the study area include steep side slopes undulating plains very steep side slopes low plateaus rolling hills rolling plateaus low relief hills vents and cone remnants escapements basins gently inclined foot slopes and colluvial margins the steep side slope takes up roughly 33 2 of the study area landforms such as very steep sides lopes rolling hills and rolling plateaus cover 14 3 13 0 and 11 5 of the area respectively the pie chart displayed those covers with more than 0 5 fig a1 a and fig a2 most of guduru district the eastern ginde beret and part of jeldu are dominated by ow plateaus and undulating plains excluding the northern and southern portions of northern midakegni ambo woreda the eastern parts of elifata and ginde beret the south western parts of midakegn gudurucheliya and jima rare all woredas have very steep side slopes rolling hills dominate the subbasin s middle periphery while rolling plateaus dominate the subbasin s southern and south eastern parts including jima rare cheliya toke kutaye dandi and the southern part of ambo district geology lithology is the most important factor for groundwater potential occurrence as penetration is primarily determined by the permeability or conductivity level of different rock types bera et al 2020 b das et al 2019 s das et al 2017 morsy and othman 2021 basalt is the dominant rock type in the study area according to gis data collected from owwdse but some small alluvium and sandstones can be found in the southern part and eastern parts of the guder subbasin respectively fig a3 the major geological covers in the subbasin were basalt and tuff which accounted for 3435 51 square kilometers 51 42 or roughly half of the study area as illustrated in fig a1 f this geological type tends to dominate the study area s southern middle and upper parts limestones granites and gneiss cover about 1878 697 28

arcgis 10 1 attribute table and prepared for gwpz delineation because ethiopia receives orographic rainfall indeje et al 2001 van den hende et al 2021 altitude or elevation can have a significant impact on the study area s groundwater potential elevation may be related to precipitation its magnitude and frequency and thus groundwater recharge k g berhanu and hatiye 2020 as a result higher elevations are associated with more groundwater recharge and ensure groundwater availability in low lying areas of the watershed as a result it is commonly assumed that high elevation areas favor recharge in deep settled confined aquifers located at low elevations or in low land areas arshad et al 2020 k g berhanu and hatiye 2020 todd and mays 2005 in other words highland areas can contribute some recharge via springs and play an important role in groundwater occurrence because water stores better at lower elevations than at higher elevations the low elevation of the guder river basin favors more groundwater potential hence the higher the elevation above sea level the less groundwater potential there is and vice versa the subbasin is relatively high in the south and along the boundary and lower in the midst and north where it river joins the abay river fig a4 as a result the minimum and maximum elevations of the guder river basin were determined to be 1144 m and 3288 m above sea level respectively the aster dem was clipped and projected which was originally retrieved from http www gdem aster ersdac or jp search jsp and appropriate weighting was assigned based on its influence on groundwater potentiality all of this was completed in arcgis 10 1 and the shapefile was prepared for groundwater potential delineation land use and land cover are important factors in any watershed runoff a basin s infiltration and groundwater recharge capacity guru et al 2017 and they also provide soil information such as soil moisture content groundwater and surface water and an indicator of groundwater potential ahmad et al 2020 the owwdse of ethiopia provided the classified gis data of land use and cover according to the data collected cultivated land with an aerial extent of 2037 0 km2 30 26 dominated the land cover of the guder basin followed by moderately cultivated land with an aerial extent of 1196 8 km2 17 78 dense bush land with an aerial extent of 1062 0 km2 15

covers 172 8 km2 2 57 fig a1 d riverine forests water bodies wetlands agriculture and cultivated land are thought to be the most important landcover classes for groundwater occurrence while urban land use or settlement and bushland are believed to be less important fig a5 and table 3 in preparation for groundwater potential delineation the land use cover was clipped projected and weighted in arcgis

have an impact on recharge potentiality clay has a lower infiltration capacity than loam and sandy loam as a result the groundwater potential of sandy loam and loam soil textures is greater than that of clayey soil textures according to an addis ababa university study the soil in the study area is classified into three types loam clay loam and sandy loam b berhanu et al 2013 more than half of the basin is covered by loam 3600 10km2 which is found along the middle and margin of the study area with sandy loam 1963 83 km2 29 covering the watershed s middle edge fig a1 e clay covers 1168 61 km2 17

jeldu district fig a6 sandy loam soils have a high infiltration rate and high groundwater potential whereas clay soils have a low infiltration rate and low groundwater potential the soil texture gis data like other thematic layers was projected to a similar projection clipped to the study area and provided weightage before it was ready for delineating gwpzs these tasks were completed with the

elevation in a given area which influences runoff as well kattimani et al 2018 u kumar et al 2013 rafati and nikeghbal 2017 rajasekhar et al 2019 because infiltration is inversely proportional to land steepness the slope is an important parameter in groundwater investigation the gentler the slopes the slower the surface water flow and the more groundwater percolates into the ground on the contrary the steeper the slope the greater the surface runoff reducing groundwater percolation a slope map of the area under investigation was created using the aster dem satellite digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m using arcgis spatial analyst tools the slope was prepared and reclassified into five classes the weight in the attribute table was assigned based on its impact on the potential occurrence of groundwater the study area s slope ranges from 0 to 21 3 per cent fig a8 with gentle slopes in the northern and southern parts of the guder watershed in the arcgis spatial

line tool in pci geomatica 2017 software and editing and watershed classification was completed in the arcgis spatial analyst tool environment high lineament densities favor groundwater potential over low lineament densities as a result high value weights are assigned to high density lineaments and low value weights to low density lineaments following the completion of the map it was reclassified into five categories very low 0 0 1945 km km2 very poor groundwater potential low 0 1945 0 389 km km2 poor groundwater potential medium 0 389 0 5836 km km2 intermediate groundwater potential and high

drainage density is calculated by dividing the total length of all streams or rivers in a drainage basin by the drainage basin s total area ajay kumar et al 2020 harini et al 2018 because drainage density is an inverse function of permeability it is an important parameter in determining the groundwater potential zone high drainage density values favor runoff and as a result indicate a low groundwater potential zone ajay kumar et al 2020 harini et al 2018 the drainage density was calculated using arcgis 10 1 s spatial analyst tool the dem was delineated under hydrology using the spatial analyst tool followed by density preparation and reclassification according to the drainage density thematic layer the drainage density value ranged from 0 to 1 80 km km2 fig 4 these are reclassified into five classes based on their effect on groundwater occurrence for analysis 0 0 35 very low very good 0 35 0 72 low good 0 72 1 07 medium intermediate 1 07 1 43 high poor and 1 43 1 80 very high very poor table 3 rainfall is important in the hydrologic cycle because it controls groundwater potential rainfall is the major source of surface and groundwater in this area and therefore the intensity of rainfall and its spatial distribution strongly control the recharge volume of the basin as stated by many scholars ahmad et al 2020 barlow and clarke 2017 k g berhanu and hatiye 2020 t kumar et al 2014 nadew et al 2019 pal et al 2020 rafati and nikeghbal 2017 groundwater recharge would be most likely in areas with high rainfall and least likely in areas with low rainfall k g berhanu

technique was carefully chosen the weights assigned to various thematic maps and their features were determined using field experience and expert judgment which was normalized using saaty s ahp method goepel 2013 a kumar and krishna 2018 during the analytic hierarchy process each pair of factors in a specific cluster is evaluated in terms of their relative importance one at a time a pairwise comparison matrix is developed in which aii 1 and aij 1 ai the right eigenvector which is calculated from the maximum absolute eigenvalue max 1 2 is used to calculate the weightage factor of the ranking criteria and the resulting sub criteria the eigenvector technique was used to compute the principal eigenvalue λ a kumar and krishna 2018 1 λ max wi n 1 n aw i wi 2 aw a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a

than 0 1 indicating the overall cohesiveness of the pairwise comparison matrix a kumar and krishna 2018 şener et al 2011 otherwise the corresponding weightage must be reconsidered to avoid inconsistency following that groundwater potential zones were defined the groundwater potential index gwpi is a dimensionless quantity that is used to estimate the gwpzs in the study area the weighted

groundwater potential map is typically validated with well discharge or well yield data goepel 2013 a kumar and krishna 2018 şener et al 2011 but gwpzs are delineated without validation when well

were both 5 based on weighted values based on their overall percentage weight the delineated groundwater potential zones gwpzs were reclassified into five categories very poor poor moderate good and very good groundwater potentiality table 4 and fig 6 fig 6 depicts the study area s groundwater potentiality map the extremely high gwpzs are found in the north guder subbasin beginning at the study area s longitude center and prolonged southern northwestern and southwesterly because of the presence of steep side slopes escapements rock surfaces and hills groundwater potentiality has ranged from very low to low at various distances from the center the research showed that geomorphology has a significant impact on groundwater potential when compared to other factors furthermore slope steepness geology formation type high steepness areas and limestone type of lithological formation have all been identified in areas where groundwater potential is extremely low 4 1 validation the available well discharge data were provided by ethiopia s ministry of water irrigation and energy about thirteen 13 gwpzs were discovered to validate the delineated gwpz the studies were found along the main road that goes through asgori ambo guder and babich the observed well data were highlighted in pink in fig 7 with a strong correlation coefficient the study was certain r2 schmidt and osebold 2017 selvanathan and jayabalan 2020 zamani et al 2020 and kappa statistics c t chen et al 2015 okwuashi et al 2012 rafieyan 2016 sim and wright 2005 the coefficient of correlation became 0 73 fig 7 and the mean kappa statistics calculated value was 77 as shown in table 4 indeed the study was confirmed to have a high r2 and there was significant agreement between the field observed and estimated gwpz based on the kappa statistics obtained range value table 5 5 conclusion this study uses gis and rs techniques to assess groundwater potential zones gwpzs in ethiopia s upper blue nile basin western oromia region with a case study of the guder subbasin thematic layers that significantly influence gwpzs such as geomorphology land use cover lithology geology lineament density slope soil properties soil texture soil type drainage density rainfall and elevation maps were prepared using available data such as conventional data and satellite images and individual weights were assigned along with sub class categorizations based merely on literature and expert decision the study assessment revealed that approximately 33 6 2315 km2 of the area of research has good and very good groundwater potentiality in equal magnitude whereas 22 9 1578 8 km2 20 2 1388 7 km2 and 23 3 1601 0 km2 fall under good moderate and poor respectively of the delineated total area of the guder sub basin 6883 5 km2 zones with high to extremely high gwpzs found in the are generally located in the center north eastern and southern parts of the study area whereas low potential zones are observed in the study region s west and very low to low gwpzs have been observed in the watershed s middle periphery mountainous area the best zone indicates the most adequate region for the occurrence of groundwater whereas a low zone represents the least suitable region for groundwater occurrence poor gwpzs may have been demonstrated in areas characterized by hills steep side slopes and escapements slopy surfaces and rock surfaces in comparison to other factors geomorphology has a significant impact on groundwater potential furthermore the steepness of slope and formation type geology indeed play an important role as areas with steep slopes and limestone lithological compositions have been related to areas with very low groundwater occurrence the study then uses observed well discharge data to validate the groundwater potential zone results with a strong correlation coefficient value of 0 73 and a kappa statistic value of 77 the study is certain this study also provides stakeholders kebele administration office woreda and society with cost effective time saving and rapid appraisal of groundwater resources evidence to better understand areas with high and low groundwater for easier

7727,study region northwest of guangxi province southwest china study focus knowing the role of isotopes in precipitation can improve understanding of climate change and eco hydrological processes in complex critical zone systems however knowledge of the influence of local meteorological factors on variations of precipitation isotopes remains limited as high resolution rainwater sampling is lacking new hydrological insights for the region the temporal characteristics intra annual seasonal and monthly scales of precipitation were analyzed using daily precipitation isotopes data from 2011 to 2020 and event resolving data from 2019 to 2020 at huanjiang in southwest china the boosted regression tree model was used to explore the relationship between local meteorological factors and δ18o values on an intra annual scale δ 18o δd and d excess values exhibited significant sinusoidal fluctuation being lower and higher during the wet and dry seasons respectively temperature is the most sensitive meteorological factor to monsoon climate response on the seasonal scale et0 explains 37 5 of isotopic variations in the dry season thus indicating that the influence of evaporation on the rainwater isotopes variation should be considered the amount effect of rainwater isotopes was clearly shown on the monthly scale however precipitation isotopes did not follow the amount effect on an inter event scale which can be explained by large scale convection activity these findings can improve interpretations of isotopic variations in precipitation in humid subtropical climate zones

tracing hydrological processes will enable researchers to find solutions to fundamental problems of critical zone science such as weathering rates and water residence times miguez macho and fan 2021 oshun et al 2016 rainwater is the most important input factor influencing water balance and material exchange in a watershed therefore understanding its movement in the critical zone system plays an irreplaceable role in tracing of hydrological processes fischer and knutti 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2019 stable δd and δ 18o in precipitation respond very sensitively to climate change and hydrological processes are widely applied as tracers to study interactions between water movement processes and environmental factors ansari et al 2020 bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 islam et al 2021 galewsky et al 2016 ruan et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 over the last 60 years the global network of isotope in precipitation gnip has monitored hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation at 1380 sites across more than 136 countries iaea 2013 liu et al 2014 after analyzing 400 samples of water from rivers lakes and precipitation worldwide craig 1961 established a global meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 gmwl using ordinary least squares regression since then the gmwl has been widely used for comparison with the local meteoric water line lmwl to exhibit local water cycle processes such as evaporation and condensation relevant studies on these monthly scale datasets have considerably promoted the further development of isotope tracer research meanwhile the temporal characteristics of precipitation isotopes are attracting increasing attention as they can reflect different climatic and environmental information bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 the global the isotopic composition of precipitation usually follows the law of sinusoidal fluctuation with seasonal cycles throughout the year allen et al 2018 2019 bedaso and wu 2020 jacobs et al 2018 lutz et al 2018 von freyberg et al 2018 high resolution precipitation isotope data daily scale to intra event scale has significance in broadening the understanding of regional hydrology water resources and climate sensitivity abouelmagd et al 2012 aronson et al 2008 bedaso et al 2019 daily resolution precipitation isotope data can help understand the dynamic processes of individual precipitation and link the isotope signals to synoptic weather conditions bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 dayem et al 2010 tang et al 2015 xie et al 2011 yang et al 2017 isotope monitoring of extreme rainfall e g frontal cyclonic and typhoon precipitation can explain the variations of synoptic systems moisture vapor transport cloud and fractionation processes and surface meteorological conditions during the rainfall process ansari et al 2020 han et al 2020a b munksgaard et al 2012 li et al 2015 xu et al 2019 different synoptic conditions of extreme rainfall events strongly influence rainwater isotope composition ansari et al 2020 han et al 2020a b xu et al 2019 nevertheless our understanding of the stable isotope characteristics in extreme precipitation that are usually caused by intense convective activity is still limited on the global scale due to the contingency of rainfall events and the lack of high resolution monitoring sites scheliga et al 2018 acquiring this information can significantly improve our understanding the global climate conditions that are characterized by frequent occurrence of extreme events miguez macho and fan 2021 stable isotopes in precipitation have great environmental significance precipitation has characteristic stable isotope signatures in different locations affected by fractionation processes induced by environmental factors such as climatic and geographical index zhang et al 2010 temperature amount of precipitation latitude altitude and continental effects illustrates the important control effect of environmental factors on the rainwater isotopes bedaso and wu 2020 jiao et al 2019 2020 liu et al 2014 noble and ansari 2019 some effects show distinct regional characteristics for example dansgaard 1964 found a remarkably temperature effect in high and mid high latitude continent and a significant amount effect in tropical and low latitude regions further zhang and wang 2016 showed that the temperature effect in northern china is more significant than in southern china long term monitoring has shown that these environmental effects occur in specific areas due to their unique meteorological and geographical characteristics of the regions therefore continuous supplementary monitoring data of these variables can enhance our understanding of the relationship between stable isotopes in precipitation and environmental factors in different areas the subtropical region of china located in the middle low latitude region contains at least 78 precipitation isotope observation stations not all of which are part of the gnip zhang et al 2022b despite the similar solar radiation and climate characteristics of this region the precipitation isotopes exhibit substantial spatial variation because of complex underlying surface topography and differences in types of vegetation belt and elevation yuan and yang 2020 complex moisture sources including south china sea the bay of the bengal the arabian sea westerly winds and local water vapor are also important driving for precipitation isotope variations li et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 2022b c moreover most studies only considered the relationship between the rainwater isotope value and meteorological or topographical elements the lack of high resolution precipitation isotope datasets limits the interpretation of the physical mechanism of rainwater isotope variation during rainfall processes furthermore southwest china is a climate sensitive region where droughts and floods are common occurrences liu et al 2015 therefore improving the monitoring network of isotope in precipitation will help improve our understanding of climate change and region ecological environmental security in southwest china huanjiang station located in a subtropical humid monsoon climate region of southwest china joined the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip in 2004 tracer eco hydrological processes of water stable isotopes have been monitored hu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 ding et al 2020 however despite several long term monitoring studies the characteristics of precipitation isotope variation and its controlling mechanism remain unclear and might hamper the development of long term eco hydrological research in addition the influence of meteorological factors on precipitation isotopes requires investigation for example evapotranspiration has been found to significant influence precipitation isotopes in warm and dry areas galewsky et al 2016 xia and winnick 2021 putman et al 2019 while relevant research in humid regions is scarce recently guo et al 2021 found that evapotranspiration affects precipitation isotopes in guilin joined gnip network in 1983 located near the huanjiang site however other sites in southwest china e g chengdu chongqing guiyang and kunming belonging to the gnip network did not show such effects liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhou and li 2018 therefore supplementing the precipitation isotope monitoring dataset can provide comprehensive insights into precipitation isotope variations in humid regions moreover changes in precipitation isotopes and their mechanisms at the intro event scale of heavy rainfall events remain unclear and the corresponding information can provide a significance reference in studying the rainfall runoff mechanisms characterized by rapid hydrological processes in this study we describe the variation of stable isotopes based on the daily and intra event resolution dataset from 2011 to 2020 the aim of this study was to 1 characterize the temporal variation of stable isotope values δ18o δd and d excess in rainwater and 2 investigate the relationship between rainwater isotope values and different meteorological factors on different time scales 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and climate environment the study site huanjiang county 108 18 e 24 43 n is located in northwest guangxi of southwest china approximately 1900 km northeast of the bay of bengal 1400 km northwest of the south china sea and 1900 km south of the mongolian plateau fig 1a the study site has a subtropical monsoon climate fig 1c the average annual temperature in the study area is 19 4 with the hottest and coldest months being july average 27 4 and january average 9 0 respectively the average annual rainfall in the study site is about 1446 mm with the wettest and driest months are in june average 268 7 mm and february average 24 2 mm respectively according to the 2011 2020 data statistics two distinct seasons of dry season october to march and wet season april to september contribute to 61 9 and 38 1 of the total annual precipitation respectively the study area is mainly affected by three types of monsoon air masses liu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 generally the air mass sources of the wet season originate from the southwest the bay of bengal and the indian ocean monsoon and east asia the south china sea and the western subtropical pacific monsoon in addition the air mass sources in the dry season october to march originate from the mongolian siberian plateau fig 1a zhang and wang 2016 2 2 precipitation collections and analysis the precipitation sampling equipment was similar to that tested by iaea and comprised a 150 mm diameter funnel connected to a 1 0 l brown bottle schotterer et al 1996 an air outlet tube was soldered to the bottom of the funnel we collected 499 precipitation samples at 8 00 am after rainy days between january 2011 and december 2020 all vials were wrapped with parafilm to avoid evaporation and were stored at 4 c samples n 89 were similarly collected during rainstorm events between june 2019 and september 2020 all rainfall events were sampled at half hour to two hour time intervals based on the amount of rainfall to assess the isotope value variation in precipitation rainstorm event data were acquired on june 23 2019 july 8 2019 october 22 2019 june 5 2020 june 6 2020 and june 7 2020 september 6 2020 and september 7 2020 these events were named as 23062019 08072019 22102019 05062020 06062020 07062020 06092020 and 07092020 respectively table 1 shows comprehensive information about precipitation and isotopes based on the rainfall standard lai et al 2016 we determined the 22102019 07062020 and 06092020 events as heavy rainstorm 23062020 and 06062020 as rainstorm and 08072019 22102019 and 05062020 as heavy rainfall 2 3 laboratory analysis the δ 18o and δd stable isotopes of rainwater samples were measured by los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer west et al 2010 via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy following the iaea standard procedure iaea 2009 the results are reported in the standard δ notation craig 1961 and are defined relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow δ d δ 18 o r s a m p l e r s tan d a r d r s tan d a r d where r represents the isotope ratio of a sample 2h 1h and 18o 16o and r standard represents the corresponding ratio in a standard form the δ value is expressed in parts per thousand permil the measurement precision of measurement δd and δ 18o was respectively 0 5 and 0 2 at the 2σ criterion a second parameter defined as d excess δ d 8 δ 18 o based on craig 1961 provided additional constraint on moisture sources atmospheric processes and vapor transport history guan et al 2013 most of the samples have d excess values close to the global average of 10 craig 1961 however d excess values in some samples were low 0 associated with small amount of rainfall and caused by evaporation harvey 2001 all isotope values were calculated as rainfall amount weighted values 2 4 climate data and potential evapotranspiration et0 meteorological parameters including the daily rainfall amount temperature the maximum temperature the minimum temperature and relative humidity were measured by using standard meteorological station huanjiang karst ecosystem observation station fig 1d in a previous study we briefly investigated the linear relationship between precipitation isotopes and temperature precipitation amount on a seasonal scale from 2013 to 2018 zhang et al 2022a but did not consider the influence of other meteorological parameters in this study we extend the data to 2020 and use the model to analyze the relationship between isotopes and meteorological parameters on monthly seasonal and annual time scales the validity of the data is determined using statistical analysis using potential evapotranspiration et0 as a parameter of evaporation capacity we assessed the relationship between rainwater δ 18o and et0 in huangjiang the penman monteith equation is a standard approach for assessing et0 allen et al 1998 due to its physical features that enable the incorporation of aerodynamic indicators et 0 0 0023 t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 ra where et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 1 day 1 and t mean t max and t min are mean maximum and minimum air temperature respectively scatter plots for each meteorological factor are provided in fig s1 except for the strong linear relationship r 2 0 82 between daily temperature and et0 all other meteorological factors exhibit a weak correlation 2 5 hysplit modeling to explore the possible influence of seasonal movement of air mass on precipitation isotope values the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory https www ready noaa gov hypub bin trajtype pl hysplit model developed by national oceanic atmospheric agency was implemented and backward trajectories of air masses were calculated draxler 2011 this model has achieved considerable success in past evaluations of isotopic signatures and water vapor sources in the vicinity of the study area such as in yunnan li et al 2016 changsha wu et al 2014 and guilin zhang et al 2014 we utilized this model to fit the air mass composition at the monthly scales from 2011 to 2020 the global data assimilation system gdas 1 0 was used as background meteorological data which has a data resolution of 2 5 2 5 wu et al 2014 an initial height of 1000 m above ground level was selected to target vapor rich air parcels because moisture is predominantly found within the lower 2000 m of the atmosphere bedaso and wu 2020 moreover 72 h was selected as the backward running time due to the average lag time of water vapor is less than 3 d bedaso and wu 2020 subsequently cluster analysis was performed to identify the contribution of the major air mass sources this method merges trajectories that are close to each other and represents those groups called clusters by their mean trajectory discrepancies between trajectories within and between clusters were minimized and maximized respectively more detailed information can be found at https ready arl noaa gov documents

wang 2016 2 6 boosted regression trees brt model we analyze the effects of meteorological factors temperature evapotranspiration precipitation amount and relative humidity on δ 18o at different time scales using the boosted regression tree brt model the brt model precisely forecasts and interprets datasets used for regression and classification analyze it is one of the best approaches for differentiating the contributions and influences of multiple predictor variations and can resolve the problem of nonlinear relationships autocorrelation missing data and multicollinearity rodeghiero

the gbm package in r notably december january and february were grouped into one month because of the small amount of sampling data 3 results 3 1 variations of rainwater isotopes and δd δ18o relationship at intra annual seasonal and monthly scales table 2 and fig 2 show daily precipitation isotope values and their statistical analysis were showed in the δ 18o values ranged between 15 9 and 2 0 with an average value of 6 2 3 5 the δd values varied between 118 9 and 32 1 with an average of 37 0 29 2 the d excess values ranged between 17 1 and 50 0 with an average of 12 2 6 9 at the intra annual scale the δ 18o δd and d excess values exhibited obvious fluctuations in regularized variability that were opposite to that of the temperature fig 2 moreover the isotope values in precipitation exhibited significantly p 0 01 strong seasonality table 2 and fig 2 with low and high values in the wet season april september and dry october march seasons respectively at the monthly scale δ 18o and δd values decreased continuously from february to september and increased from september to february of the next year table 2 however the d excess values were mainly significant for seasonal variations and the differences in their values were relatively small at the monthly scale the δ 18o δd and d excess value was the highest in february which was obviously p 0 05 larger than in other months moreover d excess values was obvious p 0 05 lower in july and august than in other months table 2 understanding the relationship of δ 18o and δd is useful to compare seasonal and spatial isotope variations regionally as shown in fig 3 the local meteoric water line lmwl was established on the month precipitation datasets using least squares regression which expressed a linear correlation between δd and δ 18o as δ d 8 73 δ 18 o 17 24 r2 0 99 p 0 001 both the slope and intercept of lwml were larger than those of the gmwl δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 craig 1961 the frequency distribution in fig 3 illustrated the number of samples in each specified range of δd and δ 18o notably the skewness for δd and δ 18o distributions was small as δd varies linearly with δ 18o values fig 3 craig 1961 the observed δ 18o values were used to reflect the relationship between isotope values and climate parameters seasonal and monthly lmwls based on the daily precipitation datasets are listed in table 3 at the seasonal scale the slope and intercept of lmwl differed marginally between the wet and dry seasons however significant differences were observed at the monthly scale specifically the range of slope and intercept of lwml were 3 15 10 39 and 6 48 27 58 respectively in the dry season and 6 33 7 92 and 1 13 10 48 respectively in the wet season the average slope in the dry season and wet season were 7 31 and 7 41 respectively but the coefficient of variation of slope in the dry season 29 92 was higher than that in the wet season 7 79 moreover the mean intercept in the dry season 14 18 was much higher than in the wet season 8 87 3 2 variations of isotopes in rainwater and δd δ18o relationship at inter event scale the δ18o δd and d excess values varied from 81 88 to 12 35 14 07 to 1 30 and 0 82 32 96 respectively with the weighted mean values in all sequential precipitation samples being 7 33 45 92 and 12 75 respectively fig 4 the δ 18o was positive during the early stage which later decreased and then increased in most precipitation events make the d excess 10 as the background value fig 4 black dash the d excess value was greater than 10 in the early stage however the d excess value fluctuated considerably during the middle and late periods and the consistent rule was not observed the sequential precipitation meteoric water line smwl was δ d 7 76 δ 18 o 11 02 r 2 0 90 n 89 fig 5 both the slope and intercept of smwl were smaller than those of the gmwl and the lmwl furthermore the δd and δ 18o values were located in the top right of smwl for only the 22102019 event during the dry season 3 3 relationship between precipitation δ18o and meteorological factors at different time scales at the intra annual scale 46 precipitation δ18o variability was explained by temperature which was negatively correlated with precipitation δ18o values fig 6a similarly et0 and δ18o values were negatively correlated but their contribution was lower than the temperature relative humidity and precipitation amount contributions comparatively less to precipitation δ18o variations furthermore significant negative linear were observed between precipitation amount and predictor δ18o values at the seasonal scale the variations of precipitation δ18o values were mainly affected by precipitation amount in the wet season and by et0 in the dry season fig 6b and c although the contribution rate of each meteorological factor differed marginally in wet season 22 8 26 6 a more explicit negative relationship between rainfall amount and δ18o values was discovered relatively the effect of et0 on the δ18o values in the dry season was observed evidently furthermore temperature evapotranspiration and isotope values show a significant positive linear relationship in the dry season fig 6c meteorological factors and precipitation δ18o values showed varying degrees of correlation at the monthly scale figs 7 and 8 the average contribution rate of precipitation amount was 44 4 followed by temperature 19 9 et0 18 8 and relative humidity 13 9 except for june and september the precipitation amount was the main meteorological factor causing variation in the δ18o values δ18o values and rainfall amount showed a significant negative linear relationship p 0 05 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 temporal variations of precipitation isotopes the rainwater isotopes were within the range reported for southwest china table 4 monitored data showed that the δd δ18o and d excess of rainwater showed significant sinusoidal fluctuations on an intra annual scale fig 2 this result was similar to those of previous studies of precipitation isotopes in the humid subtropical zone of china kong et al 2019 liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 sinusoidal isoscapes are helpful as they can concisely show seasonal isotope phenomena and can be assessed efficiently from sparse or irregular datasets allen et al 2018 2019 compared with other areas the characteristics of sinusoidal fluctuation in the study area were more evident and have strong regularity which indicates that the east asian monsoon region is strongly controlled by the monsoon climate maloszewski 2000 o driscoll et al 2005 ogrinc et al 2008 this finding suggests that precipitation isotopes may play an important role in paleoclimate reconstruction or climate change prediction in the study area the d excess values exceeded the global average 10 dansgaard 1964 and were much higher than those in coastal areas xu et al 2019 which is attributed to the isotope fractionation controlled by the vapor evaporation and condensation in inland areas higher the d excess values higher is the proportion of the evaporated in precipitation putman et al 2019 thus explaining why d excess values were higher in the dry season than in the wet season in the present study table 2 similarly changes in the d excess value during precipitation can provide information on moisture supply putman et al 2019 rainwater in a dry region with vapor provided through continental recycling characterized by high d excess values might have higher d excess values therefore high d excess values during the early period reflected a high influx of moisture from the continent while the low d excess value in the late period indicated that moisture was mainly recycled fig 4 the lmwl was the predicted equilibrium correlation guan et al 2013 putman et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 the slope 8 73 and intercept 17 24 of the lmwl in the study area were higher than that of gmwl lmwl slopes higher than 8 are mainly observed in the south pacific domain where water vapor masses are characterized by complex monsoon climate systems that experience stronger distillation effects from the ocean to continental araguás araguás et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 similar lmwls were observed in adjacent areas in southern china zhou and li 2018 wu et al 2014 liu et al 2014 however due to its dry climate although kunming is located in the same climatic region its lmwl was significantly different from that of other areas table 4 the slope 7 66 and intercept 11 08 of smlw in precipitation events in the study site were smaller than those of lwml fig 5 which was similar with the findings of previous studies xu et al 2019 han et al 2020a b this was mainly because the rainwater from the lmwl masking the post condensation process of water vapor in the cloud at different periods after the weighted average processing occurred samples of continuous rainwater respond to changes in water vapor condensation in clouds and also records the fractionation rate ratio of the isotope values han et al 2020a b 4 2 relationships between δ18o and influencing factors at different time scales 4 2 1 seasonal movement of air masses the significant regular sinusoidal fluctuations in precipitation isotope values support the view that the monsoon cycle has a first order controlling effect on isotope composition in rainwater at the annual and seasonal scales the hysplit model showed that the water vapor masses source and transport path affected the isotope composition of rainwater in huanjiang from 2011 to 2019 fig 9 the main transport paths were the southwest monsoon indian ocean arabian sea and bay of bengal southeast monsoon south china sea and pacific ocean mongolian siberian monsoon and the westerly winds zhang and wang 2016 the large δ18o in the dry season september to april was main controlled by a dry and cold westerly and continental monsoon whereas low values in the wet season were mainly controlled by wet and warm maritime monsoon from southwest and southeast fig 9 liu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 the isotope values from september to december were lower than those from january to april indicating that the southeast monsoon contributes greatly to the more depleted isotope values may is the onset of the summer monsoon at the study site fig 9e which lasts until september the δ18o values low between june and september cai et al 2018 proposed that low isotopic values during the late summer monsoon or post monsoon seasons are related to vapor transport in westerly winds from the east of the india burma trough moreover the transition in precipitation δ18o values from the pre monsoon to monsoon mature stage is related to intensification of convective activity in the moisture source regions caused by monsoon establishment and northward migration of the intertropical convergence zone cai et al 2018 the water vapor source from the south china sea plays a critical switch effect in the moisture provided for rainfall in present study area liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 used hysplit and records of typhoon paths and found that low concentrations of heavy isotopes corresponded with remote maritime moisture from the south china sea and the west pacific thereafter continental and westerly air masses gradually dominate until the next summer monsoon arrived 4 2 2 effects of meteorological factors meteorological parameters play a critical role in affecting the precipitation isotopes dansgaard 1964 risi et al 2008 zhang and wang 2016 moreover the relationship between meteorological factors and precipitation isotopes remains unclear and most studies only consider rainfall amount and temperature table 4 moreover the influence of air mass circulation on precipitation isotopes is weakened due to the shorting of time scale which is conducive to the analysis of the effects of local meteorological factors and weather systems on precipitation isotope values in this study we found that the relationship between δ18o and meteorological factors was inconsistent at different time scales intra event to intra annual scales the monsoon activity cycle is consistent with the solar movement which is fundamentally responsible for the climatic characteristics of rain and heat that typically occur simultaneously in subtropical china liu et al 2014 therefore the intra annual precipitation isotope variation and temperature fluctuated with temperature being the main controlling factor explaining the isotope variations at the intra annual scale fig 6a the positive relationship between δ18o and temperature can be explained by rayleigh distillation as follows as temperature decreases the specific humidity at saturation decreases consequently decreasing the isotope value in both vapor and the subsequent precipitation dansgaard 1964 galewsky et al 2016 a positive linear relationship between temperature and isotope is generally found in the middle and high latitudes and continental interior whereas a negative linear relationship is mainly observed in subtropical regions bedaso and wu 2020 liu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 similar results have also been found in changshu changsha dinghushan and ailaoshan in southern subtropical china liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 li et al 2016 zhou and li 2018 however on a seasonal scale the negative linear relationship between precipitation isotope values and temperature was relatively weak during the wet season whereas the positive linear relationship was significant in the dry season this was similar to previous findings of short term monitoring in the east asian monsoon regions such as beijing wen et al 2010 taipei laskar et al 2014 tsukuba wei et al 2016 and changsha yao et al 2018 precipitation isotope value is largely controlled by local temperature during relatively cold and dry seasons as would be expected from strong rayleigh fractionation at lower temperatures for wet season the dilution effect results in a weaker effect of temperature on precipitation isotopes in wet season than rainfall amount hoefs 1997 moreover the wet season in the study area was mainly affected by various atmospheric processes such as convection from the oceanity monsoon advection because of the complex land ocean terrain and recycling of local vapor associated with evaporation and evapotranspiration which weakens the statistical relationship between temperature and precipitation isotopes a significant correlation between monthly amounts of rainfall isotopes and precipitation amount amount effect is significant and negative in the low latitude areas dansgaard 1964 liu et al 2014 bedaso and wu 2020 high rainfall amounts indicate low isotope values which are related to the progressive distillation of the heavier water isotopologues from an air parcel moreover the evaporation of raindrops is weak and the exchange with vapor below the cloud base is less in the larger rainfall events however this amount effect is not as common in the subtropics as in the low latitude regions bowen et al 2019 wu et al 2022a at guilin station guo et al 2021 found an obvious weak negative relationship between daily precipitation isotope values and rainfall amounts as well as a poor relationship between monthly isotope values and rainfall amounts similar results were found by wu et al 2014 in subtropical regions and bedaso et al 2020 in tropical regions in the present study long term monitoring data revealed a strongly significant p 0 01 amount effect on annual seasonal and monthly scales fig 6b and c this was attributed to strong convective activity controlling the rainwater isotopic composition tharammal et al 2017 intense and frequent convective activity leads to intensive precipitation processes that consume water vapor and alter the isotopic composition of precipitation tian et al 2020 moreover wu et al 2022b reported that upstream rainout processes from the bay of bengal toward land and moisture recycling over land were key factors affecting the isotopic composition of precipitation in tengchong southwest china the relationship between the rainfall amount and δ18o values was very strong and nonlinear during october and november fig 8 indicating that a threshold may exist within the range of δ18o values in the dry season that is the rainwater isotope values do not follow the amount effect when the rainfall amount exceeds a certain value a longer time series and more monitoring points may help further validate the above conclusions on the monthly scale the monsoon cycle marginally influenced variations in precipitation isotope values and temperature gradient played an important role in affecting the relationship between isotope values and temperature a significant negative linear correlation was observed between δ18o values and temperature in march and april with a relatively larger temperature gradient while the significant positive linear relationship observed from june to september showed a smaller temperature gradient fig 8 according to rayleigh fractionation heavy isotopes in water vapor are preferentially separated during precipitation and the fractionation factors are affected by condensation temperature under the same conditions the lower the temperature the more negative the isotope values and smaller temperature gradients reflect similar environmental characteristics in addition secondary evaporation under cloud cover mainly occurs in the temperature range of 5 20 and the evaporation is strong at higher temperatures 25 li et al 2020 this can explain the lower slope of lmwl in march and april than in june to september freshly evaporated water vapor from the continent tends to be more enriched than free tropospheric water vapor but not necessarily more enriched than evaporation from the ocean aemisegger et al 2014 guo et al 2021 this excess precipitation is the result of water recycling on land by et0 trenberth et al 2007 the d excess value can provide information about weather systems and moisture sources guan et al 2013 the relationship between et0 and temperature and rainwater δ18o values was consistent and an opposite trend with relative humidity was evident on the monthly scale fig 8 therefore various local meteorological factors jointly determined the contribution of recycled moisture in the asian monsoon region tsukuba japan the annual average contribution of surface evapotranspiration of moisture is 16 0 12 3 and 20 5 12 9 in summer wei et al 2016 evapotranspiration increases as temperature increases and surface air humidity decreases in the rainy season thus the contribution of local recycled moisture to precipitation moisture increases moreover the contribution of local recirculated water vapor to precipitation water vapor decreases with the increase in precipitation and relative humidity zhang et al 2022c the trend was the opposite during the dry season moreover the low relative humidity could potentially accelerate sub cloud evaporation and further enrich δ18o in the remaining precipitation however wu et al 2014 did not observe any such correlation in changsha central china having humid subtropical climates this means that spatial and temporal heterogeneity may affect our findings on the influencing factors of precipitation isotopes and further illustrates the importance of improving dataset network 4 2 3 effects of convective precipitation the frequency natural of extreme rainfall has remarkably accelerated in subtropical regions recently miguez macho and fan 2021 the frequent heavy rainfall in southwest china due to the generation of tropical typhoons or cyclones controlled by oceanic convective activities provides a large influx warm and wet moisture from the low altitude ocean coupled with more depleted rainwater han et al 2020a b xu et al 2019 the major isotopic tendencies evident across diverse rainfall events are l shaped v shaped and constant trends muller et al 2015 casellas et al 2019 the precipitation was v shaped during most rainfall events fig 3 indicating a decreasing trend of precipitation isotopes in the early stage and an increasing trend in the late stage precipitation isotope in falling raindrops gradually enriches through unsaturated air and the variation of isotopes shows the above trend which depends on relative humidity and raindrop size zhang and wang 2016 moreover the v shaped precipitation is usually related to the passage of a cold front accompanied by prolonged precipitation similar results were observed by casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2004 and muller et al 2015 compared with the v shaped precipitation events the isotope values during the 06092020 event exhibited irregular variations this event was caused by tropical cyclones with high rainfall intensity strong convective synoptic conditions strong winds and high intensity precipitation ansari et al 2020 casellas et al 2019 fudeyasu et al 2008 sánchez murillo et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in convective events the δ 18o and rainfall amount do not follow the amount effect but are associated with strong convective precipitation and cloud spread risi et al 2008 ansari et al 2020 similar results have been confirmed li et al 2015 he et al 2018 d excess can help to analyze moisture source information during precipitation dansgaard 1964 li et al 2014 2015 the d excess value was generally 10 at the start of rainfall events indicating that the initial moisture was replenished by recycled moisture the d excess values of the subsequent processes remained constant at approximately 10 suggesting a continuous supply of marine moisture fig 4 unlike semi arid beijing in the east asian monsoon area li et al 2015 found that the d excess value at the onset comprised only 2 0 of extreme rainfall in summer suggesting that the moisture was probably transported from offshore areas to the study area moreover the first order control of isotopes by monsoon circulation can be confirmed even by convective rainfall as δ 18o of autumn rainfall was at the top right quadrant of the smwl fig 5 however the limited nature of the data necessitates further observation variations among precipitation isotope values in extreme rainfall processes are particularly complex the mechanism through which local climate or geographical factors influence physical variations of rainfall processes require further exploration this would help to improve understanding of complex hydrological processes in the climate context 5 conclusions main findings of the paper a continuous 9 year precipitation isotope and hydro meteorological dataset was combined with boosted regression tree model to analyze how local meteorological factors control precipitation isotopes we emphasizes the influence of local meteorological factors on precipitation isotope values the isotope values exhibited strong seasonality temperature is the most sensitive meteorological factor to monsoon climate response explaining 37 5 of the variation of isotope values on the intra annual scale the meteorological factors were not consistent at the seasonal scale with precipitation amount and et0 in the wet and dry seasons being the main influencing factors at the monthly scale the precipitation amount was dominant and was negatively linearly correlated with δ 18o at the inter event scale precipitation isotopes did not follow amount effect due to large scale convection activity limitations of this work the advantage of our dataset is that the continuous long term precipitation and hydro meteorological data support for understanding of climate change and eco hydrological processes however the main results were only obtained at the point scale and relevant conclusions are limited in the generalization of regional scale future studies should focus on the relationship between spatial scale precipitation isotope values and local climate to create scientific basis for understanding complex climate changes in southwest china broader impacts although many studies of humid areas have focused on the spatio temporal variation of precipitation isotope most studies have only considered the influence of the amount of rainfall and temperature on precipitation isotopes evapotranspiration which significant contributes to local climates has been overlooked this will greatly improve the understanding of the water cycle and climate change credit authorship contribution statement jun zhang conceptualization methodology software

7727,study region northwest of guangxi province southwest china study focus knowing the role of isotopes in precipitation can improve understanding of climate change and eco hydrological processes in complex critical zone systems however knowledge of the influence of local meteorological factors on variations of precipitation isotopes remains limited as high resolution rainwater sampling is lacking new hydrological insights for the region the temporal characteristics intra annual seasonal and monthly scales of precipitation were analyzed using daily precipitation isotopes data from 2011 to 2020 and event resolving data from 2019 to 2020 at huanjiang in southwest china the boosted regression tree model was used to explore the relationship between local meteorological factors and δ18o values on an intra annual scale δ 18o δd and d excess values exhibited significant sinusoidal fluctuation being lower and higher during the wet and dry seasons respectively temperature is the most sensitive meteorological factor to monsoon climate response on the seasonal scale et0 explains 37 5 of isotopic variations in the dry season thus indicating that the influence of evaporation on the rainwater isotopes variation should be considered the amount effect of rainwater isotopes was clearly shown on the monthly scale however precipitation isotopes did not follow the amount effect on an inter event scale which can be explained by large scale convection activity these findings can improve interpretations of isotopic variations in precipitation in humid subtropical climate zones

tracing hydrological processes will enable researchers to find solutions to fundamental problems of critical zone science such as weathering rates and water residence times miguez macho and fan 2021 oshun et al 2016 rainwater is the most important input factor influencing water balance and material exchange in a watershed therefore understanding its movement in the critical zone system plays an irreplaceable role in tracing of hydrological processes fischer and knutti 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2019 stable δd and δ 18o in precipitation respond very sensitively to climate change and hydrological processes are widely applied as tracers to study interactions between water movement processes and environmental factors ansari et al 2020 bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 islam et al 2021 galewsky et al 2016 ruan et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 over the last 60 years the global network of isotope in precipitation gnip has monitored hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation at 1380 sites across more than 136 countries iaea 2013 liu et al 2014 after analyzing 400 samples of water from rivers lakes and precipitation worldwide craig 1961 established a global meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 gmwl using ordinary least squares regression since then the gmwl has been widely used for comparison with the local meteoric water line lmwl to exhibit local water cycle processes such as evaporation and condensation relevant studies on these monthly scale datasets have considerably promoted the further development of isotope tracer research meanwhile the temporal characteristics of precipitation isotopes are attracting increasing attention as they can reflect different climatic and environmental information bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 the global the isotopic composition of precipitation usually follows the law of sinusoidal fluctuation with seasonal cycles throughout the year allen et al 2018 2019 bedaso and wu 2020 jacobs et al 2018 lutz et al 2018 von freyberg et al 2018 high resolution precipitation isotope data daily scale to intra event scale has significance in broadening the understanding of regional hydrology water resources and climate sensitivity abouelmagd et al 2012 aronson et al 2008 bedaso et al 2019 daily resolution precipitation isotope data can help understand the dynamic processes of individual precipitation and link the isotope signals to synoptic weather conditions bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 dayem et al 2010 tang et al 2015 xie et al 2011 yang et al 2017 isotope monitoring of extreme rainfall e g frontal cyclonic and typhoon precipitation can explain the variations of synoptic systems moisture vapor transport cloud and fractionation processes and surface meteorological conditions during the rainfall process ansari et al 2020 han et al 2020a b munksgaard et al 2012 li et al 2015 xu et al 2019 different synoptic conditions of extreme rainfall events strongly influence rainwater isotope composition ansari et al 2020 han et al 2020a b xu et al 2019 nevertheless our understanding of the stable isotope characteristics in extreme precipitation that are usually caused by intense convective activity is still limited on the global scale due to the contingency of rainfall events and the lack of high resolution monitoring sites scheliga et al 2018 acquiring this information can significantly improve our understanding the global climate conditions that are characterized by frequent occurrence of extreme events miguez macho and fan 2021 stable isotopes in precipitation have great environmental significance precipitation has characteristic stable isotope signatures in different locations affected by fractionation processes induced by environmental factors such as climatic and geographical index zhang et al 2010 temperature amount of precipitation latitude altitude and continental effects illustrates the important control effect of environmental factors on the rainwater isotopes bedaso and wu 2020 jiao et al 2019 2020 liu et al 2014 noble and ansari 2019 some effects show distinct regional characteristics for example dansgaard 1964 found a remarkably temperature effect in high and mid high latitude continent and a significant amount effect in tropical and low latitude regions further zhang and wang 2016 showed that the temperature effect in northern china is more significant than in southern china long term monitoring has shown that these environmental effects occur in specific areas due to their unique meteorological and geographical characteristics of the regions therefore continuous supplementary monitoring data of these variables can enhance our understanding of the relationship between stable isotopes in precipitation and environmental factors in different areas the subtropical region of china located in the middle low latitude region contains at least 78 precipitation isotope observation stations not all of which are part of the gnip zhang et al 2022b despite the similar solar radiation and climate characteristics of this region the precipitation isotopes exhibit substantial spatial variation because of complex underlying surface topography and differences in types of vegetation belt and elevation yuan and yang 2020 complex moisture sources including south china sea the bay of the bengal the arabian sea westerly winds and local water vapor are also important driving for precipitation isotope variations li et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 2022b c moreover most studies only considered the relationship between the rainwater isotope value and meteorological or topographical elements the lack of high resolution precipitation isotope datasets limits the interpretation of the physical mechanism of rainwater isotope variation during rainfall processes furthermore southwest china is a climate sensitive region where droughts and floods are common occurrences liu et al 2015 therefore improving the monitoring network of isotope in precipitation will help improve our understanding of climate change and region ecological environmental security in southwest china huanjiang station located in a subtropical humid monsoon climate region of southwest china joined the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip in 2004 tracer eco hydrological processes of water stable isotopes have been monitored hu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 ding et al 2020 however despite several long term monitoring studies the characteristics of precipitation isotope variation and its controlling mechanism remain unclear and might hamper the development of long term eco hydrological research in addition the influence of meteorological factors on precipitation isotopes requires investigation for example evapotranspiration has been found to significant influence precipitation isotopes in warm and dry areas galewsky et al 2016 xia and winnick 2021 putman et al 2019 while relevant research in humid regions is scarce recently guo et al 2021 found that evapotranspiration affects precipitation isotopes in guilin joined gnip network in 1983 located near the huanjiang site however other sites in southwest china e g chengdu chongqing guiyang and kunming belonging to the gnip network did not show such effects liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhou and li 2018 therefore supplementing the precipitation isotope monitoring dataset can provide comprehensive insights into precipitation isotope variations in humid regions moreover changes in precipitation isotopes and their mechanisms at the intro event scale of heavy rainfall events remain unclear and the corresponding information can provide a significance reference in studying the rainfall runoff mechanisms characterized by rapid hydrological processes in this study we describe the variation of stable isotopes based on the daily and intra event resolution dataset from 2011 to 2020 the aim of this study was to 1 characterize the temporal variation of stable isotope values δ18o δd and d excess in rainwater and 2 investigate the relationship between rainwater isotope values and different meteorological factors on different time scales 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and climate environment the study site huanjiang county 108 18 e 24 43 n is located in northwest guangxi of southwest china approximately 1900 km northeast of the bay of bengal 1400 km northwest of the south china sea and 1900 km south of the mongolian plateau fig 1a the study site has a subtropical monsoon climate fig 1c the average annual temperature in the study area is 19 4 with the hottest and coldest months being july average 27 4 and january average 9 0 respectively the average annual rainfall in the study site is about 1446 mm with the wettest and driest months are in june average 268 7 mm and february average 24 2 mm respectively according to the 2011 2020 data statistics two distinct seasons of dry season october to march and wet season april to september contribute to 61 9 and 38 1 of the total annual precipitation respectively the study area is mainly affected by three types of monsoon air masses liu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 generally the air mass sources of the wet season originate from the southwest the bay of bengal and the indian ocean monsoon and east asia the south china sea and the western subtropical pacific monsoon in addition the air mass sources in the dry season october to march originate from the mongolian siberian plateau fig 1a zhang and wang 2016 2 2 precipitation collections and analysis the precipitation sampling equipment was similar to that tested by iaea and comprised a 150 mm diameter funnel connected to a 1 0 l brown bottle schotterer et al 1996 an air outlet tube was soldered to the bottom of the funnel we collected 499 precipitation samples at 8 00 am after rainy days between january 2011 and december 2020 all vials were wrapped with parafilm to avoid evaporation and were stored at 4 c samples n 89 were similarly collected during rainstorm events between june 2019 and september 2020 all rainfall events were sampled at half hour to two hour time intervals based on the amount of rainfall to assess the isotope value variation in precipitation rainstorm event data were acquired on june 23 2019 july 8 2019 october 22 2019 june 5 2020 june 6 2020 and june 7 2020 september 6 2020 and september 7 2020 these events were named as 23062019 08072019 22102019 05062020 06062020 07062020 06092020 and 07092020 respectively table 1 shows comprehensive information about precipitation and isotopes based on the rainfall standard lai et al 2016 we determined the 22102019 07062020 and 06092020 events as heavy rainstorm 23062020 and 06062020 as rainstorm and 08072019 22102019 and 05062020 as heavy rainfall 2 3 laboratory analysis the δ 18o and δd stable isotopes of rainwater samples were measured by los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer west et al 2010 via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy following the iaea

additional constraint on moisture sources atmospheric processes and vapor transport history guan et al 2013 most of the samples have d excess values close to the global average of 10 craig 1961 however d excess values in some samples were low 0 associated with small amount of rainfall and caused by evaporation harvey 2001 all isotope values were calculated as rainfall amount weighted values 2 4 climate data and potential evapotranspiration et0 meteorological parameters including the daily rainfall amount temperature the maximum temperature the minimum temperature and relative humidity were measured by using standard meteorological station huanjiang karst ecosystem observation station fig 1d in a previous study we briefly investigated the linear relationship between precipitation isotopes and temperature precipitation amount on a seasonal scale from 2013 to 2018 zhang et al 2022a but did not consider the influence of other meteorological parameters in this study we extend the data to 2020 and use the model to analyze the relationship between isotopes and meteorological parameters on monthly seasonal and annual time scales the validity of the data is determined using statistical analysis using potential evapotranspiration et0 as a parameter of evaporation capacity we assessed the relationship between rainwater δ 18o and et0 in huangjiang the penman monteith equation is a standard approach for assessing et0 allen et al 1998 due to its physical features that enable the incorporation of aerodynamic indicators et 0 0 0023 t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 ra where et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 1 day 1 and t mean t max and t min are mean maximum and minimum air temperature respectively scatter plots for each meteorological factor are provided in fig s1 except for the strong linear relationship r 2 0 82 between daily temperature and et0 all other meteorological factors exhibit a weak correlation 2 5 hysplit modeling to explore the possible influence of seasonal movement of air mass on precipitation isotope values the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory https www ready noaa gov hypub bin trajtype pl hysplit model developed by national oceanic atmospheric agency was implemented and backward trajectories of air masses were calculated draxler 2011 this model has achieved considerable success in past evaluations of isotopic signatures and water vapor sources in the vicinity of the study area such as in yunnan li et al 2016 changsha wu et al 2014 and guilin zhang et al 2014 we utilized this model to fit the air mass composition at the monthly scales from 2011 to 2020 the global data assimilation system gdas 1 0 was used as background meteorological data which has a data resolution of 2 5 2 5 wu et al 2014 an initial height of 1000 m above ground level was selected to target vapor rich air parcels because moisture is predominantly found within the lower 2000 m of the atmosphere bedaso and wu 2020 moreover 72 h was selected as the backward running time due to the average lag time of water vapor is less than 3 d bedaso and wu 2020 subsequently cluster analysis was performed to identify the contribution of the major air mass sources this method merges trajectories that are close to each other and represents those groups called clusters by their mean trajectory discrepancies between trajectories within and between clusters were minimized and maximized respectively more detailed information can be found at https ready arl noaa gov documents

wang 2016 2 6 boosted regression trees brt model we analyze the effects of meteorological factors temperature evapotranspiration precipitation amount and relative humidity on δ 18o at different time scales using the boosted regression tree brt model the brt model precisely forecasts and interprets datasets used for regression and classification analyze it is one of the best approaches for differentiating the contributions and influences of multiple predictor variations and can resolve the problem of nonlinear relationships autocorrelation missing data and multicollinearity rodeghiero et al 2018 sanaei et al 2019 all brt models were fitted using adjusted settings for ecological modeling tree complexity 45 learning rate 0 0001 and bag fraction 0 7 all brt analyses were performed in the gbm package in r notably december january and february were grouped into one month because of the small amount of sampling data 3 results 3 1 variations of rainwater isotopes and δd δ18o relationship at intra annual seasonal and monthly scales table 2 and fig 2 show daily precipitation isotope values and their statistical analysis were showed in the δ 18o values ranged between 15 9 and 2 0 with an average value of 6 2 3 5 the δd values varied between 118 9 and 32 1 with an average of 37 0 29 2 the d excess values ranged between 17 1 and 50 0 with an average of 12 2 6 9 at the intra annual scale the δ 18o δd and d excess values exhibited obvious fluctuations in regularized variability that were opposite to that of the temperature fig 2 moreover the isotope values in precipitation exhibited significantly p 0 01 strong seasonality table 2 and fig 2 with low and high values in the wet season april september and dry october march seasons respectively at the monthly scale δ 18o and δd values decreased continuously from february to september and increased from september to february of the next year table 2 however the d excess values were mainly significant for seasonal variations and the differences in their values were relatively small at the monthly scale the δ 18o δd and d excess value was the highest in february which was obviously p 0 05 larger than in other months moreover d excess values was obvious p 0 05 lower in july and august than in other months table 2 understanding the relationship of δ 18o and δd is useful to compare seasonal and spatial isotope variations regionally as shown in fig 3 the local meteoric water line lmwl was established on the month precipitation datasets using least squares regression which expressed a linear correlation between δd and δ 18o as δ d 8 73 δ 18 o 17 24 r2 0 99 p 0 001 both the slope and intercept of lwml were larger than those of the gmwl δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 craig 1961 the frequency distribution in fig 3 illustrated the number of samples in each specified range of δd and δ 18o notably the skewness for δd and δ 18o distributions was small as δd varies linearly with δ 18o values fig 3 craig 1961 the observed δ 18o values were used to reflect the relationship between isotope values and climate parameters seasonal and monthly lmwls based on the daily precipitation datasets are listed in table 3 at the seasonal scale the slope and intercept of lmwl differed marginally between the wet and dry seasons however significant differences were observed at the monthly scale specifically the range of slope and intercept of lwml were 3 15 10 39 and 6 48 27 58 respectively in the dry season and 6 33 7 92 and 1 13 10 48 respectively in the wet season the average slope in the dry season and wet season were 7 31 and 7 41 respectively but the coefficient of variation of slope in the dry season 29 92 was higher than that in the wet season 7 79 moreover the mean intercept in the dry season 14 18 was much higher than in the wet season 8 87 3 2 variations of isotopes in rainwater and δd δ18o relationship at inter event scale the δ18o δd and d excess values varied from 81 88 to 12 35 14 07 to 1 30 and 0 82 32 96 respectively with the weighted mean values in all sequential precipitation samples being 7 33 45 92 and 12 75 respectively fig 4 the δ 18o was positive during the early stage which later decreased and then increased in most precipitation events make the d excess 10 as the background value fig 4 black dash the d excess value was greater than 10 in the early stage however the d excess value fluctuated considerably during the middle and late periods and the consistent rule was not observed the sequential precipitation meteoric water line smwl was δ d 7 76 δ 18 o 11 02 r 2 0 90 n 89 fig 5 both the slope and intercept of smwl were smaller than those of the gmwl and the lmwl furthermore the δd and δ 18o values were located in the top right of smwl for only the 22102019 event during the dry season 3 3 relationship between precipitation δ18o and meteorological factors at different time scales at the intra annual scale 46 precipitation δ18o variability was explained by temperature which was negatively correlated with precipitation δ18o values fig 6a similarly et0 and δ18o values were negatively correlated but their contribution was lower than the temperature relative humidity and precipitation amount contributions comparatively less to precipitation δ18o variations furthermore significant negative linear were observed between precipitation amount and predictor δ18o values at the seasonal scale the variations of precipitation δ18o values were mainly affected by precipitation amount in the wet season and by et0 in the dry season fig 6b and c although the contribution rate of each meteorological factor differed marginally in wet season 22 8 26 6 a more explicit negative relationship between rainfall amount and δ18o values was discovered relatively the effect of et0 on the δ18o values in the dry season was observed evidently furthermore temperature evapotranspiration and isotope values show a significant positive linear relationship in the dry season fig 6c meteorological factors and precipitation δ18o values showed varying degrees of correlation at the monthly scale figs 7 and 8 the average contribution rate of precipitation amount was 44 4 followed by temperature 19 9 et0 18 8 and relative humidity 13 9 except for june and september the precipitation amount was the main meteorological factor causing variation in the δ18o values δ18o values and rainfall amount showed a significant negative linear relationship p 0 05 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 temporal variations of precipitation isotopes the rainwater isotopes were within the range reported for southwest china table 4 monitored data showed that the δd δ18o and d excess of rainwater showed significant sinusoidal fluctuations on an intra annual scale fig 2 this result was similar to those of previous studies of precipitation isotopes in the humid subtropical zone of china kong et al 2019 liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 sinusoidal isoscapes are helpful as they can concisely show seasonal isotope phenomena and can be assessed efficiently from sparse or irregular datasets allen et al 2018 2019 compared with other areas the characteristics of sinusoidal fluctuation in the study area were more evident and have strong regularity which indicates that the east asian monsoon region is strongly controlled by the monsoon climate maloszewski 2000 o driscoll et al 2005 ogrinc et al 2008 this finding suggests that precipitation isotopes may play an important role in paleoclimate reconstruction or climate change prediction in the study area the d excess values exceeded the global average 10 dansgaard 1964 and were much higher than those in coastal areas xu et al 2019 which is attributed to the isotope fractionation controlled by the vapor evaporation and condensation in inland areas higher the d excess values higher is the proportion of the evaporated in precipitation putman et al 2019 thus explaining why d excess values were higher in the dry season than in the wet season in the present study table 2 similarly changes in the d excess value during precipitation can provide information on moisture supply putman et al 2019 rainwater in a dry region with vapor provided through continental recycling characterized by high d excess values might have higher d excess values therefore high d excess values during the early period reflected a high influx of moisture from the continent while the low d excess value in the late period indicated that moisture was mainly recycled fig 4 the lmwl was the predicted equilibrium correlation guan et al 2013 putman et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 the slope 8 73 and intercept 17 24 of the lmwl in the study area were higher than that of gmwl lmwl slopes higher than 8 are mainly observed in the south pacific domain where water vapor masses are characterized by complex monsoon climate systems that experience stronger distillation effects from the ocean to continental araguás araguás et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 similar lmwls were observed in adjacent areas in southern china zhou and li 2018 wu et al 2014 liu et al 2014 however due to its dry climate although kunming is located in the same climatic region its lmwl was significantly different from that of other areas table 4 the slope 7 66 and intercept 11 08 of smlw in precipitation events in the study site were smaller than those of lwml fig 5 which was similar with the findings of previous studies xu et al 2019 han et al 2020a b this was mainly because the rainwater from the lmwl masking the post condensation process of water vapor in the cloud at different periods after the weighted average processing occurred samples of continuous rainwater respond to changes in water vapor condensation in clouds and also records the fractionation rate ratio of the isotope values han et al 2020a b 4 2 relationships between δ18o and influencing factors at different time scales 4 2 1 seasonal movement of air masses the significant regular sinusoidal fluctuations in precipitation isotope values support the view that the monsoon cycle has a first order controlling effect on isotope composition in rainwater at the annual and seasonal scales the hysplit model showed that the water vapor masses source and transport path affected the isotope composition of rainwater in huanjiang from 2011 to 2019 fig 9 the main transport paths were the southwest monsoon indian ocean arabian sea and bay of bengal southeast monsoon south china sea and pacific ocean mongolian siberian monsoon and the westerly winds zhang and wang 2016 the large δ18o in the dry season september to april was main controlled by a dry and cold westerly and continental monsoon whereas low values in the wet season were mainly controlled by wet and warm maritime monsoon from southwest and southeast fig 9 liu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 the isotope values from september to december were lower than those from january to april indicating that the southeast monsoon contributes greatly to the more depleted isotope values may is the onset of the summer monsoon at the study site fig 9e which lasts until september the δ18o values low between june and september cai et al 2018 proposed that low isotopic values during the late summer monsoon or post monsoon seasons are related to vapor transport in westerly winds from the east of the india burma trough moreover the transition in precipitation δ18o values from the pre monsoon to monsoon mature stage is related to intensification of convective activity in the moisture source regions caused by monsoon establishment and northward migration of the intertropical convergence zone cai et al 2018 the water vapor source from the south china sea plays a critical switch effect in the moisture provided for rainfall in present study area liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 used hysplit and records of typhoon paths and found that low concentrations of heavy isotopes corresponded with remote maritime moisture from the south china sea and the west pacific thereafter continental and westerly air masses gradually dominate until the next summer monsoon arrived 4 2 2 effects of meteorological factors meteorological parameters play a critical role in affecting the precipitation isotopes dansgaard 1964 risi et al 2008 zhang and wang 2016 moreover the relationship between meteorological factors and precipitation isotopes remains unclear and most studies only consider rainfall amount and temperature table 4 moreover the influence of air mass circulation on precipitation isotopes is weakened due to the shorting of time scale which is conducive to the analysis of the effects of local meteorological factors and weather systems on precipitation isotope values in this study we found that the relationship between δ18o and meteorological factors was inconsistent at different time scales intra event to intra annual scales the monsoon activity cycle is consistent with the solar movement which is fundamentally responsible for the climatic characteristics of rain and heat that typically occur simultaneously in subtropical china liu et al 2014 therefore the intra annual precipitation isotope variation and temperature fluctuated with temperature being the main controlling factor explaining the isotope variations at the intra annual scale fig 6a the positive relationship between δ18o and temperature can be explained by rayleigh distillation as follows as temperature decreases the specific humidity at saturation decreases consequently decreasing the isotope value in both vapor and the subsequent precipitation dansgaard 1964 galewsky et al 2016 a positive linear relationship between temperature and isotope is generally found in the middle and high latitudes and continental interior whereas a negative linear relationship is mainly observed in subtropical regions bedaso and wu 2020 liu et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 similar results have also been found in changshu changsha dinghushan and ailaoshan in southern subtropical china liu et al 2014 wu et al 2014 li et al 2016 zhou and li 2018 however on a seasonal scale the negative linear relationship between precipitation isotope values and temperature was relatively weak during the wet season whereas the positive linear relationship was significant in the dry season this was similar to previous findings of short term monitoring in the east asian monsoon regions such as beijing wen et al 2010 taipei laskar et al 2014 tsukuba wei et al 2016 and changsha yao et al 2018 precipitation isotope value is largely controlled by local temperature during relatively cold and dry seasons as would be expected from strong rayleigh fractionation at lower temperatures for wet season the dilution effect results in a weaker effect of temperature on precipitation isotopes in wet season than rainfall amount hoefs 1997 moreover the wet season in the study area was mainly affected by various atmospheric processes such as convection from the oceanity monsoon advection because of the complex land ocean terrain and recycling of local vapor associated with evaporation and evapotranspiration which weakens the statistical relationship between temperature and precipitation isotopes a significant correlation between monthly amounts of rainfall isotopes and precipitation amount amount effect is significant and negative in the low latitude areas dansgaard 1964 liu et al 2014 bedaso and wu 2020 high rainfall amounts indicate low isotope values which are related to the progressive distillation of the heavier water isotopologues from an air parcel moreover the evaporation of raindrops is weak and the exchange with vapor below the cloud base is less in the larger rainfall events however this amount effect is not as common in the subtropics as in the low latitude regions bowen et al 2019 wu et al 2022a at guilin station guo et al 2021 found an obvious weak negative relationship between daily precipitation isotope values and rainfall amounts as well as a poor relationship between monthly isotope values and rainfall amounts similar results were found by wu et al 2014 in subtropical regions and bedaso et al 2020 in tropical regions in the present study long term monitoring data revealed a strongly significant p 0 01 amount effect on annual seasonal and monthly scales fig 6b and c this was attributed to strong convective activity controlling the rainwater isotopic composition tharammal et al 2017 intense and frequent convective activity leads to intensive precipitation processes that consume water vapor and alter the isotopic composition of precipitation tian et al 2020 moreover wu et al 2022b reported that upstream rainout processes from the bay of bengal toward land and moisture recycling over land were key factors affecting the isotopic composition of precipitation in tengchong southwest china the relationship between the rainfall amount and δ18o values was very strong and nonlinear during october and november fig 8 indicating that a threshold may exist within the range of δ18o values in the dry season that is the rainwater isotope values do not follow the amount effect when the rainfall amount exceeds a certain value a longer time series and more monitoring points may help further validate the above conclusions on the monthly scale the monsoon cycle marginally influenced variations in precipitation isotope values and temperature gradient played an important role in affecting the relationship between isotope values and temperature a significant negative linear correlation was observed between δ18o values and temperature in march and april with a relatively larger temperature gradient while the significant positive linear relationship observed from june to september showed a smaller temperature gradient fig 8 according to rayleigh fractionation heavy isotopes in water vapor are preferentially separated during precipitation and the fractionation factors are affected by condensation temperature under the same conditions the lower the temperature the more negative the isotope values and smaller temperature gradients reflect similar environmental characteristics in addition secondary evaporation under cloud cover mainly occurs in the temperature range of 5 20 and the evaporation is strong at higher temperatures 25 li et al 2020 this can explain the lower slope of lmwl in march and april than in june to september freshly evaporated water vapor from the continent tends to be more enriched than free tropospheric water vapor but not necessarily more enriched than evaporation from the ocean aemisegger et al 2014 guo et al 2021 this excess precipitation is the result of water recycling on land by et0 trenberth et al 2007 the d excess value can provide information about weather systems and moisture sources guan et al 2013 the relationship between et0 and temperature and rainwater δ18o values was consistent and an opposite trend with relative humidity was evident on the monthly scale fig 8 therefore various local meteorological factors jointly determined the contribution of recycled moisture in the asian monsoon region tsukuba japan the annual average contribution of surface evapotranspiration of moisture is 16 0 12 3 and 20 5 12 9 in summer wei et al 2016 evapotranspiration increases as temperature increases and surface air humidity decreases in the rainy season thus the contribution of local recycled moisture to precipitation moisture increases moreover the contribution of local recirculated water vapor to precipitation water vapor decreases with the increase in precipitation and relative humidity zhang et al 2022c the trend was the opposite during the dry season moreover the low relative humidity could potentially accelerate sub cloud evaporation and further enrich δ18o in the remaining precipitation however wu et al 2014 did not observe any such correlation in changsha central china having humid subtropical climates this means that spatial and temporal heterogeneity may affect our findings on the influencing factors of precipitation isotopes and further illustrates the importance of improving dataset network 4 2 3 effects of convective precipitation the frequency natural of extreme rainfall has remarkably accelerated in subtropical regions recently miguez macho and fan 2021 the frequent heavy rainfall in southwest china due to the generation of tropical typhoons or cyclones controlled by oceanic convective activities provides a large influx warm and wet moisture from the low altitude ocean coupled with more depleted rainwater han et al 2020a b xu et al 2019 the major isotopic tendencies evident across diverse rainfall events are l shaped v shaped and constant trends muller et al 2015 casellas et al 2019 the precipitation was v shaped during most rainfall events fig 3 indicating a decreasing trend of precipitation isotopes in the early stage and an increasing trend in the late stage precipitation isotope in falling raindrops gradually enriches through unsaturated air and the variation of isotopes shows the above trend which depends on relative humidity and raindrop size zhang and wang 2016 moreover the v shaped precipitation is usually related to the passage of a cold front accompanied by prolonged precipitation similar results were observed by casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2004 and muller et al 2015 compared with the v shaped precipitation events the isotope values during the 06092020 event exhibited irregular variations this event was caused by tropical cyclones with high rainfall intensity strong convective synoptic conditions strong winds and high intensity precipitation ansari et al 2020 casellas et al 2019 fudeyasu et al 2008 sánchez murillo et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in convective events the δ 18o and rainfall amount do not follow the amount effect but are associated with strong convective precipitation and cloud spread risi et al 2008 ansari et al 2020 similar results have been confirmed li et al 2015 he et al 2018 d excess can help to analyze moisture source information during precipitation dansgaard 1964 li et al 2014 2015 the d excess value was generally 10 at the start of rainfall events indicating that the initial moisture was replenished by recycled moisture the d excess values of the subsequent processes remained constant at approximately 10 suggesting a continuous supply of marine moisture fig 4 unlike semi arid beijing in the east asian monsoon area li et al 2015 found that the d excess value at the onset comprised only 2 0 of extreme rainfall in summer suggesting that the moisture was probably transported from offshore areas to the study area moreover the first order control of isotopes by monsoon circulation can be confirmed even by convective rainfall as δ 18o of autumn rainfall was at the top right quadrant of the smwl fig 5 however the limited nature of the data necessitates further observation variations among precipitation isotope values in extreme rainfall processes are particularly complex the mechanism through which local climate or geographical factors influence physical variations of rainfall processes require further exploration this would help to improve understanding of complex hydrological processes in the climate context 5 conclusions main findings of the paper a continuous 9 year precipitation isotope and hydro meteorological dataset was combined with boosted regression tree model to analyze how local meteorological factors control precipitation isotopes we emphasizes the influence of local meteorological factors on precipitation isotope values the isotope values exhibited strong seasonality temperature is the most sensitive meteorological factor to monsoon climate response explaining 37 5 of the variation of isotope values on the intra annual scale the meteorological factors were not consistent at the seasonal scale with precipitation amount and et0 in the wet and dry seasons being the main influencing factors at the monthly scale the precipitation amount was dominant and was negatively linearly correlated with δ 18o at the inter event scale precipitation isotopes did not follow amount effect due to large scale convection activity limitations of this work the advantage of our dataset is that the continuous long term precipitation and hydro meteorological data support for understanding of climate change and eco hydrological processes however the main results were only obtained at the point scale and relevant conclusions are limited in the generalization of regional scale future studies should focus on the relationship between spatial scale precipitation isotope values and local climate to create scientific basis for understanding complex climate changes in southwest china broader impacts although many studies of humid areas have focused on the spatio temporal variation of precipitation isotope most studies have only considered the influence of the amount of rainfall and temperature on precipitation isotopes evapotranspiration which significant contributes to local climates has been overlooked this will greatly improve the understanding of the water cycle and climate change credit authorship contribution statement jun zhang conceptualization methodology software

debate about which are the optimal parameters to meet the interests of all the parties involved is still open larraz et al 2020 scrats 2020 setting adequate operating rules is key to manage conflicts between donor and receiving regions policies and regulations are essential to guarantee the success of water transfer projects zhuang 2016 however reservoirs are usually operated with non efficient predefined ruled macian sorribes and pulido velazquez 2020 and the expected design goals are often not achieved dobson et al 2019 although the problem of designing optimal reservoir operations has been extensively studied the complexity of real word systems limited the practical application of the methods proposed in the literature ren et al 2019 multi objective simulation optimization frameworks recently emerged as a valuable strategy for optimal resource allocation heinz et al 2007 maier et al 2014 veena et al 2021 several studies have been conducted to design optimal operating rules addressing multiple objectives such as agricultural urban and ecological water demand hydropower generation and energy consumption gu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 ming et al 2017 zeng et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 the most representative simulation optimization method is the evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps which combines direct policy search a nonlinear approximating network and a multi objective evolutionary algorithm giuliani et al 2016 emodps exploits the parameterization of the operating policies and explores the associated parameter space to find a parameterized policy that optimizes the expected system performance giuliani et al 2018 the effectiveness of emodps in addressing reservoirs operation in complex multi objective contexts has been demonstrated for a review see giuliani et al 2021 and references therein and its potential to improve water transfer strategies has been recently explored ren et al 2019 veena et al 2021 after the recent modification of the tsa water transfer rule in 2021 no further changes are expected in near future however the topic is still intensely debated with the collision of opposing views from one side the respect for the priority of the donor basin and the achievement of its good ecological status and on the other side the concern on the effects that such a goal would produce on the economy of the recipient regions while some proposals have been made to improve the water transfer rule de lucas 2019 cedex 2020 larraz et al 2020 advanced methods such as the emodps have not yet been tested by applying this approach to the tsa case this paper intends to widen the solutions space explored so far and to contribute to the ongoing debate on the present and future of this controversial water transfer in spain we also evaluate the potential of the emodps approach to guide the design of alternative operating rules for water transfers with the ultimate goal of mitigating tensions between recipient and donor regions and seeking to fulfil the environmental needs of the donor basin we employ emodps to optimize the operation of the tsa with respect to four potentially conflicting objectives i the tagus water demands urban water supply irrigation and environmental flow maintenance ii the segura water demands urban water supply and irrigation iii hydropower production downstream of the entrepeñas and buendía dams and iv the socioeconomic benefit of the population living on reservoirs shores we jointly optimize the re operation of the two headwaters reservoirs and the existing water transfer policy thus allowing the exploration of trade offs between objectives and the definition of an operating rule that could benefit the main stakeholders involved we tested the optimization under a scenario of increased environmental flow in the tagus river as established by the 2021 2027 tagus river basin management plan this allowed us to assess the effect produced by this mitigation measure on the competing objectives and design an operating rule sufficiently robust to deal with such a scenario 2 case study description 2 1 the tsa system the tsa system in operation since 1979 consists of a 286 km long pipeline with a maximum annual transfer capacity of 650 hm 3 the donor regions include castilla la mancha madrid and extremadura up to 600 hm 3 year are allocated to the region of murcia segura river basin the province of alicante in the valencia region and to a lesser extent the province of almería in andalusia in addition 50 hm 3 year can be transferred to the guadiana basin for ecological and urban water supply purposes the tsa infrastructure begins in the bolarque reservoir downstream from the headwaters reservoirs entrepeñas and buendía fig 1a from bolarque the water is pumped to the bujeda reservoir from where it is conducted towards the alarcón reservoir on the júcar river and then to the talave reservoir on the mundo river the main tributary of the segura river melgarejo moreno et al 2019 the aqueduct connects river basins that are strategic for water resources management in spain and portugal senent aparicio et al 2021 the tagus river basin is the longest river in the iberian peninsula and supplies water resources to approximately 15 of the spanish and 30 of the portuguese population lobanova et al 2017 the increasing water demand and the high number of dams regulating the river led to water scarcity problems and poor ecological status in some water bodies sondermann and de oliveira 2021 the segura basin is one of the most water stressed regions in the mediterranean basin aldaya et al 2019 the estimated annual structural deficit in the basin is 458 hm 3 year especially concerning the agricultural water use which represents 86 of the total demand in the basin chs 2015 climate change is expected to further exacerbate this deficit rupérez moreno et al 2017 the intensely irrigated horticultural and fruit crops are essential to sustain the basin s economy the export of vegetables and fruits to eu countries can exceed 70 of the total production so the region has become known as the orchard of europe martin gorriz et al 2021 the tsa enabled the socioeconomic development of southeast spain morote et al 2020 according to the central irrigation union of the tagus segura scrats by its spanish acronym the aqueduct generates a total economic impact of more than 3 013 billion i e 4 6 of the gross domestic product and provides 106 566 direct jobs in the alicante and murcia provinces scrats 2020 on the other side the tsa spurred the uncontrolled expansion of irrigation and urban water demand leading to the paradox of increasing the initial water deficit in the receiving basin hernández mora and del moral 2015 wwf 2009 since 1997 the water transfer rule foresees four levels according to which the transferred volume is calculated at the beginning of each month table 1 the transferred volume varies according to the total storage of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs and the inflow to the system in the previous 12 months with a maximum water transfer of 650 hm 3 in each hydrological year moreover the rule establishes a maximum monthly release to the tagus river that includes the urban and irrigation water demand downstream of the bolarque dam as well as the environmental flow the operating rule has often been contested by stakeholders and has undergone several modifications over the years table 1 the infrastructure was intended to transfer surplus tagus water i e resources in excess of water demand for urban water supply irrigation hydroelectric production and environmental flow maintenance in the donor basin hernández mora and del moral 2015 as defined by law 21 2015 however the estimation of surplus resources in the donor basin has been long questioned arguing that the environmental effects have been not rigorously taken into account hernández mora et al 2014 rey et al 2016 according to wwf 2009 the reduced stream flows have affected riparian vegetation along the tagus river and have limited the river capacity to dilute the polluted flows produced by the madrid region resulting in water quality problems between aranjuez and toledo bolinches et al 2020 hernández mora and del moral 2015 the high frequency of situations in which the system falls into level 3 or even in level 4 where no transfer is allowed was brought to the attention of the ministry in charge of setting the rules this circumstance creates negative impacts on the population living on the shores of the reservoirs in the area of origin limiting tourism and recreational activities san martín et al 2018 as well as in the segura basin due to the instability and irregularity of the water transfer cedex 2020 such a situation arises from the combination of two elements the reduction of the natural runoff registered in the basin since the 1980s and the choice of certain control parameters in the operating rule since the design of the transfer in the 1960s the tagus headwater suffered a reduction of natural inflows by 47 san martín et al 2020 thus leading to the under exploitation of the infrastructure with respect to the design targets specifically annual transferred volumes have averaged about 350 hm 3 since 1979 instead of the projected 600 hm 3 senent aparicio et al 2021 at the same time some studies consider the transferred volume at level 2 to be unsustainable de lucas 2019 cabezas 2013 and the storage and inflow thresholds for entering in level 1 too low de lucas 2019 larraz et al 2020 in 2021 the water transfer rule was revised to lower the probability of occurrence of levels 3 and 4 cedex 2020 the volume to be transferred in level 2 was decreased to 27 hm 3 m o n t h while the inflow threshold for entering level 1 was increased to 1400 hm 3 however other studies propose even smaller values for the transferred volume at level 2 and suggest an increase also in the storage threshold de lucas 2019 larraz et al 2020 a further critical issue is the environmental flow ef to be ensured in the tagus river which directly influences the maximum monthly release target until the entry into force of the 2021 2027 tagus river basin management plan rbmp the legislation required a constant flow of 6 m 3 s at the aranjuez gauge the first monitoring point for the control of the environmental flow requirements located 100 km downstream of the bolarque dam this value was not technically supported and has been long contested a sentence of the spanish supreme court 309 2019 which repealed several articles of the tagus rbmp for not containing an adequate determination of the ef in aranjuez and in other three strategic water bodies molina 2019 forced the modification of the original value of the ef the 2021 2027 tagus rbmp foresees a gradual increase of the ef up to an average value of 8 6 m 3 s in 2027 while from the tagus perspective this value has been judged as insufficient baeza 2021 scrats argued that this value will significantly compromise the annual volume transferred to the segura basin scrats 2020 2 2 model description the model developed in this work consists of three main components entrepeñas reservoir tagus river buendía reservoir guadiela river and the aqueduct fig 1b since entrepeñas reservoir has a lower storage capacity with respect to buendía 802 hm 3 vs 1638 hm 3 but a higher inflow a tunnel connects the two reservoirs the modelled system was simplified excluding the bolarque reservoir tagus river just downstream of entrepeñas and buendía given its very low storage capacity and its main use for daily regulation and hydropower production the monthly dynamics of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs are described through the following water mass balance equations 1 s t 1 e s t e i t 1 e r t 1 e t t 1 e e t e a t e 2 s t 1 b s t b i t 1 b t t 1 e r t 1 b e t b a t b where s t e b is the storage at the beginning of month t i t 1 e b is the inflow to the reservoir t t 1 e is the volume of water eventually transferred from entrepeñas to buendía through the connecting tunnel r t 1 e b is the volume of water released and e t e b a t e b is the water evaporated in the time interval t t 1 in particular e t e b is the mean monthly evaporation rate while a t e b is the reservoir surface area uniquely defined by a nonlinear relation given the storage s t e b the actual release r t 1 e b depends on the monthly release decision u t e b provided by the operating policy which is forced within a certain operational zone by the maximum and minimum feasible release due to some physical e g activation of the spillways and normative e g minimum environmental flow maintenance limitations the volume transferred to the segura river basin qs t 1 is then established by applying a water transfer rule dependent on the total storage of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs and the inflow to the system in the previous 12 months i t tot 12 see table 1 for

qt t 1 r t 1 b r t 1 e qs t 1 the four conflicting interests in the system are evaluated over a simulation time horizon h of 20 years 1998 2018 and are modelled using the following objectives formulations 1 tagus river deficit j tag m 3 s 2 the monthly average squared deficit with respect to the monthly tagus water demand w t tagus including urban agricultural and environmental needs to be minimized defined as 5 j tag 1 h t 0 h 1 w t tagus qt t 1 2 the squared deficit aims to numerically favour several small deficits over a small number of large deficits hashimoto et al 1982 the plus sign in the equation means that only positive differences are counted as deficits accordingly a release to the tagus river higher than w t tagus is allowed and not penalized not to impose restrictions on the discharge flowing in the donor river while still respecting the maximum release defined by the operational zone of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs 2 aqueduct deficit j aq m 3 s 2 the monthly

an abacus that relates the hydraulic jump the turbined flow and the power retrieved from official design documents eptisa 2000b 2000a 3 methods and tools the approach adopted in this study focuses on addressing two main issues of the debated implementation of the tsa water transfer rule see section 2 1 the best volume to be transferred in level 2 and the impact that the 2027 ef will produce on the system the aim is to design an operating policy that could guarantee a workable compromise between the main stakeholders involved and be sufficiently robust in the near future scenario of reduced water resources availability the purpose of this work is not to estimate the water needs of the donor and receiving basins indeed the domestic and irrigation water demand in the tagus and segura basins as well as the non transferable reserve in the headwaters are assumed to be those specified in the 2021 water transfer rule we keep the same 4 level scheme currently used but we do not impose the tagus water demand as the maximum possible release to the tagus river this avoids limiting the discharge flowing into the donor basin 3 1 evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps the framework adopted in this study foresees the generation of decision alternatives i e candidate operating policies with associated alternative volume v l 2 to be transferred at level 2 via multi objective optimization specifically according to giuliani et al 2021 the multi objective optimization problem can be formulated as follows 9 π argmin π j π where j π j tag j aq j st j hyd subject to eqs 1 2 the objective j hyd is multiplied by 1 to ensure the correct direction of optimization finding π p v l 2 means finding both the optimal operating policy p and the optimal time invariant volume v l 2 to be transferred in level 2 that minimize the four dimensional objective function j π we solve this optimal control and planning problem using the evolutionary multi objective direct policy search approach emodps that transforms the optimal control problem into a planning one by parameterizing the control policy p ϑ within a predefined class of functions and exploring the parameter space through multi objective evolutionary algorithms in order to identify a set of pareto approximate policies giuliani et al 2016 a solution is defined as pareto optimal if there is no other solution that presents a better value for one objective without worsening the performance in at least one other objective using the emodps approach the above planning and control problem can be solved by jointly evolving solutions in a complex search space formed by the parameters of the control policy and the volume v l 2 within a single optimization process bertoni et al 2019 giudici et al 2019 specifically a random set of initial parameters is defined and used as input to run a system simulation over the time horizon h starting from the simulation outputs the objective functions are computed and used by the optimization algorithm to update the parameter set the new parameter set is then introduced into the simulation again and the process is repeated until the maximum number of function evaluations is reached giuliani et al 2016 macian sorribes and pulido velazquez 2020 in this study we parameterize the water reservoir operating policy by means of nonlinear approximating networks using gaussian radial basis functions rbfs the release decision u t k for the kth of k reservoirs at time t is therefore calculated as follows 10 u t k i 1 n w i k φ i i t where n is the number of rbfs φ i and w i k is the weight of the i th rbf the weights are formulated such that they sum to one i 1 n w i k 1 and are nonnegative w i k 0 i k as for the single rbf it is defined as follows 11 φ i i t exp j 1 m i t j c i j 2 b i j 2 where m is the number of policy inputs i t c i and b i are the m dimensional centre and radius vectors of the i th rbf the centres must lie within the input bounded space and the radii must be strictly positive i e for normalized variables c i j 1 1 and b i j 0 1 as a result the parameters vector employed for the parametrization of the operating policy is defined as ϑ c i j b i j w i k r n ϑ where i 1 n j 1 m n ϑ n 2 m k and k number of policy outputs in this work the input vector i t includes the following four elements the time t expressed as a combination of sine and cosine functions sin 2 π t 365 and cos 2 π t 365 and the storage in the entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs s t e and s t b the number of policy outputs is 2 i e the release decisions for the two reservoirs considering n 8 m 4 and k 2 the total number of parameters to be optimized is equal to 81 i e 80 parameters of the control policy and 1 parameter representing the volume v l 2 to be transferred in the level 2 this latter parameter can vary between 0 and 40 hm 3 month in order to explore the parameter space and discover optimal values we employ multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas specifically we adopted the self adaptive borg moea algorithm hadka and reed 2013 since it is highly robust across a wide number of challenging multi objective problems by meeting or exceeding the performance of other state of the art moeas r gupta et al 2020 zatarain salazar et al 2016 the borg moea is based on an epsilon dominance archiving requiring the users to specify a numerical threshold on each optimization objective below which they are insensitive to changes in performance in this study we adopt epsilon dominance values equal to 10 for j aq 2 for j tagus 7500 for j hydr and 10 000 000 for j storage these epsilon values represent the significance of precision that is considered consequential in evaluating decision trade offs each optimization was run for ten random seeds to improve solution diversity and avoid randomness dependence in addition each seed was run up to 500 000 function evaluations which proved to be sufficient by visual inspection of search progress the final set of pareto approximate system configurations for each computational experiment was computed as the reference set of non dominated solutions obtained across the ten optimization trials according to the most recent reviews dobson et al 2019 giuliani et al 2021 macian sorribes and pulido velazquez 2020 the use of emodps to design closed loop operating policies presents substantial advantages over the methods traditionally adopted in the literature its ability to overcome the curses of dimensionality modelling and multiple objectives giuliani et al 2016 allows handling systems with more than three reservoirs widening the number and complexity of objectives and directly using exogenous information this is particularly relevant in today s complex context where the operational decision making should balance multisectoral human pressures and environmental degradation and consider a wide range of hydroclimatic uncertainties arising by climate change giuliani et al 2021 3 2 scenarios setting we run the optimization on the 1998 2018 inflows and estimated evaporation rates as water transfer parameters we chose the ones established in the 2021 rule see table 1 except for the volume v l 2 to be transferred in level 2 which is optimized by the model we tested the optimization under two scenarios of ef implementation in the tagus river the baseline scenario sc0 considers the ef required by the 2015 2021 tagus rbmp while the second scenario sc1 considers the increased ef to be implemented by 2027 the ef is included in the tagus water demand objective which then varies across scenarios as shown in table 2 scenario sc1 which implies an increased discharge flowing in the tagus river is expected to exacerbate tensions among stakeholders further we thus explore whether increasing the degree of freedom of the current rule could allow exploring a more comprehensive range of solutions raising the chance of finding a compromise policy de lucas 2019 and larraz et al 2020 found by trial and error tests that a rule without level 1 could significantly favour the storage objective the high water volume that can be transferred in level 1 prevents the recovery of the reservoir s level and jeopardise the state of the system in the following months following this insight we tested a modified version of the second scenario sc1 mod where we set a high volume threshold for entering level 1 2000 hm 3 instead of 1300 hm 3 this allows eliminating level 1 without modifying the framework of the water transfer rule as prescribed by law 21 2015 moreover the volume to be transferred in level 3 was also lowered to the minimum possible water supply i e emergency irrigation and domestic water supply de lucas 2019 in order to better balance the water transfer in the different levels the pareto optimal solutions are compared with the historical policy estimated from historical time series of levels and releases since the historical water transfer rule underwent several modifications over the years see table 1 above we also consider the performance of the policies obtained by applying the 2014 and the 2021 water transfer rule to the 1998 2018 inflow series henceforth 2014 and 2021 policy these rules simplify the system by assuming a unique conceptual reservoir without specifying how volume and release are distributed between the two reservoirs consequently it is impossible to distinguish between the single hydropower production in entrepeñas and buendía dams 4 results and discussion 4 1 baseline scenario sc0 parallel plots are used to show the pareto optimal policies retrieved by solving the optimization problem defined in eq 9 the general structure of a parallel plot is shown in fig 2a each polyline is a different policy each parallel axis represents an optimization objective and the crossing points identify the performance of a certain policy in the different objectives for example the policy represented by the grey line presents an aqueduct deficit equal to 400 m 3 s 2 while the tagus deficit is 10 m 3 s 2 the axes are oriented so that the highest level of achievement of each objective is always at the bottom i e minimum deficit for aqueduct tagus and storage and maximum hydropower production this means that the green line represents the ideal solution while the red line corresponds to the worst one conflicts are designated as diagonal lines between two adjacent axes and the extent of the conflicts is proportional to their slope for example comparing the grey and the pink lines a clear conflict between aqueduct and tagus objectives emerges while both policies show similar performance in storage and hydropower objectives the optimal solutions obtained in the baseline scenario are shown in fig 2b all lines have been coloured according to their performance on the tagus objective with dark green representing a smaller deficit unsurprisingly tagus and aqueduct are the most conflicting objectives as shown by the inversion of the colour gradients along the two respective axes in fig 2b this conflict results because the total release from the headwaters dams at the diversion point is split between the tagus and the segura basins the performance of the pareto optimal policies is compared with the historical 2014 and 2021 policies red yellow and light blue line in fig 2b the historical system operation minimizes the tagus deficit and simultaneously demonstrates good performance in aqueduct and hydropower objectives this is coherent with the fulfilment of the tagus water demand having the highest priority followed by domestic and agricultural water needs of the segura river basin while the hydropower production has the lowest priority at the same time the historical policy generates high storage deficit which is in line with the historical records of low water levels registered in entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs the scant attention given to the recreational objective has been questioned since it contradicts the priority that should be given to the entire donor basin not only to the river stretch downstream of the tsa diversion san martín et al 2018 the objective values obtained by applying the 2014 and the 2021 water transfer rule are similar to those derived from the implementation of the historical policy except for the storage deficit which presents a 38 reduction by applying the 2021 policy all the optimized solutions strongly improve the storage objective compared to the historical and 2014 policies with a deficit reduction ranging between 30 and 98 the 2021 policy is outperformed by the optimized solutions in 99 of cases each pareto optimal solution is associated with an optimal monthly volume v l 2 to be transferred in the level 2 represented by the colour of the polylines in fig 2c where maximum values are blue and minimum are yellow operating policies with high volume v l 2 dominate the set of solutions and a colour pattern can be identified high values of v l 2 between 27 and 40 hm 3 month are associated with low aqueduct deficit while values lower than 27 hm 3 month are limited to those policies that produce little tagus and storage deficits since by law the water use priority has to be ensured to the donor basin we focused only on the subset of solutions that minimize the tagus deficit i e with performance equal to or better than the historical solution within this subset two groups of solutions with a conflicting behaviour can be identified a the solutions that minimize the aqueduct deficit and b the ones that minimize the storage deficit the distribution of their performance in each objective is shown by two groups of box plots a and b in fig 3 a significant conflict between aqueduct and storage objective is detected in the first group by imposing a deficit in the aqueduct lower than the historical value the minimum storage deficit is about 5 10 7 m 3 in the second group this value can be further minimized until a near zero deficit but a higher aqueduct deficit must be assumed the scatter plots in fig 3 show the individual solutions coloured according to the associated optimal value of volume v l 2 in the first group v l 2 values lie in the range between 26 3 and 36 8 hm 3 month these values are in line with the ones adopted in the 2014 and 2021 water transfer rules i e 38 and 27 hm 3 month lower values in this range enable a lower storage deficit a volume v l 2 equal to 26 3 hm 3 month corresponds to the solution that maximizes the storage deficit reduction 86 in the first group the second group of solutions generally presents low values of volume v l 2 80 of optimized solutions present a volume to be transferred in level 2 lower than 30 hm 3 month among the subset of solutions with minimum tagus deficit equal or lower than the historical value we identified the best policy for each objective see coloured lines in fig 4a the relative trajectories of total reservoir s storage water transfer and tagus release in the hydrological years 2012 2014 are plotted in fig 4b as an example table 3 reports the volume v l 2 associated to each best policy as well as the mean annual water transfer and the percentage of times the total reservoir s level falls into level 1 or 2 in the studied period under the minimum tagus deficit constraint the aqueduct deficit could be further minimized with respect to the historical performance but the improvement is limited by the strong conflict with the tagus objective specifically the aqueduct deficit can be reduced by 21 at most blue line in fig 4a leading to a mean annual water transfer of 359 hm 3 but implying a quite high cost for the storage objective almost 26 of the time the total reservoir s level falls into level 3 or 4 a near zero deficit for tagus storage and hydropower objectives can be achieved at the expense of the aqueduct objective leading to a mean annual water transfer minor than 300 hm 3 see green pink and orange lines in fig 4a in order to select a possible compromise policy we first identified the solutions that perform better than the historical policy in all the four objectives within this subset we then selected the policy with the lowest tagus and storage deficit giving priority to the donor basin we thus ended up with the compromise policy represented by the black line in fig 4a the same result would be obtained also by applying the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 to the subset of solutions exceeding the historical performance with equal weights assigned to all the objectives the performance of the compromise solution in terms of aqueduct tagus and hydropower deficit is slightly better than the historical solution while the storage deficit is reduced by 66 as shown in table 3 the mean annual transfer is 311 2 hm 3 and the total reservoir s level falls into level 1 or 2 for the vast majority of the time 93 the storage deficit varies throughout the year with a better performance in winter and spring as shown in fig s1 this solution is obtained with a volume v l 2 to be transferred in level 2 equal to 28 2 hm 3 month it is important to underline that other compromise operating policies could be chosen the pareto optimal solutions shown in fig 4a are the starting point for a negotiation process among the stakeholders that will end up with a set of compromise alternatives to be submitted to the decision maker for the final political decision see castelletti and soncini sessa 2006 for details even in cases where the values of the volume v l 2 are close to the ones adopted in the 2014 and 2021 water transfer rule i e 38 and 27 hm 3 month the model is able to generate optimized policies with improved performance with respect to the 2014 and 2021 solutions especially in terms of storage deficit this is due to the fact that the optimized policies introduce a novelty with respect to the existing rule generating water transfers that cyclically vary according to the hydrological period of the year for example if we compare the solution obtained by applying the 2021 water transfer rule with an optimized solution presenting the same volume v l 2 27 hm 3 month the water transfer trajectories differ from each other see fig s2 the 2021 water transfer rule only depends on storage levels this means that whenever the total storage falls into level 1 or 2 the maximum monthly water volume allowed at that level is transferred conversely in some cases where the storage level falls into level 1 or 2 the transfer volume prescribed by the optimized operating policy is lower than that allowed the re operation of entrepeñas and buendía dams and the water transfer rule are jointly optimized this implies that the modelled water transfer trajectory presents the same cyclostationary behaviour as the total release from the headwaters reservoirs with storage accumulation in winter and higher release in summer to meet the downstream tagus demand see blue line in the second panel of fig s2 coupling the 4 level water transfer rule with the cyclostationary time index allows for expanding the search for solutions and significantly improving the storage objective other studies seem to support the idea of a water transfer operating rule that varies according to the period of the year different water transfer triggering mechanisms have been proposed to decide when to transfer a certain water volume from the donor to the recipient basin water transfer decisions can be determined by the water transfer rule curve based on the storage of the recipient reservoir xi et al 2010 on storage of donor reservoir or on storage of both guo et al 2012 zeng et al 2014 in all cases the water transfer rule curve presents a seasonal trend according to flood and dry periods zhu et al 2014 proposed an optimised water transfer rule with diversion flows that vary at different periods of hydrological stage and reservoir water level zones for the tsa system villarrubia 2018 demonstrated that an inter annual water transfer rule that also considers inflows to the segura basin would be able to store volume in wet years and meet the water demand in dry years 4 2 increased ef scenarios we run the optimization under the scenario sc1 which simulates the situation that will occur in 2027 with the implementation of the increased ef established in the 2021 2027 tagus rbmp the obtained pareto optimal policies are plotted in fig 5 light blue polylines as expected the solutions are shifted towards a higher aqueduct deficit with respect to the baseline scenario as there are no solutions with an aqueduct deficit lower than 119 m 3 s 2 corresponding to a mean annual water transfer of 387 9 hm 3 year the storage deficit also increases in a subset of solutions the pattern of volume v l 2 is similar to the one observed in the baseline with low values leading to low tagus and storage deficits fig s3a supplementary material for the subset of solutions that presents a minimum deficit in the tagus river the aqueduct deficit is always higher than the historical one and equal to 214 m 3 s 2 corresponding to a mean annual water transfer of 275 5 hm 3 year in the best case this suggests that the current controversy between the donor and the receiving basin would be further exacerbated in the scenario sc1 moreover the conflict between the aqueduct and storage objective is even more acute than the one observed in the baseline scenario if we want to keep the aqueduct deficit as small as possible e g lower than 250 m 3 s 2 the minimum storage deficit is about 10 8 m 3 group a fig 6a this value can be further minimized only by generating a higher aqueduct deficit group b fig 6a as shown by the scatter plots in fig 6a this scenario reinforces the positive association between low values of volume v l 2 and low storage deficit climate change is expected to exacerbarte this situation with a reduction in the transferred volume by more than 60 senent aparicio et al 2021 or even up to 79 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 moreover sondermann and de oliveira 2021 proved that the implementation of planned environmental flow requirements will decrease the ability of the system to satisfy the demands of the agriculture sector in the tagus river in such an alarming context complementary strategies have to be considered in the segura basin such as desalinization and treated reused water morote et al 2017 or new water markets options and insurance policies rey et al 2016 unlike the baseline scenario imposing a higher ef in the tagus river limits the chance of finding an optimized solution with a good trade off between the different objectives we thus introduced the hypothesis that a rule with a higher degree of freedom no level 1 could expand the solutions space and tested the optimization under the scenario sc1 mod the number of solutions significantly decreases thus suggesting that the model is able to find a smaller subset of optimized solutions the pattern of values of volume v l 2 is more marked and shifted to values equal or minor than 25 hm 3 month as shown in fig s3b supplementary material the pareto front between the aqueduct and tagus deficit does not change across sc1 and sc1 mod while the pareto front between storage and tagus objective is confined to the area of low storage deficit see pink polylines in fig 5 this implies that for the subset of solutions with a minimum tagus deficit and under the same constraints considered above i e an aqueduct deficit lower than 250 m 3 s 2 the model is now able to outperform sc1 in the storage objective generating policies with a storage deficit lower than 10 8 m 3 group a fig 6b the values of v l 2 associated with these solutions are mainly between 20 and 24 hm 3 month unlike the previous scenarios the solutions that minimize tagus aqueduct and storage objectives do not belong to two different conflicting groups but rather overlap see groups a b fig 6b the removal of level 1 in the water transfer rule together with low values of the volume to be transferred in level 2 leads to a significant improvement in the system performance in the scenario of increased ef and enables finding a good trade off between aqueduct and storage objectives under the constraint of a minimum tagus deficit for example the solution with the lowest increase in the aqueduct deficit compared to the historical policy 10 presents a strong storage deficit reduction 73 5 conclusions this paper explores the potential of emodps to improve the historical management of the tagus segura aqueduct tsa a controversial interbasin water transfer in spain the re operation of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs and the existing water transfer policy specifically the monthly volume to be transferred in level 2 are jointly optimized under two scenarios of environmental flow implementation in the tagus river among the wide range of pareto optimal solutions generated in the baseline scenario we could identify a possible compromise policy which is able to perform as well as the historical solution in the objectives of water releases to the tagus river water transfers through the aqueduct and hydropower generation while strongly improving the objective of ensuring a certain level of storage in the headwaters reservoirs for recreational uses the associated optimized water transfer policy presents control parameters in line with the ones currently defined by law the optimal volume to be transferred in level 2 turns out to be 28 2 hm 3 month but introduces a novelty in the mechanism triggering the water transfer to the segura basin the transferred volume depends not only on the volume stored in the headwaters reservoirs and on the inflow to the system but also on the hydrological stage of the year the resulting cyclostationary behaviour of the water transfer allows for minimising the occurrence of situations with low storage level level 3 and 4 benefiting the populations living on the shores of the reservoirs and also ensuring more stability to the tsa functioning we also assessed the effect that the environmental flow to be implemented by 2027 in the tagus river will have on the entire system the results show that the current tensions between the donor and the receiving basin will be further exacerbated in this scenario according to the model the aqueduct deficit will increase by at least 10 with respect to the historical performance thus suggesting that complementary strategies for meeting the water demand in the segura basin have to be considered moreover an increased conflict between the aqueduct and storage objective limits the chance of finding a compromise solution in this scenario the elimination of level 1 in the water transfer rule would enable obtaining optimal solutions that keep the aqueduct deficit as small as possible and at the same time present good performance in the storage objective such solutions are associated with low volumes to be transferred in level 2 mainly between 20 and 24 hm 3 month increasing the degree of freedom of the water transfer rule coupled with a lower value of volume v l 2 seems then a promising approach to widen the solutions space and design a compromise policy also in this more complex scenario of increased ef the model proposed in this paper considers the main stakeholders involved in the tsa system and offers compromise solutions looking at the present and future of this infrastructure the operating policies identified are in line with current legislation since we set up the model in order to respect the criteria specified in law 21 2015 the cyclostationary variation of the transferred volume in level 2 would be the novelty aspect of the rule the pressing need for recovering the good status of the freshwater ecosystems and the expected reduction in water resources availability in the near future make it necessary to design alternative and sustainable operating rules of water transfers able to assuage tensions between recipient and donor regions and fulfil the environmental needs in the donor basin by applying emodps to an emblematic case study this paper confirms the potential of this

7728,study region the tagus segura aqueduct tsa is a large and strategic water transfer scheme in spain that connects entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs in the tagus river headwaters to the segura river basin a highly stressed mediterranean area study focus the operating rules of the tsa underwent several modifications over the years and the debate about which are the optimal parameters to meet the interests of the parties involved is still open we employed evolutionary multi objective direct policy search to jointly optimize the re operation of the headwaters dams and the water transfer policy with respect to four conflicting objectives tagus and segura water demands hydropower production and socioeconomic benefit of the population living on the shores of the headwaters reservoirs we tested the optimization under the baseline and the 2027 scenario which foresees an increased environmental flow ef in the tagus river new hydrological insights for the region the proposed operating rule presents optimized control parameters a higher degree of freedom and a transferred volume that cyclically varies according to the hydrological stage of the year in the 2027 scenario despite the increased ef the deficit in the aqueduct shows a limited increase compared to the historical solution 10 while the storage deficit is strongly reduced 73 this benefits the population living on the reservoirs shores and also ensures more stability to the aqueduct functioning graphical abstract ga1 keywords interbasin water transfer tagus segura aqueduct multi objective evolutionary optimization

shumilova et al 2018 interbasin water transfers ibwts are often conceived as solutions to water distribution unbalances and are likely to expand in the future according to duan et al 2022 ibwts redistribute 1 2 of global renewable water resources annually and this percentage is expected to increase gupta and van der zaag 2008 shumilova et al 2018 identified 34 existing water transfer megaprojects and 76 under construction or in the planning phase while ibwts can help satisfy water demands in arid and semiarid regions zhang et al 2015 they often raise concerns about their social environmental and economic impacts veena et al 2021 and their future sustainability in a fast changing environment has been questioned duan et al 2022 ibwts are considered one of the most controversial topics in the water resources planning field zhang et al 2015 often fuelling tensions between the origin donor and receiving regions lessons learnt from existing ibwts reveal that a deficient regulatory framework at the time of infrastructure design can cause adverse impacts on the entire system de andrade et al 2011 veena et al 2021 donor basins frequently experience severe hydrological alteration through flow reduction wwf 2009 and interruption of river connectivity grant et al 2012 and can be affected by salinization problems zhuang 2016 although some water transfers enabled the restoration of water recipient ecosystems e g allison and meselhe 2010 they may also facilitate the spread of contaminants as well as alien species invasion rasmussen 2002 ibwts also cause significant energy consumption ming et al 2017 and are proven to increase water demand in the recipient basins generating unsustainable expansion of urban and irrigated areas wwf 2009 the tagus segura aqueduct tsa in spain is among the major ibwt projects in the world shumilova et al 2018 it was built in the 1970s to transfer a maximum of 650 hm 3 year from entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs in the tagus headwaters to the segura river basin for irrigation and domestic water supply purposes since it entered into operation in 1979 the tsa has been one of the most controversial topics in water management in spain senent aparicio et al 2021 and has generated strong tensions among the stakeholders involved morote et al 2020 the tsa system has been widely studied from different perspectives several authors focused on its socioeconomic and environmental impacts hernández mora et al 2014 hernández mora and del moral 2015 melgarejo moreno et al 2019 morote et al 2017 2020 san martín et al 2018 wwf 2009 while other authors analysed the effects of climate change on the infrastructure aparicio et al 2013 lobanova et al 2017 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 sahouri 2014 alternative management strategies to deal with the expected reduction in water resources have been proposed morote et al 2017 rey et al 2016 the tsa operation is subject to a water transfer rule defined by royal decree 638 2021 that presents four levels based on the total volume stored in entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs and the inflow to the system in the previous twelve months each level establishes the monthly quantity of water that can be transferred to the segura river basin moreover a maximum monthly release to the tagus river is set depending on the domestic irrigation and environmental demands in the tagus upper basin the rule has been long contested by both sides generating debates especially on the high occurrence of level 3 or 4 where minimum or no water transfer is allowed and on the most adequate environmental flow to be set in the tagus river the control parameters of the rule underwent several modifications over the years until the approval of the current rule in 2021 and the debate about which are the optimal parameters to meet the interests of all the parties involved is still open larraz et al 2020 scrats 2020 setting adequate operating rules is key to manage conflicts between donor and receiving regions policies and regulations are essential to guarantee the success of water transfer projects zhuang 2016 however reservoirs are usually operated with non efficient predefined ruled macian sorribes and pulido velazquez 2020 and the expected design goals are often not achieved dobson et al 2019 although the problem of designing optimal reservoir operations has been extensively studied the complexity of real word systems limited the practical application of the methods proposed in the literature ren et al 2019 multi objective simulation optimization frameworks recently emerged as a valuable strategy for optimal resource allocation heinz et al 2007 maier et al 2014 veena et al 2021 several studies have been conducted to design optimal operating rules addressing multiple objectives such as agricultural urban and ecological water demand hydropower generation and energy consumption gu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 ming et al 2017 zeng et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 the most representative simulation optimization method is the evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps which combines direct policy search a nonlinear approximating network and a multi objective evolutionary algorithm giuliani et al 2016 emodps exploits the parameterization of the operating policies and explores the associated parameter space to find a parameterized policy that optimizes the expected system performance giuliani et al 2018 the effectiveness of emodps in addressing reservoirs operation in complex multi objective contexts has been demonstrated for a review see giuliani et al 2021 and references therein and its potential to improve water transfer strategies has been recently explored ren et al 2019 veena et al 2021 after the recent modification of the tsa water transfer rule in 2021 no further changes are expected in near future however the topic is still intensely debated with the collision of opposing views from one side the respect for the priority of the donor basin and the achievement of its good ecological status and on the other side the concern on the effects that such a goal would produce on the economy of the recipient regions while some proposals have been made to improve the water transfer rule de lucas 2019 cedex 2020 larraz et al 2020 advanced methods such as the emodps have not yet been tested by applying this approach to the tsa case this paper intends to widen the solutions space explored so far and to contribute to the ongoing debate on the present and future of this controversial water transfer in spain we also evaluate the potential of the emodps approach to guide the design of alternative operating rules for water transfers with the ultimate goal of mitigating tensions between recipient and donor regions and seeking to fulfil the environmental needs of the donor basin we employ emodps to optimize the operation of the tsa with respect to four potentially conflicting objectives i the tagus water demands urban water supply irrigation and environmental flow maintenance ii the segura water demands urban water supply and irrigation iii hydropower production downstream of the entrepeñas and buendía dams and iv the socioeconomic benefit of the population living on reservoirs shores we jointly optimize the re operation of the two headwaters reservoirs and the existing water transfer policy thus allowing the exploration of trade offs between objectives and the definition of an operating rule that could benefit the main stakeholders involved we tested the optimization under a scenario of increased environmental flow in the tagus river as established by the 2021 2027 tagus river basin management plan this allowed us to assess the effect produced by this mitigation measure on the competing objectives and design an operating rule sufficiently robust to deal with such a scenario 2 case study description 2 1 the tsa system the tsa system in operation since 1979 consists of a 286 km long pipeline with a maximum annual transfer capacity of 650 hm 3 the donor regions include castilla la mancha madrid and extremadura up to 600 hm 3 year are allocated to the region of murcia segura river basin the province of alicante in the valencia region and to a lesser extent the province of almería in andalusia in addition 50 hm 3 year can be transferred to the guadiana basin for ecological and urban water supply purposes the tsa infrastructure begins in the bolarque reservoir downstream from the headwaters reservoirs entrepeñas and buendía fig 1a from bolarque the water is pumped to the bujeda reservoir from where it is conducted towards the alarcón reservoir on the júcar river and then to the talave reservoir on the mundo river the main tributary of the segura river melgarejo moreno et al 2019 the aqueduct connects river basins that are strategic for water resources management in spain and portugal senent aparicio et al 2021 the tagus river basin is the longest river in the iberian peninsula and supplies water resources to approximately 15 of the spanish and 30 of the portuguese population lobanova et al 2017 the increasing water demand and the high number of dams regulating the river led to water scarcity problems and poor ecological status in some water bodies sondermann and de oliveira 2021 the segura basin is one of the most water stressed regions in the mediterranean basin aldaya et al 2019 the estimated annual structural deficit in the basin is 458 hm 3 year especially concerning the agricultural water use which represents 86 of the total demand in the basin chs 2015 climate change is expected to further exacerbate this deficit rupérez moreno et al 2017 the intensely irrigated horticultural and fruit crops are essential to sustain the basin s economy the export of vegetables and fruits to eu countries can exceed 70 of the total production so the region has become known as the orchard of europe martin gorriz et al 2021 the tsa enabled the socioeconomic development of southeast spain morote et al 2020 according to the central irrigation union of the tagus segura scrats by its spanish acronym the aqueduct generates a total economic impact of more than 3 013 billion i e 4 6 of the gross domestic product and provides 106 566 direct jobs in the alicante and murcia provinces scrats 2020 on the other side the tsa spurred the uncontrolled expansion of irrigation and urban water demand leading to the paradox of increasing the initial water deficit in the receiving basin hernández mora and del moral 2015 wwf 2009 since 1997 the water transfer rule foresees four levels according to which the transferred volume is calculated at the beginning of each month table 1 the transferred volume varies according to the total storage of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs and the inflow to the system in the previous 12 months with a maximum water transfer of 650 hm 3 in each hydrological year moreover the rule establishes a maximum monthly release to the tagus river that includes the urban and irrigation water demand downstream of the bolarque dam as well as the environmental flow the operating rule has often been contested by stakeholders and has undergone several modifications over the years table 1 the infrastructure was intended to transfer surplus tagus water i e resources in excess of water demand for urban water supply irrigation hydroelectric production and environmental flow maintenance in the donor basin hernández mora and del moral 2015 as defined by law 21 2015 however the estimation of surplus resources in the donor basin has been long questioned arguing that the environmental effects have been not rigorously taken into account hernández mora et al 2014 rey et al 2016 according to wwf 2009 the reduced stream flows have affected riparian vegetation along the tagus river and have limited the river capacity to dilute the polluted flows produced by the madrid region resulting in water quality problems between aranjuez and toledo bolinches et al 2020 hernández mora and del moral 2015 the high frequency of situations in which the system falls into level 3 or even in level 4 where no transfer is allowed was brought to the attention of the ministry in charge of setting the rules this circumstance creates negative impacts on the population living on the shores of the reservoirs in the area of origin limiting tourism and recreational activities san martín et al 2018 as well as in the segura basin due to the instability and irregularity of the water transfer cedex 2020 such a situation arises from the combination of two elements the reduction of the natural runoff registered in the basin since the 1980s and the choice of certain control parameters in the operating rule since the design of the transfer in the 1960s the tagus headwater suffered a reduction of natural inflows by 47 san martín et al 2020 thus leading to the under exploitation of the infrastructure with respect to the design targets specifically annual transferred volumes have averaged about 350 hm 3 since 1979 instead of the projected 600 hm 3 senent aparicio et al 2021 at the same time some studies consider the transferred volume at level 2 to be unsustainable de lucas 2019 cabezas 2013 and the storage and inflow thresholds for entering in level 1 too low de lucas 2019 larraz et al 2020 in 2021 the water transfer rule was revised to lower the probability of occurrence of levels 3 and 4 cedex 2020 the volume to be transferred in level 2 was decreased to 27 hm 3 m o n t h while the inflow threshold for entering level 1 was increased to 1400 hm 3 however other studies propose even smaller values for the transferred volume at level 2 and suggest an increase also in the storage threshold de lucas 2019 larraz et al 2020 a further critical issue is the environmental flow ef to be ensured in the tagus river which directly influences the maximum monthly release target until the entry into force of the 2021 2027 tagus river basin management plan rbmp the legislation required a constant flow of 6 m 3 s at the aranjuez gauge the first monitoring point for the control of the environmental flow requirements located 100 km downstream of the bolarque dam this value was not technically supported and has been long contested a sentence of the spanish supreme court 309 2019 which repealed several articles of the tagus rbmp for not containing an adequate determination of the ef in aranjuez and in other three strategic water bodies molina 2019 forced the modification of the original value of the ef the 2021 2027 tagus rbmp foresees a gradual increase of the ef up to an average value of 8 6 m 3 s in 2027 while from the tagus perspective this value has been judged as insufficient baeza 2021 scrats argued that this value will significantly compromise the annual volume transferred to the segura basin scrats 2020 2 2 model description the model developed in this work consists of three main components entrepeñas reservoir tagus river buendía reservoir guadiela river and the aqueduct fig 1b since entrepeñas reservoir has a lower storage capacity with respect to buendía 802 hm 3 vs 1638 hm 3 but a higher inflow a tunnel connects the two reservoirs the modelled system was simplified excluding the bolarque reservoir tagus river just downstream of entrepeñas and buendía given its very low storage capacity and its main use for daily regulation and hydropower production the monthly dynamics of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs are described through the following water mass balance equations 1 s t 1 e s t e i t 1 e r t 1 e t t 1 e e t e a t e 2 s t 1 b s t b i t 1 b t t 1 e r t 1 b e t b a t b where s t e b is the storage at the beginning of month t i t 1 e b is the inflow to the reservoir t t 1 e is the volume of water eventually transferred from entrepeñas to buendía through the connecting tunnel r t 1 e b is the volume of water released and e t e b a t e b is the water evaporated in the time interval t t 1 in particular e t e b is the mean monthly evaporation rate while a t e b is the reservoir surface area uniquely defined by a nonlinear relation given the storage s t e b the actual release r t 1 e b depends on the monthly release decision u t e b provided by the operating policy which is forced within a certain operational zone by the maximum and minimum feasible release due to some physical e g activation of the spillways and normative e g minimum environmental flow maintenance limitations the volume transferred to the segura river basin qs t 1 is then established by applying a water transfer rule dependent on the total storage of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs and the inflow to the system in the previous 12 months i t tot 12 see table 1 for

formulations 1 tagus river deficit j tag m 3 s 2 the monthly average squared deficit with respect to the monthly tagus water demand w t tagus including urban agricultural and environmental needs to be minimized defined as 5 j tag 1 h t 0 h 1 w t tagus qt t 1 2 the squared deficit aims to numerically favour several small deficits over a small number of large deficits hashimoto et al 1982 the plus sign in the equation means that only positive differences are counted as deficits accordingly a release to the tagus river higher than w t tagus is allowed and not penalized not to impose restrictions on the discharge flowing in the donor river while still respecting the maximum release defined by the operational zone of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs 2 aqueduct deficit j aq m 3 s 2 the monthly

an abacus that relates the hydraulic jump the turbined flow and the power retrieved from official design documents eptisa 2000b 2000a 3 methods and tools the approach adopted in this study focuses on addressing two main issues of the debated implementation of the tsa water transfer rule see section 2 1 the best volume to be transferred in level 2 and the impact that the 2027 ef will produce on the system the aim is to design an operating policy that could guarantee a workable compromise between the main stakeholders involved and be sufficiently robust in the near future scenario of reduced water resources availability the purpose of this work is not to estimate the water needs of the donor and receiving basins indeed the domestic and irrigation water demand in the tagus and segura basins as well as the non transferable reserve in the headwaters are assumed to be those specified in the 2021 water transfer rule we keep the same 4 level scheme currently used but we do not impose the tagus water demand as the maximum possible release to the tagus river this avoids limiting the discharge flowing into the donor basin 3 1 evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps the framework adopted in this study foresees the generation of decision alternatives i e candidate operating policies with associated alternative volume v l 2 to be transferred at level 2 via multi objective optimization specifically according to giuliani et al 2021 the multi objective optimization problem can be formulated as follows 9 π argmin π j π where j π j tag j aq j st j hyd subject to eqs 1 2 the objective j hyd is multiplied by 1 to ensure the correct direction of optimization finding π p v l 2 means finding both the optimal operating policy p and the optimal time invariant volume v l 2 to be transferred in level 2 that minimize the four dimensional objective function j π we solve this optimal control and planning problem using the evolutionary multi objective direct policy search approach emodps that transforms the optimal control problem into a planning one by parameterizing the control policy p ϑ within a predefined class of functions and exploring the parameter space through multi objective evolutionary algorithms in order to identify a set of pareto approximate policies giuliani et al 2016 a solution is defined as pareto optimal if there is no other solution that presents a better value for one objective without worsening the performance in at least one other objective using the emodps approach the above planning and control problem can be solved by jointly evolving solutions in a complex search space formed by the parameters of the control policy and the volume v l 2 within a single optimization process bertoni et al 2019 giudici et al 2019 specifically a random set of initial parameters is defined and used as input to run a system simulation over the time horizon h starting from the simulation outputs the objective functions are computed and used by the optimization algorithm to update the parameter set the new parameter set is then introduced into the simulation again and the process is repeated until the maximum number of function evaluations is reached giuliani et al 2016 macian sorribes and pulido velazquez 2020 in this study we parameterize the water reservoir operating policy by means of nonlinear approximating networks using gaussian radial basis functions rbfs the release decision u t k for the kth of k reservoirs at time t is therefore calculated as follows 10 u t k i 1 n w i k φ i i t where n is the number of rbfs φ i and w i k is the weight of the i th rbf the weights are formulated such that they sum to one i 1 n w i k 1 and are nonnegative w i k 0 i k as for the single rbf it is defined as follows 11 φ i i t exp j 1 m i t j c i j 2 b i j 2 where m is the number of policy inputs i t c i and b i are the m dimensional centre and radius vectors of the i th rbf the centres must lie within the input bounded space and the radii must be strictly positive i e for normalized variables c i j 1 1 and b i j 0 1 as a result the parameters vector employed for the parametrization of the operating policy is defined as ϑ c i j b i j w i k r n ϑ where i 1 n j 1 m n ϑ n 2 m k and k number of policy outputs in this work the input vector i t includes the following four elements the time t expressed as a combination of sine and cosine functions sin 2 π t 365 and cos 2 π t 365 and the storage in the entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs s t e and s t b the number of policy outputs is 2 i e the release decisions for the two reservoirs considering n 8 m 4 and k 2 the total number of parameters to be optimized is equal to 81 i e 80 parameters of the control policy and 1 parameter representing the volume v l 2 to be transferred in the level 2 this latter parameter can vary between 0 and 40 hm 3 month in order to explore the parameter space and discover optimal values we employ multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas specifically we adopted the self adaptive borg moea algorithm hadka and reed 2013 since it is highly robust across a wide number of challenging multi objective problems by meeting or exceeding the performance of other state of the art moeas r gupta et al 2020 zatarain salazar et al 2016 the borg moea is based on an epsilon dominance archiving requiring the users to specify a numerical threshold on each optimization objective below which they are insensitive to changes in performance in this study we adopt epsilon dominance values equal to 10 for j aq 2 for j tagus 7500 for j hydr and 10 000 000 for j storage these epsilon values represent the significance of precision that is considered consequential in evaluating decision trade offs each optimization was run for ten random seeds to improve solution diversity and avoid randomness dependence in addition each seed was run up to 500 000 function evaluations which proved to be sufficient by visual inspection of search progress the final set of pareto approximate system configurations for each computational experiment was computed as the reference set of non dominated solutions obtained across the ten optimization trials according to the most recent reviews dobson et al 2019 giuliani et al 2021 macian sorribes and pulido velazquez 2020 the use of emodps to design closed loop operating policies presents substantial advantages over the methods traditionally adopted in the literature its ability to overcome the curses of dimensionality modelling and multiple objectives giuliani et al 2016 allows handling systems with more than three reservoirs widening the number and complexity of objectives and directly using exogenous information this is particularly relevant in today s complex context where the operational decision making should balance multisectoral human pressures and environmental degradation and consider a wide range of hydroclimatic uncertainties arising by climate change giuliani et al 2021 3 2 scenarios setting we run the optimization on the 1998 2018 inflows and estimated evaporation rates as water transfer parameters we chose the ones established in the 2021 rule see table 1 except for the volume v l 2 to be transferred in level 2 which is optimized by the model we tested the optimization under two scenarios of ef implementation in the tagus river the baseline scenario sc0 considers the ef required by the 2015 2021 tagus rbmp while the second scenario sc1 considers the increased ef to be implemented by 2027 the ef is included in the tagus water demand objective which then varies across scenarios as shown in table 2 scenario sc1 which implies an increased discharge flowing in the tagus river is expected to exacerbate tensions among stakeholders further we thus explore whether increasing the degree of freedom of the current rule could allow exploring a more comprehensive range of solutions raising the chance of finding a compromise policy de lucas 2019 and larraz et al 2020 found by trial and error tests that a rule without level 1 could significantly favour the storage objective the high water volume that can be transferred in level 1 prevents the recovery of the reservoir s level and jeopardise the state of the system in the following months following this insight we tested a modified version of the second scenario sc1 mod where we set a high volume threshold for entering level 1 2000 hm 3 instead of 1300 hm 3 this allows eliminating level 1 without modifying the framework of the water transfer rule as prescribed by law 21 2015 moreover the volume to be transferred in level 3 was also lowered to the minimum possible water supply i e emergency irrigation and domestic water supply de lucas 2019 in order to better balance the water transfer in the different levels the pareto optimal solutions are compared with the historical policy estimated from historical time series of levels and releases since the historical water transfer rule underwent several modifications over the years see table 1 above we also consider the performance of the policies obtained by applying the 2014 and the 2021 water transfer rule to the 1998 2018 inflow series henceforth 2014 and 2021 policy these rules simplify the system by assuming a unique conceptual reservoir without specifying how volume and release are distributed between the two reservoirs consequently it is impossible to distinguish between the single hydropower production in entrepeñas and buendía dams 4 results and discussion 4 1 baseline scenario sc0 parallel plots are used to show the pareto optimal policies retrieved by solving the optimization problem defined in eq 9 the general structure of a parallel plot is shown in fig 2a each polyline is a different policy each parallel axis represents an optimization objective and the crossing points identify the performance of a certain policy in the different objectives for example the policy represented by the grey line presents an aqueduct deficit equal to 400 m 3 s 2 while the tagus deficit is 10 m 3 s 2 the axes are oriented so that the highest level of achievement of each objective is always at the bottom i e minimum deficit for aqueduct tagus and storage and maximum hydropower production this means that the green line represents the ideal solution while the red line corresponds to the worst one conflicts are designated as diagonal lines between two adjacent axes and the extent of the conflicts is proportional to their slope for example comparing the grey and the pink lines a clear conflict between aqueduct and tagus objectives emerges while both policies show similar performance in storage and hydropower objectives the optimal solutions obtained in the baseline scenario are shown in fig 2b all lines have been coloured according to their performance on the tagus objective with dark green representing a smaller deficit unsurprisingly tagus and aqueduct are the most conflicting objectives as shown by the inversion of the colour gradients along the two respective axes in fig 2b this conflict results because the total release from the headwaters dams at the diversion point is split between the tagus and the segura basins the performance of the pareto optimal policies is compared with the historical 2014 and 2021 policies red yellow and light blue line in fig 2b the historical system operation minimizes the tagus deficit and simultaneously demonstrates good performance in aqueduct and hydropower objectives this is coherent with the fulfilment of the tagus water demand having the highest priority followed by domestic and agricultural water needs of the segura river basin while the hydropower production has the lowest priority at the same time the historical policy generates high storage deficit which is in line with the historical records of low water levels registered in entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs the scant attention given to the recreational objective has been questioned since it contradicts the priority that should be given to the entire donor basin not only to the river stretch downstream of the tsa diversion san martín et al 2018 the objective values obtained by applying the 2014 and the 2021 water transfer rule are similar to those derived from the implementation of the historical policy except for the storage deficit which presents a 38 reduction by applying the 2021 policy all the optimized solutions strongly improve the storage objective compared to the historical and 2014 policies with a deficit reduction ranging between 30 and 98 the 2021 policy is outperformed by the optimized solutions in 99 of cases each pareto optimal solution is associated with an optimal monthly volume v l 2 to be transferred in the level 2 represented by the colour of the polylines in fig 2c where maximum values are blue and minimum are yellow operating policies with high volume v l 2 dominate the set of solutions and a colour pattern can be identified high values of v l 2 between 27 and 40 hm 3 month are associated with low aqueduct deficit while values lower than 27 hm 3 month are limited to those policies that produce little tagus and storage deficits since by law the water use priority has to be ensured to the donor basin we focused only on the subset of solutions that minimize the tagus deficit i e with performance equal to or better than the historical solution within this subset two groups of solutions with a conflicting behaviour can be identified a the solutions that minimize the aqueduct deficit and b the ones that minimize the storage deficit the distribution of their performance in each objective is shown by two groups of box plots a and b in fig 3 a significant conflict between aqueduct and storage objective is detected in the first group by imposing a deficit in the aqueduct lower than the historical value the minimum storage deficit is about 5 10 7 m 3 in the second group this value can be further minimized until a near zero deficit but a higher aqueduct deficit must be assumed the scatter plots in fig 3 show the individual solutions coloured according to the associated optimal value of volume v l 2 in the first group v l 2 values lie in the range between 26 3 and 36 8 hm 3 month these values are in line with the ones adopted in the 2014 and 2021 water transfer rules i e 38 and 27 hm 3 month lower values in this range enable a lower storage deficit a volume v l 2 equal to 26 3 hm 3 month corresponds to the solution that maximizes the storage deficit reduction 86 in the first group the second group of solutions generally presents low values of volume v l 2 80 of optimized solutions present a volume to be transferred in level 2 lower than 30 hm 3 month among the subset of solutions with minimum tagus deficit equal or lower than the historical value we identified the best policy for each objective see coloured lines in fig 4a the relative trajectories of total reservoir s storage water transfer and tagus release in the hydrological years 2012 2014 are plotted in fig 4b as an example table 3 reports the volume v l 2 associated to each best policy as well as the mean annual water transfer and the percentage of times the total reservoir s level falls into level 1 or 2 in the studied period under the minimum tagus deficit constraint the aqueduct deficit could be further minimized with respect to the historical performance but the improvement is limited by the strong conflict with the tagus objective specifically the aqueduct deficit can be reduced by 21 at most blue line in fig 4a leading to a mean annual water transfer of 359 hm 3 but implying a quite high cost for the storage objective almost 26 of the time the total reservoir s level falls into level 3 or 4 a near zero deficit for tagus storage and hydropower objectives can be achieved at the expense of the aqueduct objective leading to a mean annual water transfer minor than 300 hm 3 see green pink and orange lines in fig 4a in order to select a possible compromise policy we first identified the solutions that perform better than the historical policy in all the four objectives within this subset we then selected the policy with the lowest tagus and storage deficit giving priority to the donor basin we thus ended up with the compromise policy represented by the black line in fig 4a the same result would be obtained also by applying the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 to the subset of solutions exceeding the historical performance with equal weights assigned to all the objectives the performance of the compromise solution in terms of aqueduct tagus and hydropower deficit is slightly better than the historical solution while the storage deficit is reduced by 66 as shown in table 3 the mean annual transfer is 311 2 hm 3 and the total reservoir s level falls into level 1 or 2 for the vast majority of the time 93 the storage deficit varies throughout the year with a better performance in winter and spring as shown in fig s1 this solution is obtained with a volume v l 2 to be transferred in level 2 equal to 28 2 hm 3 month it is important to underline that other compromise operating policies could be chosen the pareto optimal solutions shown in fig 4a are the starting point for a negotiation process among the stakeholders that will end up with a set of compromise alternatives to be submitted to the decision maker for the final political decision see castelletti and soncini sessa 2006 for details even in cases where the values of the volume v l 2 are close to the ones adopted in the 2014 and 2021 water transfer rule i e 38 and 27 hm 3 month the model is able to generate optimized policies with improved performance with respect to the 2014 and 2021 solutions especially in terms of storage deficit this is due to the fact that the optimized policies introduce a novelty with respect to the existing rule generating water transfers that cyclically vary according to the hydrological period of the year for example if we compare the solution obtained by applying the 2021 water transfer rule with an optimized solution presenting the same volume v l 2 27 hm 3 month the water transfer trajectories differ from each other see fig s2 the 2021 water transfer rule only depends on storage levels this means that whenever the total storage falls into level 1 or 2 the maximum monthly water volume allowed at that level is transferred conversely in some cases where the storage level falls into level 1 or 2 the transfer volume prescribed by the optimized operating policy is lower than that allowed the re operation of entrepeñas and buendía dams and the water transfer rule are jointly optimized this implies that the modelled water transfer trajectory presents the same cyclostationary behaviour as the total release from the headwaters reservoirs with storage accumulation in winter and higher release in summer to meet the downstream tagus demand see blue line in the second panel of fig s2 coupling the 4 level water transfer rule with the cyclostationary time index allows for expanding the search for solutions and significantly improving the storage objective other studies seem to support the idea of a water transfer operating rule that varies according to the period of the year different water transfer triggering mechanisms have been proposed to decide when to transfer a certain water volume from the donor to the recipient basin water transfer decisions can be determined by the water transfer rule curve based on the storage of the recipient reservoir xi et al 2010 on storage of donor reservoir or on storage of both guo et al 2012 zeng et al 2014 in all cases the water transfer rule curve presents a seasonal trend according to flood and dry periods zhu et al 2014 proposed an optimised water transfer rule with diversion flows that vary at different periods of hydrological stage and reservoir water level zones for the tsa system villarrubia 2018 demonstrated that an inter annual water transfer rule that also considers inflows to the segura basin would be able to store volume in wet years and meet the water demand in dry years 4 2 increased ef scenarios we run the optimization under the scenario sc1 which simulates the situation that will occur in 2027 with the implementation of the increased ef established in the 2021 2027 tagus rbmp the obtained pareto optimal policies are plotted in fig 5 light blue polylines as expected the solutions are shifted towards a higher aqueduct deficit with respect to the baseline scenario as there are no solutions with an aqueduct deficit lower than 119 m 3 s 2 corresponding to a mean annual water transfer of 387 9 hm 3 year the storage deficit also increases in a subset of solutions the pattern of volume v l 2 is similar to the one observed in the baseline with low values leading to low tagus and storage deficits fig s3a supplementary material for the subset of solutions that presents a minimum deficit in the tagus river the aqueduct deficit is always higher than the historical one and equal to 214 m 3 s 2 corresponding to a mean annual water transfer of 275 5 hm 3 year in the best case this suggests that the current controversy between the donor and the receiving basin would be further exacerbated in the scenario sc1 moreover the conflict between the aqueduct and storage objective is even more acute than the one observed in the baseline scenario if we want to keep the aqueduct deficit as small as possible e g lower than 250 m 3 s 2 the minimum storage deficit is about 10 8 m 3 group a fig 6a this value can be further minimized only by generating a higher aqueduct deficit group b fig 6a as shown by the scatter plots in fig 6a this scenario reinforces the positive association between low values of volume v l 2 and low storage deficit climate change is expected to exacerbarte this situation with a reduction in the transferred volume by more than 60 senent aparicio et al 2021 or even up to 79 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 moreover sondermann and de oliveira 2021 proved that the implementation of planned environmental flow requirements will decrease the ability of the system to satisfy the demands of the agriculture sector in the tagus river in such an alarming context complementary strategies have to be considered in the segura basin such as desalinization and treated reused water morote et al 2017 or new water markets options and insurance policies rey et al 2016 unlike the baseline scenario imposing a higher ef in the tagus river limits the chance of finding an optimized solution with a good trade off between the different objectives we thus introduced the hypothesis that a rule with a higher degree of freedom no level 1 could expand the solutions space and tested the optimization under the scenario sc1 mod the number of solutions significantly decreases thus suggesting that the model is able to find a smaller subset of optimized solutions the pattern of values of volume v l 2 is more marked and shifted to values equal or minor than 25 hm 3 month as shown in fig s3b supplementary material the pareto front between the aqueduct and tagus deficit does not change across sc1 and sc1 mod while the pareto front between storage and tagus objective is confined to the area of low storage deficit see pink polylines in fig 5 this implies that for the subset of solutions with a minimum tagus deficit and under the same constraints considered above i e an aqueduct deficit lower than 250 m 3 s 2 the model is now able to outperform sc1 in the storage objective generating policies with a storage deficit lower than 10 8 m 3 group a fig 6b the values of v l 2 associated with these solutions are mainly between 20 and 24 hm 3 month unlike the previous scenarios the solutions that minimize tagus aqueduct and storage objectives do not belong to two different conflicting groups but rather overlap see groups a b fig 6b the removal of level 1 in the water transfer rule together with low values of the volume to be transferred in level 2 leads to a significant improvement in the system performance in the scenario of increased ef and enables finding a good trade off between aqueduct and storage objectives under the constraint of a minimum tagus deficit for example the solution with the lowest increase in the aqueduct deficit compared to the historical policy 10 presents a strong storage deficit reduction 73 5 conclusions this paper explores the potential of emodps to improve the historical management of the tagus segura aqueduct tsa a controversial interbasin water transfer in spain the re operation of entrepeñas and buendía reservoirs and the existing water transfer policy specifically the monthly volume to be transferred in level 2 are jointly optimized under two scenarios of environmental flow implementation in the tagus river among the wide range of pareto optimal solutions generated in the baseline scenario we could identify a possible compromise policy which is able to perform as well as the historical solution in the objectives of water releases to the tagus river water transfers through the aqueduct and hydropower generation while strongly improving the objective of ensuring a certain level of storage in the headwaters reservoirs for recreational uses the associated optimized water transfer policy presents control parameters in line with the ones currently defined by law the optimal volume to be transferred in level 2 turns out to be 28 2 hm 3 month but introduces a novelty in the mechanism triggering the water transfer to the segura basin the transferred volume depends not only on the volume stored in the headwaters reservoirs and on the inflow to the system but also on the hydrological stage of the year the resulting cyclostationary behaviour of the water transfer allows for minimising the occurrence of situations with low storage level level 3 and 4 benefiting the populations living on the shores of the reservoirs and also ensuring more stability to the tsa functioning we also assessed the effect that the environmental flow to be implemented by 2027 in the tagus river will have on the entire system the results show that the current tensions between the donor and the receiving basin will be further exacerbated in this scenario according to the model the aqueduct deficit will increase by at least 10 with respect to the historical performance thus suggesting that complementary strategies for meeting the water demand in the segura basin have to be considered moreover an increased conflict between the aqueduct and storage objective limits the chance of finding a compromise solution in this scenario the elimination of level 1 in the water transfer rule would enable obtaining optimal solutions that keep the aqueduct deficit as small as possible and at the same time present good performance in the storage objective such solutions are associated with low volumes to be transferred in level 2 mainly between 20 and 24 hm 3 month increasing the degree of freedom of the water transfer rule coupled with a lower value of volume v l 2 seems then a promising approach to widen the solutions space and design a compromise policy also in this more complex scenario of increased ef the model proposed in this paper considers the main stakeholders involved in the tsa system and offers compromise solutions looking at the present and future of this infrastructure the operating policies identified are in line with current legislation since we set up the model in order to respect the criteria specified in law 21 2015 the cyclostationary variation of the transferred volume in level 2 would be the novelty aspect of the rule the pressing need for recovering the good status of the freshwater ecosystems and the expected reduction in water resources availability in the near future make it necessary to design alternative and sustainable operating rules of water transfers able to assuage tensions between recipient and donor regions and fulfil the environmental needs in the donor basin by applying emodps to an emblematic case study this paper confirms the potential of this

7729,the lake victoria basin home of africa s largest freshwater lake experienced extensive floods in 2019 2020 and anomalous drought conditions in early 2022 both antithetical hydrological events raised concerns for an estimated 35 million people within the basin who are vulnerable to these continually recurrent hydrometeorological extremes while there is a need for high resolution spatial and temporal hydrological monitoring in situ observations are limited and insufficient within the basin this study assesses the capability of publicly available earth observations and models to capture the occurrence of recent hydrological extremes within the lake victoria basin spatial and temporal comparisons of the following hydrological variables are conducted within the lake victoria basin from june 2002 june 2022 precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture lake height and total water storage anomaly twsa results from the time series and spatial analyses confirm that the anomalous wet and dry events respectively occurred from october 2019 march 2020 and november 2021 march 2021 the observations also indicated a quick recovery from the drought event by june 2022 additionally a comparison of 9 km soil moisture and 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture products improves understanding of wetness spatial variability within the basin these results were validated using in situ soil moisture data available through the international soil moisture network making this the first study to validate the downscaled 1 km soil moil moisture product within the african continent methods from this study demonstrate the utility of a diverse array of publicly available earth observation and model data to improve understanding of recent hydrological anomalies and extreme events within the lake victoria basin this can be applied to water resources management particularly in regions lacking sufficient in situ hydrological data keywords lake victoria flood drought hydrology earth observations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction africa s largest lake lake victoria provides valuable ecosystem services to five east african countries within its basin burundi kenya rwanda tanzania and uganda freshwater from lake victoria supports domestic use diverse aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and economic industries including agriculture livestock fisheries and hydropower production awange 2020 2006 tourism recreation and transportation of goods via inland waterways are further supported by the lake awange 2020 reynolds 2005 as the source of the white nile river and a subbasin of the greater nile watershed the lake victoria basin plays a critical role in supplying freshwater locally to an estimated 35 million people and indirectly to 340 million people in downstream countries ramillien et al 2014 mugo et al 2020 over the previous decades hydrometeorological extremes such as floods and droughts have proven to be continual and recurrent in the lake victoria basin nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 historically devastating floods in this region occur practically every year during the october december rainy season and cause substantial loss of life and property nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 periods of extreme drought are equally concerning because decreased or delayed rainfall can lead to crop failure widespread famine and food insecurity coughlan de perez et al 2019 agutu et al 2017 fews net 2021 as the frequency and severity of hydrological extremes is predicted to increase due to climate change accurate and continual monitoring of hydrological conditions at the basin level is vital for sustainable water resources management alsdorf et al 2016 paris et al 2022 wainwright et al 2021 this is particularly true for the lake victoria basin particularly given that previous research has identified it as a significant hotspot for population climate burdens which are exacerbated by recurrent droughts and flooding due to variable rainfall lópez carr et al 2014 since the populations of burundi kenya rwanda tanzania and uganda are respectively forecasted to increase by 114 68 77 117 and 114 between mid 2020 and mid 2050 there is further motivation to improve water resources management to support such population growth and demands table 1 kaneda et al 2020 as with many regions in africa the lake victoria basin lacks sufficient in situ public and ground based hydrological observations to meet these needs khan et al 2010 hu et al 2021 ndehedehe et al 2016 while discharge data from uganda s hydropower dam located at lake victoria s outlet is collected this data is not publicly available this is likely due to political concerns regarding the agreed curve which is an international treaty between uganda and egypt through which uganda agrees to operate its hydropower dams in a way that reflect the natural outflows of lake victoria swenson and wahr 2009 shamsudduha et al 2017 kull 2006 vanderkelen et al 2018 getirana et al 2020 similarly the few ground based rainfall stations within the lake victoria basin are unreliably operated and sparsely distributed making it an insufficient data source for basin wide hydrological analyses awange et al 2019 therefore there is a need for publicly available and remotely observed hydrological data at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions in the lake victoria basin to monitor the recent hydrological extreme events satellite remote sensing has proven to be a useful tool to obtain hydrological observations in regions limited by sparse temporal and spatial coverage of ground based in situ data this is particularly true for comparisons of satellite sensor precipitation with gauge observations hashemi et al 2017 mondal et al 2018 le et al 2018 numerous studies have relied on remote sensing and land surface models to reliably estimate components of the hydrological cycle within the lake victoria basin and other african basins lakshmi et al 2018 khan et al 2010 awange 2020 ndehedehe et al 2016 vanderkelen et al 2018 becker et al 2010 grippa et al 2011 shamsudduha et al 2017 kansara et al 2021 other studies in the lower mekong river basin have also demonstrated the synergistic utility of satellite remote sensing observations within hydrological models mohammed et al 2018a 2018b 2018c le et al 2020 2022 these techniques particularly the utilization of a wide array of publicly available hydrological earth observations can be applied to the lake victoria basin to update previous studies and to compare the recent hydrological extreme events additionally this is a valuable method for collecting hydrological data across country borders since lake victoria is geopolitically divided between kenya 6 uganda 43 and tanzania 51 awange 2020 thus earth observations are a promising method for obtaining uniform and publicly available hydrological observations at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions across the international boundaries of this basin in this paper we examine components of the hydrological water balance precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and change in total water storage and additional hydrological variables soil moisture lake level height and lake extent for the lake victoria basin from june 2002 june 2022 with particular focus on the 2019 2020 flood events and the 2021 2022 drought period this is accomplished by leveraging publicly available data from seven satellite based earth observations and one land surface model which is necessary given the limited in situ data available in this region since previous studies identified the lake victoria basin as an area where populations are particularly vulnerable to seasonal hydrological variabilities we conducted a hydrological anomaly analysis at monthly timescales to identify periods of anomalous positive and negative hydrological conditions our analysis includes monthly basin wide averaged time series of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff total water storage anomaly soil moisture and lake level height from june 2002 june 2022 spatial anomaly plots at spatial resolution up to 0 1 are provided for precipitation evapotranspiration runoff total water storage anomaly and soil moisture for two months of interest the local maxima and minima monthly anomalies between january 2019 june 2022 these represent a wet and dry month which respectively occurred during the identified flood and drought events to our knowledge this is the first study to conduct a hydrological spatial anomaly comparison for the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought events in the lake victoria basin additionally to improve understanding of wetness spatial variability during the flood and drought periods a spatial comparison of 9 km near surface soil moisture and 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture products is included for the basin these spatial plots are displayed for the wet and dry months identified in the root zone soil moisture anomaly time series as local maxima and minima between january 2019 june 2022 the 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture data was validated using 28 ground soil moisture stations available via the international soil moisture network this is the first study to validate the 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture product within the african continent because the lake victoria basin and other areas in the greater horn of africa lack sufficient in situ soil moisture observations for widespread analysis validation and assessment of remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture data are vital for determining the utility of these data for future studies and operational usage agutu et al 2021 this is especially necessary for soil moisture due to the region s dependence on rain fed subsistence agriculture agutu et al 2021 methods from this study for observing hydrological anomalies as time series and spatial plots demonstrate a simple tool for monitoring hydrological variables using publicly available datasets in a region that is traditionally limited by insufficient ground observations these methods could be applied to inform water management and agricultural planning within the lake victoria basin as well as other regions lacking sufficient ground based hydrological observations further research could be conducted to assess applications of this work for water management here we show that earth observations can monitor hydrological variables during extreme and anomalous events such as the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought this work aims to support ongoing efforts to decrease the community s vulnerability to anomalous hydrological conditions such as extreme floods and droughts by improving monitoring of components of the hydrological cycle precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and change in total water storage and other hydrological variables soil moisture lake level height and lake extent within the lake victoria basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area lake victoria locally called lake nulabale is the largest tropical lake and the second largest freshwater lake in the world with an approximate surface area of 65 295 km2 awange 2020 despite its large spatial extent lake victoria is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 80 m and an average depth of 40 m nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 the basin has a catchment surface area of approximately 229 815 km2 and encompasses portions of uganda kenya tanzania rwanda and burundi hamilton 2016 a singular outlet of lake victoria is found at ripon falls near jinja uganda here the lake victoria basin directly contributes to the white nile river thus as shown in fig 1a the lake victoria basin is a subbasin of the nile watershed a digital elevation model dem of the lake victoria basin derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm is shown in fig 1b usgs 2018 tectonic and volcanic activity within the great rift valley contribute to the basin s varying topography which ranges in altitude from approximately 1109 4309 m above mean sea level msl the highest elevations are found in the northeastern mountainous regions in kenya and along the southwestern edge of the basin in burundi and rwanda the lowest elevations are found directly along the perimeter of lake victoria approximately 25 major rivers within the basin contribute directly to lake victoria vanderkelen et al 2018 however precipitation accounts for approximately 86 of the input into lake victoria nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 the humid tropical climate in combination with lake victoria s large extent contribute to a distinct diurnal meteorological pattern within the basin during afternoons intense convective thunderstorms typically form over the land due to a nocturnal lake land breeze system shamsudduha et al 2017 thiery et al 2016 2017 on seasonal timescales the long rains and short rains respectively occur from may march and september november hydrological patterns within the basin are further influenced on seasonal and interannual scales by the intertropical convergence zone itcz the indian ocean dipole iod and the el ñino southern oscillation enso wainwright et al 2021 becker et al 2010 fews net 2020 2021 2 1 1 land cover of the lake victoria basin land cover classifications derived from modis terra and aqua reflectance data at a spatial resolution of 500 m are shown for the lake victoria basin in fig 2 for purposes of this study land cover is assumed to be constant between june 2019 to june 2022 since analysis of land cover change were outside the scope of this study inland waterbodies including lake victoria make up 25 of the basin s total area grasslands are 35 of the basin area and are predominately located in tanzania croplands including natural vegetation mosaics are collectively 21 of the basin extent and include portions of all five countries the main crops produced within the basin are maize beans sorghum millet paddy rice sugarcane tea coffee cotton and meats reynolds 2005 mugo et al 2020 only 0 2 of the basin area is classified as urban and built up lands even though an estimated 35 million people live within a 100 km buffer zone of lake victoria mugo et al 2020 a study conducted by mugo et al 2020 used optical imagery from landsat and field data to assess land use changes between 1985 and 2014 in the lake victoria basin and found an 800 increase in urbanized areas between 1985 and 2020 mugo et al 2020 human centric activities were found to be the primary motivation for land use land cover changes during this period particularly through the conversion of forests woodlands grasslands and wetlands to farmlands and settlements mugo et al 2020 2 2 data a summary table of the satellite based earth observations and model outputs used in this study for precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture root zone and near surface lake height and total water storage anomaly twsa are summarized in table 2 each variable was averaged at a monthly timescale in the native resolution of the source data monthly spatial averages were calculated across the basin extent to construct time series for each variable for spatial mapping purposes precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and root zone soil moisture were re gridded to a common spatial resolution the near surface soil moisture observations were not gridded to allow for spatial comparison of the 9 km and 1 km products similarly twsa was not re gridded to avoid misleading visual representation of these data given the coarse spatial resolution of grace lake height is assumed to be constant across the extent of lake victoria and thus is not spatially mapped further details concerning each data product can be found in sections 2 2 1 2 2 6 2 2 1 precipitation data from the integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg the integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg is a joint mission between the national aeronautics space administration nasa and the japan aerospace and exploration agency jaxa which uses a constellation of satellites with passive microwave and infrared sensors to provide high spatial and temporal resolution precipitation measurements huffman et al 2015 for regions lacking ground based in situ precipitation measurements remotely sensed precipitation observations are commonly used from gpm imerg the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2015 dezfuli et al 2017 for purposes of this study gpm imerg final precipitation l3 v06 and gpm imerg late precipitation l3 v06 were used to obtain monthly precipitation data at 0 1 spatial resolution from june 2002 june 2022 this was used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly precipitation anomalies more

imaging spectroradiometer modis the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is a sensor onboard the sun synchronous polar orbiting satellites terra and aqua in this study modis was used to obtain monthly evapotranspiration data from june 2002 to june 2022 and one year of land cover data 2019 the global modis evapotranspiration product is based on the penman monteith equation mu et al 2007 2011 this product has a temporal repeat of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 0 05 running et al 2017 for this study the modis mod16a2 006 evapotranspiration data were averaged at monthly timescales to construct a time series and spatial plots of monthly evapotranspiration anomalies it is important to note that the modis mod16a2 006 evapotranspiration product masks inland water thus a limitation of this observation data source is that no evapotranspiration data is available directly over lake victoria the modis mcd12q1 006 product was used to construct a map of land cover type for the lake victoria basin in 2019 using the annual international geosphere biosphere program igbp classification scheme friedl et al 2019 additional information about modis evapotranspiration and land cover products can be found at https modis gsfc nasa gov 2 2 3 runoff and root zone soil moisture data from the global land data assimilation system gldas the global land data assimilation system gldas is a global high resolution 0 25 publicly available hydrological model that assimilates ground and satellite based observations in offline land surface models to output land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 for hydrological basins lacking continual and extensive in situ observations gldas model outputs have performed well when estimating hydrological variables for water balance studies lakshmi et al 2018 shamsudduha et al 2017 kansara et al 2021 hu et al 2021 ndehedehe et al 2016 for purposes of this study the gldas noah land surface model was used to obtain monthly runoff and root zone soil moisture 0 2 m depth data these data were used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly runoff and root zone soil moisture anomalies the gldas noah land surface model l4 v2 1 was used from june 2002 april 2022 and the gldas noah land surface model l4 early product v2 1 was used from may 2022 june 2022 further details about gldas and the noah land surface model can be found at https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas 2 2 4 soil moisture data from the soil moisture active passive smap mission the soil moisture active passive smap mission launched in 2015 to estimate near surface soil moisture 0 5 cm depth using a 1 41 ghz l band radiometer chan et al 2016 entekhabi et al 2010 smap overpasses occur at 6 00am and 6 00pm local time every 2 3 days with a spatial resolution on 0 09 for this study monthly 9 km smap soil moisture data from the 6 00pm overpasses were used from january 2015 january 2022 a 1 km soil moisture product which was downscaled from the 9 km smap data using correlations between surface temperature differences and vegetation were averaged to a monthly timescale fang et al 2022 validation of the 1 km soil moisture product were performed using data available from 28 ground stations via the international soil moisture network https ismn geo tuwien ac at additional information about smap and the 1 km downscaled soil moisture product can be found at https smap jpl nasa gov and fang et al 2022 due to the limited observation record of smap of 8 years this study uses observed monthly values of 9 km and 1 km near surface soil moisture data as opposed to monthly anomalies these data were used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly near surface soil moisture at 9 km and 1 km resolutions 2 2 5 lake level height data from satellite radar altimetry jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 satellite radar altimetry has proven to be a reliable method for monitoring inland waterbody elevation over large lakes rivers and wetlands particularly in regions lacking adequate stream gage data ramillien et al 2014 becker et al 2010 ndehedehe et al 2016 birkett et al 2010 to calculate lake surface height a nadir pointing antenna onboard the satellite emits microwave pulses and measures the elapsed time between emission and receiving of the reflected pulse altitude elapse time and geophysical corrections are used to estimate lake surface height the microwave spectra enable measurements regardless of day night or cloudy conditions since stream gage data at lake victoria s outlet is not publicly available satellite radar altimetry data obtained from the united states department of agriculture usda foreign agricultural service global reservoir and lake monitor g realm were used to estimate lake level height in millimeters relative to msl usda 2022 previous studies have also utilized g realm altimetry data for analysis within the lake victoria basin swenson and wahr 2009 becker et al 2010 reynolds 2005 a validation study was conducted by reynolds in 2005 that compared lake victoria gage data from 2000 to 2004 to g realm and found very similar agreement better than 10 cm rsm reynolds 2005 in our study the following satellites and sensors with an approximate repeat period of 10 days were used from the g realm lake victoria height product to construct a time series of monthly lake height anomalies jason 1 gdr 20 hz from 2002 to 2008 jason 2 ostm gdr from 2008 to 2016 and jason 3 interim gdr 20 hz from 2016 to 2022 further details about g realm can be found at https ipad fas usda gov cropexplorer global reservoir 2 2 6 total water storage anomaly data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace grace fo satellite gravimetry via the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and follow on grace fo missions has proven to be a reliable method for observing changes in total water storage with a geoid height accuracy of one centimeter ramillien et al 2020 changes in catchment storage from aquifers soil moisture groundwater surface water etc are observable as grace derived total water storage anomaly twsa previous studies have utilized grace twsa for hydrological balance analysis in the lake victoria basin and surrounding african basins awange et al 2008 lakshmi et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2016 khaki and awange 2021 kansara et al 2021 grippa et al 2011 agutu et al 2017 in this study the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascons jpl rl06 v02 data with 0 5 spatial resolution were used please see the grace fo l3 handbook https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata gracefo docs grace fo l3 handbook jpl pdf while the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon data is provided at this spatial resolution of 0 5 it is important to note that the size of a single mascon is 3 and neighboring 0 5 grid cells may not be independent of each other however it is common to use the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon dataset at 0 5 resolution kansara and lakshmi 2021 shamsudduha et al 2017 bonsor et al 2018 thus a scale factor derived from land surface models was applied to the grace land water equivalent lwe thickness data by multiplying the raw grace lwe thickness by the scale factor this is necessary to obtain a spatial resolution of 0 5 and it is not pre applied to the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon data additionally a gap in grace grace fo observations occurred in 2017 2018 due to mission lifespan and battery complications landerer et al 2020 for purposes of this study linear interpolation is used to fill the missing monthly twsa data these data were used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly twsa further information about the grace mission and the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon dataset can be found at https gracefo jpl nasa gov and https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata gracefo docs grace fo l3 handbook jpl pdf 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological components of the water balance equation the water balance equation is as follows 1 p et r s where p is precipitation et is evapotranspiration r is runoff and s is change in total water storage in this study p and et are derived from earth observations gpm imerg and modis respectively while r is a model output gldas grace grace fo was used to estimate s assessment of water balance closure in the lake victoria basin using these datasets are limited by the modis et observations because this dataset masks out lakes given the large spatial extent of lake victoria which makes up approximately 25 of the basin it is unreasonable to assess water balance closure of the basin without evapotranspiration data over the lake itself thus in this study we have chosen to examine individual hydrological components of the water balance equation specifically precipitation evapotranspiration over land runoff and change in water storage additional hydrological variables examined in this study include soil moisture lake level height and lake extent 3 2 hydrological anomalies monthly climate anomalies for precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and root zone soil moisture were calculated using the difference between the monthly value and the monthly climatology monthly climate anomaly henceforth referred to as anomaly represents the difference between the actual monthly value and the monthly climatology for example a positive anomaly represents more rainfall than the climatological average likewise a negative anomaly represents less rainfall than the climatological average it is important to note that by international standards climatology calculations should use a record of at least 30 years wmo 2017 however this was not feasible for our study due to the availability and mission durations of earth observations used for the analysis thus a limitation of our study is that only a record of 20 years june 2002 june 2022 was used to calculate monthly climatology ideally an equal time span of observations should be used for each month when calculating monthly climatology but since the number of years of available observations is below the 30 year threshold all available data is used for the analysis thus 20 years of observations were used for all months except june which had 21 years of observations time series and spatial plots of monthly climate anomalies were constructed for each hydrological variable for visual purposes linear interpolation was used to re grid precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and root zone soil moisture to the same spatial scales for the spatial anomaly plots twsa was not re gridded as this would be an overextension of the coarse native spatial resolution 4 results and discussion 4 1 time series of hydrological anomalies time series of hydrological anomalies for precipitation evapotranspiration runoff root zone soil moisture twsa and lake height from june 2002 june 2022 are shown in fig 3a e a key objective of this study is to examine the recent flood and drought periods in the lake victoria basin so our results and discussion are focused on hydrological anomalies between september 2019 june 2022 however the extended period of record provides valuable context for the magnitude and duration of the recent flood and drought events the highest positive anomalies within this time period of june 2002 june 2022 were observed during the 2020 2021 flood event for evapotranspiration runoff twsa and lake height negative anomalies during the 2021 2022 drought event however were not the most extreme negative anomalies that the lake victoria basin has experienced in the past 20 years in fig 3 the local maxima and minima hydrological anomalies are respectively indicated by vertical blue and red lines which show months where the lake victoria basin experienced anomalous wet and dry conditions table 3 summarizes months within the period of interest that were identified as positive anomalies wet month and the negative anomalies dry month as well as their respective anomaly values where applicable spatial plots corresponding to these identified wet and dry months for precipitation evapotranspiration root zone soil moisture and twsa are discussed in section 4 2 in the precipitation anomalies time series shown in fig 3a october 2019 was identified as the anomalous wet month with a value of 73 mm november 2021 was identified as the anomalous dry month with a value of 32 mm while the positive precipitation anomaly during october 2019 was not the most extreme observed within the basin between 2002 and 2022 it was followed by 8 months of persistently positive precipitation anomalies from september 2019 april 2020 which is one of the longest periods of positive precipitation anomalies experienced in the basin the increase in twsa during the same period shown in fig 3e concurs with the precipitation anomaly time series twsa reached its local maximum positive anomaly of 62 cm in may 2020 which is one month later than the precipitation anomaly peak this was the highest twsa value observed within the lake victoria basin since 2002 during the 2021 2022 drought event twsa remains positive in the past however the lake victoria basin has experienced dry periods with strong negative anomalies which indicates the relative magnitude of the early 2022 drought in comparison to previous droughts lake height anomalies shown in fig 3f also increased substantially during the flood event in september 2019 the lake height anomaly was 340 mm by may 2020 the lake height anomaly increased to 1380 mm at the time lake level heights in may 2020 were record breaking bbc 2020 however the lake height proceeded to reach a higher positive anomaly in february 2021 with a value of 1470 mm during the 2021 2022 drought period lake height anomalies remained positive while decreasing to 972 mm the twsa in late 2021 and early 2022 remained relatively constant despite the steady decrease in lake height anomalies at this time root zone soil moisture anomalies shown in fig 3d fluctuate from positive to negative between the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought events a maximum root zone soil moisture anomaly of 120 kg m2 was observed in march 2020 a minimum root zone soil moisture anomaly of 71 kg m2 was observed in november 2021 which was then followed by five months of persistently negative root zone soil moisture anomalies by june 2022 however the root zone soil moisture anomalies recovered and were positive this captures the quick recovery of the recent drought event similar to the root zone soil moisture anomalies runoff anomalies shown in fig 3c fluctuate from positive values in march 2020 of 27 mm to negative values in november 2021 of 10 mm the runoff anomalies are persistently negative from june 2021 may 2022 before recovering to a positive anomaly in june 2022 in conjunction with the root zone soil moisture anomalies during june 2022 the runoff anomalies in june 2022 also captures the basin s quick recovery from the recent drought event 4 2 spatial variability of hydrological anomalies spatial anomaly plots of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff root zone soil moisture and twsa are shown in fig 4a e for each hydrological variable the previously identified wet and dry months from the hydrological anomalies time series are spatially plotted scalebar ranges were manually selected to ensure average variabilities over the basin are visually apparent by displaying outliers as the maximum and minimum colors precipitation anomalies during october 2019 wet month and november 2021 dry month are shown in fig 4a1 2 during the wet month positive precipitation anomalies were dominant across the basin with most regions experiencing anomalies of 100 mm or greater this concurs with media and journal articles which reported heavy and atypical rainfall in the eastern horn of africa due to one of the strongest indian ocean dipole iod events on record wainwright et al 2020 fews net 2020 the greatest precipitation anomaly of 472 mm was observed directly over lake victoria in the dry month precipitation anomalies were as severe as approximately 160 mm over the northeastern and southwestern shores of lake victoria a few patches of positive anomalies were observed throughout the basin such as directly over lake victoria this is likely explained by local meteorology in the nocturnal lake land breeze system of lake victoria which makes precipitation directly over the lake 25 30 greater than precipitation over the surrounding land shamsudduha et al 2017 thiery et al 2016 2017 evapotranspiration spatial anomaly plots for february 2020 wet month and march 2022 dry month are shown in fig 4b1 2 as previously discussed an unfortunate limitation of this modis evapotranspiration product is that lakes and permanent waterbodies are masked out however one would expect that a significant portions of the basin s overall evapotranspiration occurs directly over lake victoria due to the lake s large surface area shallow depth and the region s tropical climate previous studies have found that evaporation accounts for 80 of the water leaving lake victoria while precipitation accounts for approximately 86 of the total water input into lake victoria nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 however it is not possible to assess these results with the public earth observations utilized in this study in fig 4b1 2 less extreme anomalies 10 mm were observed in the western portion of the basin compared to the eastern regions 40 mm when compared alongside land cover type fig 2 permanent wetlands are highlighted as positive anomalies during the wet month and the kenyan forested areas are highlighted as negative anomalies during the dry month similar spatial anomaly patterns were observed for runoff fig 4c1 2 and root zone soil moisture fig 4d1 2 during the wet month march 2020 the most extreme runoff and root zone soil moisture anomalies were observed in the lower elevations up to 120 mm for runoff and 254 kg m2 for root zone soil moisture anomalies in the dry month november 2021 root zone soil moisture anomalies 100 kg m2 were observed across most of the eastern portion of the basin additionally there is a clear division between positive negative runoff and root zone soil moisture anomalies in burundi and rwanda this pattern follows the boundary of cropland versus grassland savanna land cover types shown in fig 2 twsa spatial plots for may 2020 wet month and december 2021 dry month are shown in fig 4e1 2 for both periods an overall positive twsa was observed within the basin with regions experiencing peak twsa greater than or equal to 60 cm however december 2021 has lower positive anomalies than may 2020 in the eastern and southwestern portions of the basin observed changes in twsa are more extreme over land as opposed to the lake itself between the wet and dry months additionally highly negative twsa are observed in uganda near lake victoria s outlet which is a highly populated urban area because the native resolution of grace is coarse it is possible that these observed patters are indicative of limitations of the enhanced spatial resolution of the grc tellus global mascon monthly mass grid data further research should be conducted to assess the accuracy and limitations of this data product with regard to extreme hydrological events in the lake victoria basin overall the spatial plots of hydrological anomalies capture significant variability within the lake victoria basin and between periods of flood and drought this provides valuable spatial hydrological information which complements the previously discussed temporal anomaly analysis this level of spatial hydrological analysis would not otherwise be obtainable given the region s limited in situ hydrological observations 4 3 comparison of 9 km and 1 km soil moisture products spatial plots of monthly soil moisture observations 0 5 m depth are shown in fig 5 due to the limited mission duration of smap launched in 2015 a sufficient period of record was not available to conduct an anomaly analysis additionally no soil moisture data is collected over lake victoria or other waterbodies within the basin consistent with the root zone soil moisture anomaly analysis march 2020 and november 2021 were selected as wet and dry months of interest the 9 km smap soil moisture observations for the wet month show higher soil moisture values ranging from approximately 0 34 to 0 44 kg m2 in the northeastern southern and southwestern regions of the basin fig 5a1 during the dry month the 9 km smap soil moisture observations showed that the lower elevations in the northeast maintained higher soil moisture values than the higher elevations in kenya the southeastern regions of the basin in rwanda and burundi also maintained higher soil moisture than the surrounding regions based on the land cover classifications this spatial pattern may be explained by human intervention to maintain soil moisture conditions suitable for agriculture the 1 km downscaled soil moisture observations are shown in fig 5b1 2 for march 2020 and november 2021 as well overall the 1 km soil moisture product demonstrated higher soil moisture values in the southern region compared to the 9 km smap product fig 5b1 similarly in the dry month the 1 km soil moisture product demonstrated lower soil moisture values 0 05 kg m2 than the 9 km smap product 0 13 kg m2 in the eastern edge of the basin in kenya and tanzania fig 5b2 qualitatively the 1 km soil moisture product seems to capture more extreme soil moisture values than the 9 km smap product a quantitative validation analysis was performed with 28 ground based soil moisture stations through the trans african hydro meteorological observatory tahmo and the international soil moisture network ismn which is accessible at https ismn geo tuwien ac at en validation statistics plots and time series are shown in figs 6 and 7 and the appendix 1 2 it is important to note that this validation is limited by the short period of in situ observations primarily from mid 2018 to present additionally no ismn in situ observations were available in tanzania in fig 6 data collected at four ismn soil moisture observation sites were validated with the 1 km and 9 km smap observations the 1 km downscaled soil moisture observations performed better than the 9 km soil moisture product for each site fig 7 shows time series of the same four ismn soil moisture observation sites in comparison with the 1 km and 9 km soil moisture smap observations from 2015 to 2021 here it is possible to see how the performance of both the 1 km and 9 km soil moisture products vary over time in comparison with the in situ soil moisture observations in general the 1 km data performed comparably or better than the 9 km smap observations with lower unbiased rmse both the 1 km and 9 km data had low p values and were statistically significant from this validation figs 6 and 7 and the appendix it is clear that the downscaled 1 km soil moisture compares better to the available in situ observations than the original 9 km soil moisture data along with the 1 km global validation conducted by fang et al 2022 this validation forms a good basis for acceptance of use of the smap downscaled 1 km soil moisture data set for analyses in this basin future research should be conducted to continue validation efforts across the african continent 4 4 change in lake volume to further quantify the relative hydrological variations in this region between hydrological extremes change in the volume of lake victoria were calculated from the identified wet month may 2021 and dry month feb 2022 the following equation was used v a h where v is change in lake volume a is change in lake surface area and h is change in lake level height the change in surface area between may 2021 and feb 2022 were calculated by identifying the total area of inundated pixels over lake victoria in sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar imagery during the two months changes in lake level height were derived from the g realm altimetry data between may 2021 and feb 2022 the lake level height decreased by 1 19 m and the surface area decreased by approximately 9270 km2 thus the overall change in lake level volume was 11 03 km3 this large decrease in lake volume concurs with the results derived from the other hydrological variables which also experienced large decreases represented as negative anomalies during this time period this is apparent in the basin wide averaged monthly twsa observations which decreased from 60 cm in may 2021 to 35 cm in feb 2022 the large decreases in lake volume and twsa during this period further indicate the occurrence of these two hydrological extreme events 4 5 relationship between twsa precipitation and lake height a time series of monthly climatology for precipitation lake height and twsa are shown in fig 8 see section 3 2 equation 2 for more details on the calculation of monthly climatology this depicts the seasonality of precipitation lake height and twsa based on the period of available data june 2002 june 2022 for precipitation and lake height june 2002 may 2022 for twsa the precipitation monthly climatology captures the distinct short rainy season and long rainy season which respectively occur between march may and september november april has the highest average rainfall of 118 mm month july has the lowest average rainfall of 56 mm month lake height follows similar seasonality as precipitation with a slight lag approximately 1 2 months may has the highest average lake height with an elevation of 1136 m above msl october has the lowest average lake height with an elevation of 1134 m above msl as previously discussed lake victoria is sensitive to human management of hydropower dam operations at its outlet so these seasonal changes may be a result of both anthropogenic and natural factors twsa depicts similar seasonality as precipitation with a lag of 1 2 months may has the highest average monthly twsa value of 7 cm month september has the lowest average monthly twsa value of 8 cm month fig 9 shows a longer time series comparison from january 2019 january 2022 for monthly twsa purple bars observed basin averaged monthly precipitation blue solid line and monthly climatology of precipitation dashed gray line from october 2019 to may 2020 the average observed monthly precipitation exceeded the monthly precipitation climatology by 13 75 mm this means the basin experienced a positive precipitation anomaly and was wetter than the climatological average from media articles it is documented that extensive flooding occurred during this period in the lake victoria basin and east africa bbc 2020 fews net 2020 kisumu 2020 khaki and awange 2021 wainwright et al 2021 similarly march 2021 december 2021 had average observed monthly precipitation below the monthly climatology by 6 mm to 31 mm this indicates a negative precipitation anomalies and drier conditions than the climatological average these observations concur with a report from the famine early warning systems network which documented this period as having a failed rainy season and high risk for crop failure and food insecurity in east africa fews net 2021 5 conclusions over the previous decades hydrometeorological extreme like floods and droughts have been continual and recurrent in the lake victoria basin recently the lake victoria basin experienced extreme floods in 2019 2020 and drought conditions in early 2022 high resolution spatial and temporal monitoring of hydrological variables are vital for improving understanding of hydrology within the lake victoria basin particularly given the region s dense population and vulnerability to sub seasonal hydrological anomalies which can lead to the loss of life and property crop failure food insecurity and increased poverty however there are insufficient in situ hydrological observations in the lake victoria basin to fill this need thus in this study we leverage publicly available earth observations and model data to capture occurrence of the recent flood and drought events in the lake victoria basin we examined and discussed components of the hydrological water balance precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and change in total water storage and additional hydrological variables soil moisture lake height and lake extent with specific regard to the recent hydrological extreme events this was accomplished through construction of time series and spatial plots of monthly anomalies for each variable our results improve understanding and documentation of the severity and duration of the recent flood and drought events the innovation of this work is that it offers a simple method of using publicly available earth observations and model data to improve spatial and temporal analyses of hydrological anomalies at sub seasonal time scales within a region lacking in situ data to our knowledge this is the first study to conduct a hydrological spatial anomaly comparison for the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought events in the lake victoria basin thus this is a novel contribution to the existing record of hydrological research in this region because it updates previous studies and is among the first to integrate such a diverse array of publicly available datasets for the lake victoria basin further work could assess this method for informing water resources management in this region particularly for informing scheduling planting irrigation and harvesting of crops this would be valuable given the lake victoria basin s growing population and economic reliance on rain fed subsistence agriculture additionally a comparison of 9 km and 1 km near surface soil moisture products derived and downscaled from smap was conducted to improve spatial resolution of soil moisture observations in the lake victoria basin the 1 km near surface soil moisture product was validated with ground station near surface soil moisture data available through the international soil moisture network and performed either better or comparably to the 9 km smap observations this was the first validation of the 1 km near surface soil moisture product in the continent of africa further research should continue validation efforts of soil moisture data derived from earth observations in the lake victoria basin and africa in the limited regions where ground based observations are available methods and findings from this study can be used to advance understanding and monitoring methods of sub seasonal hydrological anomalies within the lake victoria basin particularly through publicly available earth observations by demonstrating a simple method for improved monitoring of hydrological variables including precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture lake height and twsa this study supports the continual effort to decrease the lake victoria basin community s vulnerability to

7729,the lake victoria basin home of africa s largest freshwater lake experienced extensive floods in 2019 2020 and anomalous drought conditions in early 2022 both antithetical hydrological events raised concerns for an estimated 35 million people within the basin who are vulnerable to these continually recurrent hydrometeorological extremes while there is a need for high resolution spatial and temporal hydrological monitoring in situ observations are limited and insufficient within the basin this study assesses the capability of publicly available earth observations and models to capture the occurrence of recent hydrological extremes within the lake victoria basin spatial and temporal comparisons of the following hydrological variables are conducted within the lake victoria basin from june 2002 june 2022 precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture lake height and total water storage anomaly twsa results from the time series and spatial analyses confirm that the anomalous wet and dry events respectively occurred from october 2019 march 2020 and november 2021 march 2021 the observations also indicated a quick recovery from the drought event by june 2022 additionally a comparison of 9 km soil moisture and 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture products improves understanding of wetness spatial variability within the basin these results were validated using in situ soil moisture data available through the international soil moisture network making this the first study to validate the downscaled 1 km soil moil moisture product within the african continent methods from this study demonstrate the utility of a diverse array of publicly available earth observation and model data to improve understanding of recent hydrological anomalies and extreme events within the lake victoria basin this can be applied to water resources management particularly in regions lacking sufficient in situ hydrological data keywords lake victoria flood drought hydrology earth observations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction africa s largest lake lake victoria provides valuable ecosystem services to five east african countries within its basin burundi kenya rwanda tanzania and uganda freshwater from lake victoria supports domestic use diverse aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and economic industries including agriculture livestock fisheries and hydropower production awange 2020 2006 tourism recreation and transportation of goods via inland waterways are further supported by the lake awange 2020 reynolds 2005 as the source of the white nile river and a subbasin of the greater nile watershed the lake victoria basin plays a critical role in supplying freshwater locally to an estimated 35 million people and indirectly to 340 million people in downstream countries ramillien et al 2014 mugo et al 2020 over the previous decades hydrometeorological extremes such as floods and droughts have proven to be continual and recurrent in the lake victoria basin nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 historically devastating floods in this region occur practically every year during the october december rainy season and cause substantial loss of life and property nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 periods of extreme drought are equally concerning because decreased or delayed rainfall can lead to crop failure widespread famine and food insecurity coughlan de perez et al 2019 agutu et al 2017 fews net 2021 as the frequency and severity of hydrological extremes is predicted to increase due to climate change accurate and continual monitoring of hydrological conditions at the basin level is vital for sustainable water resources management alsdorf et al 2016 paris et al 2022 wainwright et al 2021 this is particularly true for the lake victoria basin particularly given that previous research has identified it as a significant hotspot for population climate burdens which are exacerbated by recurrent droughts and flooding due to variable rainfall lópez carr et al 2014 since the populations of burundi kenya rwanda tanzania and uganda are respectively forecasted to increase by 114 68 77 117 and 114 between mid 2020 and mid 2050 there is further motivation to improve water resources management to support such population growth and demands table 1 kaneda et al 2020 as with many regions in africa the lake victoria basin lacks sufficient in situ public and ground based hydrological observations to meet these needs khan et al 2010 hu et al 2021 ndehedehe et al 2016 while discharge data from uganda s hydropower dam located at lake victoria s outlet is collected this data is not publicly available this is likely due to political concerns regarding the agreed curve which is an international treaty between uganda and egypt through which uganda agrees to operate its hydropower dams in a way that reflect the natural outflows of lake victoria swenson and wahr 2009 shamsudduha et al 2017 kull 2006 vanderkelen et al 2018 getirana et al 2020 similarly the few ground based rainfall stations within the lake victoria basin are unreliably operated and sparsely distributed making it an insufficient data source for basin wide hydrological analyses awange et al 2019 therefore there is a need for publicly available and remotely observed hydrological data at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions in the lake victoria basin to monitor the recent hydrological extreme events satellite remote sensing has proven to be a useful tool to obtain hydrological observations in regions limited by sparse temporal and spatial coverage of ground based in situ data this is particularly true for comparisons of satellite sensor precipitation with gauge observations hashemi et al 2017 mondal et al 2018 le et al 2018 numerous studies have relied on remote sensing and land surface models to reliably estimate components of the hydrological cycle within the lake victoria basin and other african basins lakshmi et al 2018 khan et al 2010 awange 2020 ndehedehe et al 2016 vanderkelen et al 2018 becker et al 2010 grippa et al 2011 shamsudduha et al 2017 kansara et al 2021 other studies in the lower mekong river basin have also demonstrated the synergistic utility of satellite remote sensing observations within hydrological models mohammed et al 2018a 2018b 2018c le et al 2020 2022 these techniques particularly the utilization of a wide array of publicly available hydrological earth observations can be applied to the lake victoria basin to update previous studies and to compare the recent hydrological extreme events additionally this is a valuable method for collecting hydrological data across country borders since lake victoria is geopolitically divided between kenya 6 uganda 43 and tanzania 51 awange 2020 thus earth observations are a promising method for obtaining uniform and publicly available hydrological observations at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions across the international boundaries of this basin in this paper we examine components of the hydrological water balance precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and change in total water storage and additional hydrological variables soil moisture lake level height and lake extent for the lake victoria basin from june 2002 june 2022 with particular focus on the 2019 2020 flood events and the 2021 2022 drought period this is accomplished by leveraging publicly available data from seven satellite based earth observations and one land surface model which is necessary given the limited in situ data available in this region since previous studies identified the lake victoria basin as an area where populations are particularly vulnerable to seasonal hydrological variabilities we conducted a hydrological anomaly analysis at monthly timescales to identify periods of anomalous positive and negative hydrological conditions our analysis includes monthly basin wide averaged time series of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff total water storage anomaly soil moisture and lake level height from june 2002 june 2022 spatial anomaly plots at spatial resolution up to 0 1 are provided for precipitation evapotranspiration runoff total water storage anomaly and soil moisture for two months of interest the local maxima and minima monthly anomalies between january 2019 june 2022 these represent a wet and dry month which respectively occurred during the identified flood and drought events to our knowledge this is the first study to conduct a hydrological spatial anomaly comparison for the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought events in the lake victoria basin additionally to improve understanding of wetness spatial variability during the flood and drought periods a spatial comparison of 9 km near surface soil moisture and 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture products is included for the basin these spatial plots are displayed for the wet and dry months identified in the root zone soil moisture anomaly time series as local maxima and minima between january 2019 june 2022 the 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture data was validated using 28 ground soil moisture stations available via the international soil moisture network this is the first study to validate the 1 km downscaled near surface soil moisture product within the african continent because the lake victoria basin and other areas in the greater horn of africa lack sufficient in situ soil moisture observations for widespread analysis validation and assessment of remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture data are vital for determining the utility of these data for future studies and operational usage agutu et al 2021 this is especially necessary for soil moisture due to the region s dependence on rain fed subsistence agriculture agutu et al 2021 methods from this study for observing hydrological anomalies as time series and spatial plots demonstrate a simple tool for monitoring hydrological variables using publicly available datasets in a region that is traditionally limited by insufficient ground observations these methods could be applied to inform water management and agricultural planning within the lake victoria basin as well as other regions lacking sufficient ground based hydrological observations further research could be conducted to assess applications of this work for water management here we show that earth observations can monitor hydrological variables during extreme and anomalous events such as the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought this work aims to support ongoing efforts to decrease the community s vulnerability to anomalous hydrological conditions such as extreme floods and droughts by improving monitoring of components of the hydrological cycle precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and change in total water storage and other hydrological variables soil moisture lake level height and lake extent within the lake victoria basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area lake victoria locally called lake nulabale is the largest tropical lake and the second largest freshwater lake in the world with an approximate surface area of 65 295 km2 awange 2020 despite its large spatial extent lake victoria is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 80 m and an average depth of 40 m nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 the basin has a catchment surface area of approximately 229 815 km2 and encompasses portions of uganda kenya tanzania rwanda and burundi hamilton 2016 a singular outlet of lake victoria is found at ripon falls near jinja uganda here the lake victoria basin directly contributes to the white nile river thus as shown in fig 1a the lake victoria basin is a subbasin of the nile watershed a digital elevation model dem of the lake victoria basin derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm is shown in fig 1b usgs 2018 tectonic and volcanic activity within the great rift valley contribute to the basin s varying topography which ranges in altitude from approximately 1109 4309 m above mean sea level msl the highest elevations are found in the northeastern mountainous regions in kenya and along the southwestern edge of the basin in burundi and rwanda the lowest elevations are found directly along the perimeter of lake victoria approximately 25 major rivers within the basin contribute directly to lake victoria vanderkelen et al 2018 however precipitation accounts for approximately 86 of the input into lake victoria nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 the humid tropical climate in combination with lake victoria s large extent contribute to a distinct diurnal meteorological pattern within the basin during afternoons intense convective thunderstorms typically form over the land due to a nocturnal lake land breeze system shamsudduha et al 2017 thiery et al 2016 2017 on seasonal timescales the long rains and short rains respectively occur from may march and september november hydrological patterns within the basin are further influenced on seasonal and interannual scales by the intertropical convergence zone itcz the indian ocean dipole iod and the el ñino southern oscillation enso wainwright et al 2021 becker et al 2010 fews net 2020 2021 2 1 1 land cover of the lake victoria basin land cover classifications derived from modis terra and aqua reflectance data at a spatial resolution of 500 m are shown for the lake victoria basin in fig 2 for purposes of this study land cover is assumed to be constant between june 2019 to june 2022 since analysis of land cover change were outside the scope of this study inland waterbodies including lake victoria make up 25 of the basin s total area grasslands are 35 of the basin area and are predominately located in tanzania croplands including natural vegetation mosaics are collectively 21 of the basin extent and include portions of all five countries the main crops produced within the basin are maize beans sorghum millet paddy rice sugarcane tea coffee cotton and meats reynolds 2005 mugo et al 2020 only 0 2 of the basin area is classified as urban and built up lands even though an estimated 35 million people live within a 100 km buffer zone of lake victoria mugo et al 2020 a study conducted by mugo et al 2020 used optical imagery from landsat and field data to assess land use changes between 1985 and 2014 in the lake victoria basin and found an 800 increase in urbanized areas between 1985 and 2020 mugo et al 2020 human centric activities were found to be the primary motivation for land use land cover changes during this period particularly through the conversion of forests woodlands grasslands and wetlands to farmlands and settlements mugo et al 2020 2 2 data a summary table of the satellite based earth observations and model outputs used in this study for precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture root zone and near surface lake height and total water storage anomaly twsa are summarized in table 2 each variable was averaged at a monthly timescale in the native resolution of the source data monthly spatial averages were calculated across the basin extent to construct time series for each variable for spatial mapping purposes precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and root zone soil moisture were re gridded to a common spatial resolution the near surface soil moisture observations were not gridded to allow for spatial comparison of the 9 km and 1 km products similarly twsa was not re gridded to avoid misleading visual representation of these data given the coarse spatial resolution of grace lake height is assumed to be constant across the extent of lake victoria and thus is not spatially mapped further details concerning each data product can be found in sections 2 2 1 2 2 6 2 2 1 precipitation data from the integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg the integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg is a joint mission between the national aeronautics space administration nasa and the japan aerospace and exploration agency jaxa which uses a constellation of satellites with passive microwave and infrared sensors to provide high spatial and temporal resolution precipitation measurements huffman et al 2015 for regions lacking ground based in situ precipitation measurements remotely sensed precipitation observations are commonly used from gpm imerg the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2015 dezfuli et al 2017 for purposes of this study gpm imerg final precipitation l3 v06 and gpm imerg late precipitation l3 v06 were used to obtain monthly precipitation data at 0 1 spatial resolution from june 2002 june 2022 this was used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly precipitation anomalies more

imaging spectroradiometer modis the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is a sensor onboard the sun synchronous polar orbiting satellites terra and aqua in this study modis was used to obtain monthly evapotranspiration data from june 2002 to june 2022 and one year of land cover data 2019 the global modis evapotranspiration product is based on the penman monteith equation mu et al 2007 2011 this product has a temporal repeat of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 0 05 running et al 2017 for this study the modis mod16a2 006 evapotranspiration data were averaged at monthly timescales to construct a time series and spatial plots of monthly evapotranspiration anomalies it is important to note that the modis mod16a2 006 evapotranspiration product masks inland water thus a limitation of this observation data source is that no evapotranspiration data is available directly over lake victoria the modis mcd12q1 006 product was used to construct a map of land cover type for the lake victoria basin in 2019 using the annual international geosphere biosphere program igbp classification scheme friedl et al 2019 additional information about modis evapotranspiration and land cover products can be found at https modis gsfc nasa gov 2 2 3 runoff and root zone soil moisture data from the global land data assimilation system gldas the global land data assimilation system gldas is a global high resolution 0 25 publicly available hydrological model that assimilates ground and satellite based observations in offline land surface models to output land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 for hydrological basins lacking continual and extensive in situ observations gldas model outputs have performed well when estimating hydrological variables for water balance studies lakshmi et al 2018 shamsudduha et al 2017 kansara et al 2021 hu et al 2021 ndehedehe et al 2016 for purposes of this study the gldas noah land surface model was used to obtain monthly runoff and root zone soil moisture 0 2 m depth data these data were used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly runoff and root zone soil moisture anomalies the gldas noah land surface model l4 v2 1 was used from june 2002 april 2022 and the gldas noah land surface model l4 early product v2 1 was used from may 2022 june 2022 further details about gldas and the noah land surface model can be found at https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas 2 2 4 soil moisture data from the soil moisture active passive smap mission the soil moisture active passive smap mission launched in 2015 to estimate near surface soil moisture 0 5 cm depth using a 1 41 ghz l band radiometer chan et al 2016 entekhabi et al 2010 smap overpasses occur at 6 00am and 6 00pm local time every 2 3 days with a spatial resolution on 0 09 for this study monthly 9 km smap soil moisture data from the 6 00pm overpasses were used from january 2015 january 2022 a 1 km soil moisture product which was downscaled from the 9 km smap data using correlations between surface temperature differences and vegetation were averaged to a monthly timescale fang et al 2022 validation of the 1 km soil moisture product were performed using data available from 28 ground stations via the international soil moisture network https ismn geo tuwien ac at additional information about smap and the 1 km downscaled soil moisture product can be found at https smap jpl nasa gov and fang et al 2022 due to the limited observation record of smap of 8 years this study uses observed monthly values of 9 km and 1 km near surface soil moisture data as opposed to monthly anomalies these data were used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly near surface soil moisture at 9 km and 1 km resolutions 2 2 5 lake level height data from satellite radar altimetry jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 satellite radar altimetry has proven to be a reliable method for monitoring inland waterbody elevation over large lakes rivers and wetlands particularly in regions lacking adequate stream gage data ramillien et al 2014 becker et al 2010 ndehedehe et al 2016 birkett et al 2010 to calculate lake surface height a nadir pointing antenna onboard the satellite emits microwave pulses and measures the elapsed time between emission and receiving of the reflected pulse altitude elapse time and geophysical corrections are used to estimate lake surface height the microwave spectra enable measurements regardless of day night or cloudy conditions since stream gage data at lake victoria s outlet is not publicly available satellite radar altimetry data obtained from the united states department of agriculture usda foreign agricultural service global reservoir and lake monitor g realm were used to estimate lake level height in millimeters relative to msl usda 2022 previous studies have also utilized g realm altimetry data for analysis within the lake victoria basin swenson and wahr 2009 becker et al 2010 reynolds 2005 a validation study was conducted by reynolds in 2005 that compared lake victoria gage data from 2000 to 2004 to g realm and found very similar agreement better than 10 cm rsm reynolds 2005 in our study the following satellites and sensors with an approximate repeat period of 10 days were used from the g realm lake victoria height product to construct a time series of monthly lake height anomalies

cropexplorer global reservoir 2 2 6 total water storage anomaly data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace grace fo satellite gravimetry via the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and follow on grace fo missions has proven to be a reliable method for observing changes in total water storage with a geoid height accuracy of one centimeter ramillien et al 2020 changes in catchment storage from aquifers soil moisture groundwater surface water etc are observable as grace derived total water storage anomaly twsa previous studies have utilized grace twsa for hydrological balance analysis in the lake victoria basin and surrounding african basins awange et al 2008 lakshmi et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2016 khaki and awange 2021 kansara et al 2021 grippa et al 2011 agutu et al 2017 in this study the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascons jpl rl06 v02 data with 0 5 spatial resolution were used please see the grace fo l3 handbook https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata gracefo docs grace fo l3 handbook jpl pdf while the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon data is provided at this spatial resolution of 0 5 it is important to note that the size of a single mascon is 3 and neighboring 0 5 grid cells may not be independent of each other however it is common to use the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon dataset at 0 5 resolution kansara and lakshmi 2021 shamsudduha et al 2017 bonsor et al 2018 thus a scale factor derived from land surface models was applied to the grace land water equivalent lwe thickness data by multiplying the raw grace lwe thickness by the scale factor this is necessary to obtain a spatial resolution of 0 5 and it is not pre applied to the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon data additionally a gap in grace grace fo observations occurred in 2017 2018 due to mission lifespan and battery complications landerer et al 2020 for purposes of this study linear interpolation is used to fill the missing monthly twsa data these data were used to construct time series and spatial plots of monthly twsa further information about the grace mission and the grc tellus jpl monthly mass grid global mascon dataset can be found at https gracefo jpl nasa gov and https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files alldata gracefo docs grace fo l3 handbook jpl pdf 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological components of the water balance equation the water balance equation is as follows 1 p et r s where p is precipitation et is evapotranspiration r is runoff and s is change in total water storage in this study p and et are derived from earth observations gpm imerg and modis respectively while r is a model output gldas grace grace fo was used to estimate s assessment of water balance closure in the lake victoria basin using these datasets are limited by the modis et observations because this dataset masks out lakes given the large spatial extent of lake victoria which makes up approximately 25 of the basin it is unreasonable to assess water balance closure of the basin without evapotranspiration data over the lake itself thus in this study we have chosen to examine individual hydrological components of the water balance equation specifically precipitation evapotranspiration over land runoff and change in water storage additional hydrological variables examined in this study include soil moisture lake level height and lake extent 3 2 hydrological anomalies monthly climate anomalies for precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and root zone soil moisture were calculated using the difference between the monthly value and the monthly climatology monthly climate anomaly henceforth referred to as anomaly represents the difference between the actual monthly value and the monthly climatology for example a positive anomaly represents more rainfall than the climatological average likewise a negative anomaly represents less rainfall than the climatological average it is important to note that by international standards climatology calculations should use a record of at least 30 years wmo 2017 however this was not feasible for our study due to the availability and mission durations of earth observations used for the analysis thus a limitation of our study is that only a record of 20 years june 2002 june 2022 was used to calculate monthly climatology ideally an equal time span of observations should be used for each month when calculating monthly climatology but since the number of years of available observations is below the 30 year threshold all available data is used for the analysis thus 20 years of observations were used for all months except june which had 21 years of observations time series and spatial plots of monthly climate anomalies were constructed for each hydrological variable for visual purposes linear interpolation was used to re grid precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and root zone soil moisture to the same spatial scales for the spatial anomaly plots twsa was not re gridded as this would be an overextension of the coarse native spatial resolution 4 results and discussion 4 1 time series of hydrological anomalies time series of hydrological anomalies for precipitation evapotranspiration runoff root zone soil moisture twsa and lake height from june 2002 june 2022 are shown in fig 3a e a key objective of this study is to examine the recent flood and drought periods in the lake victoria basin so our results and discussion are focused on hydrological anomalies between september 2019 june 2022 however the extended period of record provides valuable context for the magnitude and duration of the recent flood and drought events the highest positive anomalies within this time period of june 2002 june 2022 were observed during the 2020 2021 flood event for evapotranspiration runoff twsa and lake height negative anomalies during the 2021 2022 drought event however were not the most extreme negative anomalies that the lake victoria basin has experienced in the past 20 years in fig 3 the local maxima and minima hydrological anomalies are respectively indicated by vertical blue and red lines which show months where the lake victoria basin experienced anomalous wet and dry conditions table 3 summarizes months within the period of interest that were identified as positive anomalies wet month and the negative anomalies dry month as well as their respective anomaly values where applicable spatial plots corresponding to these identified wet and dry months for precipitation evapotranspiration root zone soil moisture and twsa are discussed in section 4 2 in the precipitation anomalies time series shown in fig 3a october 2019 was identified as the anomalous wet month with a value of 73 mm november 2021 was identified as the anomalous dry month with a value of 32 mm while the positive precipitation anomaly during october 2019 was not the most extreme observed within the basin between 2002 and 2022 it was followed by 8 months of persistently positive precipitation anomalies from september 2019 april 2020 which is one of the longest periods of positive precipitation anomalies experienced in the basin the increase in twsa during the same period shown in fig 3e concurs with the precipitation anomaly time series twsa reached its local maximum positive anomaly of 62 cm in may 2020 which is one month later than the precipitation anomaly peak this was the highest twsa value observed within the lake victoria basin since 2002 during the 2021 2022 drought event twsa remains positive in the past however the lake victoria basin has experienced dry periods with strong negative anomalies which indicates the relative magnitude of the early 2022 drought in comparison to previous droughts lake height anomalies shown in fig 3f also increased substantially during the flood event in september 2019 the lake height anomaly was 340 mm by may 2020 the lake height anomaly increased to 1380 mm at the time lake level heights in may 2020 were record breaking bbc 2020 however the lake height proceeded to reach a higher positive anomaly in february 2021 with a value of 1470 mm during the 2021 2022 drought period lake height anomalies remained positive while decreasing to 972 mm the twsa in late 2021 and early 2022 remained relatively constant despite the steady decrease in lake height anomalies at this time root zone soil moisture anomalies shown in fig 3d fluctuate from positive to negative between the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought events a maximum root zone soil moisture anomaly of 120 kg m2 was observed in march 2020 a minimum root zone soil moisture anomaly of 71 kg m2 was observed in november 2021 which was then followed by five months of persistently negative root zone soil moisture anomalies by june 2022 however the root zone soil moisture anomalies recovered and were positive this captures the quick recovery of the recent drought event similar to the root zone soil moisture anomalies runoff anomalies shown in fig 3c fluctuate from positive values in march 2020 of 27 mm to negative values in november 2021 of 10 mm the runoff anomalies are persistently negative from june 2021 may 2022 before recovering to a positive anomaly in june 2022 in conjunction with the root zone soil moisture anomalies during june 2022 the runoff anomalies in june 2022 also captures the basin s quick recovery from the recent drought event 4 2 spatial variability of hydrological anomalies spatial anomaly plots of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff root zone soil moisture and twsa are shown in fig 4a e for each hydrological variable the previously identified wet and dry months from the hydrological anomalies time series are spatially plotted scalebar ranges were manually selected to ensure average variabilities over the basin are visually apparent by displaying outliers as the maximum and minimum colors precipitation anomalies during october 2019 wet month and november 2021 dry month are shown in fig 4a1 2 during the wet month positive precipitation anomalies were dominant across the basin with most regions experiencing anomalies of 100 mm or greater this concurs with media and journal articles which reported heavy and atypical rainfall in the eastern horn of africa due to one of the strongest indian ocean dipole iod events on record wainwright et al 2020 fews net 2020 the greatest precipitation anomaly of 472 mm was observed directly over lake victoria in the dry month precipitation anomalies were as severe as approximately 160 mm over the northeastern and southwestern shores of lake victoria a few patches of positive anomalies were observed throughout the basin such as directly over lake victoria this is likely explained by local meteorology in the nocturnal lake land breeze system of lake victoria which makes precipitation directly over the lake 25 30 greater than precipitation over the surrounding land shamsudduha et al 2017 thiery et al 2016 2017 evapotranspiration spatial anomaly plots for february 2020 wet month and march 2022 dry month are shown in fig 4b1 2 as previously discussed an unfortunate limitation of this modis evapotranspiration product is that lakes and permanent waterbodies are masked out however one would expect that a significant portions of the basin s overall evapotranspiration occurs directly over lake victoria due to the lake s large surface area shallow depth and the region s tropical climate previous studies have found that evaporation accounts for 80 of the water leaving lake victoria while precipitation accounts for approximately 86 of the total water input into lake victoria nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 however it is not possible to assess these results with the public earth observations utilized in this study in fig 4b1 2 less extreme anomalies 10 mm were observed in the western portion of the basin compared to the eastern regions 40 mm when compared alongside land cover type fig 2 permanent wetlands are highlighted as positive anomalies during the wet month and the kenyan forested areas are highlighted as negative anomalies during the dry month similar spatial anomaly patterns were observed for runoff fig 4c1 2 and root zone soil moisture fig 4d1 2 during the wet month march 2020 the most extreme runoff and root zone soil moisture anomalies were observed in the lower elevations up to 120 mm for runoff and 254 kg m2 for root zone soil moisture anomalies in the dry month november 2021 root zone soil moisture anomalies 100 kg m2 were observed across most of the eastern portion of the basin additionally there is a clear division between positive negative runoff and root zone soil moisture anomalies in burundi and rwanda this pattern follows the boundary of cropland versus grassland savanna land cover types shown in fig 2 twsa spatial plots for may 2020 wet month and december 2021 dry month are shown in fig 4e1 2 for both periods an overall positive twsa was observed within the basin with regions experiencing peak twsa greater than or equal to 60 cm however december 2021 has lower positive anomalies than may 2020 in the eastern and southwestern portions of the basin observed changes in twsa are more extreme over land as opposed to the lake itself between the wet and dry months additionally highly negative twsa are observed in uganda near lake victoria s outlet which is a highly populated urban area because the native resolution of grace is coarse it is possible that these observed patters are indicative of limitations of the enhanced spatial resolution of the grc tellus global mascon monthly mass grid data further research should be conducted to assess the accuracy and limitations of this data product with regard to extreme hydrological events in the lake victoria basin overall the spatial plots of hydrological anomalies capture significant variability within the lake victoria basin and between periods of flood and drought this provides valuable spatial hydrological information which complements the previously discussed temporal anomaly analysis this level of spatial hydrological analysis would not otherwise be obtainable given the region s limited in situ hydrological observations 4 3 comparison of 9 km and 1 km soil moisture products spatial plots of monthly soil moisture observations 0 5 m depth are shown in fig 5 due to the limited mission duration of smap launched in 2015 a sufficient period of record was not available to conduct an anomaly analysis additionally no soil moisture data is collected over lake victoria or other waterbodies within the basin consistent with the root zone soil moisture anomaly analysis march 2020 and november 2021 were selected as wet and dry months of interest the 9 km smap soil moisture observations for the wet month show higher soil moisture values ranging from approximately 0 34 to 0 44 kg m2 in the northeastern southern and southwestern regions of the basin fig 5a1 during the dry month the 9 km smap soil moisture observations showed that the lower elevations in the northeast maintained higher soil moisture values than the higher elevations in kenya the southeastern regions of the basin in rwanda and burundi also maintained higher soil moisture than the surrounding regions based on the land cover classifications this spatial pattern may be explained by human intervention to maintain soil moisture conditions suitable for agriculture the 1 km downscaled soil moisture observations are shown in fig 5b1 2 for march 2020 and november 2021 as well overall the 1 km soil moisture product demonstrated higher soil moisture values in the southern region compared to the 9 km smap product fig 5b1 similarly in the dry month the 1 km soil moisture product demonstrated lower soil moisture values 0 05 kg m2 than the 9 km smap product 0 13 kg m2 in the eastern edge of the basin in kenya and tanzania fig 5b2 qualitatively the 1 km soil moisture product seems to capture more extreme soil moisture values than the 9 km smap product a quantitative validation analysis was performed with 28 ground based soil moisture stations through the trans african hydro meteorological observatory tahmo and the international soil moisture network ismn which is accessible at https ismn geo tuwien ac at en validation statistics plots and time series are shown in figs 6 and 7 and the appendix 1 2 it is important to note that this validation is limited by the short period of in situ observations primarily from mid 2018 to present additionally no ismn in situ observations were available in tanzania in fig 6 data collected at four ismn soil moisture observation sites were validated with the 1 km and 9 km smap observations the 1 km downscaled soil moisture observations performed better than the 9 km soil moisture product for each site fig 7 shows time series of the same four ismn soil moisture observation sites in comparison with the 1 km and 9 km soil moisture smap observations from 2015 to 2021 here it is possible to see how the performance of both the 1 km and 9 km soil moisture products vary over time in comparison with the in situ soil moisture observations in general the 1 km data performed comparably or better than the 9 km smap observations with lower unbiased rmse both the 1 km and 9 km data had low p values and were statistically significant from this validation figs 6 and 7 and the appendix it is clear that the downscaled 1 km soil moisture compares better to the available in situ observations than the original 9 km soil moisture data along with the 1 km global validation conducted by fang et al 2022 this validation forms a good basis for acceptance of use of the smap downscaled 1 km soil moisture data set for analyses in this basin future research should be conducted to continue validation efforts across the african continent 4 4 change in lake volume to further quantify the relative hydrological variations in this region between hydrological extremes change in the volume of lake victoria were calculated from the identified wet month may 2021 and dry month feb 2022 the following equation was used v a h where v is change in lake volume a is change in lake surface area and h is change in lake level height the change in surface area between may 2021 and feb 2022 were calculated by identifying the total area of inundated pixels over lake victoria in sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar imagery during the two months changes in lake level height were derived from the g realm altimetry data between may 2021 and feb 2022 the lake level height decreased by 1 19 m and the surface area decreased by approximately 9270 km2 thus the overall change in lake level volume was 11 03 km3 this large decrease in lake volume concurs with the results derived from the other hydrological variables which also experienced large decreases represented as negative anomalies during this time period this is apparent in the basin wide averaged monthly twsa observations which decreased from 60 cm in may 2021 to 35 cm in feb 2022 the large decreases in lake volume and twsa during this period further indicate the occurrence of these two hydrological extreme events 4 5 relationship between twsa precipitation and lake height a time series of monthly climatology for precipitation lake height and twsa are shown in fig 8 see section 3 2 equation 2 for more details on the calculation of monthly climatology this depicts the seasonality of precipitation lake height and twsa based on the period of available data june 2002 june 2022 for precipitation and lake height june 2002 may 2022 for twsa the precipitation monthly climatology captures the distinct short rainy season and long rainy season which respectively occur between march may and september november april has the highest average rainfall of 118 mm month july has the lowest average rainfall of 56 mm month lake height follows similar seasonality as precipitation with a slight lag approximately 1 2 months may has the highest average lake height with an elevation of 1136 m above msl october has the lowest average lake height with an elevation of 1134 m above msl as previously discussed lake victoria is sensitive to human management of hydropower dam operations at its outlet so these seasonal changes may be a result of both anthropogenic and natural factors twsa depicts similar seasonality as precipitation with a lag of 1 2 months may has the highest average monthly twsa value of 7 cm month september has the lowest average monthly twsa value of 8 cm month fig 9 shows a longer time series comparison from january 2019 january 2022 for monthly twsa purple bars observed basin averaged monthly precipitation blue solid line and monthly climatology of precipitation dashed gray line from october 2019 to may 2020 the average observed monthly precipitation exceeded the monthly precipitation climatology by 13 75 mm this means the basin experienced a positive precipitation anomaly and was wetter than the climatological average from media articles it is documented that extensive flooding occurred during this period in the lake victoria basin and east africa bbc 2020 fews net 2020 kisumu 2020 khaki and awange 2021 wainwright et al 2021 similarly march 2021 december 2021 had average observed monthly precipitation below the monthly climatology by 6 mm to 31 mm this indicates a negative precipitation anomalies and drier conditions than the climatological average these observations concur with a report from the famine early warning systems network which documented this period as having a failed rainy season and high risk for crop failure and food insecurity in east africa fews net 2021 5 conclusions over the previous decades hydrometeorological extreme like floods and droughts have been continual and recurrent in the lake victoria basin recently the lake victoria basin experienced extreme floods in 2019 2020 and drought conditions in early 2022 high resolution spatial and temporal monitoring of hydrological variables are vital for improving understanding of hydrology within the lake victoria basin particularly given the region s dense population and vulnerability to sub seasonal hydrological anomalies which can lead to the loss of life and property crop failure food insecurity and increased poverty however there are insufficient in situ hydrological observations in the lake victoria basin to fill this need thus in this study we leverage publicly available earth observations and model data to capture occurrence of the recent flood and drought events in the lake victoria basin we examined and discussed components of the hydrological water balance precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and change in total water storage and additional hydrological variables soil moisture lake height and lake extent with specific regard to the recent hydrological extreme events this was accomplished through construction of time series and spatial plots of monthly anomalies for each variable our results improve understanding and documentation of the severity and duration of the recent flood and drought events the innovation of this work is that it offers a simple method of using publicly available earth observations and model data to improve spatial and temporal analyses of hydrological anomalies at sub seasonal time scales within a region lacking in situ data to our knowledge this is the first study to conduct a hydrological spatial anomaly comparison for the 2019 2020 flood and 2021 2022 drought events in the lake victoria basin thus this is a novel contribution to the existing record of hydrological research in this region because it updates previous studies and is among the first to integrate such a diverse array of publicly available datasets for the lake victoria basin further work could assess this method for informing water resources management in this region particularly for informing scheduling planting irrigation and harvesting of crops this would be valuable given the lake victoria basin s growing population and economic reliance on rain fed subsistence agriculture additionally a comparison of 9 km and 1 km near surface soil moisture products derived and downscaled from smap was conducted to improve spatial resolution of soil moisture observations in the lake victoria basin the 1 km near surface soil moisture product was validated with ground station near surface soil moisture data available through the international soil moisture network and performed either better or comparably to the 9 km smap observations this was the first validation of the 1 km near surface soil moisture product in the continent of africa further research should continue validation efforts of soil moisture data derived from earth observations in the lake victoria basin and africa in the limited regions where ground based observations are available methods and findings from this study can be used to advance understanding and monitoring methods of sub seasonal hydrological anomalies within the lake victoria basin particularly through publicly available earth observations by demonstrating a simple method for improved monitoring of hydrological variables including precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture lake height and twsa this study supports the continual effort to decrease the lake victoria basin community s vulnerability to
