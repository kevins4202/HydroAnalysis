focusing on the effects of human factors on the success of sea wars coraddu 2013 implemented ship model testing with a 7 2 m long naval vessel model in still lake waters they explored the asymmetric propeller behaviour of the twin screw ship during navigation fossati et al 2015 conducted experiments on ship motion and wave load in actual seas using a 9 99 m long yacht model sun et al 2015 experimentally studied the seakeeping performance of two large scale ship models with lengths of approximately 7 m jiao et al 2018 comprehensively studied the seakeeping performance of a 12 5 m long segmented ship model however the ship models used by these researchers had a maximum length of about 13 m hence there were still apparent scale effects moreover to the best of our knowledge no scholars have ever performed ship model resistance tests in real sea environments the previous self propelled ship model tests were typically carried out in sheltered sea areas or lakes which lack realistic wind wave and current conditions in view of the above we developed a new comprehensive testing system to assess the resistance and propulsion performance of ship models in actual seas it can be used to study and analyse the performance of new types of ship including high performance ones combining the advantages of tank model testing and full scale ship testing in actual seas this new technique has considerable advantages testing occurs in an offshore environment with natural wind wave and current flow conditions which means that the ship model can achieve the same sailing performance as in actual sea conditions the six degrees of freedom dof motions of the ship model are unconstrained during navigation and the motion response characteristics are more realistic than those in tank testing effects such as refraction diffraction and breaking of waves in the ocean and the related effects caused by wind and current flow can be considered tanks cannot simulate a real marine environment owing to the scale effects of wind wave and current flow and limitations of the wave making capacity waves in a tank have viscosities and surface tensions that are many times larger than real waves in the ocean and artificial waves are affected by friction and reflection at the tank wall in addition the content of entrapped air bubbles in the free surface is relatively low wind scaling is also of significance and the reynolds number is not correctly simulated at the model scale which means that inertial wind forces in the tank are proportionally smaller unrestrained by the scale and functions of tanks the ship model is largely free from model scale effects and the blockage effects of tanks a wide range of experiments can be implemented including resistance and propulsion performance seakeeping performance manoeuvrability and underwater explosion tests in addition to experiments under complicated and dangerous working conditions more scientific accurate and reliable technical support can be provided for both the optimal design of the ship performance and the evaluation of comprehensive performance and application characteristics of platforms this comprehensive test system for the resistance and propulsion performance of a ship model in actual seas provides a new direction for the study of ship performance to validate the developed testing technique we conducted a series of tests on a 25 m long ship model in actual seas in qingdao china 35 9 n 120 2 e the experiments included resistance self propulsion partial seakeeping performance and manoeuvrability tests we accumulated abundant data which is invaluable for the design of ship models for sea testing design and demonstration of testing schemes installation and commissioning of equipment and the construction of safeguarding systems for testing at sea these experiments can be extended to various aspects of the ship and provide a good reference for other large scale model tests as an example this study considers an energy saving device esd which includes a preswirl stator pss and rudder bulb and investigates the energy saving function of the installed esd see fig 1 2 ship model setup in this study a glass fibre reinforced plastic ship model is considered for sea testing modelled after the 230000dwt csb fortune a large scale ore carrier at a 1 13 scale the model is a single engine single propeller stern driven ship with a block coefficient c b of 0 83 the ship model is that of a full form ship with a bulbous bow parallel midbody and transom stern the main parameters are listed in table 1 fig 2 shows the layout of the ship model which includes propulsion and autopilot systems see fig 3 in the stern room integrated navigation system and data collection system in the cab and ballast blocks with a total weight of 95 tonnes the propulsion system comprises a console 30 kw generator integrated cabinet servomotor and reduction gear with a reduction ratio of 1 4 broken shaft type self propulsion instrument two couplings and a shaft and propeller on the bottom platform of the stern room therefore the rotating speed of the propeller can be controlled as required the broken shaft type self propulsion instrument see fig 3c can simultaneously measure the thrust and torque of the propeller of the 25 m long ship model with high accuracy independently developed by us it is the core technology of this propeller system by dividing the units it applies two independent structures to reanalyse the thrust and torque of the propeller hence the different strain units bear only the axial or circumferential deformation avoiding crosstalk between the thrust and torque the contactless torque sensor integrates the flexibility of digital signal conditioning with carrier amplifier technology which significantly improves measurement accuracy the autopilot system is also driven by the generator and integrated cabinet it comprises a servomotor and reduction gear with a reduction ratio of 1 10 transmission mechanism rudder stopper rudder stock and semi spade rudder body on the rear deck of the stern room the integrated navigation system which uses the global positioning system gps and an inertial navigation system ins can monitor the 6 dof motions of the ship model the data collection system also contains two parts the first part embedded in the console is used for collecting related information on the main engine steering engine and integrated navigation system and for controlling the propulsion and autopilot systems in real time the other part connected to sensors is used for recording data such as the thrust and torque of the propeller and the accelerated speed of the fore midship and aft parts of the ship model all sensors and the console are powered by batteries to separate the strong currents from the weak thereby avoiding signal interference as the deadweight of the ship model is relatively large the selection and arrangement of the ballast blocks is considerably challenging after careful design concrete blocks and sandbags were used as ballast blocks and tiled on the hull bottom most of the ballast was loaded into the ship model while on the dock car the remaining ballast was loaded into the ship model and levelled after launching 3 comprehensive test system fig 4 shows a block diagram of the comprehensive test system for the resistance and propulsion performance of a ship model in actual seas the comprehensive test system is divided into two parts a resistance testing system and a self propulsion testing system 3 1 resistance testing system the first part of the comprehensive test system includes a system for resistance testing in a harbour it is necessary to select a suitable harbour based on the testing needs the factors to be considered include the length water depth experimental area infrastructure such as water electricity and winching equipment and the wind and waves in the harbour after the arrangement of the ballast blocks the ship model was launched by end launching its floating status was then adjusted to the designed waterline and an auxiliary vessel was used to tow it to the experimental area two high power winches see figs 5a and b and 6 were installed diagonally in the harbour winch a equipped with a frequency conversion control cabinet permits manual input of the target rotating speed of the drum it is used to haul the ship model such that it can sail at the required speed winch b equipped with a brake apparatus provides a pretightening force for the model it is used to stabilise the sailing direction of the ship model and support the operation of winch a on each side of the experimental area a pulley was installed along the line connecting winches a and b to ensure that the ship model moves in the designated linear path during resistance testing the error in the angle of the force sensors relative to the line of the channel was less than 3 the measurement error of the ship model speed and resistance caused by the angle error was less than 0 4 and could therefore be neglected the two ends of the force sensors at the bow and stern of the ship were respectively connected to the hull and a rope through swivel hoist rings see fig 7 preventing the ropes from breaking away from the sensors owing to circumferential forces the scheme for resistance testing is as follows 1 a buoy type wave weight instrument was launched before testing along with the anemorumbometer see fig 8 it measures and records the sea condition during the experiments and ensures that the sea condition meets the requirements set in iso 15016 2015 the wind and wave levels should be below level 2 and the wave height and wind speed must be less than 0 2 m and 3 4 m s respectively testing above the half tide level the corresponding depth of water was d 3 b t and the froude depth number was f n h 0 5 can eliminate shallow water effects ittc 2017a moreover the froude depth number of the ship model does not vary along the track of the model in resistance testing the width of the narrowest part of the channel was approximately twice the length of the ship model see fig 5a further the blockage midship sectional area channel cross section was less than 2 0 in this case the sidewall effects are negligible as stated in ittc 2017a and xie et al 1978 this was further confirmed by analysing the resistance data in the time domain as no evident changes were observed when the ship passed through the narrowest part thus it can be assumed that resistance testing is not disturbed by the boundary of the water area 2 a security inspection was performed before testing to ensure normal equipment operation 3 winch a was used for hauling the ship model at a constant speed it was maintained under horizontal tension and coincided with the centre line of the ship model during testing 4 after the ship model entered the measuring area from the accelerating area and reached the speed required for testing the force balance was used to obtain raw data for 40 s of measurement the braking rope was then used to slow the ship model 5 an auxiliary vessel was launched to assist the ship model in returning to the starting point for testing under other working conditions 6 the esd see fig 1b was changed underwater to perform fully appended resistance testing 3 2 self propulsion testing system the second part of the comprehensive test system includes a self propulsion testing system used in actual seas we accomplished self propulsion testing in an actual sea as depicted in fig 5c 5f as shown in fig 5g self propulsion testing was conducted in sea waters 5 km from the shore of qingdao the water temperature of the testing area was approximately 21 c and the water depth was approximately 20 m before testing the weather forecast was checked to determine whether it was suitable for sea testing before starting the experiments the ship model was towed to a suitable testing area by an auxiliary vessel initial testing was conducted with a ship speed of zero which included the correction of the propeller torque and measurement of the wind speed and direction during testing an environmental collection system was applied for real time monitoring of the wind wave and current flows as shown in fig 4 with reference to the testing method used in real ships a scheme for the self propulsion testing of ship models in actual seas was designed during self propulsion testing a certain direction was considered as the reference the ship model sailed in a straight line in a fixed direction at a constant propeller rotating speed data were collected once the sailing speed had stabilised after at least 10 min of operation testing was conducted at different propeller rotating speeds along with an increase in the number of rotations when the ship model returned the reference direction was rotated 180 and the same testing procedure was performed the speed of the ship model relative to the ground v g and the thrust and torque of the propeller were measured during testing during the testing process the auxiliary vessel was 500 m away in the convoy a captain was on the ship model to mitigate potential dangers such as submerged reefs in the navigation area 4 data processing method combining the existing technologies and the achievements of tank model testing and full scale ship testing in seas we developed related technological methods suitable for ship model testing in actual seas for resistance testing in the harbour the resistance value at a certain sailing speed can be obtained by calculating the difference between the two force balances at the bow and stern of the ship model as actual sea conditions are complicated and continuously changing to compare the various performance indicators of the ship model under different conditions during self propulsion testing in actual seas it is necessary to consider the methods proposed by thomson 1978 ittc 2017a and iso 2015 the testing data under actual sea conditions must then be revised mainly considering the effects of tidal flows wind resistance of the superstructure and added resistance by the waves the uncertainty of the test results was analysed according to the methods proposed by aldous et al 2015 iso 2008 and ittc 2017b the combined standard uncertainty u c y was evaluated by the propagation of uncertainty given by eq 1 park et al 2015a ittc 2008 1 u c y i 1 n f x i 2 u 2 x i 2 i 1 n 1 j i 1 n f x i f x j u 2 x i x j 1 2 where u is the standard uncertainty of the result of a measurement expressed as a standard deviation y f x 1 x 2 x n is the experimental result and f x i is the sensitivity coefficient of the sensor at low speeds the ship model will be considerably affected by the water flow causing it to yaw or even stop sailing therefore the self propulsion test was performed only when the ship s speed was greater than that of the current it is necessary to select an appropriate revision method based on the tidal flows in the testing area given that every self propulsion test duration of the ship model is considerably shorter than the tidal cycle this study applied the mean of means mom method to revise the sailing speed for this revision the ship model must operate six times at three different levels of horsepower of the main engine with a steering angle below 5 and the upper limit of the acceptable difference between the real and calculated values at 0 1 kn strasser et al 2015 for accurate results two round trip runs under the same working conditions need to be conducted for testing after which the mom method can be applied to derive the following equation for revising the sailing speed 2 v m v g 1 3 v g 2 3 v g 3 v g 4 8 the thrust and torque measurements of the propeller can also be revised using the mom method self propulsion testing is typically conducted in areas with a sufficient water depth however when it is necessary to adjust for the effects of shallow water and revise the speed a m d 2 0 05 where a m is the underwater orthographic projection area and d is the water depth the lackenby method is suggested lackenby 1963 eq 3 is used for calculating the incremental value of the revised speed δ v g 3 δ v g 0 1242 a m d 2 0 05 1 t a n d g d v g 2 1 2 v g as the windward area of the structure above the waterline including the superstructure is relatively large and the wind speed at sea is considerable the air resistance cannot be ignored the incremental value of the wind resistance r a a can be calculated by eq 4 as proposed by ittc 2018 4 r a a 0 5 ρ a c d a ψ w r r e f a x v v w r r e f 2 0 5 ρ a c d a 0 a x v v g 2 where ρ a is the density of air a x v is the area of the cross section that bears the maximum wind blow v w r r e f is the relative wind speed at the benchmark height and ψ w r r e f is the relative wind direction at the benchmark height 0 indicates the windward direction as shown in fig 9 the air drag coefficient c d a can be obtained through a computational fluid dynamics cfd method wind tunnel testing with relevant models or the relevant statistical information provided by iso15016 2015 iso 2015 or through the regression equation proposed by fujiwara et al 2005 the error in r a a was less than 20 the uncertainty introduced by r a a which mainly arises from the relative wind direction was less than 25 n as self propulsion testing of the ship model in actual seas cannot be conducted in still waters the effect of waves on the sailing speed under actual sea conditions should be considered when the heave and pitch of the ship model during testing are relatively small the vertical acceleration of the bow is lower than 0 05 g and the relative wave direction is below 45 it is advisable to apply the stawave 1 method boom et al 2013 eq 5 is the empirical equation for the added resistance by the waves r a w proposed by ittc 2017a 5 r a w 1 16 ρ s g h w 1 3 2 b b l b w l where ρ s is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration h w 1 3 is the significant wave height of the wind waves and l b w l is the length of the bow on the water line at 95 of the maximum beam see fig 9d all self propulsion tests were conducted at sea with h w 1 3 0 12 m the error in r a w was less than 15 and the uncertainty introduced by r a w was less than 10 n it is difficult to completely adjust the loading conditions of the ship model at sea to the standard loading conditions however this adjustment will cause the displacement of the ship model to differ from the standard displacement generally a range of 2 from the standard displacement is permitted for the actual displacement both ittc 2017a and iso 2015 apply eq 6 to calculate the incremental value of the resistance r a d i s caused by the difference in displacement 6 r a d i s 0 65 r m δ 0 δ 1 where δ 0 is the standard displacement and r m is the resistance of the ship model the ship model ballast and equipment were weighed before loading the error in δ was less than 1 and the relative uncertainty introduced by r m was less than 5 therefore the resistance increment caused by wind waves and displacement deviations under actual sea conditions δ r can be obtained using eq 7 7 δ r r a a r a w r a d i s other factors such as yawing steering and changes in the water temperature and density of sea water only affect the sailing speed to a small degree and can therefore be ignored some of the results acquired through the above revision method are depicted in fig 10 8 η d p e p d b r x v 75 η s η g p s where p e is the effective power of the ship model p d b is the received power of propeller η s is the shafting transmission efficiency η g is the efficiency of reduction gear and p s is the power from the motor 5 results and discussion analysis of the resistance testing results revealed that the effect of the esd on the incremental value of the resistance of the ship model increases with an increase in sailing speed see fig 10a r x was the revised resistance based on the r m obtained from the resistance testing and the resistance increment δ r during self propulsion testing see fig 10b the error in r x was less than 8 the time series of the propeller thrust and torque with increasing propeller rotating speed in one test are presented in fig 11 note that for each propeller rotating speed both the propeller thrust and torque reach a steady state which oscillates by about a mean value in addition the amplitudes of the torque are significantly larger than those of the propeller thrust there are evident scale effects in studies on the energy saving function of esds shen et al 2016 therefore it is meaningful to explore such functions of an esd installed on the 25 m long ship model the performance of the propeller operating in natural seas i e in actual seawater differs from that in testing tanks with lower reynolds numbers as shown by the results of the self propulsion testing of the ship model in actual seas the propulsive efficiency of the model improves significantly when the esd is installed see fig 10c the propulsive efficiency appreciation of the esd installed propeller δ η d increased with the ship s speed reaching 2 92 at fn 0 15 during the self propulsion testing fig 12 compares the results of the mooring test and the self propulsion test it indicates that when the advance speed of the propeller is zero both the thrust and torque of the propeller are relatively high the errors in the thrust and torque of the propeller measured by the broken shaft type self propulsion instrument were less than 2 of the reading when the esd is installed the thrust of the propeller increases whereas its torque decreases this verifies the energy saving function of the esd the esd achieves energy savings as follows 1 the pss produces favourable thrust by changing the direction of water flow park et al 2015b and 2 the rudder bulb prevents flow separation by weakening the hub vortices improving the propulsive efficiency shin et al 2012 in a ship model towing tank the kelvin wave of a ship model with a relatively wide breadth cannot unfold completely instead it will reflect at the sidewalls of the tank combined with blockage effects it is impossible to obtain a perfect kelvin wave however evident kelvin waves can be obtained in the self propulsion testing of a ship model in actual seas as shown in fig 10d the wakes of the ship model when it turns around are distinctive as shown in figs 5d and e the wave energy produced by the ship model during self propulsion testing can be determined through the analysis of the waveform particle image velocimetry can be applied to monitor the characteristics of the flow field at typical positions of the ship model in actual seas to verify the cfd results 6 conclusions in this paper the scheme and results obtained for a comprehensive test system for ship model resistance and propulsion performance in actual seas were presented the effects of an esd on the ship performance under actual sea conditions were also assessed the results established that the proposed technique is reliable and the energy saving function of the esd was confirmed the comprehensive test system and method can be used for diverse purposes including as a reference guide for other large scale model tests the test system can be further improved by enhancing the test device accuracy and further optimising the data processing methods with this system conventional tests for the seakeeping performance and manoeuvrability can be extended in addition related equipment can be installed to perform specific tests such as ship underwater explosion tests and tests for the exciting force of the propeller it is expected that more ship models will be constructed by applying this comprehensive test system to a ship model in actual seas to enhance test data and verify and optimise the testing schemes and test result handling methods which can pave the way for remarkable achievements in the near future author contributions section jian feng lin

model at a constant speed it was maintained under horizontal tension and coincided with the centre line of the ship model during testing 4 after the ship model entered the measuring area from the accelerating area and reached the speed required for testing the force balance was used to obtain raw data for 40 s of measurement the braking rope was then used to slow the ship model 5 an auxiliary vessel was launched to assist the ship model in returning to the starting point for testing under other working conditions 6 the esd see fig 1b was changed underwater to perform fully appended resistance testing 3 2 self propulsion testing system the second part of the comprehensive test system includes a self propulsion testing system used in actual seas we accomplished self propulsion testing in an actual sea as depicted in fig 5c 5f as shown in fig 5g self propulsion testing was conducted in sea waters 5 km from the shore of qingdao the water temperature of the testing area was approximately 21 c and the water depth was approximately 20 m before testing the weather forecast was checked to determine whether it was suitable for sea testing before starting the experiments the ship model was towed to a suitable testing area by an auxiliary vessel initial testing was conducted with a ship speed of zero which included the correction of the propeller torque and measurement of the wind speed and direction during testing an environmental collection system was applied for real time monitoring of the wind wave and current flows as shown in fig 4 with reference to the testing method used in real ships a scheme for the self propulsion testing of ship models in actual seas was designed during self propulsion testing a certain direction was considered as the reference the ship model sailed in a straight line in a fixed direction at a constant propeller rotating speed data were collected once the sailing speed had stabilised after at least 10 min of operation testing was conducted at different propeller rotating speeds along with an increase in the number of rotations when the ship model returned the reference direction was rotated 180 and the same testing procedure was performed the speed of the ship model relative to the ground v g and the thrust and torque of the propeller were measured during testing during the testing process the auxiliary vessel was 500 m away in the convoy a captain was on the ship model to mitigate potential dangers such as submerged reefs in the navigation area 4 data processing method combining the existing technologies and the achievements of tank model testing and full scale ship testing in seas we developed related technological methods suitable for ship model testing in actual seas for resistance testing in the harbour the resistance value at a certain sailing speed can be obtained by calculating the difference between the two force balances at the bow and stern of the ship model as actual sea conditions are complicated and continuously changing to compare the various performance indicators of the ship model under different conditions during self propulsion testing in actual seas it is necessary to consider the methods proposed by thomson 1978 ittc 2017a and iso 2015 the testing data under actual sea conditions must then be revised mainly considering the effects of tidal flows wind resistance of the superstructure and added resistance by the waves the uncertainty of the test results was analysed according to the methods proposed by aldous et al 2015 iso 2008 and ittc 2017b the combined standard uncertainty u c y was evaluated by the propagation of uncertainty given by eq 1 park et al 2015a ittc 2008 1 u c y i 1 n f x i 2 u 2 x i 2 i 1 n 1 j i 1 n f x i f x j u 2 x i x j 1 2 where u is the standard uncertainty of the result of a measurement expressed as a standard deviation y f x 1 x 2 x n is the experimental result and f x i is the sensitivity coefficient of the sensor at low speeds the ship model will be considerably affected by the water flow causing it to yaw or even stop sailing therefore the self propulsion test was performed only when the ship s speed was greater than that of the current it is necessary to select an appropriate revision method based on the tidal flows in the testing area given that every self propulsion test duration of the ship model is considerably shorter than the tidal cycle this study applied the mean of means mom method to revise the sailing speed for this revision the ship model must operate six times at three different levels of horsepower of the main engine with a steering angle below 5 and the upper limit of the acceptable difference between the real and calculated values at 0 1 kn strasser et al 2015 for accurate results two round trip runs under the same working conditions need to be conducted for testing after which the mom method can be applied to derive the following equation for revising the sailing speed 2 v m v g 1 3 v g 2 3 v g 3 v g 4 8 the thrust and torque measurements of the propeller can also be revised using the mom method self propulsion testing is typically conducted in areas with a sufficient water depth however when it is necessary to adjust for the effects of shallow water and revise the speed a m d 2 0 05 where a m is the underwater orthographic projection area and d is the water depth the lackenby method is suggested lackenby 1963 eq 3 is used for calculating the incremental value of the revised speed δ v g 3 δ v g 0 1242 a m d 2 0 05 1 t a n d g d v g 2 1 2 v g as the windward area of the structure above the waterline including the superstructure is relatively large and the wind speed at sea is considerable the air resistance cannot be ignored the incremental value of the wind resistance r a a can be calculated by eq 4 as proposed by ittc 2018 4 r a a 0 5 ρ a c d a ψ w r r e f a x v v w r r e f 2 0 5 ρ a c d a 0 a x v v g 2 where ρ a is the density of air a x v is the area of the cross section that bears the maximum wind blow v w r r e f is the relative wind speed at the benchmark height and ψ w r r e f is the relative wind direction at the benchmark height 0 indicates the windward direction as shown in fig 9 the air drag coefficient c d a can be obtained through a computational fluid dynamics cfd method wind tunnel testing with relevant models or the relevant statistical information provided by iso15016 2015 iso 2015 or through the regression equation proposed by fujiwara et al 2005 the error in r a a was less than 20 the uncertainty introduced by r a a which mainly arises from the relative wind direction was less than 25 n as self propulsion testing of the ship model in actual seas cannot be conducted in still waters the effect of waves on the sailing speed under actual sea conditions should be considered when the heave and pitch of the ship model during testing are relatively small the vertical acceleration of the bow is lower than 0 05 g and the relative wave direction is below 45 it is advisable to apply the stawave 1 method boom et al 2013 eq 5 is the empirical equation for the added resistance by the waves r a w proposed by ittc 2017a 5 r a w 1 16 ρ s g h w 1 3 2 b b l b w l where ρ s is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration h w 1 3 is the significant wave height of the wind waves and l b w l is the length of the bow on the water line at 95 of the maximum beam see fig 9d all self propulsion tests were conducted at sea with h w 1 3 0 12 m the error in r a w was less than 15 and the uncertainty introduced by r a w was less than 10 n it is difficult to completely adjust the loading conditions of the ship model at sea to the standard loading conditions however this adjustment will cause the displacement of the ship model to differ from the standard displacement generally a range of 2 from the standard displacement is permitted for the actual displacement both ittc 2017a and iso 2015 apply eq 6 to calculate the incremental value of the resistance r a d i s caused by the difference in displacement 6 r a d i s 0 65 r m δ 0 δ 1 where δ 0 is the standard displacement and r m is the resistance of the ship model the ship model ballast and equipment were weighed before loading the error in δ was less than 1 and the relative uncertainty introduced by r m was less than 5 therefore the resistance increment caused by wind waves and displacement deviations under actual sea conditions δ r can be obtained using eq 7 7 δ r r a a r a w r a d i s other factors such as yawing steering and changes in the water temperature and density of sea water only affect the sailing speed to a small degree and can therefore be ignored some of the results acquired through the above revision method are depicted in fig 10 8 η d p e p d b r x v 75 η s η g p s where p e is the effective power of the ship model p d b is the received power of propeller η s is the shafting transmission efficiency η g is the efficiency of reduction gear and p s is the power from the motor 5 results and discussion analysis of the resistance testing results revealed that the effect of the esd on the incremental value of the resistance of the ship model increases with an increase in sailing speed see fig 10a r x was the revised resistance based on the r m obtained from the resistance testing and the resistance increment δ r during self propulsion testing see fig 10b the error in r x was less than 8 the time series of the propeller thrust and torque with increasing propeller rotating speed in one test are presented in fig 11 note that for each propeller rotating speed both the propeller thrust and torque reach a steady state which oscillates by about a mean value in addition the amplitudes of the torque are significantly larger than those of the propeller thrust there are evident scale effects in studies on the energy saving function of esds shen et al 2016 therefore it is meaningful to explore such functions of an esd installed on the 25 m long ship model the performance of the propeller operating in natural seas i e in actual seawater differs from that in testing tanks with lower reynolds numbers as shown by the results of the self propulsion testing of the ship model in actual seas the propulsive efficiency of the model improves significantly when the esd is installed see fig 10c the propulsive efficiency appreciation of the esd installed propeller δ η d increased with the ship s speed reaching 2 92 at fn 0 15 during the self propulsion testing fig 12 compares the results of the mooring test and the self propulsion test it indicates that when the advance speed of the propeller is zero both the thrust and torque of the propeller are relatively high the errors in the thrust and torque of the propeller measured by the broken shaft type self propulsion instrument were less than 2 of the reading when the esd is installed the thrust of the propeller increases whereas its torque decreases this verifies the energy saving function of the esd the esd achieves energy savings as follows 1 the pss produces favourable thrust by changing the direction of water flow park et al 2015b and 2 the rudder bulb prevents flow separation by weakening the hub vortices improving the propulsive efficiency shin et al 2012 in a ship model towing tank the kelvin wave of a ship model with a relatively wide breadth cannot unfold completely instead it will reflect at the sidewalls of the tank combined with blockage effects it is impossible to obtain a perfect kelvin wave however evident kelvin waves can be obtained in the self propulsion testing of a ship model in actual seas as shown in fig 10d the wakes of the ship model when it turns around are distinctive as shown in figs 5d and e the wave energy produced by the ship model during self propulsion testing can be determined through the analysis of the waveform particle image velocimetry can be applied to monitor the characteristics of the flow field at typical positions of the ship model in actual seas to verify the cfd results 6 conclusions in this paper the scheme and results obtained for a comprehensive test system for ship model resistance and propulsion performance in actual seas were presented the effects of an esd on the ship performance under actual sea conditions were also assessed the results established that the proposed technique is reliable and the energy saving function of the esd was confirmed the comprehensive test system and method can be used for diverse purposes including as a reference guide for other large scale model tests the test system can be further improved by enhancing the test device accuracy and further optimising the data processing methods with this system conventional tests for the seakeeping performance and manoeuvrability can be extended in addition related equipment can be installed to perform specific tests such as ship underwater explosion tests and tests for the exciting force of the propeller it is expected that more ship models will be constructed by applying this comprehensive test system to a ship model in actual seas to enhance test data and verify and optimise the testing schemes and test result handling methods which can pave the way for remarkable achievements in the near future author contributions section jian feng lin

22136,a grand aim of aquaculturists is to investigate the interactions between the oceanic environment and aquaculture structures in order to make the structures more durable to loads caused by waves and current to that end we investigate the effects of extreme wave conditions by leveraging a physical model approach we assume that the floating collar of the cage moves with the wave in heave leading to extreme conditions thus the wavelength is much larger than the size of the floating collar model and the wave frequency is much lower than the natural period of heave for the floating collar model without netting under wave only conditions the first and second harmonic components of the vertical acceleration are proportional to the wave amplitude ζ a and square of the wave amplitude ζ a 2 respectively the third and fourth harmonic components exhibit oscillations at non dimensional wave number ν a 0 055 due to the change of free surface for the floating cage model under combined waves and current conditions the first harmonic component is more likely proportional to ζ a while the second harmonic component shows erratic behavior the effects of mooring loads in front and aft mooring lines are also assessed keywords physical model approach nonlinear vertical accelerations mooring loads aquaculture cage wave structure interaction 1 introduction cage based aquaculture involves growing fish in all types of aquatic environments enclosing the fish in a net cage protects them from predators and enables monitoring of the stock health waves and current are the most relevant factors for cage design installation operation as well as maintenance a number of physical models which simplify the interaction between the fluid and aquaculture cage have been proposed for instance model of high density polyethylene hdpe circular rings has been developed for simulating the floating collar of the net pen deployed in eastport me usa fredriksson et al 2007a the obtained elasticity modulus was used in finite element structural analysis in addition incited by a fluid structure model from tsukrov et al 2003 2005 field measurements have been performed and mooring gear operational limits of a hdpe net pen have been established fredriksson et al 2007b the overall hydrodynamic behavior of the floating collar has been analyzed by dividing the floating collar into several segments li et al 2007 each segment is treated as partially submerged rigid cylinder sarpkaya 1976 estimated the drag and inertia coefficients of a submerged horizontal cylinder by the morison equation he found that the hydrodynamic coefficients depended on the keulegan carpenter kc number and reynolds re number following sarpkaya s principle kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 predicted the drag coefficient of the collar to be 1 0 they also observed a drag coefficient higher than 1 0 in case of high sea states when the collar goes in and out of water furthermore empirical expressions for hydrodynamic coefficients in terms of kc number were developed by considering the distance between upstream and downstream pipes of the floating collar xu et al 2018 the coefficients for the downstream pipe were found to decrease due to the shielding from the upstream pipe chen and christensen 2018 employed computational fluid dynamics cfd with the aim of analyzing the interactions between the fluid and the floating collars with emphasis of the free surface effects on the collars xu et al 2018 observed that the drag force of the floating collar followed with the lowering of the free surface hydrodynamic characteristics of multi cage systems were investigated via experimental tests and the mooring loads the volume reduction and damping effects have been documented thoroughly bi et al 2015 xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2015a most recently zhao et al 2019 investigated a new semi submersible offshore fish farm subjected to waves the analysis of mooring loads and dynamic response provides us new insights for development of aquaculture farms the potential flow theory and the beam theory have been extensively utilized in the analysis of the nonlinear deformation and hydrodynamic response of the floating collar suhey et al 2005 excellent agreements with the theoretical predictions of hydrodynamic forces have been achieved the translation and rotation of the floating collar was obtained from euler s law and curved beam theory as reported in dong et al 2010 following the same theory zhao et al 2015b studied the hydroelastic response of the floating collar subjected to waves based on the theory presented in kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 li et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model based on curved beam theory in order to describe the vertical motion of the floater recently shen et al 2018 utilized the approach proposed by li et al 2016 to investigate the motion of the floating collar the dynamic response of the floating collar examined by bai et al 2016 showed that the fatigue lifetime of floating pipes is more sensitive to the wave period than to the wave height even though a number of studies have been devoted to wave structure interactions of aquaculture cage most of them have focused on the floating collar due to its important share in buoyancy of the entire cage system however the hydrodynamic response of the floating collar with netting has received less attention and is still not completely understood the experimental data from physical model tests is still insufficient for validation of mathematical and numerical implementations in addition the damping between floating collar and the netting via coupling interaction is also not understood well previous works on the aquaculture cages did not study much of combined waves and current conditions which represent the real marine environment therefore in the present study we carry out a series of wave tow basin tests on physical models of a floating cage collar and a floating cage collar with netting a set of considered waves and combined waves and current conditions has been generated in our tests by adjusting the wave steepness and current velocity inspired by the previous experimental studies of li and faltinsen 2012 li et al 2016 2018 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 we simplify the aquaculture cage to a floating collar with netting and mooring system which allows us to experimentally estimate the nonlinear vertical acceleration the mooring loads of the structure and the damping effect of the netting on the floating collar in what follows we first describe and further verify the experiments for the present models in section 2 details of the modeling law and principles of wave generators are also given the non dimensional vertical harmonic acceleration of the model the coupled motion of the floating collar and the netting and other results are presented in section 3 the drag force and the mooring loads are provided in section 4 a thorough explanation and the error analysis of the results are discussed in section 5 in the concluding section section 6 strengths and limitations of the physical model approach are assessed 2 experiments before establishing a scale for the model test in waves three major factors that affect the scale selection need to be examined 1 model characteristics for instance the geometry and the material properties e g bending stiffness 2 wave tow basin dimensions and 3 wave generation dimensions of the basin determine the effect of the reflection of the model and the tank walls on the measurements in general the lower the interference the refection of the model and the tank walls the more accurate the results the wave generator supposes to be capable of producing the scaled wave heights and periods for tests which requires a comprehensive insight into the fundamentals of wave generator theory the flowchart of the physical model test in the present study is depicted in fig 1 and then each part is introduced in detail physical model tests of the aquaculture cage using regular waves and current were carried out at the wave tow basin in zhejiang ocean university zhejiang china the dimensions of the wave tow basin are 130 m length 6 m width 4 5 m height with a constant water depth of 3 5 m the physical models of the aquaculture cage are investigated by towing experiments and waves generated from a hinged flap type wave generator current effects are introduced by towing the model towards the waves 2 1 physical model the physical model we utilized has a 1 25 scale and it corresponds to a specific prototype with a standard diameter of 40 m the scale of 1 25 is typically remarked between a range of scales of the wave tanks from 1 10 to 1 100 chakrabarti 1994 components of the physical model and the wave conditions are froude scaled with geometric similarity except for the nets pe 80 is used to make the floating collar model in this study on fig 2 this hdpe material is commonly used for aquaculture cages dimensions of the inner and outer diameter of the pipe are 30 mm and 36 mm respectively the floating collar model and the bottomless cylindrical net cage were tested as depicted on fig 2 the netting is made of nylon with the solidity ratio of 0 45 resulting in a fine mesh net the physical model details of the cage and mechanical characteristics are provided in table 1 in table 1 the values in parenthesis for mass of net cage are the weights of the floating collars note that the netting in our tests differs from the previous work kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 since we utilize the net model with fine diamond mesh in our case the net solidity s n is defined as 1 s n d w l w e h e v d w 2 l w 2 1 e h 2 1 e v 2 where d w is the twine diameter of the net l w represents the bar length of the net twine e h and e v are the hanging ratios in horizontal and vertical directions respectively e h w i d t h o f n e t 2 n h l w e v h e i g h t o f n e t 2 n v l w n h and n v are the mesh numbers in width and height 2 2 experimental setup we make variables non dimensional to satisfy the similarity principle such as the froude similarity all major components of the aquaculture cage have been tested initially tests of the single circular hdpe ring have been conducted under wave conditions and then the circular hdpe ring with bottomless netting has been tested under combined waves and current conditions there are four almost horizontal moorings attached to the circular hdpe ring to position the model as depicted in fig 3 these four moorings are connected with self designed springs pre tension of 10 n is used to avoid the slack of the mooring lines in response to steeper waves vertical mooring enables the anchors to attach to the bottom of the ocean or the wave tank however this method requires a basin with a false bottom hence we use the horizontal mooring approach in the tests two ideal conditions are assumed 1 the natural frequency does not change with the scaling of the model and 2 the modes of the motion are the same under both vertical and horizontal mooring situations the configuration of the experimental setup is exhibited in fig 3 the origin of cartesian coordinate system is placed at the free surface where z 0 the nearly horizontal mooring is connected to one end of a self designed spring while the other end of the spring is fastened to a force gauge diameter 20 mm height 15 mm accelerometers 18 mm 18 mm 10 mm in dimension 6 g in weight are mounted on the circular floating pipe and are positioned at angles ranging from β 0 to β π with an increment of π 4 they represent the aft aft left left front left and front positions as shown in fig 3 the precision of the accelerometer is 0 005 m s2 six wave probes partially submerged under water are installed to get the mean amplitude of the wave height two cameras are used to record the general behavior of the floating collar model above the water and the netting under the water both cameras run with a frame rate of 60 fps and a resolution of 1280 720 pixels 2 3 test conditions regular wave tests are conducted using the physical model approach with wave frequencies spanning the expected forcing band for the floating collar model regular waves in period range t 1 0 1 6 s with an increment of 0 05s are considered for the case of floating collar model with netting the combined waves and current conditions are applied with the current velocity ranging from 0 1 m s to 0 2 m s and the combined regular wave period in range t 1 0 1 6 s with an increment of 0 1s incident waves with prescribed wave steepness h λ 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 propagating along the x axis direction are applied in all cases these test conditions are summarized in table 2 where h is the wave height and λ is the wavelength before testing the physical model wave calibration is performed to get the ideal wave conditions without the interference of signal noise veritas 2000 the performance of wave generator is crucial for accurate tests the characteristics of generated waves are approximated using linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 the velocity potential φ surface elevation η and dispersion relation are respectively defined as 2 φ g ζ a ω cosh ν h z cosh ν d sin ν x ω t 3 η ζ a cos ν x ω t 4 ω 2 g ν tanh ν h where ζ a is the wave amplitude equal to ½ of the wave height g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the circular frequency ν is the wavenumber equal to 2 π λ λ is the wavelength h is the water depth z is the vertical position in the water column and x is the horizontal position wave generators in wave tow basins are classified into two categories active and passive the active wave generator such as the hinged flap type creates waves by controlling the movement of the flap for the ideal wave conditions of model tests it is not suggested to place the model into the basin since the model can cause interference in calibration of the wave data the effect of current is produced by towing the model towards the wave propagating direction errors within 0 3 compared to the prescribed values are achieved under current only situations after towing measured wave data was filtered and compared to the corresponding prescribed wave for wave calibration the comparisons between prescribed and measured wave heights without the presence of the models are exhibited in table 3 h p and h m are defined as prescribed and measured wave heights in meters 2 4 data processing there are two kinds of data collection routines the standard routines and the test specific routines dean and dalrymple 1991 many of these programs are available in testing facilities however custom developed programs are advantageous for specific model test data for instance calibration errors induced by mismatch between measured and the prescribed values could be observed during tests a test specific code can easily identify this kind of error therefore a complication of these two routines are emerged in our data processing filtering allows isolation of waves and forces accelerations within certain frequency domain we perform digital filtering of the recorded data in order to 1 eliminate noise 2 isolate low and high frequency data 3 prepare data for spectral analysis and 4 remove the transition data for a prescribed sinusoidal wave the actual wave formed in the tank may not have a sinusoidal shape due to the gravity tank bottom and the wave generator effects fourier series analysis is implemented to process the measured wave data in addition the interval between two testing cases should also be sufficiently long to prevent the interference between tests we use an interval of 8 10 min based on wave tow basin dimensions of 130 m length 6 m width 4 5 m height each test is repeated 2 3 times to ensure reproducibility procedures of data processing are as follows 1 obtain the raw data from accelerometers 2 perform digital filtering to obtain harmonic components of the vertical acceleration e g w a ω w a 2 ω w a 3 ω and w a 4 ω 3 normalize the obtained harmonic components of the vertical acceleration by w a c g ζ a and w a n ω ζ a n respectively n 2 3 4 and w a is the harmonic component of the vertical acceleration after filtering nearly steady state data is measured after 20 wave periods and the steady state time window is filtered with band pass filter to remove noise out of the prescribed frequency range the lower and upper limits in frequency are set to 0 95 t and 1 05 t 1 95 t and 2 05 t 2 95 t and 3 05 t 3 95 t and 4 05 t so that the first second third and fourth order harmonics of vertical accelerations can be evaluated after filtering three examples of first harmonic components of vertical accelerations after filtering are depicted in fig 4 the range of the time series for filtering is from 0 35 low limit to 0 50 high limit as shown in fig 4 with red horizontal lines the curves of the time series appear smooth after removal of the noise the experimental vertical accelerations decrease with the increase of the wave steepness the results of nonlinear vertical acceleration and mooring loads in different cases and net configurations are reported in the following sections 3 results for nonlinear vertical acceleration 3 1 model of floating collar the nonlinear vertical acceleration of scaled floating collar model is experimentally investigated under regular waves fig 5 demonstrates the dependence of non dimensional steady state harmonic acceleration amplitudes including w a ω w a 2 ω w a 3 ω and w a 4 ω on non dimensional wave number ν a which contains all three wave steepness 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 at front β π and aft β 0 positions along the floating collar to compare magnitudes of different harmonic terms we normalize the harmonic terms with the frequency ω and amplitude ζ a of the incident regular waves as can be seen in fig 5 the overall trend is that the non dimensional harmonic acceleration amplitudes increase with non dimensional wave numbers the non dimensional terms at the front position of the floating collar are slightly larger than those at the aft position this quantitative analysis coincides with the wave tank observations since the front and aft positions along the floating collar are exposed to the wave propagating direction harmonic accelerations at these positions are predominantly caused by heave and pitch the motion at aft position is relatively still compared to front position because the heave has more pronounced effect on the aft position there is an inflection point that appears at non dimensional wave number ν a 0 055 in the front position of the floating collar for third and fourth harmonic components the harmonic terms increase nearly linear followed by a drop at the aft position the higher order harmonic terms vary significantly for the wave steepness of 1 15 this strong nonlinearity is induced by the change of free surface which is presented in the steeper waves as overtopping occurs during the overtopping process the flow separates from the boundary layer region and the flow field in the aft position is disturbed the froude krylov force contributes less to non linearity of the harmonic terms in the disturbed flow field we see linear dependence between the non dimensional harmonic acceleration amplitudes and the wave steepness this is because high wave steepness causes large structure motion and vice versa however most of the first harmonic components for the wave steepness of 1 15 are smaller than those for the wave steepness of 1 60 after comparison we found that the ratio between mean values of first harmonic accelerations and wave amplitude w a ω ζ a for wave steepness of 1 60 is larger than the one for wave steepness of 1 15 this causes term w a ω c g ζ a for wave steepness of 1 60 to be larger than the one for wave steepness of 1 15 therefore it is wave amplitude ζ a rather than the non dimensional harmonic acceleration amplitude that plays the dominant role for the first harmonic term for the wave steepness of 1 15 when the non dimensional wave number is less than 0 05 the fourth harmonic component in the aft position is much higher than for any other wave steepness it is important to note the low frequency effect leading to this nonlinearity a perturbation method employed in our study indicates that w a ω w a 2 ω w a 3 ω and w a 4 ω are most likely proportional to ζ a ζ a 2 ζ a 3 and ζ a 4 respectively fig 6 provides information on the trends in dependence of non dimensional acceleration terms on the non dimensional wave number at front β π and aft β 0 positions along the floating collar clearly no significant inflection point appears in these dependences from figs 5 and 6 it is evident that the overall trends for first and second harmonic terms show correlations with the wave amplitudes for different wave steepness e g 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 third and fourth harmonic terms normalized with ζ a 3 and ζ a 4 have magnitudes of o 10 4 and o 10 6 respectively however observed correlations are not completely proportional as it can be seen on fig 6 we note that the small wave steepness of 1 60 does not seem to correlate well with the wave amplitude for higher order harmonic components the overtopping and nonlinear froude krylov force cannot fully explain the absence of correlation for small wave steepness 1 60 meaning that the nonlinear froude krylov forces could be responsible for the absence the correlation however we do not observe separation of the flow for small wave steepness of 1 60 viscous effects corresponding to the boundary layer flow are assumed negligible in the present study the kc number is relatively small faltinsen 1993 reported that the flow separation does not occur when keulegan carpenter kc number is less than 2 3 therefore the flow separation does not seem to be the cause of the uncorrelated non dimensional acceleration amplitude and wave number for low wave steepness of 1 60 3 2 model of floating cage in this section we focus on the vertical acceleration of a scaled floating cage model under combined regular waves and current differs from the floating collar model the floating cage model retains principal components of the aquaculture cage such as the floating collar the mooring system the netting and the bottom weights see figs 2 and 3 we intend to investigate the damping effects from the netting on the vertical acceleration of the entire floating cage model and the coupled motion the bottom portion of the net is not taking into account when evaluating the damping effects fig 7 8 show the non dimensional steady state harmonic acceleration amplitudes of the floating cage for all combined waves and current tests at front β π and aft β 0 positions along the floating collar note that the subscripts u 1 and u 2 u 1 0 1 m s and u 2 0 2 m s are the current velocities used in the present study w a u 1 2 ω represents the non dimensional harmonic acceleration under combined waves and current conditions similar trends can be observed in figs 7 8 for the floating cage compared to the floating collar without netting the harmonic acceleration increases with the non dimensional wave number and it is larger at the front position than at the aft position for the second harmonic component in steeper waves with current velocity of 0 1 m s there is a sudden drop when the non dimensional wave number exceeds 0 04 this implies that the low frequency strongly affects the higher order harmonics component of the acceleration and that the current induced free surface motion enhances the nonlinearity the same trends are observed in fig 8 where the current velocity approaches 0 2 m s slight differences in the case of wave steepness of 1 60 indicate that the increase of the frequency can result in higher values for second harmonic components compared with the floating collar model the harmonic acceleration for the floating cage model is reduced the tethered netting moves up and down with the floating collar according to the wave tank tests and the damping effect from the netting hinders the vertical motion of the floating cage when the wave is combined with a current speed of 0 1 m s the average decrease of first harmonic component is roughly 10 wave steepness of 1 60 19 wave steepness of 1 30 and 26 wave steepness of 1 15 the harmonic acceleration also decreases when the current velocity reaches 0 2 m s when the wave is combined with a current speed of 0 2 m s the average decrease of first harmonic component is roughly 6 wave steepness of 1 60 15 6 wave steepness of 1 30 and 23 wave steepness of 1 15 this implies that the damping effect from the netting does not increase with the current velocity the current mostly affects the mooring system and contributes to the deformation of the net the current also prevents the net from slacking hence there is more acceleration fluctuation in the wave only situation compared to the combined waves and current cases see fig 5 and figs 7 8 the current makes the netting deformed it also causes the lift forces on the net at the same time the lift forces increase with the current velocity and inclination of the net reducing the net damping forces on the floating collar for higher current velocities fig 9 and fig 10 show the dependence of non dimensional acceleration terms on non dimensional wave number at front β π and aft positions β 0 along the floating cage for considered current velocities these non dimensional harmonic terms are much smaller compared to the ones shown on fig 6 and variables for wave steepness of 1 60 show more random scattering perturbation method cannot be used for these distributions because of the interference of the current and the far field effects the interactions between surface waves and the floating collar is one reason for wave breaking at smaller wave steepness of 1 60 particularly due to the interference of current the wave height turns out to be lower than that of undisturbed group in addition we observe that the wave heights are reduced by moving with a positively oriented current and that the variation of the wave height results in the significant change of harmonic vertical accelerations therefore both the wave amplitude and the deformation contribute to the reduction of vertical acceleration under combined waves and current conditions 4 drag and mooring loads 4 1 current conditions plenty of published works have investigated the effects of hydrodynamic forces such as the effect of drag on netting empirical relations for evaluation of drag coefficients have been proposed in terms of reynolds number solidity ratio of the net and inclination angle some of which are summarized in table 4 however only few studies considered netting with fine mesh in this section we investigate drag forces acting on the netting with fine mesh under the action of current the drag force is evaluated as a sum of the forces acting on the front and aft mooring lines the experimental measurements and the analytical predictions are compared in fig 11 note that the term c d c y l in the empirical relations is slightly different from balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 according to the description in white and corfield 2006 the drag coefficient for a circular cylinder and a sphere can be calculated as c d c y l 1 10 r e 2 3 at r e 5 10 ³ for general net twines of the aquaculture cage the reynolds number is in range o 10 2 10 4 the estimated reynolds number can be substituted in balash s relation to get an estimate for drag coefficient of the netting in the relation from kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 the authors used a seventh order polynomial to represent the drag coefficient of a circular cylinder single net twine reynolds number was in the range 10 3 2 r e 10 4 the seventh order polynomial is 5 c d c y l 78 46675 254 7873 log 10 r e 327 8864 log 10 r e 2 223 64577 log 10 r e 3 87 92234 log 10 r e 4 20 00769 log 10 r e 5 2 44894 log 10 r e 6 0 12479 log 10 r e 7 this relation is not appropriate for reynolds numbers below 32 since 10 3 2 32 zhan et al 2006 estimated the drag coefficient by experimental tests while not taking into consideration the velocity at the twines the corrected towing velocity at twines resulting from consideration of relative motion gives more accurate results the procedure has been illustrated in balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 where the corrected velocity is u c u 1 s n from fig 11 we see that the experimental results are below analytical predictions based on empirical relations there are two possible explanations for this discrepancy 1 the measured drag forces are erroneous due to the influence of the side moorings or 2 the empirical relations are overpredicting the drag forces the drag coefficients obtained from the relations proposed by balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 were higher than others the diameter of the net twine used in the present study is 1 mm while the corresponding reynolds numbers are 50 100 150 and 200 for considered towing velocities the drag coefficient for circular cylinder at r e 200 is around 1 26 hoerner 1965 which is smaller than the values obtained from empirical relations therefore we conclude the empirical relations for drag coefficients are responsible for the observed discrepancy 4 2 combined waves and current conditions time series of tension forces in front and aft mooring lines under combined waves and current conditions are shown in fig 12 three stages are identified 1 wave propagation stage time series 100 s 2 wave structure interaction stage 100 s time series 300 s and 3 combined waves and current cage model interaction stage 300 s time series 400 s during the first stage waves are propagating from the wave maker to the cage model since the waves have not reached the cage the force signal is nearly zero during the second stage incident waves interact with cage model while in the third stage the cage model is towed along the wave propagating direction there is a sudden jump in force at the onset of current data acquisition was stopped after 400 s the current causes an increase in the mooring tension especially when the current velocity is 0 2 m s the tension force in the front mooring line is greater than that in the aft mooring line coincident with the field observation in the field the elongation of the spring in the front mooring line was observed to be much larger than the elongation of the spring in the aft mooring line the comparison of mean tension force amplitude and total tension at front and aft mooring lines under combined waves and current conditions are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the mean tension is the mean value in the steady time window the total tension is the sum of the mean tension and the force amplitude the force amplitude is denoted as f a 2 σ f where σ f is the standard deviation of the force series in the steady time window the absolute values of the tensions are exhibited in figs 13 and 14 the tension forces of aft mooring are actually negative due to subtraction of the pre tension the overall trends of the mooring forces in front and aft mooring lines are similar from figs 13 and 14 we see that the mean and total tension increase linearly with λ d and that the mooring tension increases with wave steepness the force amplitudes do not show particular trends due to the random nature of the standard deviation the mean and total tension at the front mooring line are much larger than those at the aft mooring lines the current has a significant effect on the total mooring tension compared to the wave only and combined waves and current cases longer waves in the wave only conditions have more pronounced effect on mooring tensions than the waves in combined waves and current conditions 4 3 net configurations current induced net deformation is crucial for the dissolved oxygen and the nutrition exchange of the farmed organisms many factors influence the growth of the farmed organisms thus a better understanding of the net deformation caused by waves and current is important for guiding the design installation and maintenance of cage the deformation of the cage net exposed to still water and combined waves and current conditions at t 1 0s are shown in fig 15 we observe that the geometry of the net exposed to still water is slightly different from the geometry of the squared mesh netting the net aperture used in the present study is a diamond mesh the properties of the diamond mesh are related to the flexural rigidity as described in balash 2012 the configuration of the net shows its shrinking behavior due to the flexural rigidity furthermore this shrinking behavior will affect the mooring and hydrodynamic response of the cage the use of net aperture is a matter of practical choice for aquaculture farming there is no difference between squared mesh and diamond mesh with respect to mechanical properties if both nettings utilize polyethylene pe materials the deformation of the net is caused by the deformation of upstream and downstream net panels the front netting is predominantly deformed in the direction of the current due to the shielding effect the volume reduction ratio increases with the current velocity note that in the top position of the netting the vertical motion is much larger than in the bottom position due to the effect of bottom weights 5 discussion present physical model experiments of aquaculture structures have revealed novel hydrodynamic behaviors caused by wave structure interactions several other studies have examined the scale modeling of aquaculture cages and the cage hydrodynamic response forces deformation and the effect of the material properties kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 lader et al 2008 lader and enerhaug 2005 tsukrov et al 2011 more recently physical model approach has been employed to investigate the effect of mooring loads on the aquaculture net cage and hydrodynamic response of a floating collar kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 li et al 2016 their works have shown that the behavior of the frequency dependent variables of the floating collar can be partially explained by perturbation method in the present study we utilize the physical model approach and apply the perturbation method to vertical accelerations of a floating collar without netting furthermore we investigate the vertical accelerations of the floating collar with netting caused by coupled motion of the floating collar and the net under combined wave and current conditions in addition the drag forces induced by current and the mooring tension under wave only and combined waves and current conditions are studied as well to that end the worst conditions are assumed where the wavelength is much larger than the dimensions of the floating collar and the wave frequency is much lower than the natural period of heave these extreme conditions test the structural integrity of the aquaculture cage under waves and current which is of great practical importance for engineering applications for the floating collar model without netting under wave only conditions the harmonic acceleration amplitudes at front position are higher than those at the aft position the heave and pitch are dominant factors for the variation of the harmonic accelerations inflection point has been observed for the accelerations at the front position which is slightly different from the results reported in li et al 2016 their focus was primarily on the higher frequencies and the elastic response of the floating collar however the overall trends are similar the harmonic acceleration increases with the non dimensional wave numbers the overtopping has been observed under wave steepness of 1 30 and 1 15 where froude krylov forces have weak effects since the flow field is disturbed for the small wave steepness of 1 60 the higher order non dimensional harmonic accelerations w a 3 ω ζ a 3 and w a 4 ω ζ a 4 did not show proportional correlations the mean free surface and the configuration of the partially submerged floating collar were the main reasons for absence of the proportional correlations for the small wave steepness of 1 60 we observe an increase in the added mass of the floating collar with the rise of the free surface the added mass is correlated to the shape of the floating collar while the free surface contributed mostly to the nonlinearity of the dependences between the higher terms of harmonic acceleration and wave amplitudes in the case of the floating collar with netting under combined waves and current conditions the third and fourth harmonic terms of the acceleration are insignificant because of the damping effects of the netting as evidenced by figs 9 and 10 compared with the floating collar cases the harmonic components of the floating cage decreased roughly by 6 wave steepness of 1 60 and current velocity 0 2 m s in minimum and 26 wave steepness of 1 15 and current velocity 0 1 m s in maximum the damping effect of the net on the floating collar is due to 1 net deformation induced by the current and 2 the relative motions of the floating collar the netting and bottom weights the net deformation changes the gravitational center of the mass of the entire cage and the incline of the net impacts the horizontal force on the floating cage consequently restoring moment is required for recovery of original orientation under the combined waves and current conditions during this interaction process the net generates damping effects on the floating collar the coupling motions can produce a sudden snap load on the net when the net moves with the floating collar this snap load has been investigated numerically in lader and fredheim 2006 the snap load on the net also contributed to damping of the floating collar the lift force caused by the current acts on the net and reduces the damping effects resulting in weaker damping effects on the floating collar for higher current velocities for the wave steepness of 1 60 first harmonic term w a u 1 ω for first current condition was found to have larger error bar in comparison to the first harmonic term w a u 2 ω corresponding to the second current condition this error bar shows the relative error between the experimental mean value and standard deviation in the present study the calculated relative errors remain below approximately 1 0 relatively larger error bar for the wave steepness of 1 60 and for current of 0 1 m s is due to the wave breaking at the current boundary when the waves encounter the towing model which is in turn caused by the small wave amplitude although waves propagate along the current direction their regeneration is still slower in comparison of the breaking process therefore the observed large error bar is expected for these chaotic conditions the errors become reasonable as the current velocity approaches 0 2 m s theoretical investigations of a slender torus in short waves has been reported in newman 1977 the slender body theory and asymptotic expansion method are also valid for ν a 0 in the present study we experimentally verify these predictions for the case of longer waves vertical heave force on a floating structure has been investigated by mciver 2012 the author concluded that the vertical movement of a structure at low frequencies is affected by far field wave amplitude which should be considered when analyzing the harmonic vertical accelerations under waves small oscillations have been observed in the harmonic terms for tests under combined waves and current conditions due to seiching seiching is determined by the highest resonance period in the tank the seiching period of the wave tow basin in ocean university of zhejiang is approximately 23 73s the seiching current amplitude can affect the harmonic accelerations and cause errors in the experimental data wave diffraction occurred when the wave steepness was very large this diffraction can directly affect the wave transfer and alter the wave orientation the wave diffraction was mainly caused by the gap between flap of the wave generator and the tank walls which induced the attenuation of wave height under combined waves and current conditions current induced wave refraction occurred when the wave height changed which may also affect the results the weight of the accelerometer could also affect the experimental results the drag force under current only conditions is smaller than the empirical predictions the empirical relations for the drag coefficients tend to overestimate the drag coefficients therefore the appropriate empirical formulae should be carefully chosen the overall trends for the tension forces in front and aft mooring lines are similar the longer wave has more effect on the mooring tensions under wave only conditions than under the combined waves and current conditions on the other hand the current has significant effect on the mooring tension under combined waves and current conditions the deformation of the net is attributed to the current which reduces with the flow through the net panel løland 1991 proposed an estimate for the velocity reduction factor u w r u where u w is the local velocity in the wake of the net panel r is the velocity reduction factor u is the current velocity the velocity reduction induced by the shielding effect of the upstream netting has attracted significant attention in the recent years for instance bi et al 2013 reported that the velocity reduction factor decreased from 0 9 to 0 68 as the net number increased from 1 to 4 the effects of spacing distance between two nets were investigated both experimentally and numerically and approximately 25 flow reduction has been observed bi et al 2014 for the fine mesh netting in the present study the shielding effect of the upstream netting decreased the current velocity resulting in small deformation of the downstream netting 6 conclusions physical model tests have been conducted with the purpose of investigating the nonlinear vertical accelerations and mooring loads of a scaled aquaculture cage for the floating collar model regular waves with wave steepness of 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 were tested for the floating cage model the same regular waves combined with current 0 1 m s and 0 2 m s were examined it was assumed that the wavelength was much larger than the size of the floating collar and that the wave frequency was much lower than the natural period of heave for the floating collar model the first and second harmonic components of the vertical accelerations were found to be proportional to wave amplitudes ζ a and ζ a 2 respectively while the third and fourth harmonic components did not show similar dependences due to the free surface interference for the floating cage model the correlation between first harmonic component and the wave amplitude was approximately linear while second harmonic component exhibited chaotic behavior caused by the interaction of incident waves and the current third and fourth harmonic components were approximately zero after normalized with wave amplitude the damping effects were attributed to net deformation and relative motions between the floating collar and the netting the damping effects were also the dominant contributing factor to the observed reduction of acceleration the average reduction of first harmonic component is from 10 wave steepness of 1 60 to 26 wave steepness of 1 15 when the wave is combined with a current velocity of 0 1 m s when the combined current velocity approaches 0 2 m s the average reduction of first harmonic component is from 6 wave steepness of 1 60 to 23 wave steepness of 1 15 the low frequency strongly affects the higher order harmonics component of the acceleration and the current induced free surface motion enhances the nonlinearity the mooring tension is much more sensitive to longer waves under wave only conditions while the current has more effect on the mooring tension for combined wave and current conditions

22136,a grand aim of aquaculturists is to investigate the interactions between the oceanic environment and aquaculture structures in order to make the structures more durable to loads caused by waves and current to that end we investigate the effects of extreme wave conditions by leveraging a physical model approach we assume that the floating collar of the cage moves with the wave in heave leading to extreme conditions thus the wavelength is much larger than the size of the floating collar model and the wave frequency is much lower than the natural period of heave for the floating collar model without netting under wave only conditions the first and second harmonic components of the vertical acceleration are proportional to the wave amplitude ζ a and square of the wave amplitude ζ a 2 respectively the third and fourth harmonic components exhibit oscillations at non dimensional wave number ν a 0 055 due to the change of free surface for the floating cage model under combined waves and current conditions the first harmonic component is more likely proportional to ζ a while the second harmonic component shows erratic behavior the effects of mooring loads in front and aft mooring lines are also assessed keywords physical model approach nonlinear vertical accelerations mooring loads aquaculture cage wave structure interaction 1 introduction cage based aquaculture involves growing fish in all types of aquatic environments enclosing the fish in a net cage protects them from predators and enables monitoring of the stock health waves and current are the most relevant factors for cage design installation operation as well as maintenance a number of physical models which simplify the interaction between the fluid and aquaculture cage have been proposed for instance model of high density polyethylene hdpe circular rings has been developed for simulating the floating collar of the net pen deployed in eastport me usa fredriksson et al 2007a the obtained elasticity modulus was used in finite element structural analysis in addition incited by a fluid structure model from tsukrov et al 2003 2005 field measurements have been performed and mooring gear operational limits of a hdpe net pen have been established fredriksson et al 2007b the overall hydrodynamic behavior of the floating collar has been analyzed by dividing the floating collar into several segments li et al 2007 each segment is treated as partially submerged rigid cylinder sarpkaya 1976 estimated the drag and inertia coefficients of a submerged horizontal cylinder by the morison equation he found that the hydrodynamic coefficients depended on the keulegan carpenter kc number and reynolds re number following sarpkaya s principle kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 predicted the drag coefficient of the collar to be 1 0 they also observed a drag coefficient higher than 1 0 in case of high sea states when the collar goes in and out of water furthermore empirical expressions for hydrodynamic coefficients in terms of kc number were developed by considering the distance between upstream and downstream pipes of the floating collar xu et al 2018 the coefficients for the downstream pipe were found to decrease due to the shielding from the upstream pipe chen and christensen 2018 employed computational fluid dynamics cfd with the aim of analyzing the interactions between the fluid and the floating collars with emphasis of the free surface effects on the collars xu et al 2018 observed that the drag force of the floating collar followed with the lowering of the free surface hydrodynamic characteristics of multi cage systems were investigated via experimental tests and the mooring loads the volume reduction and damping effects have been documented thoroughly bi et al 2015 xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2015a most recently zhao et al 2019 investigated a new semi submersible offshore fish farm subjected to waves the analysis of mooring loads and dynamic response provides us new insights for development of aquaculture farms the potential flow theory and the beam theory have been extensively utilized in the analysis of the nonlinear deformation and hydrodynamic response of the floating collar suhey et al 2005 excellent agreements with the theoretical predictions of hydrodynamic forces have been achieved the translation and rotation of the floating collar was obtained from euler s law and curved beam theory as reported in dong et al 2010 following the same theory zhao et al 2015b studied the hydroelastic response of the floating collar subjected to waves based on the theory presented in kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 li et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model based on curved beam theory in order to describe the vertical motion of the floater recently shen et al 2018 utilized the approach proposed by li et al 2016 to investigate the motion of the floating collar the dynamic response of the floating collar examined by bai et al 2016 showed that the fatigue lifetime of floating pipes is more sensitive to the wave period than to the wave height even though a number of studies have been devoted to wave structure interactions of aquaculture cage most of them have focused on the floating collar due to its important share in buoyancy of the entire cage system however the hydrodynamic response of the floating collar with netting has received less attention and is still not completely understood the experimental data from physical model tests is still insufficient for validation of mathematical and numerical implementations in addition the damping between floating collar and the netting via coupling interaction is also not understood well previous works on the aquaculture cages did not study much of combined waves and current conditions which represent the real marine environment therefore in the present study we carry out a series of wave tow basin tests on physical models of a floating cage collar and a floating cage collar with netting a set of considered waves and combined waves and current conditions has been generated in our tests by adjusting the wave steepness and current velocity inspired by the previous experimental studies of li and faltinsen 2012 li et al 2016 2018 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 we simplify the aquaculture cage to a floating collar with netting and mooring system which allows us to experimentally estimate the nonlinear vertical acceleration the mooring loads of the structure and the damping effect of the netting on the floating collar in what follows we first describe and further verify the experiments for the present models in section 2 details of the modeling law and principles of wave generators are also given the non dimensional vertical harmonic acceleration of the model the coupled motion of the floating collar and the netting and other results are presented in section 3 the drag force and the mooring loads are provided in section 4 a thorough explanation and the error analysis of the results are discussed in section 5 in the concluding section section 6 strengths and limitations of the physical model approach are assessed 2 experiments before establishing a scale for the model test in waves three major factors that affect the scale selection need to be examined 1 model characteristics for instance the geometry and the material properties e g bending stiffness 2 wave tow basin dimensions and 3 wave generation dimensions of the basin determine the effect of the reflection of the model and the tank walls on the measurements in general the lower the interference the refection of the model and the tank walls the more accurate the results the wave generator supposes to be capable of producing the scaled wave heights and periods for tests which requires a comprehensive insight into the fundamentals of wave generator theory the flowchart of the physical model test in the present study is depicted in fig 1 and then each part is introduced in detail physical model tests of the aquaculture cage using regular waves and current were carried out at the wave tow basin in zhejiang ocean university zhejiang china the dimensions of the wave tow basin are 130 m length 6 m width 4 5 m height with a constant water depth of 3 5 m the physical models of the aquaculture cage are investigated by towing experiments and waves generated from a hinged flap type wave generator current effects are introduced by towing the model towards the waves 2 1 physical model the physical model we utilized has a 1 25 scale and it corresponds to a specific prototype with a standard diameter of 40 m the scale of 1 25 is typically remarked between a range of scales of the wave tanks from 1 10 to 1 100 chakrabarti 1994 components of the physical model and the wave conditions are froude scaled with geometric similarity except for the nets pe 80 is used to make the floating collar model in this study on fig 2 this hdpe material is commonly used for aquaculture cages dimensions of the inner and outer diameter of the pipe are 30 mm and 36 mm respectively the floating collar model and the bottomless cylindrical net cage were tested as depicted on fig 2 the netting is made of nylon with the solidity ratio of 0 45 resulting in a fine mesh net the physical model details of the cage and mechanical characteristics are provided in table 1 in table 1 the values in parenthesis for mass of net cage are the weights of the floating collars note that the netting in our tests differs from the previous work kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 since we utilize the net model with fine diamond mesh in our case the net solidity s n is defined as 1 s n d w l w e h e v d w 2 l w 2 1 e h 2 1 e v 2 where d w is the twine diameter of the net l w represents the bar length of the net twine e h and e v are the hanging ratios in horizontal and vertical directions respectively e h w i d t h o f n e t 2 n h l w e v h e i g h t o f n e t 2 n v l w n h and n v are the mesh numbers in width and height 2 2 experimental setup we make variables non dimensional to satisfy the similarity principle such as the froude similarity all major components of the aquaculture cage have been tested initially tests of the single circular hdpe ring have been conducted under wave conditions and then the circular hdpe ring with bottomless netting has been tested under combined waves and current conditions there are four almost horizontal moorings attached to the circular hdpe ring to position the model as depicted in fig 3 these four moorings are connected with self designed springs pre tension of 10 n is used to avoid the slack of the mooring lines in response to steeper waves vertical mooring enables the anchors to attach to the bottom of the ocean or the wave tank however this method requires a basin with a false bottom hence we use the horizontal mooring approach in the tests two ideal conditions are assumed 1 the natural frequency does not change with the scaling of the model and 2 the modes of the motion are the same under both vertical and horizontal mooring situations the configuration of the experimental setup is exhibited in fig 3 the origin of cartesian coordinate system is placed at the free surface where z 0 the nearly horizontal mooring is connected to one end of a self designed spring while the other end of the spring is fastened to a force gauge diameter 20 mm height 15 mm accelerometers 18 mm 18 mm 10 mm in dimension 6 g in weight are mounted on the circular floating pipe and are positioned at angles ranging from β 0 to β π with an increment of π 4 they represent the aft aft left left front left and front positions as shown in fig 3 the precision of the accelerometer is 0 005 m s2 six wave probes partially submerged under water are installed to get the mean amplitude of the wave height two cameras are used to record the general behavior of the floating collar model above the water and the netting under the water both cameras run with a frame rate of 60 fps and a resolution of 1280 720 pixels 2 3 test conditions regular wave tests are conducted using the physical model approach with wave frequencies spanning the expected forcing band for the floating collar model regular waves in period range t 1 0 1 6 s with an increment of 0 05s are considered for the case of floating collar model with netting the combined waves and current conditions are applied with the current velocity ranging from 0 1 m s to 0 2 m s and the combined regular wave period in range t 1 0 1 6 s with an increment of 0 1s incident waves with prescribed wave steepness h λ 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 propagating along the x axis direction are applied in all cases these test conditions are summarized in table 2 where h is the wave height and λ is the wavelength before testing the physical model wave calibration is performed to get the ideal wave conditions without the interference of signal noise veritas 2000 the performance of wave generator is crucial for accurate tests the characteristics of generated waves are approximated using linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 the velocity potential φ surface elevation η and dispersion relation are respectively defined as 2 φ g ζ a ω cosh ν h z cosh ν d sin ν x ω t 3 η ζ a cos ν x ω t 4 ω 2 g ν tanh ν h where ζ a is the wave amplitude equal to ½ of the wave height g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the circular frequency ν is the wavenumber equal to 2 π λ λ is the wavelength h is the water depth z is the vertical position in the water column and x is the horizontal position wave generators in wave tow basins are classified into two categories active and passive the active wave generator such as the hinged flap type creates waves by controlling the movement of the flap for the ideal wave conditions of model tests it is not suggested to place the model into the basin since the model can cause interference in calibration of the wave data the effect of current is produced by towing the model towards the wave propagating direction errors within 0 3 compared to the prescribed values are achieved under current only situations after towing measured wave data was filtered and compared to the corresponding prescribed wave for wave calibration the comparisons between prescribed and measured wave heights without the presence of the models are exhibited in table 3 h p and h m are defined as prescribed and measured wave heights in meters 2 4 data processing there are two kinds of data collection routines the standard routines and the test specific routines dean and dalrymple 1991 many of these programs are available in testing facilities however custom developed programs are advantageous for specific model test data for instance calibration errors induced by mismatch between measured and the prescribed values could be observed during tests a test specific code can easily identify this kind of error therefore a complication of these two routines are emerged in our data processing filtering allows isolation of waves and forces accelerations within certain frequency domain we perform digital filtering of the recorded data in order to 1 eliminate noise 2 isolate low and high frequency data 3 prepare data for spectral analysis and 4 remove the transition data for a prescribed sinusoidal wave the actual wave formed in the tank may not have a sinusoidal shape due to the gravity tank bottom and the wave generator effects fourier series analysis is implemented to process the measured wave data in addition the interval between two testing cases should also be sufficiently long to prevent the interference between tests we use an interval of 8 10 min based on wave tow basin dimensions of 130 m length 6 m width 4 5 m height each test is repeated 2 3 times to ensure reproducibility procedures of data processing are as follows 1 obtain the raw data from accelerometers 2 perform digital filtering to obtain harmonic components of the vertical acceleration e g w a ω w a 2 ω w a 3 ω and w a 4 ω 3 normalize the obtained harmonic components of the vertical acceleration by w a c g ζ a and w a n ω ζ a n respectively n 2 3 4 and w a is the harmonic component of the vertical acceleration after filtering nearly steady state data is measured after 20 wave periods and the steady state time window is filtered with band pass filter to remove noise out of the prescribed frequency range the lower and upper limits in frequency are set to 0 95 t and 1 05 t 1 95 t and 2 05 t 2 95 t and 3 05 t 3 95 t and 4 05 t so that the first second third and fourth order harmonics of vertical accelerations can be evaluated after filtering three examples of first harmonic components of vertical accelerations after filtering are depicted in fig 4 the range of the time series for filtering is from 0 35 low limit to 0 50 high limit as shown in fig 4 with red horizontal lines the curves of the time series appear smooth after removal of the noise the experimental vertical accelerations decrease with the increase of the wave steepness the results of nonlinear vertical acceleration and mooring loads in different cases and net configurations are reported in the following sections 3 results for nonlinear vertical acceleration 3 1 model of floating collar the nonlinear vertical acceleration of scaled floating collar model is experimentally investigated under regular waves fig 5 demonstrates the dependence of non dimensional steady state harmonic acceleration amplitudes including w a ω w a 2 ω w a 3 ω and w a 4 ω on non dimensional wave number ν a which contains all three wave steepness 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 at front β π and aft β 0 positions along the floating collar to compare magnitudes of different harmonic terms we normalize the harmonic terms with the frequency ω and amplitude ζ a of the incident regular waves as can be seen in fig 5 the overall trend is that the non dimensional harmonic acceleration amplitudes increase with non dimensional wave numbers the non dimensional terms at the front position of the floating collar are slightly larger than those at the aft position this quantitative analysis coincides with the wave tank observations since the front and aft positions along the floating collar are exposed to the wave propagating direction harmonic accelerations at these positions are predominantly caused by heave and pitch the motion at aft position is relatively still compared to front position because the heave has more pronounced effect on the aft position there is an inflection point that appears at non dimensional wave number ν a 0 055 in the front position of the floating collar for third and fourth harmonic components the harmonic terms increase nearly linear followed by a drop at the aft position the higher order harmonic terms vary significantly for the wave steepness of 1 15 this strong nonlinearity is induced by the change of free surface which is presented in the steeper waves as overtopping occurs during the overtopping process the flow separates from the boundary layer region and the flow field in the aft position is disturbed the froude krylov force contributes less to non linearity of the harmonic terms in the disturbed flow field we see linear dependence between the non dimensional harmonic acceleration amplitudes and the wave steepness this is because high wave steepness causes large structure motion and vice versa however most of the first harmonic components for the wave steepness of 1 15 are smaller than those for the wave steepness of 1 60 after comparison we found that the ratio between mean values of first harmonic accelerations and wave amplitude w a ω ζ a for wave steepness of 1 60 is larger than the one for wave steepness of 1 15 this causes term w a ω c g ζ a for wave steepness of 1 60 to be larger than the one for wave steepness of 1 15 therefore it is wave amplitude ζ a rather than the non dimensional harmonic acceleration amplitude that plays the dominant role for the first harmonic term for the wave steepness of 1 15 when the non dimensional wave number is less than 0 05 the fourth harmonic component in the aft position is much higher than for any other wave steepness it is important to note the low frequency effect leading to this nonlinearity a perturbation method employed in our study indicates that w a ω w a 2 ω w a 3 ω and w a 4 ω are most likely proportional to ζ a ζ a 2 ζ a 3 and ζ a 4 respectively fig 6 provides information on the trends in dependence of non dimensional acceleration terms on the non dimensional wave number at front β π and aft β 0 positions along the floating collar clearly no significant inflection point appears in these dependences from figs 5 and 6 it is evident that the overall trends for first and second harmonic terms show correlations with the wave amplitudes for different wave steepness e g 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 third and fourth harmonic terms normalized with ζ a 3 and ζ a 4 have magnitudes of o 10 4 and o 10 6 respectively however observed correlations are not completely proportional as it can be seen on fig 6 we note that the small wave steepness of 1 60 does not seem to correlate well with the wave amplitude for higher order harmonic components the overtopping and nonlinear froude krylov force cannot fully explain the absence of correlation for small wave steepness 1 60 meaning that the nonlinear froude krylov forces could be responsible for the absence the correlation however we do not observe separation of the flow for small wave steepness of 1 60 viscous effects corresponding to the boundary layer flow are assumed negligible in the present study the kc number is relatively small faltinsen 1993 reported that the flow separation does not occur when keulegan carpenter kc number is less than 2 3 therefore the flow separation does not seem to be the cause of the uncorrelated non dimensional acceleration amplitude and wave number for low wave steepness of 1 60 3 2 model of floating cage in this section we focus on the vertical acceleration of a scaled floating cage model under combined regular waves and current differs from the floating collar model the floating cage model retains principal components of the aquaculture cage such as the floating collar the mooring system the netting and the bottom weights see figs 2 and 3 we intend to investigate the damping effects from the netting on the vertical acceleration of the entire floating cage model and the coupled motion the bottom portion of the net is not taking into account when evaluating the damping effects fig 7 8 show the non dimensional steady state harmonic acceleration amplitudes of the floating cage for all combined waves and current tests at front β π and aft β 0 positions along the floating collar note that the subscripts u 1 and u 2 u 1 0 1 m s and u 2 0 2 m s are the current velocities used in the present study w a u 1 2 ω represents the non dimensional harmonic acceleration under combined waves and current conditions similar trends can be observed in figs 7 8 for the floating cage compared to the floating collar without netting the harmonic acceleration increases with the non dimensional wave number and it is larger at the front position than at the aft position for the second harmonic component in steeper waves with current velocity of 0 1 m s there is a sudden drop when the non dimensional wave number exceeds 0 04 this implies that the low frequency strongly affects the higher order harmonics component of the acceleration and that the current induced free surface motion enhances the nonlinearity the same trends are observed in fig 8 where the current velocity approaches 0 2 m s slight differences in the case of wave steepness of 1 60 indicate that the increase of the frequency can result in higher values for second harmonic components compared with the floating collar model the harmonic acceleration for the floating cage model is reduced the tethered netting moves up and down with the floating collar according to the wave tank tests and the damping effect from the netting hinders the vertical motion of the floating cage when the wave is combined with a current speed of 0 1 m s the average decrease of first harmonic component is roughly 10 wave steepness of 1 60 19 wave steepness of 1 30 and 26 wave steepness of 1 15 the harmonic acceleration also decreases when the current velocity reaches 0 2 m s when the wave is combined with a current speed of 0 2 m s the average decrease of first harmonic component is roughly 6 wave steepness of 1 60 15 6 wave steepness of 1 30 and 23 wave steepness of 1 15 this implies that the damping effect from the netting does not increase with the current velocity the current mostly affects the mooring system and contributes to the deformation of the net the current also prevents the net from slacking hence there is more acceleration fluctuation in the wave only situation compared to the combined waves and current cases see fig 5 and figs 7 8 the current makes the netting deformed it also causes the lift forces on the net at the same time the lift forces increase with the current velocity and inclination of the net reducing the net damping forces on the floating collar for higher current velocities fig 9 and fig 10 show the dependence of non dimensional acceleration terms on non dimensional wave number at front β π and aft positions β 0 along the floating cage for considered current velocities these non dimensional harmonic terms are much smaller compared to the ones shown on fig 6 and variables for wave steepness of 1 60 show more random scattering perturbation method cannot be used for these distributions because of the interference of the current and the far field effects the interactions between surface waves and the floating collar is one reason for wave breaking at smaller wave steepness of 1 60 particularly due to the interference of current the wave height turns out to be lower than that of undisturbed group in addition we observe that the wave heights are reduced by moving with a positively oriented current and that the variation of the wave height results in the significant change of harmonic vertical accelerations therefore both the wave amplitude and the deformation contribute to the reduction of vertical acceleration under combined waves and current conditions 4 drag and mooring loads 4 1 current conditions plenty of published works have investigated the effects of hydrodynamic forces such as the effect of drag on netting empirical relations for evaluation of drag coefficients have been proposed in terms of reynolds number solidity ratio of the net and inclination angle some of which are summarized in table 4 however only few studies considered netting with fine mesh in this section we investigate drag forces acting on the netting with fine mesh under the action of current the drag force is evaluated as a sum of the forces acting on the front and aft mooring lines the experimental measurements and the analytical predictions are compared in fig 11 note that the term c d c y l in the empirical relations is slightly different from balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 according to the description in white and corfield 2006 the drag coefficient for a circular cylinder and a sphere can be calculated as c d c y l 1 10 r e 2 3 at r e 5 10 ³ for general net twines of the aquaculture cage the reynolds number is in range o 10 2 10 4 the estimated reynolds number can be substituted in balash s relation to get an estimate for drag coefficient of the netting in the relation from kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 the authors used a seventh order polynomial to represent the drag coefficient of a circular cylinder single net twine reynolds number was in the range 10 3 2 r e 10 4 the seventh order polynomial is 5 c d c y l 78 46675 254 7873 log 10 r e 327 8864 log 10 r e 2 223 64577 log 10 r e 3 87 92234 log 10 r e 4 20 00769 log 10 r e 5 2 44894 log 10 r e 6 0 12479 log 10 r e 7 this relation is not appropriate for reynolds numbers below 32 since 10 3 2 32 zhan et al 2006 estimated the drag coefficient by experimental tests while not taking into consideration the velocity at the twines the corrected towing velocity at twines resulting from consideration of relative motion gives more accurate results the procedure has been illustrated in balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 where the corrected velocity is u c u 1 s n from fig 11 we see that the experimental results are below analytical predictions based on empirical relations there are two possible explanations for this discrepancy 1 the measured drag forces are erroneous due to the influence of the side moorings or 2 the empirical relations are overpredicting the drag forces the drag coefficients obtained from the relations proposed by balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 were higher than others the diameter of the net twine used in the present study is 1 mm while the corresponding reynolds numbers are 50 100 150 and 200 for considered towing velocities the drag coefficient for circular cylinder at r e 200 is around 1 26 hoerner 1965 which is smaller than the values obtained from empirical relations therefore we conclude the empirical relations for drag coefficients are responsible for the observed discrepancy 4 2 combined waves and current conditions time series of tension forces in front and aft mooring lines under combined waves and current conditions are shown in fig 12 three stages are identified 1 wave propagation stage time series 100 s 2 wave structure interaction stage 100 s time series 300 s and 3 combined waves and current cage model interaction stage 300 s time series 400 s during the first stage waves are propagating from the wave maker to the cage model since the waves have not reached the cage the force signal is nearly zero during the second stage incident waves interact with cage model while in the third stage the cage model is towed along the wave propagating direction there is a sudden jump in force at the onset of current data acquisition was stopped after 400 s the current causes an increase in the mooring tension especially when the current velocity is 0 2 m s the tension force in the front mooring line is greater than that in the aft mooring line coincident with the field observation in the field the elongation of the spring in the front mooring line was observed to be much larger than the elongation of the spring in the aft mooring line the comparison of mean tension force amplitude and total tension at front and aft mooring lines under combined waves and current conditions are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the mean tension is the mean value in the steady time window the total tension is the sum of the mean tension and the force amplitude the force amplitude is denoted as f a 2 σ f where σ f is the standard deviation of the force series in the steady time window the absolute values of the tensions are exhibited in figs 13 and 14 the tension forces of aft mooring are actually negative due to subtraction of the pre tension the overall trends of the mooring forces in front and aft mooring lines are similar from figs 13 and 14 we see that the mean and total tension increase linearly with λ d and that the mooring tension increases with wave steepness the force amplitudes do not show particular trends due to the random nature of the standard deviation the mean and total tension at the front mooring line are much larger than those at the aft mooring lines the current has a significant effect on the total mooring tension compared to the wave only and combined waves and current cases longer waves in the wave only conditions have more pronounced effect on mooring tensions than the waves in combined waves and current conditions 4 3 net configurations current induced net deformation is crucial for the dissolved oxygen and the nutrition exchange of the farmed organisms many factors influence the growth of the farmed organisms thus a better understanding of the net deformation caused by waves and current is important for guiding the design installation and maintenance of cage the deformation of the cage net exposed to still water and combined waves and current conditions at t 1 0s are shown in fig 15 we observe that the geometry of the net exposed to still water is slightly different from the geometry of the squared mesh netting the net aperture used in the present study is a diamond mesh the properties of the diamond mesh are related to the flexural rigidity as described in balash 2012 the configuration of the net shows its shrinking behavior due to the flexural rigidity furthermore this shrinking behavior will affect the mooring and hydrodynamic response of the cage the use of net aperture is a matter of practical choice for aquaculture farming there is no difference between squared mesh and diamond mesh with respect to mechanical properties if both nettings utilize polyethylene pe materials the deformation of the net is caused by the deformation of upstream and downstream net panels the front netting is predominantly deformed in the direction of the current due to the shielding effect the volume reduction ratio increases with the current velocity note that in the top position of the netting the vertical motion is much larger than in the bottom position due to the effect of bottom weights 5 discussion present physical model experiments of aquaculture structures have revealed novel hydrodynamic behaviors caused by wave structure interactions several other studies have examined the scale modeling of aquaculture cages and the cage hydrodynamic response forces deformation and the effect of the material properties kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 lader et al 2008 lader and enerhaug 2005 tsukrov et al 2011 more recently physical model approach has been employed to investigate the effect of mooring loads on the aquaculture net cage and hydrodynamic response of a floating collar kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 li et al 2016 their works have shown that the behavior of the frequency dependent variables of the floating collar can be partially explained by perturbation method in the present study we utilize the physical model approach and apply the perturbation method to vertical accelerations of a floating collar without netting furthermore we investigate the vertical accelerations of the floating collar with netting caused by coupled motion of the floating collar and the net under combined wave and current conditions in addition the drag forces induced by current and the mooring tension under wave only and combined waves and current conditions are studied as well to that end the worst conditions are assumed where the wavelength is much larger than the dimensions of the floating collar and the wave frequency is much lower than the natural period of heave these extreme conditions test the structural integrity of the aquaculture cage under waves and current which is of great practical importance for engineering applications for the floating collar model without netting under wave only conditions the harmonic acceleration amplitudes at front position are higher than those at the aft position the heave and pitch are dominant factors for the variation of the harmonic accelerations inflection point has been observed for the accelerations at the front position which is slightly different from the results reported in li et al 2016 their focus was primarily on the higher frequencies and the elastic response of the floating collar however the overall trends are similar the harmonic acceleration increases with the non dimensional wave numbers the overtopping has been observed under wave steepness of 1 30 and 1 15 where froude krylov forces have weak effects since the flow field is disturbed for the small wave steepness of 1 60 the higher order non dimensional harmonic accelerations w a 3 ω ζ a 3 and w a 4 ω ζ a 4 did not show proportional correlations the mean free surface and the configuration of the partially submerged floating collar were the main reasons for absence of the proportional correlations for the small wave steepness of 1 60 we observe an increase in the added mass of the floating collar with the rise of the free surface the added mass is correlated to the shape of the floating collar while the free surface contributed mostly to the nonlinearity of the dependences between the higher terms of harmonic acceleration and wave amplitudes in the case of the floating collar with netting under combined waves and current conditions the third and fourth harmonic terms of the acceleration are insignificant because of the damping effects of the netting as evidenced by figs 9 and 10 compared with the floating collar cases the harmonic components of the floating cage decreased roughly by 6 wave steepness of 1 60 and current velocity 0 2 m s in minimum and 26 wave steepness of 1 15 and current velocity 0 1 m s in maximum the damping effect of the net on the floating collar is due to 1 net deformation induced by the current and 2 the relative motions of the floating collar the netting and bottom weights the net deformation changes the gravitational center of the mass of the entire cage and the incline of the net impacts the horizontal force on the floating cage consequently restoring moment is required for recovery of original orientation under the combined waves and current conditions during this interaction process the net generates damping effects on the floating collar the coupling motions can produce a sudden snap load on the net when the net moves with the floating collar this snap load has been investigated numerically in lader and fredheim 2006 the snap load on the net also contributed to damping of the floating collar the lift force caused by the current acts on the net and reduces the damping effects resulting in weaker damping effects on the floating collar for higher current velocities for the wave steepness of 1 60 first harmonic term w a u 1 ω for first current condition was found to have larger error bar in comparison to the first harmonic term w a u 2 ω corresponding to the second current condition this error bar shows the relative error between the experimental mean value and standard deviation in the present study the calculated relative errors remain below approximately 1 0 relatively larger error bar for the wave steepness of 1 60 and for current of 0 1 m s is due to the wave breaking at the current boundary when the waves encounter the towing model which is in turn caused by the small wave amplitude although waves propagate along the current direction their regeneration is still slower in comparison of the breaking process therefore the observed large error bar is expected for these chaotic conditions the errors become reasonable as the current velocity approaches 0 2 m s theoretical investigations of a slender torus in short waves has been reported in newman 1977 the slender body theory and asymptotic expansion method are also valid for ν a 0 in the present study we experimentally verify these predictions for the case of longer waves vertical heave force on a floating structure has been investigated by mciver 2012 the author concluded that the vertical movement of a structure at low frequencies is affected by far field wave amplitude which should be considered when analyzing the harmonic vertical accelerations under waves small oscillations have been observed in the harmonic terms for tests under combined waves and current conditions due to seiching seiching is determined by the highest resonance period in the tank the seiching period of the wave tow basin in ocean university of zhejiang is approximately 23 73s the seiching current amplitude can affect the harmonic accelerations and cause errors in the experimental data wave diffraction occurred when the wave steepness was very large this diffraction can directly affect the wave transfer and alter the wave orientation the wave diffraction was mainly caused by the gap between flap of the wave generator and the tank walls which induced the attenuation of wave height under combined waves and current conditions current induced wave refraction occurred when the wave height changed which may also affect the results the weight of the accelerometer could also affect the experimental results the drag force under current only conditions is smaller than the empirical predictions the empirical relations for the drag coefficients tend to overestimate the drag coefficients therefore the appropriate empirical formulae should be carefully chosen the overall trends for the tension forces in front and aft mooring lines are similar the longer wave has more effect on the mooring tensions under wave only conditions than under the combined waves and current conditions on the other hand the current has significant effect on the mooring tension under combined waves and current conditions the deformation of the net is attributed to the current which reduces with the flow through the net panel løland 1991 proposed an estimate for the velocity reduction factor u w r u where u w is the local velocity in the wake of the net panel r is the velocity reduction factor u is the current velocity the velocity reduction induced by the shielding effect of the upstream netting has attracted significant attention in the recent years for instance bi et al 2013 reported that the velocity reduction factor decreased from 0 9 to 0 68 as the net number increased from 1 to 4 the effects of spacing distance between two nets were investigated both experimentally and numerically and approximately 25 flow reduction has been observed bi et al 2014 for the fine mesh netting in the present study the shielding effect of the upstream netting decreased the current velocity resulting in small deformation of the downstream netting 6 conclusions physical model tests have been conducted with the purpose of investigating the nonlinear vertical accelerations and mooring loads of a scaled aquaculture cage for the floating collar model regular waves with wave steepness of 1 60 1 30 and 1 15 were tested for the floating cage model the same regular waves combined with current 0 1 m s and 0 2 m s were examined it was assumed that the wavelength was much larger than the size of the floating collar and that the wave frequency was much lower than the natural period of heave for the floating collar model the first and second harmonic components of the vertical accelerations were found to be proportional to wave amplitudes ζ a and ζ a 2 respectively while the third and fourth harmonic components did not show similar dependences due to the free surface interference for the floating cage model the correlation between first harmonic component and the wave amplitude was approximately linear while second harmonic component exhibited chaotic behavior caused by the interaction of incident waves and the current third and fourth harmonic components were approximately zero after normalized with wave amplitude the damping effects were attributed to net deformation and relative motions between the floating collar and the netting the damping effects were also the dominant contributing factor to the observed reduction of acceleration the average reduction of first harmonic component is from 10 wave steepness of 1 60 to 26 wave steepness of 1 15 when the wave is combined with a current velocity of 0 1 m s when the combined current velocity approaches 0 2 m s the average reduction of first harmonic component is from 6 wave steepness of 1 60 to 23 wave steepness of 1 15 the low frequency strongly affects the higher order harmonics component of the acceleration and the current induced free surface motion enhances the nonlinearity the mooring tension is much more sensitive to longer waves under wave only conditions while the current has more effect on the mooring tension for combined wave and current conditions

22137,a new type of caisson composed of two skirted side semicircles and a skirted middle rectangle was used as a breakwater foundation in xuyu port china in this study large scale laboratory model tests were carried out on jacking installations and lateral loading of this new skirted foundation in sand test results showed that the soil pressure acting on the caisson s inner skirt was larger than the outer soil pressure during jacking installation whilst the tip resistance was greater than skirt friction penetration resistance was well predicted with the jacked pile theory and cone resistance overturning failure of the foundation occurred under the lateral loading ultimate lateral loads displayed a descending trend with increasing loading position height whereas the corresponding moments exhibited an increasing trend parameters were suggested to calibrate the expression of circular foundation for purpose of estimating the combined capacity of the new skirted foundation passive soil pressure zones occurred on the outer surface of the new skirted foundation in the loading direction in contrast active soil pressure zones were found in the area with opposite loading direction the net incremental soil pressure was positive in the loading direction suggesting that the rotation center was beneath the model base keywords new skirted foundation installation lateral loading soil structure interaction sand 1 introduction a new breakwater foundation type guan et al 2018 was designed and applied to a vertical breakwater project in xuyu port china chen and li 2016 nie et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the breakwater foundation has a shallow caisson type structure composed of two skirted side semicircles and a skirted middle rectangle two buckets located on the foundation are used as a wave wall adjacent structures are connected together to reduce wave action intensity and prevent sedimentation compared with conventional mound or caisson breakwaters yan et al 2018 he et al 2018 the new skirted breakwater consumes fewer materials and provides a more convenient and economical route for the construction of breakwater compared with traditional circular foundations lian et al 2014 wang et al 2017b such new designing strategy can effectively increase the load bearing area and prevent structural torsion through a side by side arrangement after construction the whole structure is transported to a predetermined location by a floating dock guan et al 2018 and installed using jacking or suction forces therefore one challenge for the new type of skirted foundation is to penetrate deep enough to retain the required bearing capacity and stability especially in sand where penetration resistance is quite large and installation can be more problematic koteras and ibsen 2019 due to a lack of field and laboratory observations however some insights can be taken from traditional circular caissons as suction technology is usually employed in addition to the caisson s own weight most previous studies have emphasized suction penetration resistance houlsby and byrne 2005 tran et al 2008 ibsen and thilsted 2011 zhu et al 2011 kim et al 2015 jia et al 2018 however jacking penetration resistance should still be studied to provide guidance in real case applications for comparative purpose and to improve accuracy of calculation some recent studies on jacking installation mechanisms for circular foundations in sand have been carried out based on laboratory model tests and field trials lian et al 2014 and chen et al 2016 conducted a series of laboratory tests to investigate the interactions between the caisson and silty sand in both jacking and suction installation processes lee et al 2015 conducted model testing on bucket foundations embedded in sand by different installation methods to investigate cone tip resistance it was found that the inside cone tip resistance of a bucket installed by suction force was approximately 40 less than that installed by jacking force koteras and ibsen 2019 compared jacking and suction installation mechanics using medium scale tests zhu et al 2019 performed model testing of circular bucket foundations that were embedded in sand using the jacking installation method the penetration and tip resistance and inner and outer soil pressure were investigated despite the fact that offshore foundations are subjected to vertical loading from the self weight of the caisson the vertical applied load is way below the vertical capacity in contrast lateral loads such as the horizontal load and moment generated by waves play a predominant role in breakwater foundation design li et al 2014 for practical applications in xuyu port the static and cyclic lateral bearing performance of the new skirted breakwater in soft clay was investigated using small scale tests gao et al 2013a and centrifuge modeling chen and li 2016 nie et al 2016 additionally in situ stress and pore water pressure monitoring was performed to ensure normal breakwater operation guan et al 2018 these tests were all conducted on soft clay rather than sand compared with the few studies on the new skirted foundation there has been abundant research on the lateral performance of traditional circular foundations in sand with popular model testing methods watson and randolph 1998 byrne and houlsby 1999 watson et al 2000 cassidy et al 2004 zhu et al 2011 gao et al 2013b ibsen et al 2013a b li et al 2015 wang et al 2017a due to the fact that conducting numerical analysis in cohesionless soil is more difficult than the analysis of caisson foundations in clay bransby and randolph 1998 gourvenec 2007 in the most recent studies zhu et al 2011 conducted a series of large scale model tests on suction caissons suction installation resistance was investigated and predicted with cone resistance the instantaneous rotation center of the circular caisson at failure was found at a depth of about four fifths of the skirt length gao et al 2013b conducted a series of model tests to explore the anti uplift behavior of circular suction caissons in sand studying the effects of aspect ratios load inclination angles and loading positions the pull out bearing capacity decreased with load inclination angles increasing the optimum loading position located between 2 3 and 3 4 of the caisson length ibsen et al 2013a b proposed adaptive plasticity models and calibrated failure criteria for a circular bucket foundation in sand under general loading the combined capacity of circular bucket foundations from loads was found to be independent of the embedment ratio however the experimental results were based on small scale tests wang et al 2017a performed centrifuge modeling of circular bucket foundation lateral bearing behavior in offshore wind turbines with the configurations of three aspect ratios overturning occurred under lateral loading and lateral bearing capacity was determined with two criterions regarding displacement a simplified calculation method that was checked with test results was used as the third method despite the above reviews literature on the installation mechanics and lateral loading behavior of the new type of breakwater foundation is still limited primarily due to the lack of field and laboratory observations furthermore it is necessary to supplement the database regarding foundation performance when installed in granular soils the main objectives of this study were to investigate the 1 soil skirt interaction during jacking installation 2 jacking penetration resistance distribution and calculation method 3 failure mode and bearing capacity under lateral loading and 4 soil structure response under lateral loading in addition parameters were suggested to calibrate the estimating equation for the combined capacity of the new skirted foundation type the results from this study will contribute to the promotion of the new skirted foundation 2 model testing 2 1 equipment and materials model testing for the new type of skirted foundation was carried out in a large soil tank as illustrated in fig 2 the inside of the soil tank were in a rectangular geometry with the dimension of the 6 3 8 3 m length width depth which eliminated boundary influences a steel reaction beam was attached to the side walls of the platform a hydraulic cylinder was fixed on the beam to provide the reaction forces used in jacking installation tests a second hydraulic cylinder which was used after installation by the first hydraulic cylinder was fixed on the beam attached to the side wall to provide the reaction forces during lateral loading two wired displacement transducers were placed beside hydraulic cylinders to record the vertical and lateral displacements respectively two load cells were fixed on the hydraulic cylinders to monitor the penetrating force and the lateral load two inclinometers were placed with the angle of 90 to monitor tilting angles during installation and lateral loading a water level control system was also designed to control the rise and drawdown of water in the tank the new skirted foundation was made of steel its dimensions are shown in table 1 the semicircle diameter d was 100 cm and the skirt and middle rectangle lengths d and s were 50 cm the skirt and top lid thicknesses were 0 8 and 1 6 cm respectively there were ten soil pressure sensors with a diameter of 2 cm embedded in the skirt wall of the caisson with the set up of five facing inward and five facing outward as shown in fig 3 the inside sensors were subscripted as i i was numbered from 1 to 5 and the outside sensors of the same height were subscripted as i 5 distances from the top lid or skirt tip to the soil pressure sensors were 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 35 cm and 45 cm in addition two soil pressure sensors were embedded in the top lid the soil pressure sensors in the skirt and top lid were designed to monitor the interactions between sand and the skirt or top lid there were six valves on the top lid of the caisson which were used for in and out gas during the penetration stage the experiments used natural marine sand collected from coastal areas of tianjin china the physical properties of the sand such as natural and dry density moisture content the permeability value internal friction angle cohesion and compression modulus were obtained as per standards the results of which are listed in table 2 the friction angle was measured in slow direct shear tests at stress levels of 50 kpa 100 kpa 150 kpa and 200 kpa according to the particle size distribution curve shown in fig 4 91 14 of the sand was medium sand with grain sizes ranging from 0 15 to 0 6 mm cone penetration tests cpts were used to obtain cone resistance the cone penetration results are shown in fig 5 the results demonstrated that cone tip resistance increased with the increasing depth of cone penetration the sand layer was saturated by water and left for static settlement the final sand bed was 2 4 m in depth overlaid by 0 05 m depth of water to keep it saturated during testing 2 2 testing procedure six tests were carried out in this study t 1 to t 6 which were classified into two basic steps the first step was about jacking installation and the second one was in regards to lateral loading the jacking installation was designed to obtain the penetration resistance demonstrate soil skirt interactions contribute information about skirted foundation installations in medium sand and prepare for the subsequent step of lateral loading in the second step the lateral load was applied to acquire repeatable results of the ultimate lateral capacity and the pressure of both inner and outer soil the sequence of overall testing procedures is summarized in table 3 2 2 1 installation for the test it is important to keep each testing condition unchanged especially the relative sand densities bang et al 2011 hence prior to each test the sand in the tank was loosened to a depth of about 1 5 times of the skirt length the test was abolished when the tilting angle in the installation exceeded 1 5 therefore adjustments were made before installation to guarantee a small tilting angle but no adjustment was made in the installation process the new skirted foundation was first sunk into the soil under its own weight and then penetrated more deeply under a step loading method after the stabilization of gravity induced displacement t 1 t 2 and t 3 corresponded to a 2 kn load incremental step t 4 and t 5 corresponded to a 1 5 kn step and t 6 corresponded to a 1 kn step the jacking process was executed by the first hydraulic cylinder and was ceased when the soil pressure reading of the top lid appeared 2 2 2 lateral loading the operation of lateral loading was divided into three groups as per the variation of the height of the displacement point above the top lid l monotonic lateral loads were applied by the second hydraulic cylinder after the installation of the new skirted foundation the time interval between installation and lateral loading processes exceeded 2 h to eliminate the effect of installation on monotonic lateral performance t 1 and t 2 corresponded to l 0 4 m t 3 and t 4 corresponded to l 0 6 m and t 5 and t 6 corresponded to l 0 8 m each test pair with the same value of l was uploaded in opposite directions hence the soil pressure values for faces fi 1 and fo 2 were obtained when uploaded in the loading direction whereas pressure values for faces fi 2 and fo 1 were acquired in the opposite direction as shown in figs 2 and 3 once the new skirted foundation began to tilt the lateral loading process was initiated 3 test results and discussion 3 1 jacking installation performance 3 1 1 displacement the displacement measuring point was near the loading point the tilting angles were small and the maximum value in the six tests did not exceed 1 2 in the penetration process fig 6 shows measured displacement values for t 1 to t 6 respectively the displacement curve underwent three stages during jacking installation gravity stage intermediate stage and jacking stage it can be inferred that during the gravity stage the new type of skirted caisson sunk down rapidly under its own weight the final measured displacements ranged from 10 3 cm to 13 3 cm in t 1 to t 6 as shown in fig 7 in the intermediate stage the measured displacements did not vary this showed that the structure was stable under its own weight during the jacking stage a vertical load was imposed in a step loading method a linear increase in settlement was firstly observed then the settlement displayed nonlinear behavior until the soil pressure sensors inside the top lid began to display readings which meant that the sand was in contact with the inside top lid final displacement values ranged from 45 5 cm to 48 7 cm which did not exceed the skirt length that was designated as 50 cm this means that the occurrence of soil plugs during jacking installation the effects of load incremental step were not evidently observed during testing displacement responses were similar to that of the jacking installation process of traditional circular foundations lian et al 2014 3 1 2 soil skirt interactions fig 8 depicts the inner and outer soil pressure values versus displacement during jacking installation in t 3 inner soil pressure generally increased with displacement the soil pressure sensors at greater depths showed higher values the soil pressure sensor near the tip 5 recorded pressures up to 57 kpa after jacking installation outer soil pressure was lower at the same penetrating depth and did not exceed 10 kpa this is due to the fact that the skirt wall imposed a stronger lateral constraint on the internal sand as a result of this very high soil pressure formed inside the skirt which was similar to the situation of jacked pipe piles and traditional circular caisson installations as the negative excess pore pressure due to dilation was likely to be small in medium sand and sand has a strong permeability allowing that excess pressure to dissipate the pore pressure was not measured and the effective soil pressure p was calculated as 1 p p γ w h w where p is the measured soil pressure γ w is the unit weight of the water and h w is the depth of soil pressure sensors below the water surface 3 1 3 resistance distributions during jacking installation the penetration force and weight of the new skirted foundation followed the static equilibrium condition li et al 2019 2 r g f r f r t i p where r is the total penetration resistance g is the weight of the caisson adjusted for buoyancy as increasing amounts of the caisson submerge during penetration f is the penetration force measured by the load cell placed between the hydraulic cylinder and the new skirted foundation r f is the skirt friction which includes inner friction r fi and outer friction r fo and r tip is the tip resistance after advance weighing and measuring f the curve of r versus displacement was plotted as shown in fig 9 the curves of t 1 to t 6 t 5 was slightly higher were generally in accordance with each other total resistance increased gradually with the increase of penetration displacement and the growth rate increased the skirt friction r f consists of inner friction r fi and outer friction r fo and can be calculated based on measured soil pressure which can be described as following equations lian et al 2014 3 r f r f i r f o 4 r f i i 1 5 μ p i i a i i 5 r f o i 6 10 μ p o i a o i 6 a i i π d i 2 s b 7 a o i π d o 2 s b where μ is the friction coefficient between the skirt and the sand following andersen et al 2008 and lian et al 2014 μ is 0 577 corresponding to the interface friction angle δ 0 9ϕ d i and d o represent the inner and outer diameters of the new skirted foundation respectively b 0 1 m is the distance of the annular zone 0 05 m above and below the pressure sensors skirt friction can also be calculated using empirical methods inner friction was calculated in terms of the plug resistance q plug because it was clearly greater than the outer friction caused by the skirt constraint effect li et al 2019 this method could also be regarded as a cone penetration test cpt method 8 r f i 1 4 π d i 2 q p l u g q c q c z lehane and gavin 2001 performed model tests of jacked pipe piles in sand and the value of q plug q c was about 0 05 the ratio of q plug q c was recommended at 0 05 for traditional circular foundations lian et al 2014 but was re evaluated using an inverse method for the new type of skirted foundation as 9 q p l u g q c z 12 the ratio of q plug q c is slightly lower than the recommended values by lehane and gavin 2001 and lian et al 2014 which may attributed to the deformation of skirted foundation the new skirted foundation was found to be more easily deformed than the circular type in installation outer skirt friction was calculated using the triaxial friction angle tfa and cpt empirical methods andersen et al 2008 outer friction r fo was calculated by tfa method as wang et al 2019b 10 r f o 0 5 k γ z tan δ where k is the ratio between horizontal and initial vertical effective stresses at the skirt wall and was recommended at 1 1 based on laboratory tests for traditional circular foundations γ is the effective soil weight and z is the penetration displacement outer friction r fo was calculated by cpt method as li et al 2019 11 r f o π d o 2 s 0 z k f q c l d l where k f is the empirical coefficient suggested by andersen et al 2008 at 0 0053 for traditional circular foundations under laboratory conditions the test results showed a good agreement with that of the empirical methods the inner friction r fi and the outer friction r fo of t 1 to t 6 were somewhat discrete but were generally in a similar trend as shown in fig 10 r fi values were larger than r fo values and the r fi growth rate was greater than r fo this demonstrated that the difference between r fi and r fo increased with increasing penetration displacement sharing ratios of r fi and r fo to r as depicted in fig 11 increased with penetration displacement reaching out the value of approximately 0 1 and 0 3 respectively the tip resistance r tip was obtained as the total resistance minus tested skirt friction 12 r t i p r r f the cpt method was also used to calculate tip resistance and k p was suggested by lian et al 2014 as 1 2 for traditional circular foundations 13 r t i p k p q c z a t i p where a tip is the tip area r tip distributions are shown in fig 12 test results for r tip were accurately predicted using the empirical method and increased with penetration displacement tip resistance results of t 1 to t 6 showed a good agreement while t 5 values were slightly greater the sharing ratios of r tip to r decreased with the increase of penetration displacement and reached a minimum value of 0 6 therefore tip resistance play a more important and functional role during jacking installation total penetration resistances for the new skirted foundation calculated using empirical methods were obtained by eq 2 and the results of which are shown in fig 9 the total resistance was in accordance with the testing results suggesting that the suggested coefficients were appropriate for predicting jacking installation resistance 3 2 skirted foundation lateral behavior 3 2 1 failure mode fig 13 depicts the new skirted foundation after laboratory testing to illustrate failure mode as lateral load increased the new skirted foundation tilted according to soil pressure sensors 11 and 12 the vast majority of the top lip moved upwards and separated from the soil as lateral load increased the skirt in the loading direction slightly settled into the soil and the skirt opposite the loading direction slid with the surrounding soil meanwhile wedge shaped zones were pushed down the surrounding soil was pressed sideways and upwards in the loading direction and bulged after testing forming a local shear failure zone a small subsidence area occurred opposite the loading direction and the soil moved upward slightly away soil in the loading direction was more heavily deformed and was evidently in a plastic deformation state therefore it can be concluded that the new skirted foundation was failed by tilting this finding is similar to the failure mode of traditional circular foundations li et al 2015 3 2 2 loading capacity the lateral loading and displacement tilting angle relationships for t 1 to t 6 are depicted in fig 14 test results for the same loading height were plotted together to ensure the reproducibility of the testing the maximum lateral bearing loads derived by comparison of different set of tests showed a good agreement the curves represented a linear trend with a large gradient as the load increased rapidly while the displacement tilting angle changed very little when l 0 4 m however the curves showed strong nonlinearity after exceeding a certain load threshold and rapidly achieved maximum capacity wang et al 2019a 2020 in comparison the displacement tilting angle seemed to increase with lateral load at a greater rate when the loading height was greater when l 0 6 m and l 0 8 m notably there was some difference in the ultimate lateral load between t 3 and t 4 and the result of t 4 seemed to have some deviations the ultimate lateral load was determined as the load corresponding to the intersection of two tangents in the elastic and failure stages huang and kim 2012 villalobos et al 2005 the combined moment and lateral loading relationships are depicted in fig 15 comparisons of lateral behaviors at different loading heights demonstrated that the models at l 0 4 m had the maximum ultimate lateral bearing load after reaching the maximum value the lateral bearing load then decreased with the increasing value of l in comparison the corresponding moment at top lid center generally increased with increasing value of l throughout the testing villalobos et al 2005 used a yield surface expression to describe the combined capacity of traditional circular foundation under low vertical loads shown as follow 14 f h h 0 v u l t 2 m m 0 d t v u l t 2 2 a h h 0 v u l t m m 0 d t v u l t β 12 t 0 1 β 1 β 2 2 v v u l t t 0 2 β 1 1 v v u l t 2 β 2 0 15 β 12 β 1 β 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 β 1 β 2 β 2 where v ult is the ultimate vertical load d t is the traditional circular foundation diameter β 1 and β 2 are curvature factors and the yield surface is usually plotted by defining β 1 β 2 1 in addition h 0 m 0 and a are parameters of yield surface and t 0 is a value that controls the lower intersection of the failure surface with the v axis which varies between 0 04 larger footing and 0 064 smaller footing the range of t 0 was reached using a larger footing with a diameter of 293 mm and a smaller footing with a diameter of 200 mm for the new skirted foundation an equivalent diameter d e was used and the ultimate vertical load v ult can be estimated as 16 d e d o d o s 17 v u l t γ d n q π d e 2 4 d e s γ d e 2 n r π d e 2 4 d e s γ d 2 2 k tan δ π d e n q and n r are determined from bolton and lau 1993 18 n r c 1 n q 1 cos ϕ c 2 19 n q c 3 e c 4 π tan ϕ tan 2 45 ϕ 2 the constants factors c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 for sand are 0 1 1 33 0 715 and 1 42 ibsen et al 2012 respectively the calculated v ult was 341 kn which corresponded with the measured v ult from vertical loading tests yan et al 2019 based on a criterion of 0 06d e the mean value of t 1 and t 2 was approximately 340 kn thus validating the method on the use of the recommended values from ibsen et al 2013b the value of yield points located between the yield surface were calculated to be t 0 0 04 and t 0 0 064 as shown in fig 15 however the yield point trends for the new skirted foundation did not correspond well with the yield surfaces from ibsen et al 2013b therefore the values of m 0 0 0845 byrne 2000 and h 0 0 255 were adjusted for the yield surface in this study the failure criterion properly described the measured capacities of the new skirted foundation with t 0 0 042 with the dimensions such strategy resulted in a better parameter fit and accuracy for the larger footings however the parameters were only limited in this case more generalized and reproducible parameters were suggested to be proposed with enough samples 3 2 3 soil pressure fig 16 illustrates the incremental soil pressure variations during lateral loading for face fo 1 soil pressure cells of 6 8 increased with increasing lateral loading when l 0 4 m however the pressures at 9 and 10 first increased then decreased thus the incremental soil pressure at higher penetration depths under certain lateral loading was greater than that of other conditions the pressure at 8 and 9 exceeded 10 when the lateral load reached 7 kpa and pressure at 8 exceeded 9 when the lateral load reached 10 kpa the pressure values were all located in the passive soil pressure zone incremental soil pressure exhibited a similar distribution with the case of l 0 4 m when l 0 6 m however pressure values at l 0 6 m were generally smaller than those at the same penetration depth and lateral load when l 0 4 m a passive soil pressure zone could be derived because the incremental soil pressure values were all positive the incremental soil pressure for 6 9 when l 0 8 m was generally similar to the pressure when l 0 4 m however the pressure at 10 was negative when the lateral load was beyond 3 kpa demonstrating that 10 was located in the active soil pressure zone fig 17 depicts incremental soil pressure variability during lateral loading for face fi 1 the incremental soil pressure at 1 4 either varied little or was slightly smaller than zero when l 0 4 0 8 m however pressure at 5 first increased then decreased when l 0 4 m while kept fluctuated when l 0 6 m or 0 8 m in comparison the incremental soil pressure at 1 5 generally varied little or decreased to negative values with increasing lateral load when l 0 4 0 8 m for fi 2 this is shown in fig 18 the variation of soil pressure for faces fi 1 and fi 2 revealed that the skirt soil interactions inside the new skirted foundation were small it is likely that the incremental soil pressures were induced by skirt soil separation and slippage which then triggered active soil pressure zones in most of the inner skirt the incremental soil pressure at 6 9 slightly decreased and pressure at 10 increased with increasing lateral loading when l 0 4 m for fo 2 as shown in fig 19 the incremental soil pressure at 7 10 generally decreased to positive values when l 0 6 m and values for 6 10 shifted to negative values when l 0 8 m this revealed that face fo 2 was generally located in the active soil pressure zone and was possibly induced by skirt slippage and rotation the net soil pressure distributions derived from the incremental soil pressure for fo 1 minus fo 2 are presented in fig 20 net soil pressure had a parabolic shape that became increasingly apparent with the increase of lateral load however net soil pressure was generally positive this means that the rotational centers were below the tip of the new type of skirted foundation in comparison zhu et al 2011 found that the instantaneous rotation center of the circular caisson at failure was at a depth of about four fifths of the skirt length this is because that the new type of skirted foundation was extended in the lengthwise direction which seemed to be more wide shallow than a traditional circular foundation with the same skirt depth 4 conclusions a series of large scale model tests were conducted to investigate jacking installation mechanics and lateral loading performance of a new skirted foundation in sand the new skirted foundation model composed of two side semicircles and a middle rectangle was constructed by steel the semicircles had a diameter of 1 0 m and the lengths of both the middle rectangle and the skirt were 0 5 m the soil used was sand collected offshore of tianjin china the thickness of the sand bed was 2 4 m following factors were investigated in this study displacement and soil skirt interactions during jacking installation jacking penetration resistance distribution and calculation failure mode and bearing capacity and soil structure response under lateral loading based on the aforementioned models the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the new type of skirted foundation sunk down rapidly under its own weight and resulting displacements ranged from 10 3 cm to 13 3 cm soil settlement first increased linearly then a nonlinearity behavior occurred during the jacking installation and soil plugs occurred 2 soil pressure generally increased with the increasing displacement during jacking installation and soil pressure sensors at higher depths exhibited greater values inner soil pressure values were higher than that of outer soil at the same penetration depths due to the skirt constraint effect 3 tip resistance values were higher than skirt friction and inner friction was higher than outer friction the inner skirt friction was predicted well using the calculation method for pipe pile axial capacity based on cone resistance the measured outer skirt friction showed a good agreement with tfa and cpt empirical methods it was recommended that the tip resistance coefficient k p to take the value of 1 2 4 the new skirted foundation exhibited a mode of tilting failure the majority of the top lip moved upwards and separated with the soil under increasing lateral load the skirt in the loading direction slightly settled into the soil while the skirt in the opposite direction of loading slid with the surrounding soil meanwhile the surrounding soil was pressed sideways and moved upwards in the loading direction and bulged after testing leading to the formation of a local shear failure zone 5 the displacement tilting angle increased with lateral load at a faster rate with increasing loading height the smaller loading height models had larger lateral bearing loads which decreased with increasing loading height in comparison the corresponding moment at the center of the top lid generally increased with increasing loading height it was suggested to use proper optimum parameters to describe the lateral load and moment yield surface with a hyperbolic empirical expression 6 passive soil pressure zones generally occurred on the outer surface of the new skirted foundation in the loading direction whereas those in the opposite direction were mainly located in active soil pressure zones inner skirt soil interactions were lower than the outer the incremental soil pressure was probably induced by skirt soil separation and slippage which triggered active soil pressure zones in most of the inner skirt the rotational centers were found to below the tip of the new type of skirted foundation 7 the effect of bulkheads on installation vertical and lateral bearing capacities and soil skirt interaction is suggested to be investigated in future study furthermore the layout of internal bulkheads is suggested to be optimized for the benefits of the new

22137,a new type of caisson composed of two skirted side semicircles and a skirted middle rectangle was used as a breakwater foundation in xuyu port china in this study large scale laboratory model tests were carried out on jacking installations and lateral loading of this new skirted foundation in sand test results showed that the soil pressure acting on the caisson s inner skirt was larger than the outer soil pressure during jacking installation whilst the tip resistance was greater than skirt friction penetration resistance was well predicted with the jacked pile theory and cone resistance overturning failure of the foundation occurred under the lateral loading ultimate lateral loads displayed a descending trend with increasing loading position height whereas the corresponding moments exhibited an increasing trend parameters were suggested to calibrate the expression of circular foundation for purpose of estimating the combined capacity of the new skirted foundation passive soil pressure zones occurred on the outer surface of the new skirted foundation in the loading direction in contrast active soil pressure zones were found in the area with opposite loading direction the net incremental soil pressure was positive in the loading direction suggesting that the rotation center was beneath the model base keywords new skirted foundation installation lateral loading soil structure interaction sand 1 introduction a new breakwater foundation type guan et al 2018 was designed and applied to a vertical breakwater project in xuyu port china chen and li 2016 nie et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the breakwater foundation has a shallow caisson type structure composed of two skirted side semicircles and a skirted middle rectangle two buckets located on the foundation are used as a wave wall adjacent structures are connected together to reduce wave action intensity and prevent sedimentation compared with conventional mound or caisson breakwaters yan et al 2018 he et al 2018 the new skirted breakwater consumes fewer materials and provides a more convenient and economical route for the construction of breakwater compared with traditional circular foundations lian et al 2014 wang et al 2017b such new designing strategy can effectively increase the load bearing area and prevent structural torsion through a side by side arrangement after construction the whole structure is transported to a predetermined location by a floating dock guan et al 2018 and installed using jacking or suction forces therefore one challenge for the new type of skirted foundation is to penetrate deep enough to retain the required bearing capacity and stability especially in sand where penetration resistance is quite large and installation can be more problematic koteras and ibsen 2019 due to a lack of field and laboratory observations however some insights can be taken from traditional circular caissons as suction technology is usually employed in addition to the caisson s own weight most previous studies have emphasized suction penetration resistance houlsby and byrne 2005 tran et al 2008 ibsen and thilsted 2011 zhu et al 2011 kim et al 2015 jia et al 2018 however jacking penetration resistance should still be studied to provide guidance in real case applications for comparative purpose and to improve accuracy of calculation some recent studies on jacking installation mechanisms for circular foundations in sand have been carried out based on laboratory model tests and field trials lian et al 2014 and chen et al 2016 conducted a series of laboratory tests to investigate the interactions between the caisson and silty sand in both jacking and suction installation processes lee et al 2015 conducted model testing on bucket foundations embedded in sand by different installation methods to investigate cone tip resistance it was found that the inside cone tip resistance of a bucket installed by suction force was approximately 40 less than that installed by jacking force koteras and ibsen 2019 compared jacking and suction installation mechanics using medium scale tests zhu et al 2019 performed model testing of circular bucket foundations that were embedded in sand using the jacking installation method the penetration and tip resistance and inner and outer soil pressure were investigated despite the fact that offshore foundations are subjected to vertical loading from the self weight of the caisson the vertical applied load is way below the vertical capacity in contrast lateral loads such as the horizontal load and moment generated by waves play a predominant role in breakwater foundation design li et al 2014 for practical applications in xuyu port the static and cyclic lateral bearing performance of the new skirted breakwater in soft clay was investigated using small scale tests gao et al 2013a and centrifuge modeling chen and li 2016 nie et al 2016 additionally in situ stress and pore water pressure monitoring was performed to ensure normal breakwater operation guan et al 2018 these tests were all conducted on soft clay rather than sand compared with the few studies on the new skirted foundation there has been abundant research on the lateral performance of traditional circular foundations in sand with popular model testing methods watson and randolph 1998 byrne and houlsby 1999 watson et al 2000 cassidy et al 2004 zhu et al 2011 gao et al 2013b ibsen et al 2013a b li et al 2015 wang et al 2017a due to the fact that conducting numerical analysis in cohesionless soil is more difficult than the analysis of caisson foundations in clay bransby and randolph 1998 gourvenec 2007 in the most recent studies zhu et al 2011 conducted a series of large scale model tests on suction caissons suction installation resistance was investigated and predicted with cone resistance the instantaneous rotation center of the circular caisson at failure was found at a depth of about four fifths of the skirt length gao et al 2013b conducted a series of model tests to explore the anti uplift behavior of circular suction caissons in sand studying the effects of aspect ratios load inclination angles and loading positions the pull out bearing capacity decreased with load inclination angles increasing the optimum loading position located between 2 3 and 3 4 of the caisson length ibsen et al 2013a b proposed adaptive plasticity models and calibrated failure criteria for a circular bucket foundation in sand under general loading the combined capacity of circular bucket foundations from loads was found to be independent of the embedment ratio however the experimental results were based on small scale tests wang et al 2017a performed centrifuge modeling of circular bucket foundation lateral bearing behavior in offshore wind turbines with the configurations of three aspect ratios overturning occurred under lateral loading and lateral bearing capacity was determined with two criterions regarding displacement a simplified calculation method that was checked with test results was used as the third method despite the above reviews literature on the installation mechanics and lateral loading behavior of the new type of breakwater foundation is still limited primarily due to the lack of field and laboratory observations furthermore it is necessary to supplement the database regarding foundation performance when installed in granular soils the main objectives of this study were to investigate the 1 soil skirt interaction during jacking installation 2 jacking penetration resistance distribution and calculation method 3 failure mode and bearing capacity under lateral loading and 4 soil structure response under lateral loading in addition parameters were suggested to calibrate the estimating equation for the combined capacity of the new skirted foundation type the results from this study will contribute to the promotion of the new skirted foundation 2 model testing 2 1 equipment and materials model testing for the new type of skirted foundation was carried out in a large soil tank as illustrated in fig 2 the inside of the soil tank were in a rectangular geometry with the dimension of the 6 3 8 3 m length width depth which eliminated boundary influences a steel reaction beam was attached to the side walls of the platform a hydraulic cylinder was fixed on the beam to provide the reaction forces used in jacking installation tests a second hydraulic cylinder which was used after installation by the first hydraulic cylinder was fixed on the beam attached to the side wall to provide the reaction forces during lateral loading two wired displacement transducers were placed beside hydraulic cylinders to record the vertical and lateral displacements respectively two load cells were fixed on the hydraulic cylinders to monitor the penetrating force and the lateral load two inclinometers were placed with the angle of 90 to monitor tilting angles during installation and lateral loading a water level control system was also designed to control the rise and drawdown of water in the tank the new skirted foundation was made of steel its dimensions are shown in table 1 the semicircle diameter d was 100 cm and the skirt and middle rectangle lengths d and s were 50 cm the skirt and top lid thicknesses were 0 8 and 1 6 cm respectively there were ten soil pressure sensors with a diameter of 2 cm embedded in the skirt wall of the caisson with the set up of five facing inward and five facing outward as shown in fig 3 the inside sensors were subscripted as i i was numbered from 1 to 5 and the outside sensors of the same height were subscripted as i 5 distances from the top lid or skirt tip to the soil pressure sensors were 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 35 cm and 45 cm in addition two soil pressure sensors were embedded in the top lid the soil pressure sensors in the skirt and top lid were designed to monitor the interactions between sand and the skirt or top lid there were six valves on the top lid of the caisson which were used for in and out gas during the penetration stage the experiments used natural marine sand collected from coastal areas of tianjin china the physical properties of the sand such as natural and dry density moisture content the permeability value internal friction angle cohesion and compression modulus were obtained as per standards the results of which are listed in table 2 the friction angle was measured in slow direct shear tests at stress levels of 50 kpa 100 kpa 150 kpa and 200 kpa according to the particle size distribution curve shown in fig 4 91 14 of the sand was medium sand with grain sizes ranging from 0 15 to 0 6 mm cone penetration tests cpts were used to obtain cone resistance the cone penetration results are shown in fig 5 the results demonstrated that cone tip resistance increased with the increasing depth of cone penetration the sand layer was saturated by water and left for static settlement the final sand bed was 2 4 m in depth overlaid by 0 05 m depth of water to keep it saturated during testing 2 2 testing procedure six tests were carried out in this study t 1 to t 6 which were classified into two basic steps the first step was about jacking installation and the second one was in regards to lateral loading the jacking installation was designed to obtain the penetration resistance demonstrate soil skirt interactions contribute information about skirted foundation installations in medium sand and prepare for the subsequent step of lateral loading in the second step the lateral load was applied to acquire repeatable results of the ultimate lateral capacity and the pressure of both inner and outer soil the sequence of overall testing procedures is summarized in table 3 2 2 1 installation for the test it is important to keep each testing condition unchanged especially the relative sand densities bang et al 2011 hence prior to each test the sand in the tank was loosened to a depth of about 1 5 times of the skirt length the test was abolished when the tilting angle in the installation exceeded 1 5 therefore adjustments were made before installation to guarantee a small tilting angle but no adjustment was made in the installation process the new skirted foundation was first sunk into the soil under its own weight and then penetrated more deeply under a step loading method after the stabilization of gravity induced displacement t 1 t 2 and t 3 corresponded to a 2 kn load incremental step t 4 and t 5 corresponded to a 1 5 kn step and t 6 corresponded to a 1 kn step the jacking process was executed by the first hydraulic cylinder and was ceased when the soil pressure reading of the top lid appeared 2 2 2 lateral loading the operation of lateral loading was divided into three groups as per the variation of the height of the displacement point above the top lid l monotonic lateral loads were applied by the second hydraulic cylinder after the installation of the new skirted foundation the time interval between installation and lateral loading processes exceeded 2 h to eliminate the effect of installation on monotonic lateral performance t 1 and t 2 corresponded to l 0 4 m t 3 and t 4 corresponded to l 0 6 m and t 5 and t 6 corresponded to l 0 8 m each test pair with the same value of l was uploaded in opposite directions hence the soil pressure values for faces fi 1 and fo 2 were obtained when uploaded in the loading direction whereas pressure values for faces fi 2 and fo 1 were acquired in the opposite direction as shown in figs 2 and 3 once the new skirted foundation began to tilt the lateral loading process was initiated 3 test results and discussion 3 1 jacking installation performance 3 1 1 displacement the displacement measuring point was near the loading point the tilting angles were small and the maximum value in the six tests did not exceed 1 2 in the penetration process fig 6 shows measured displacement values for t 1 to t 6 respectively the displacement curve underwent three stages during jacking installation gravity stage intermediate stage and jacking stage it can be inferred that during the gravity stage the new type of skirted caisson sunk down rapidly under its own weight the final measured displacements ranged from 10 3 cm to 13 3 cm in t 1 to t 6 as shown in fig 7 in the intermediate stage the measured displacements did not vary this showed that the structure was stable under its own weight during the jacking stage a vertical load was imposed in a step loading method a linear increase in settlement was firstly observed then the settlement displayed nonlinear behavior until the soil pressure sensors inside the top lid began to display readings which meant that the sand was in contact with the inside top lid final displacement values ranged from 45 5 cm to 48 7 cm which did not exceed the skirt length that was designated as 50 cm this means that the occurrence of soil plugs during jacking installation the effects of load incremental step were not evidently observed during testing displacement responses were similar to that of the jacking installation process of traditional circular foundations lian et al 2014 3 1 2 soil skirt interactions fig 8 depicts the inner and outer soil pressure values versus displacement during jacking installation in t 3 inner soil pressure generally increased with displacement the soil pressure sensors at greater depths showed higher values the soil pressure sensor near the tip 5 recorded pressures up to 57 kpa after jacking installation outer soil pressure was lower at the same penetrating depth and did not exceed 10 kpa this is due to the fact that the skirt wall imposed a stronger lateral constraint on the internal sand as a result of this very high soil pressure formed inside the skirt which was similar to the situation of jacked pipe piles and traditional circular caisson installations as the negative excess pore pressure due to dilation was likely to be small in medium sand and sand has a strong permeability allowing that excess pressure to dissipate the pore pressure was not measured and the effective soil pressure p was calculated as 1 p p γ w h w where p is the measured soil pressure γ w is the unit weight of the water and h w is the depth of soil pressure sensors below the water surface 3 1 3 resistance distributions during jacking installation the penetration force and weight of the new skirted foundation followed the static equilibrium condition li et al 2019 2 r g f r f r t i p where r is the total penetration resistance g is the weight of the caisson adjusted for buoyancy as increasing amounts of the caisson submerge during penetration f is the penetration force measured by the load cell placed between the hydraulic cylinder and the new skirted foundation r f is the skirt friction which includes inner friction r fi and outer friction r fo and r tip is the tip resistance after advance weighing and measuring f the curve of r versus displacement was plotted as shown in fig 9 the curves of t 1 to t 6 t 5 was slightly higher were generally in accordance with each other total resistance increased gradually with the increase of penetration displacement and the growth rate increased the skirt friction r f consists of inner friction r fi and outer friction r fo and can be calculated based on measured soil pressure which can be described as following equations lian et al 2014 3 r f r f i r f o 4 r f i i 1 5 μ p i i a i i 5 r f o i 6 10 μ p o i a o i 6 a i i π d i 2 s b 7 a o i π d o 2 s b where μ is the friction coefficient between the skirt and the sand following andersen et al 2008 and lian et al 2014 μ is 0 577 corresponding to the interface friction angle δ 0 9ϕ d i and d o represent the inner and outer diameters of the new skirted foundation respectively b 0 1 m is the distance of the annular zone 0 05 m above and below the pressure sensors skirt friction can also be calculated using empirical methods inner friction was calculated in terms of the plug resistance q plug because it was clearly greater than the outer friction caused by the skirt constraint effect li et al 2019 this method could also be regarded as a cone penetration test cpt method 8 r f i 1 4 π d i 2 q p l u g q c q c z lehane and gavin 2001 performed model tests of jacked pipe piles in sand and the value of q plug q c was about 0 05 the ratio of q plug q c was recommended at 0 05 for traditional circular foundations lian et al 2014 but was re evaluated using an inverse method for the new type of skirted foundation as 9 q p l u g q c z 12 the ratio of q plug q c is slightly lower than the recommended values by lehane and gavin 2001 and lian et al 2014 which may attributed to the deformation of skirted foundation the new skirted foundation was found to be more easily deformed than the circular type in installation outer skirt friction was calculated using the triaxial friction angle tfa and cpt empirical methods andersen et al 2008 outer friction r fo was calculated by tfa method as wang et al 2019b 10 r f o 0 5 k γ z tan δ where k is the ratio between horizontal and initial vertical effective stresses at the skirt wall and was recommended at 1 1 based on laboratory tests for traditional circular foundations γ is the effective soil weight and z is the penetration displacement outer friction r fo was calculated by cpt method as li et al 2019 11 r f o π d o 2 s 0 z k f q c l d l where k f is the empirical coefficient suggested by andersen et al 2008 at 0 0053 for traditional circular foundations under laboratory conditions the test results showed a good agreement with that of the empirical methods the inner friction r fi and the outer friction r fo of t 1 to t 6 were somewhat discrete but were generally in a similar trend as shown in fig 10 r fi values were larger than r fo values and the r fi growth rate was greater than r fo this demonstrated that the difference between r fi and r fo increased with increasing penetration displacement sharing ratios of r fi and r fo to r as depicted in fig 11 increased with penetration displacement reaching out the value of approximately 0 1 and 0 3 respectively the tip resistance r tip was obtained as the total resistance minus tested skirt friction 12 r t i p r r f the cpt method was also used to calculate tip resistance and k p was suggested by lian et al 2014 as 1 2 for traditional circular foundations 13 r t i p k p q c z a t i p where a tip is the tip area r tip distributions are shown in fig 12 test results for r tip were accurately predicted using the empirical method and increased with penetration displacement tip resistance results of t 1 to t 6 showed a good agreement while t 5 values were slightly greater the sharing ratios of r tip to r decreased with the increase of penetration displacement and reached a minimum value of 0 6 therefore tip resistance play a more important and functional role during jacking installation total penetration resistances for the new skirted foundation calculated using empirical methods were obtained by eq 2 and the results of which are shown in fig 9 the total resistance was in accordance with the testing results suggesting that the suggested coefficients were appropriate for predicting jacking installation resistance 3 2 skirted foundation lateral behavior 3 2 1 failure mode fig 13 depicts the new skirted foundation after laboratory testing to illustrate failure mode as lateral load increased the new skirted foundation tilted according to soil pressure sensors 11 and 12 the vast majority of the top lip moved upwards and separated from the soil as lateral load increased the skirt in the loading direction slightly settled into the soil and the skirt opposite the loading direction slid with the surrounding soil meanwhile wedge shaped zones were pushed down the surrounding soil was pressed sideways and upwards in the loading direction and bulged after testing forming a local shear failure zone a small subsidence area occurred opposite the loading direction and the soil moved upward slightly away soil in the loading direction was more heavily deformed and was evidently in a plastic deformation state therefore it can be concluded that the new skirted foundation was failed by tilting this finding is similar to the failure mode of traditional circular foundations li et al 2015 3 2 2 loading capacity the lateral loading and displacement tilting angle relationships for t 1 to t 6 are depicted in fig 14 test results for the same loading height were plotted together to ensure the reproducibility of the testing the maximum lateral bearing loads derived by comparison of different set of tests showed a good agreement the curves represented a linear trend with a large gradient as the load increased rapidly while the displacement tilting angle changed very little when l 0 4 m however the curves showed strong nonlinearity after exceeding a certain load threshold and rapidly achieved maximum capacity wang et al 2019a 2020 in comparison the displacement tilting angle seemed to increase with lateral load at a greater rate when the loading height was greater when l 0 6 m and l 0 8 m notably there was some difference in the ultimate lateral load between t 3 and t 4 and the result of t 4 seemed to have some deviations the ultimate lateral load was determined as the load corresponding to the intersection of two tangents in the elastic and failure stages huang and kim 2012 villalobos et al 2005 the combined moment and lateral loading relationships are depicted in fig 15 comparisons of lateral behaviors at different loading heights demonstrated that the models at l 0 4 m had the maximum ultimate lateral bearing load after reaching the maximum value the lateral bearing load then decreased with the increasing value of l in comparison the corresponding moment at top lid center generally increased with increasing value of l throughout the testing villalobos et al 2005 used a yield surface expression to describe the combined capacity of traditional circular foundation under low vertical loads shown as follow 14 f h h 0 v u l t 2 m m 0 d t v u l t 2 2 a h h 0 v u l t m m 0 d t v u l t β 12 t 0 1 β 1 β 2 2 v v u l t t 0 2 β 1 1 v v u l t 2 β 2 0 15 β 12 β 1 β 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 β 1 β 2 β 2 where v ult is the ultimate vertical load d t is the traditional circular foundation diameter β 1 and β 2 are curvature factors and the yield surface is usually plotted by defining β 1 β 2 1 in addition h 0 m 0 and a are parameters of yield surface and t 0 is a value that controls the lower intersection of the failure surface with the v axis which varies between 0 04 larger footing and 0 064 smaller footing the range of t 0 was reached using a larger footing with a diameter of 293 mm and a smaller footing with a diameter of 200 mm for the new skirted foundation an equivalent diameter d e was used and the ultimate vertical load v ult can be estimated as 16 d e d o d o s 17 v u l t γ d n q π d e 2 4 d e s γ d e 2 n r π d e 2 4 d e s γ d 2 2 k tan δ π d e n q and n r are determined from bolton and lau 1993 18 n r c 1 n q 1 cos ϕ c 2 19 n q c 3 e c 4 π tan ϕ tan 2 45 ϕ 2 the constants factors c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 for sand are 0 1 1 33 0 715 and 1 42 ibsen et al 2012 respectively the calculated v ult was 341 kn which corresponded with the measured v ult from vertical loading tests yan et al 2019 based on a criterion of 0 06d e the mean value of t 1 and t 2 was approximately 340 kn thus validating the method on the use of the recommended values from ibsen et al 2013b the value of yield points located between the yield surface were calculated to be t 0 0 04 and t 0 0 064 as shown in fig 15 however the yield point trends for the new skirted foundation did not correspond well with the yield surfaces from ibsen et al 2013b therefore the values of m 0 0 0845 byrne 2000 and h 0 0 255 were adjusted for the yield surface in this study the failure criterion properly described the measured capacities of the new skirted foundation with t 0 0 042 with the dimensions such strategy resulted in a better parameter fit and accuracy for the larger footings however the parameters were only limited in this case more generalized and reproducible parameters were suggested to be proposed with enough samples 3 2 3 soil pressure fig 16 illustrates the incremental soil pressure variations during lateral loading for face fo 1 soil pressure cells of 6 8 increased with increasing lateral loading when l 0 4 m however the pressures at 9 and 10 first increased then decreased thus the incremental soil pressure at higher penetration depths under certain lateral loading was greater than that of other conditions the pressure at 8 and 9 exceeded 10 when the lateral load reached 7 kpa and pressure at 8 exceeded 9 when the lateral load reached 10 kpa the pressure values were all located in the passive soil pressure zone incremental soil pressure exhibited a similar distribution with the case of l 0 4 m when l 0 6 m however pressure values at l 0 6 m were generally smaller than those at the same penetration depth and lateral load when l 0 4 m a passive soil pressure zone could be derived because the incremental soil pressure values were all positive the incremental soil pressure for 6 9 when l 0 8 m was generally similar to the pressure when l 0 4 m however the pressure at 10 was negative when the lateral load was beyond 3 kpa demonstrating that 10 was located in the active soil pressure zone fig 17 depicts incremental soil pressure variability during lateral loading for face fi 1 the incremental soil pressure at 1 4 either varied little or was slightly smaller than zero when l 0 4 0 8 m however pressure at 5 first increased then decreased when l 0 4 m while kept fluctuated when l 0 6 m or 0 8 m in comparison the incremental soil pressure at 1 5 generally varied little or decreased to negative values with increasing lateral load when l 0 4 0 8 m for fi 2 this is shown in fig 18 the variation of soil pressure for faces fi 1 and fi 2 revealed that the skirt soil interactions inside the new skirted foundation were small it is likely that the incremental soil pressures were induced by skirt soil separation and slippage which then triggered active soil pressure zones in most of the inner skirt the incremental soil pressure at 6 9 slightly decreased and pressure at 10 increased with increasing lateral loading when l 0 4 m for fo 2 as shown in fig 19 the incremental soil pressure at 7 10 generally decreased to positive values when l 0 6 m and values for 6 10 shifted to negative values when l 0 8 m this revealed that face fo 2 was generally located in the active soil pressure zone and was possibly induced by skirt slippage and rotation the net soil pressure distributions derived from the incremental soil pressure for fo 1 minus fo 2 are presented in fig 20 net soil pressure had a parabolic shape that became increasingly apparent with the increase of lateral load however net soil pressure was generally positive this means that the rotational centers were below the tip of the new type of skirted foundation in comparison zhu et al 2011 found that the instantaneous rotation center of the circular caisson at failure was at a depth of about four fifths of the skirt length this is because that the new type of skirted foundation was extended in the lengthwise direction which seemed to be more wide shallow than a traditional circular foundation with the same skirt depth 4 conclusions a series of large scale model tests were conducted to investigate jacking installation mechanics and lateral loading performance of a new skirted foundation in sand the new skirted foundation model composed of two side semicircles and a middle rectangle was constructed by steel the semicircles had a diameter of 1 0 m and the lengths of both the middle rectangle and the skirt were 0 5 m the soil used was sand collected offshore of tianjin china the thickness of the sand bed was 2 4 m following factors were investigated in this study displacement and soil skirt interactions during jacking installation jacking penetration resistance distribution and calculation failure mode and bearing capacity and soil structure response under lateral loading based on the aforementioned models the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the new type of skirted foundation sunk down rapidly under its own weight and resulting displacements ranged from 10 3 cm to 13 3 cm soil settlement first increased linearly then a nonlinearity behavior occurred during the jacking installation and soil plugs occurred 2 soil pressure generally increased with the increasing displacement during jacking installation and soil pressure sensors at higher depths exhibited greater values inner soil pressure values were higher than that of outer soil at the same penetration depths due to the skirt constraint effect 3 tip resistance values were higher than skirt friction and inner friction was higher than outer friction the inner skirt friction was predicted well using the calculation method for pipe pile axial capacity based on cone resistance the measured outer skirt friction showed a good agreement with tfa and cpt empirical methods it was recommended that the tip resistance coefficient k p to take the value of 1 2 4 the new skirted foundation exhibited a mode of tilting failure the majority of the top lip moved upwards and separated with the soil under increasing lateral load the skirt in the loading direction slightly settled into the soil while the skirt in the opposite direction of loading slid with the surrounding soil meanwhile the surrounding soil was pressed sideways and moved upwards in the loading direction and bulged after testing leading to the formation of a local shear failure zone 5 the displacement tilting angle increased with lateral load at a faster rate with increasing loading height the smaller loading height models had larger lateral bearing loads which decreased with increasing loading height in comparison the corresponding moment at the center of the top lid generally increased with increasing loading height it was suggested to use proper optimum parameters to describe the lateral load and moment yield surface with a hyperbolic empirical expression 6 passive soil pressure zones generally occurred on the outer surface of the new skirted foundation in the loading direction whereas those in the opposite direction were mainly located in active soil pressure zones inner skirt soil interactions were lower than the outer the incremental soil pressure was probably induced by skirt soil separation and slippage which triggered active soil pressure zones in most of the inner skirt the rotational centers were found to below the tip of the new type of skirted foundation 7 the effect of bulkheads on installation vertical and lateral bearing capacities and soil skirt interaction is suggested to be investigated in future study furthermore the layout of internal bulkheads is suggested to be optimized for the benefits of the new

22138,proposed herein is a two mode wave energy converter type attachment to the fore edge of pontoon type very large floating structures vlfss for wave energy extraction and reduction of hydroelastic response this attachment consists of floating horizontal and submerged vertical plates that are connected to the vlfs with hinges and linear power take off systems the use of both floating horizontal and submerged vertical plates combines the superior performances of floating plates in extracting wave energy from short waves t 5 s and of submerged vertical plates in extracting wave energy from intermediate and long waves t 7 s when deployed in sites where 5 s t 7 s the two mode attachment yields a larger power production than the sole usage of floating plates or the sole usage of submerged vertical plates interestingly the two mode attachment also combines the superior performance of submerged vertical plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively short waves t 7 s and the superior performance of floating plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively long waves t 9 s moreover this two mode attachment furnishes a good balance between extracting wave energy and reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs for the same wave period keywords very large floating structure hydroelastic response raft wave energy converter oscillating wave surge converter 1 introduction since wave energy converters wecs were first studied by yoshio masuda in 1940s many techniques for extracting wave energy have been proposed and by 1980 more than 1000 wec related patents had been filed falcão 2010 nowadays although the number of available techniques for extracting wave energy remains large only a few of them have been adopted for wave energy projects that include model tests in real sea conditions according to csiro 2012 only about six wecs had been tested in real sea conditions among these wecs the pelamis and oyster wecs have received a great worldwide attention from engineers and scientists whittaker and folley 2012 yemm et al 2012 the pelamis wec which may be also called a raft wec haren and mei 1979 consists of pontoons connected to one another with hinges and power take off pto systems the oyster wec which may be also called the oscillating wave surge converter owsc whittaker and folley 2012 comprises a submerged vertical plate connected to a base structure at the seabed with a hinge and pto system the main advantage of the raft wec lies in the high wave energy conversion efficiency when compared to other wec concepts yemm et al 2012 on the other hand the main advantage of the owsc is its wide efficiency bandwidth flocard and finnigan 2010 and hence it may be effectively used for extracting wave energy for a wide range of wave conditions which includes a relatively long wave condition although a great deal of effort has been invested in the development of wecs for the last few decades wec technology remains at an early implementation stage as compared to other renewable energy technologies as well as the conventional energy technologies such as coal and fossil fuel energy technologies falcão 2010 mustapa et al 2017 this makes the electricity generated from ocean waves currently much more expensive than the electricity generated from other sources of energy irena 2014 one possible way to reduce the cost of wave power is to improve the power capture factor by innovative designs of wave energy converters another promising way is to reduce costs for installation mooring foundation operation and maintenance according to the international renewable energy agency report irena 2014 these costs may account for about 41 of wave energy project life cost these costs may be reduced through cost sharing between wecs and other purpose marine structures when integrated irena 2014 mustapa et al 2017 other potential benefits of integration of wecs with other purpose marine structures include i limiting the negative environmental impact irena 2014 ii reducing hydrodynamic motions of marine structures under wave actions as wecs are wave energy absorbers iii improving the ability of marine structures in breaking waves if the marine structures are partly fully functioned as breakwaters iv providing power supply for operations on marine structures v increasing the reliability and hence lifetime of wecs by providing additional strength to wecs to withstand strong waves and by allowing some components of wecs to be placed on the marine structures mustapa et al 2017 which are usually more stable under wave action as compared to stand alone wecs examples of the integration between wecs and marine structures are the wec type breakwater mustapa et al 2017 and the combined wind wave energy converter pérez collazo et al 2015 on another front of ocean utilization pontoon type very large floating structures vlfss have been shown to be one promising solution for creating artificial land on the ocean lamas pardo et al 2015 suzuki 2005 watanabe et al 2004 vlfs usually has large horizontal dimensions as compared to wavelengths and relatively small flexural rigidity wang et al 2007 because of these two properties the dynamic response of vlfs under wave action is dominated by elastic deformations and hence may be called hydroelastic response there are many methods proposed for reducing the hydroelastic response of vlfs under wave action as described in a review paper by wang et al 2010 these methods include the use of bottom founded breakwaters ohmatsu 2000 or floating breakwaters tay et al 2009 floating auxiliary structures attached to the fore of vlfs kim et al 2005 submerged vertical horizontal plates or submerged box shaped structures rigidly connected to the fore of vlfs ohta et al 1999 pham et al 2008 takagi et al 2000 and semi rigid connections between vlfs modules riyansyah et al 2010 other more recent methods are the use of dual inclined perforated submerged plates cheng et al 2016 vertical mooring lines nguyen et al 2018 and vertical porous barriers singla et al 2018 motivated by the benefits of the integration between wecs and other purpose marine structures and the necessity to reduce hydroelastic response of vlfs tay 2019 recently proposed a raft wec type attachment for extracting wave energy while reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs this attachment consists of a single wide pontoon connected to the fore edge of vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto systems by using the same wave energy conversion concept ren et al 2019 studied the use of pto systems placed at the outermost hinge connection of multi purpose floating structures by adopting the modular concept for the owsc sarkar et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019a proposed a modular raft wec type attachment where the single wide pontoon of the raft wec type attachment tay 2019 is replaced by multiple independent narrow pontoons this replacement brings several advantages including i flexibility for downsizing expansion of the overall width of the attachment ii increasing reliability of the attachment as the system has higher redundancy iii lower costs for manufacturing and deployment owing to the modularity in design and iv more power produced in oblique wave conditions if the width of the whole device is comparable to the wavelength nguyen et al 2019a wilkinson et al 2017 however the effectiveness of the modular raft wec type attachment in extracting wave energy is rather limited for relatively long waves nguyen et al 2019b to overcome this limitation of the modular raft wec type attachment and motivated by the advantages of the owsc and the raft wec this study presents a novel two mode wec type attachment comprising floating horizontal plates and submerged vertical plates connected to the fore edge of vlfs with hinges and linear pto systems these auxiliary plates are of the same dimensions and are connected to different portions of the fore edge of vlfs this wec type attachment allows wave energy to be extracted by two different modes i e from using floating auxiliary plates and from using submerged vertical plates in this study the performance of the two mode wec type attachment is examined for various mode configurations which are specified by the numbers and locations of the floating horizontal auxiliary plates and the submerged vertical auxiliary plates here the performance of a wec type attachment is assessed via the power production reduction in hydroelastic response of vlfs and horizontal linear wave forces acting on submerged vertical plates which are then transmitted to the mooring system via the vlfs for the hydroelastic analysis vlfs is modelled as a plate wang and wang 2008 while the linear wave theory faltinsen 1990 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 is used for modelling fluid motions the hydroelastic analysis is performed in the frequency domain by using the finite element boundary element fe be method kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 2 problem definition assumptions and formulation 2 1 problem definition and assumptions consider a rectangular vlfs which is modelled as a floating rectangular plate with length l width b and thickness h as shown in fig 1 the plate has young s modulus e poisson s ratio ν and mass density ρ there are n p number of thin and rigid auxiliary plates connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges for convenience these plates are numbered from 1 to n p starting from the plate with the smallest y coordinate each auxiliary plate is either a floating horizontal plate or submerged vertical plate and has length l p width b p thickness h p and mass density ρ p1 for floating auxiliary plates or ρ p2 for submerged vertical plates note that b n p b p the gap between auxiliary plates and the fore edge of vlfs is denoted by s the zero gap between auxiliary plates is considered by referring to the studies on the modular owsc michele et al 2016 and on the venice storm gate adamo and mei 2005 it is assumed that the horizontal motions of the vlfs are completely constrained by the mooring dolphin rubber fender system for simplicity the draft of vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates are assumed to be zero gao et al 2011 power take off pto systems are installed in between auxiliary plates and the fore edge of vlfs see fig 1 the behaviour of pto systems is assumed to be linear and hence the ith pto system i 1 2 n p may be modelled as a rotational linear damper zheng et al 2015 with damping coefficient c pi in fig 1b the subscript j i and j 1 2 n p the vlfs with the two mode wec type attachment floats on an ideal fluid domain and is subjected to regular waves a regular wave is characterized by wave period t with the corresponding wavelength λ and wave amplitude a the wave amplitude is assumed to be small where the linear wave theory may be used for modelling fluid motions the head sea condition is considered the seabed is assumed to be flat and the water depth is denoted by h the mode configuration mc of a two mode wec type attachment may be represented by a string of letters involving h and v for example if mc vhv it means that the first and the third auxiliary plates are submerged vertical plates while the second auxiliary plate is a floating horizontal plate 2 2 equation of motion for vlfs with two mode wec type attachment similar to a conventional floating structure the displacement vector u n t of an arbitrary point within the vlfs with two mode wec type attachment consists of six components i e u n t u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t ψ 1 t ψ 2 t ψ 3 t t where u 1 t u 2 t and u 3 t are respectively the displacements along the x y and z axes and ψ 1 t ψ 2 t and ψ 3 t are respectively the rotations about the x y and z axes the subscript t denotes the transpose and t denotes the time in the frequency domain the displacement vector may be expressed as 1 u n t x y z t re u n x y z e i ω t where re implies the real part i 1 ω is the incident wave frequency u n u 1 u 2 u 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ 3 t is the vector of the frequency dependent complex amplitudes of displacements the fluid structure interaction analysis of vlfs with two mode wec type attachment in the frequency domain may be carried out by using the hybrid finite element higher order boundary element method kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 in this method the vlfs and the auxiliary plates are first discretised into elements each element has n e nodes and each node has six degrees of freedom that correspond to the six components of the nodal displacement vector this vector is given by u ˆ n u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 u ˆ 3 ψ ˆ 1 ψ ˆ 2 ψ ˆ 3 t where the ˆ sign above each variable indicates the nodal variable the vector u n of an arbitrary point in the structure may be approximated by the formula u n n e u ˆ e where n e is the matrix containing the interpolation function values of the eth element where the considered point is in and u ˆ e is the vector containing the vectors u ˆ n of all nodes of the eth element liu and quek 2003 by following the finite element procedure kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 the equation of motion for vlfs with two mode wec type attachment may be written in the following matrix form 2 ω 2 m m a ω i ω c p c d ω k k rf u ˆ f exc where m is the global mass matrix m a the global matrix of added mass k the global stiffness matrix k rf the global matrix of restoring stiffness which results from the action of the hydrostatic force and the gravitational force senjanović et al 2008 c p the global matrix of pto damping c d the global matrix of hydrodynamic damping f exc the global vector that consists of frequency dependent complex amplitudes of nodal excitation wave forces u ˆ the vector of the frequency dependent complex amplitudes of displacements of the structure the vector u ˆ comprises the vectors u ˆ n of all nodes of the discretised model the determination of the matrices m a c d and the vector f exc called hydrodynamic matrices vector may be done by using the boundary element method as given in sec 2 3 and in appendix a the matrices k and m may be obtained using the numerical procedures for shell elements fu et al 2007 liu and quek 2003 the hinge connections between the auxiliary plates and the vlfs are taken into account by modifying the stiffness matrix k using the penalty method liu and quek 2003 the constraints that the horizontal motions i e the motions along x and y axes as well as the rotation about z axis at any points within the vlfs are zero because of the presence of the mooring system may be imposed by using the same approach as for the hinge connections if the kth node and the lth node are connected via the ith pto system the non zero components of the matrix c p are nguyen et al 2019a zheng et al 2015 c p l 5 l 5 c p k 5 k 5 c pi c p l 5 k 5 c p k 5 l 5 c pi where the subscript 5 denotes the degree of freedom corresponding to the rotation about y axis a general calculation approach for k rf has been given by kim et al 2013 however because the drafts of vlfs and floating auxiliary plates are zero and the submerged vertical auxiliary plates are thin and rigid the restoring stiffness matrix may be calculated in a simpler manner in sum the restoring stiffness matrix k rf comprises the restoring stiffness matrix of the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates k rf h and that of the submerged vertical plates k rf v and given by 3 k rf k rf h 0 0 k rf v the restoring stiffness matrix of the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates k rf h may be calculated in the same manner as for the case where the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates resting on a winkler foundation with stiffness ρ w g where g is the gravitational acceleration and ρ w the water mass density wang and wang 2008 the restoring stiffness matrix of the submerged vertical plates may be obtained based on the following formulation of the frequency dependent complex amplitude f rf v of the restoring moment that acts on an arbitrary point within the submerged vertical plates 4 f rf v ρ p 2 ρ w g h p r p ψ 2 where r p is the vertical distance between the considered point within the submerged vertical plates to the hinge connection eq 4 indicates that the rotational restoring stiffness at an arbitrary point ρ p 2 ρ w g h p r p is only positive if the mass density of the submerged vertical plate is larger than the water mass density this condition is in contrast to the corresponding condition for the owsc this is because the rotational restoring stiffness at an arbitrary point within the submerged vertical flap of the owsc should be ρ w ρ p 2 g h p r p noad and porter 2015 which is only positive if the mass density of the submerged vertical plate is smaller than the water mass density in order to reduce the size of the system of linear equations in eq 2 so as to speed up the computation the modal expansion method kim et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019b is

φ t sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 in the frequency domain the velocity potential is given by 7 φ t x y z t re φ x y z e i ω t where φ x y z is time independent and is usually called the spatial velocity potential this spatial velocity potential must satisfy the following laplace equation faltinsen 1990 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 8 2 φ x y z 0 the boundary conditions are expressed as faltinsen 1990

appendix a 2 4 performance indices the performance of two mode wec type attachment is assessed by the power capture factor as well as the hydroelastic response reduction in addition as the two mode wec type attachment consists of several submerged vertical plates the horizontal wave force acting on these submerged plates is much larger than that acting on the floating horizontal auxiliary plates which have a shallow draft assumed to be zero in this study for simplicity thus the total horizontal linear wave force acting on the submerged vertical plates is also considered in the performance assessment of the two mode wec type attachment the power capture factor is the ratio between the total power produced p av and the incident wave power p in and is written as 19 cf p av p in the determination of the power produced p av may be done using the following formula zheng et al 2015 20 p av 1 2 ω 2 i 1 n p c p i δ ψ 2 i 2 where δ ψ 2 i is the amplitude of the relative rotation about the y axis between the two nodes that are connected to each other via the ith pto system the power of incident wave p in is defined as falnes 2002 21 p in 1 4 ρ w g a 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h b the hydroelastic response reduction hr may be defined as the reduction in the amplitude of the maximum vertical displacement over the entire vlfs as follows 22 hr 1 u 3 max u 3 0 max where u 3 0 max is the maximum vertical displacement amplitude of the vlfs without the two mode wec type attachment and u 3 max the maximum vertical displacement amplitude of the vlfs with the attachment the frequency dependent complex amplitude of the total horizontal wave force acting on submerged vertical plates is given by 23 f x i ω ρ w s v φ d s v s v φ d s v where s v indicates the right wetted surface perpendicular to ox of the submerged vertical plates and s v indicates the left wetted surface of the submerged vertical plates 3 verification because numerical experimental results of vlfs with two mode wec type attachment are currently not available the present formulation and computer code are verified for two related problems including i vlfs without the wec type attachment and ii owsc comprising a submerged vertical plate connected to a base structure fixed at the seabed for the first problem the input for verification is given in table 1 fig 2 shows that the numerical results obtained by using the present formulation and computer code agree very well with the published numerical results i e ref num fu et al 2007 as well as the published experimental results i e ref exp yago and endo 1996 note that for vlfs consisting of two interconnected modules the numerical results obtained by using the present formulation and computer code also agree very well with the published numerical results fu et al 2007 as presented in our previous study nguyen et al 2019a for the second problem the present numerical results are first compared with the published numerical results yu et al 2016 for the owsc defined in fig 3 a the mass density of the submerged plate is 300 kg m3 the present numerical results are also compared with the experimental results given by henry 2008 for the owsc defined in fig 4 a the oscillating submerged plate of owsc in fig 4a is not connected directly to the seabed with a hinge like so of owsc in fig 3a but it is connected to a base structure fixed at the seabed and the hinge connection between the base structure and the oscillating plate is located at 1 5 m above the seabed the comparison with experimental results is only carried out for the excitation wave torque m exc acting on the oscillating submerged plate because of its availability henry 2008 as the excitation wave torque is independent with respect to the material properties of the submerged plate as well as the properties of pto system these parameters are not specified although the experiment was carried out in a wave flume the measured excitation wave torque may still be used for comparison with the numerically estimated excitation torque in an open sea which is considered in the present formulation this is because the width of the wave flume is about 5 times larger than the width of the scaled model henry 2008 which may make the measured excitation wave torque negligibly affected by the wave flume walls chakrabarti 1999 figs 3b and 4b show that the present numerical results show a very good agreement with published numerical experimental results for all considered cases thereby confirming the validity and accuracy of the present formulation and computer code 4 performance of two mode wec type attachment the vlfs with physical and geometric parameters given in table 1 which was used in previous research studies fu et al 2007 nguyen et al 2019a yago and endo 1996 is again adopted for numerical studies in this section the number of auxiliary plates and their dimensions are selected as in table 2 by referring to the designs of langlee wec and the oyster wec babarit et al 2012 the auxiliary plate thickness is 1 m which is relatively similar to the thickness of the owscs in sec 3 the mass density of floating auxiliary plates and that of submerged vertical plates are chosen as in table 2 the gap between the auxiliary plates and the fore edge of vlfs is 1 m liu et al 2017 yu et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 with regard to properties of sea sites the water depth h 20 m and wave period t ranging from 4 s to 16 s are considered as cf and hr are independent on the wave amplitude a the wave amplitude a is not specified for numerical studies however the wave amplitude a needs to be small to ensure that the adopted linear wave theory is valid for simplicity the mode configuration of the attachment is assumed to be symmetrical with respect to ox the performance of two mode wec type attachment is assessed for all 8 possible mode configurations including 1 hhhhhh or only the first three letters hhh for brevity because of the symmetry 2 vvv 3 hvv 4 vhh 5 vhv 6 hvh 7 hhv 8 vvh the pto damping coefficients are optimally selected within 1e4 1e8 nms rad for maximizing either cf or hr for each wave period and each mode configuration in sections 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 the objective function is maximizing cf whereas in sections 4 4 and 4 5 the objective function is either maximizing hr or maximizing cf the upper bound of pto damping coefficients is set to 1e8 nms rad by referring to the design of oyster wec babarit et al 2012 unless specified hereafter the pto damping coefficient of each pto system is considered as an independent design variable this unequal pto damping strategy was adopted for the modular owsc sarkar et al 2016 the mathematical statement of the optimization problem is given in appendix b the optimization process to obtain the optimal pto damping coefficients is based on differential evolution de price et al 2005 de generally outperforms the genetic algorithms gas which have been used in optimization studies of wec and vlfs gao et al 2013 michailides and angelides 2015 with respect to the convergence rate and the quality of the optimal solution hegerty et al 2009 de has recently been used for research studies on vlfs and wec nguyen et al 2019b 2018 the details of the optimization process based on de may be found in appendix b 4 1 power production fig 5 shows the variations of the power capture factor and the corresponding power produced with respect to wave period for all 8 mode configurations of the two mode wec type attachment the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing cf are given in fig 6 fig 5 shows that for mc hhh cf is largest when t 4 s and then it decreases with respect to wave period the largest cf is observed for t 4 s because for this wave period the ratio between the length of the auxiliary plates and the wavelength is close to 1 3 which is the ideal ratio for using floating auxiliary plates in wave energy extraction nguyen et al 2019a the corresponding ideal ratio for the raft wec is about 1 2 zheng et al 2015 for mc vvv fig 5 shows that cf first increases with respect to wave period and reaches its maximum value at a certain wave period t 7 s thereafter cf decreases with increasing wave period this variation for mc vvv is relatively similar to the corresponding variation for the owsc renzi and dias 2013 fig 5 shows that among the 8 mode configurations preferable mode configurations for wave energy extraction are changed significantly for three different ranges of wave periods which are indicated by the three different shaded areas for t 5 s a mode configuration with a larger number of floating horizontal auxiliary plates shows larger power production this means that the use of the floating auxiliary plates is preferable to submerged vertical plates this may be because in this wave condition the ratio between the length of the auxiliary plates and the wavelength is close to the ideal ratio i e 1 3 for extracting wave energy using floating auxiliary plates note that the corresponding ideal ratio for the use of the submerged vertical plates is smaller about 0 12 based on the data in fig 5 for mc vvv because cf is largest when t 7 s or when λ 72 m for t 7 s a mode configuration with a larger number of submerged vertical plates yields larger power production the use of the submerged vertical plates is preferable because for this wave condition the ratio between the length of auxiliary plates and the wavelength is closer to the ideal ratio for submerged vertical plates than that for floating auxiliary plates because the former ideal ratio is smaller than the latter one for 5 s t 7 s preferable mode configurations for extracting wave energy are generally changed from mode configurations having a larger number of floating auxiliary plates to mode configurations having a larger number of submerged vertical plates as the wave period increases from 5 s to 7 s interestingly in this wave condition power production for mode configurations with both submerged vertical plates and floating auxiliary plates may be larger than that for the hhh and vvv mode configurations this observation implies that the interaction between submerged vertical plates and floating auxiliary plates of the two mode wec type attachment may result in enhancing the power production of the attachment thus for this wave condition the use of the two mode wec type attachment consisting of both floating and submerged vertical plates may be preferable to the use of the attachment comprising solely floating auxiliary plates or solely submerged vertical plates fig 7 shows the variations of cf i i 1 2 3 with respect to the wave period for mc hhh vvv here cf i is the power capture factor associated with the ith auxiliary plate and is defined as cf i p av i p in n p where p av i is the power produced by the ith pto system see eq 20 fig 7a shows that the power capture factors associated with different auxiliary plates in hhh configuration are almost the same for all wave periods considered this observation is expected because wave forces acting on different floating auxiliary plates should be almost the same for the head sea condition fig 7b shows that the power capture factor associated with an auxiliary plate cf i in vvv configuration is generally lowest for the outermost plate 1st plate and highest for the central plate 3rd plate in other words cf i increases as one moves from the edge plate to the central plate this variation is expected because the wave force acting on a submerged plate is generally minimum for the outermost submerged plate and maximum for the central plate sarkar et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2017 fig 8 shows the variations of cf i i 1 2 3 with respect to the wave period for mc hvv vhh vhv hvh hhv vvh among the mode configurations with the same number of submerged plates a mode configuration allowing a larger number of submerged plates placed next to one another generally shows a higher power capture factor associated with submerged plates for example among the three mode configurations hvv vhv vvh the power capture factors associated with submerged plates are generally highest for mc hvv and smallest for mc vhv this observation may be explained by the fact that when submerged plates are placed next to one another the difference in water pressures acting on the two surfaces of submerged plates should be not zero along the edges adjacent to those of other submerged plates hence by placing a larger number of submerged vertical plates next to one another the wave force acting on submerged plates should increase see sec 4 3 thereby leading to an increased power capture factor from the submerged plates this arrangement of submerged plates next to one another also produces higher power capture factor cf for intermediate and long waves t 7 s as evident in fig 5 fig 8 shows that the power capture factors associated with horizontal plates for mc hvv vhh vhv hvh hhv vvh are higher than those for mc hhh for most wave periods t 5 s thus it is beneficial to have some submerged vertical plates to improve the power capture factors associated with horizontal plates this finding agrees with that for wecs with three hinged bodies yu et al 2016 the improvement in the power capture factors associated with horizontal plates may be due to the interference between the incident wave and the reflected wave from submerged vertical plates that increases the vertical displacements of horizontal plates the increase in vertical displacements of horizontal plates due to the presence of submerged vertical plates can be seen in fig 9 by comparing the vertical displacement amplitude of the second auxiliary plate for mc hhh with that for other mode configurations 4 2 hydroelastic response reduction fig 10 shows the variations of the hydroelastic response reduction with respect to wave period for all 8 mode configurations of the two mode wec type attachment fig 10 shows that for all mode configurations the hydroelastic response reduction is largest when t 4 s and it decreases as the wave period increases as expected fig 10 shows that similar to preferable mode configurations for wave energy extraction preferable mode configurations for hydroelastic response mitigation are changed considerably for three different ranges of wave periods which are indicated by the three different shaded areas in fig 10 interestingly these three shaded areas are in reverse order as compared to those in fig 5 for t 7 s fig 10 shows that a mode configuration with a larger number of submerged vertical plates generally shows larger hr this result may also be seen in fig 11 which shows the hydroelastic response of the vlfs without the attachment and with the attachment for several mode configurations for t 5 s the use of submerged vertical plates for reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs is preferable because for this wave condition the length of the submerged vertical plates is relatively close to the depth of the region where the water particle motion is non zero or where the hydrodynamic pressure is non zero this depth is about λ 2 for the short wave condition which corresponds to the deep sea condition dean and dalrymple 1991 thus a large portion of incident wave should be reflected from the submerged vertical plates resulting in decreasing significantly the amount of incident wave energy absorbed by the vlfs and hence reducing considerably the hydroelastic response of the vlfs for t 9 s a mode configuration with a larger number of floating auxiliary plates shows larger hr see fig 10 this observation may also be seen in fig 12 which shows the hydroelastic response of the vlfs without the attachment and with the attachment for several mode configurations for t 10 s this observation implies that the use of submerged vertical plates is not preferable for reducing hydroelastic response of the vlfs under action of long waves this finding agrees with the finding for a submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore edge of a vlfs masanobu et al 2003 ohta et al 1999 where the submerged vertical plate was claimed to be not effective in reducing the hydroelastic response of the vlfs for long waves for very long waves t 13 s it was also claimed that the use of the submerged vertical plate may result in increasing the hydroelastic response of the vlfs ohta et al 1999 for 7 s t 9 s preferable mode configurations for hydroelastic response mitigation are generally changed from mode configurations having a larger number of submerged vertical plates to mode configurations having a larger number of floating auxiliary plates as the wave period increases from 7 s to 9 s in this wave condition the worst mode configuration for hydroelastic response mitigation is not necessarily hhh or vvv but it may be another mode configuration this indicates that the interaction between the submerged vertical plates and the floating auxiliary plates may result in decreasing the hydroelastic response reduction 4 3 horizontal wave force acting on submerged vertical plates fig 13 a shows the variations of the amplitude of the total horizontal linear wave force acting on submerged vertical plates with respect to wave period for several mode configurations fig 13b shows the variations of the horizontal force reduction fr with respect to wave period here fr 1 f x i f x 0 where f x 0 is the amplitude of the horizontal force for the vvv or 2nd mode configuration and f x i is the amplitude of the horizontal force for the ith mode configuration i 3 4 8 fig 13 shows that the wave force decreases as the number of submerged vertical plates decreases the horizontal force reduction for the mode configurations hvv vhv and vvh is about 30 60 this figure is about 65 85 for the mode configurations vhh hvh hhv fig 13 also shows that among mode configurations with the same number of submerged vertical plates a mode configuration allowing a larger number of the submerged vertical plates placed next to one another generally shows a larger horizontal wave force for example the horizontal wave force for hvv is larger than that for vvh because the arrangement of the six auxiliary plates for hvv is hvvvvh and that for vvh is vvhhvv similarly it may be seen that the horizontal wave force for vvh is larger than that for vhv 4 4 wave energy generation versus hydroelastic response mitigation fig 14 shows the variations of cf and hr with respect to wave period for the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing hr the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing hr are given in fig 15 in general fig 14 shows that both the variations of cf and hr with respect to wave period for various mode configurations are rather similar to the corresponding variations for the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing cf thus the findings in sec 4 1 and sec 4 2 are generally still valid for the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing hr fig 16 shows the variations of δcf and δhr with respect to wave period here δcf cf 2 cf 1 and δhr hr 2 hr 1 where the superscript 1 indicates the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing cf and the superscript 2 indicates the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing hr fig 16 shows that for mc hhh both δcf and δhr are small about 0 025 for all wave periods this indicates that for mc hhh if pto damping coefficients are designed for maximizing cf or hr the resulting hr or cf obtained is almost equal to its maximum attainable value this finding agrees with that given by nguyen et al 2019b for mc vvv the absolute values of δcf and δhr are large up to about 0 15 when t 7 s for longer waves δcf and δhr are small about 0 025 this finding implies that for mc vvv if pto damping coefficients are designed for maximizing only cf or hr the resulting hr or cf is generally much smaller than its maximum attainable value for t 7 s but the resulting hr or cf is almost equal to its maximum attainable value for longer waves the large absolute values of δcf and δhr for short waves and the small absolute values for longer waves for mc vvv may be explained by the power produced and the amount of incident wave reflected from the submerged vertical plates for these two different wave conditions in detail the incident wave energy is mainly transformed into i the energy of the reflected wave from the submerged vertical plates ii the useable energy and iii the energy restored in the motions of the vlfs and the submerged vertical plates thus in general if a larger amount of power is produced or a larger amount of incident wave is reflected hr should be larger for relatively short wave conditions t 7 s because a large portion of incident wave should be reflected and the amount of power produced is not large as discussed in sec 4 1 and sec 4 2 hr may be mainly dependent on the amount of incident waves reflected as the amount of reflected wave may increase by limiting the motion of the submerged vertical plates hr may increase by generally increasing the pto damping coefficients this makes the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing hr large as compared to the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing cf see figs 6 and 15 for t 7 s and mc vvv however for longer waves t 7 s because the amount of reflected wave should be smaller than that for short waves and the amount of power produced is generally larger than that for short waves hr may mainly depend on the amount power produced thus for this wave condition increasing the power produced generally results in increasing hr this makes the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing hr close to and not necessarily larger than those for maximizing cf see figs 6 and 15 for t 7 s and mc vvv for other mode configurations fig 16 shows that the variations of δcf and δhr are quite similar to those for mc vvv however the absolute values of δcf and δhr may be larger than those for mc vvv which may result from the interaction between submerged vertical plates and floating auxiliary plates 4 5 unequal damping strategy versus equal damping strategy fig 17 shows the variations of cf 1 unequal cf 1 equal and hr 1 unequal hr 1 equal with respect to the wave period for various mode configurations while fig 18 shows the variations of cf 2 unequal cf 2 equal and hr 2 unequal hr 2 equal here the superscript 1 indicates the case where the objective is to maximize cf while the superscript 2 denotes the case where the objective is to maximize hr the subscripts unequal and equal denote the corresponding pto damping strategies for the case where the equal pto damping strategy is adopted i e damping coefficients are the same for all pto systems the optimal pto damping coefficients for various wave periods and mode configurations are given in fig 19 for mc hhh vvv figs 17 and 18 show that both cf and hr are almost insensitive to pto damping strategy this is expected because all auxiliary plates for mc hhh or mc vvv have the same dimensions and the same operation mode the insensitivity of cf and hr to pto damping strategy implies that the equal pto damping strategy should be adopted for these mode configurations to facilitate selection and control of pto systems but without compromising cf and hr for other mode configurations figs 17 and 18 show that the effects of pto damping strategy on cf and hr appear to be not significant except for a special case where the objective is to maximize hr and for short waves t 6 s for this special case see fig 18 for t 6 s by altering the pto damping strategy from the unequal damping strategy to the equal damping strategy hr decreases by up to about 0 14 thus while the equal damping strategy can be adopted to facilitate selection and control of pto system the maximum attainable hydroelastic response reduction may be comprised considerably note that for the special case where the objective is to maximize hr and for short waves t 6 s if the unequal pto damping strategy is adopted the optimal pto damping coefficients for submerged plates are much larger than those for horizontal plates e g see fig 15 for mc hvh 5 conclusions and recommendations for future studies presented herein is a two mode wave energy converter wec type attachment to pontoon type vlfs for wave energy extraction and reduction in hydroelastic response the two mode wec type attachment comprises floating horizontal auxiliary plates and submerged vertical auxiliary plates connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges and linear pto systems the following key findings may be drawn from this study i a two mode wec type attachment with a larger number of floating auxiliary plates and hence a smaller number of submerged vertical plates generally shows larger power production for short waves t 5 s but smaller power production for intermediate and long waves t 7 s thus while the use of floating auxiliary plates for wave energy extraction is preferable in short waves the use of submerged vertical plates is preferable in intermediate and long waves ii a two mode wec type attachment with a larger number of submerged vertical plates and hence a smaller number of floating auxiliary plates yields larger hydroelastic response reduction in relatively short waves t 7 s but smaller hydroelastic response reduction in relatively long waves t 9 s thus while the use of submerged vertical plates is preferable for hydroelastic response mitigation in relatively short waves the use of floating auxiliary plates is preferable in relatively long waves iii for intermediate and long waves t 7 s when pto damping coefficients are designed for maximum cf or hr the resulting hr or cf is also almost maximized in the case of short waves the same finding is observed for the wec type attachment with solely floating horizontal plates however if submerged vertical plates are introduced designing pto damping coefficients for maximizing cf or hr poses a problem that the resulting hr or cf is generally much smaller than its maximum attainable value iv among mode configurations with the same number of submerged vertical plates a mode configuration involving a larger number of submerged vertical plates placed next to one another results in a larger horizontal force as compared to the wec type attachment comprising either solely submerged vertical plates or solely floating horizontal plates the two mode wec attachment possesses several positive features including i good wave energy extraction performance for a wide range of wave periods owing to the combination of the superior performance of floating horizontal plates in extracting wave energy for short waves and the superior performance of submerged vertical plates in extracting wave energy for intermediate and long waves ii good hydroelastic response mitigation performance for a wide range of wave periods owing to the combination of the superior performance of submerged vertical plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively short waves and the superior performance of floating horizontal plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively long waves iii higher cf for ocean waves with 5 s t 7 s owing to the interaction between the vertical plates the horizontal plates iv better balance between extracting wave energy and reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs for the same wave period where although cf or hr for a certain wave period is smaller than its maximum attainable value the resulting hr or cf for the same wave period is closer to its maximum attainable value v smaller horizontal wave force acting on submerged vertical plates and therefore on the mooring system as compared to the vvv mode configuration this study shows that the mode configuration may be tuned to the incident wave period for maximum wave energy production or hydroelastic response reduction and for reducing horizontal wave forces acting on submerged vertical plates and hence a reduced horizontal force on the mooring system in fact a floating plate may be submerged by increasing the mass density of the plate e g filling its compartments with water in addition a submerged vertical plate may become a floating auxiliary plate by ballasting however if the mode configuration is allowed to be tuned to the incident wave period a more detailed design of pto systems is necessary some recommendations for future studies are given below i the present study is based on the linear wave theory where the wave amplitude is small for strong waves where nonlinearity is important cfd computational fluid dynamics analyses and physical model tests should be carried out ii hydroelastic analysis and optimization of vlfs with two mode wec type attachment are usually time consuming because of the vlfs large dimensions this problem becomes more serious when the number of design variables or the number of objective functions increases in order to speed up the hydroelastic analysis and optimization future research studies should focus on using faster optimization techniques such as parallel differential evolution pedroso et al 2017 and using faster evaluation methods for the matrices that are related to the green function such as the fast multipole method utsunomiya and watanabe 2006 or the pre corrected fft method jiang et al 2012 iii the behaviour of pto systems is assumed to be linear in this study this assumption has been widely adopted when analysing conceptual designs of wecs renzi and dias 2013 yu et al 2016 however the actual behaviour of pto systems may be nonlinear liu et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 thus the nonlinearity of pto systems should be considered in future studies for more accurate estimation of power production iv this study focuses on estimating power production however to evaluate wec designs a number of other indirect techno economic indices babarit et al 2012 are needed thus techno economic assessments for the two mode wec attachment should be carried out in future studies author contributions conceptualization h p n c m w and v h l methodology h p n

test function φ x to both sides of eq 16 and then integrate the both sides over the entire wetted surface s hb as follows kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 a 1 α s hb φ x φ x d x s hb φ in x φ x d x s hb s hb g x ξ n ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u j ξ n j ξ d ξ φ x d x because the submerged vertical plates are assumed to be thin the wetted surfaces of each submerged plate that are perpendicular to oy and oz may be neglected in the numerical model and only the wetted surfaces that are perpendicular to ox are considered because of this simplification an artificial continuity condition is imposed along the submerged edges of the considered wetted surfaces to ensure that the difference in the velocity potential between these surfaces are zero along the submerged edges this artificial continuity condition has been used for fluid structure interaction analysis of submerged thin plates noad and porter 2015 renzi and dias 2013 the wetted surface of the entire structure s hb may be decomposed into three component surfaces including i s h that is the wetted surface of the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates ii s v that is the right wetted surface perpendicular to ox of the submerged vertical plates iii s v that is the left wetted surface of the submerged vertical plates following the boundary element procedure these wetted surfaces are discretised into elements that possess the same properties i e the interpolation functions and the number of nodes in each element of the elements used for the fem formulation in sec 2 2 however different from the nodes in the fem formulation each node in the bem formulation has only one degree of freedom that corresponds to the nodal spatial velocity potential φ ˆ the spatial velocity potential of an arbitrary point may be approximated from the nodal spatial velocity potentials by using the formula φ n e φ ˆ e where the subscript e denotes the element where the considered point is in φ ˆ e is the vector containing the nodal spatial velocity potentials of the element and is obtained by assembling the vectors φ ˆ of all nodes of the element n e the vector containing the interpolation function values liu and quek 2003 note that while the size of the vector n e is 1 n e the size of the vector n e in sec 2 2 is 1 6n e we first consider the case where the source point is in s h i e x s h eq a 1 may be rewritten as a 2 s h φ x φ x d x s h

green function with respect to x is given by a 3 g x ξ x ξ m 0 k 1 k m r π h 1 sin 2 k m h 2 k m h cos k m z h cos k m ζ h k m x ξ r where k 1 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order one eq a 2 may be transformed in a matrix form as follows a 4 φ h k i 1 φ ˆ h φ h k i 1 φ ˆ in h ω 2 g φ h g 1 φ ˆ h i ω φ h g 1 u ˆ 3 h φ h g x 1 φ ˆ v i ω φ h g 2 u ˆ 1 v φ h g x 2 φ ˆ v i ω φ h g 3 u ˆ 1 v where each term in eq a 4 is the matrix form of the corresponding term in eq a 2 the superscript h denotes that the vectors are for s h the subscript v implies that the vectors are for s v the subscript v indicates that the vectors are for s v the matrices g 1 g 2 and g 3 are related to the green function the matrices g x1 g x2 are related to the first derivative of the green function with respect to x by eliminating φ h from all terms of eq a 2 and by setting u ˆ 1 v u ˆ 1 v u ˆ 1 v eq a 4 becomes a 5 k i 1 φ ˆ h k i 1 φ ˆ in h ω 2 g g 1 φ ˆ h i ω g 1 u ˆ 3 h g x 1 φ ˆ v i ω g 2 u

6 note that the matrix 0 before φ ˆ v indicates the fact that for the case where both the source and the field points are in s v the first derivative of the green function eq a 3 is zero next we consider the case where x s v eq a 2 may be rewritten as a 8 s v 1 2 φ x φ x d x s v φ in x φ x d x s v s h ω 2 g g x ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u 3 ξ d ξ φ x d x s v s v g x ξ x ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u 1 ξ d ξ φ x d

where each term in eq a 9 is the matrix form after eliminating φ v of the corresponding term in eq a 8 the matrix 0 before φ ˆ v results from the fact that the first derivative of the green function eq a 3 is zero when both the source and the field points are in s v from eqs a 5 a 7 and a 9 we obtain the following system of equations a 10 k i 1 ω 2 g g 1 g x 1 g x 2 ω 2 g g 4 1 2 k i 2 g x 3 ω 2

rewritten as a 11 e φ ˆ h φ ˆ v φ ˆ v f φ ˆ in h φ ˆ in v φ ˆ in v i ω h u ˆ 3 h u ˆ 1 v u ˆ 1 v where the matrices e f and h represents the corresponding matrices in eq a 10 similar to the continuity conditions for the hinge connections between the vlfs and the auxiliary plates the artificial continuity condition for the velocity potential along the submerged edges of the submerged vertical plates can be imposed in the numerical model by using the penalty method liu and quek 2003 for the matrix e in eq a 11 after applying the boundary element procedure to transform eq 16 into eq a 11 we now discuss the calculation of the vector of frequency dependent complex amplitudes of nodal hydrodynamic force p g in eq 18 this vector is related to the nodal velocity potential vector as follows a 12 p g i ω ρ w t g k i 1 0 0 0 k i 2 k i 2 φ ˆ h φ ˆ v φ ˆ v where t g is the transformation matrix that is used to transform the vector for nodal hydrodynamic forces in the bem formulation into the corresponding vector for nodal hydrodynamic forces in the fem formulation this transformation process is required because while each node in the bem formulation has only one degree of freedom that in the fem formulation has six degrees of freedom as discussed earlier the size of the matrix t g is 6n n n n where is n n the number of nodes of the entire discretised fem model the component vector of the matrix t g for each node is 0 0 1 0 0 0 t if the node is within the vlfs or the floating auxiliary plates and is 1 0 0 0 0 0 t if the node is within the submerged vertical plates eq a 12 may also be expressed as a 13 p g i ω ρ w t g l φ ˆ h φ ˆ v φ ˆ v where the matrix l in eq a 13 represents the corresponding matrix in eq a 12 by substituting the vector for nodal velocity potential from eq a 11 into eq a 13 we obtain the following equation a 14 p g i ω ρ w t g l e 1 f φ ˆ in h φ ˆ in v φ ˆ in v ω 2 ρ w t g l e 1 h t v u ˆ 3 h u ˆ 1 v where t v is the transformation matrix given by a 15 t v i 1 0 0 i 2 0 i 2 where i 1 i 2 are the identity matrices and their sizes are equal to the sizes of k i1 and k i2 respectively by expressing the vector u ˆ 3 h u ˆ 1 v t in eq a 14 in terms of the global vector u ˆ eq a 14 becomes a 16 p g i ω ρ w t g l e 1 f φ ˆ in ω 2 ρ w t g l e 1 h t v t g t u ˆ from eq a 16 and eq 18 the matrices m a c d and f exc may be obtained as follows a 17 m a ρ w re t g l e 1 h t v t g t a 18 c d ω ρ w im t g l e 1 h t v t g t a 19 f exc i ω ρ w t g l e 1 f φ ˆ in where im indicates the imaginary part appendix b optimization of pto damping coefficients the optimization problem is defined as follows b 1 maximize f x b 2 subject to c pi c p l c p u where f x may be either cf x or hr x as discussed in sec 4 x c p1 c p2 c p n p the vector of pto damping coefficients of n p numbers of pto systems c p l the lower bound of pto damping coefficients in the search space and c p u the upper bound of pto damping coefficients in the search space the search space for pto damping coefficients is 1e4 1e8 nms rad c pi i 1 2 n p are considered as continuous design variables the optimization process is presented in fig b1 the optimization process starts with the generation of np numbers of initial solutions x j 0 c p1 j 0 c p2 j 0 c p n p j 0 where the subscript 0 denotes the initial generation and j 1 2 np np must be at least 4 to have enough vectors for the mutation phase see eq b 4 and np needs to be sufficiently large to avoid premature convergence price et al 2005 in this study np is set to a large value np 10n p storn and price 1997 each component c pi j 0 i 1 2 n p of the vector x j 0 is created as follows price et al 2005 b 3 c p i j 0 c p l rand i 0 1 c p u c p l where rand i 0 1 is a number randomly generated within the range 0 1 after generating the initial solutions the mutation phase is employed to generate np numbers of mutant vectors v j g where the subscript g denotes the current generation as follows price et al 2005 b 4 v j g x r 1 g f m x r 2 g x r 3 g where f m is called a scale factor which is a positive real number and is usually not greater than 1 r1 r2 r3 are randomly selected from 1 2 np and r1 r2 r3 j in the crossover phase the vector v j g and the vector x j g are used to create a trial vector u j g the ith component u i j g of the vector u j g is created as follows price et al 2005 b 5 u i j g v i j g if rand i 0 1 c r or i i rand c p i j g otherwise where v i j g is the ith component of the vector v j g c p i j g is the ith component of the vector x j g cr 0 1 is the crossover control value i rand is a random index within 1 to n p in the selection phase each vector x j g 1 for the next generation is selected within the vectors u j g and x j g based on the objective function value as follows price et al 2005 b 6 x j g 1 u j g if f u j g f x j g x j g otherwise if the following stopping condition is satisfied the optimization process is terminated and the optimal solution is found price et al 2005 b 7 f worst f best 1 t o l e r where toler is a user defined value and is set to 10 5 in the present study f worst and f best are respectively the smallest and the largest objective function values over the objective function values for np numbers of possible solutions x j g 1 if the stopping condition is not satisfied the mutation crossover and selection phases are employed again the selection phase requires the evaluation of the objective function this evaluation may be done by using directly the input and the numerical analysis framework that is based on the numerical formulation given in sec 2 however this direct evaluation approach is time consuming nguyen et al 2019b to speed up the computation a two step procedure is proposed to evaluate the objective function as shown in fig b 1 in the first step the matrices m m a c d k k rf f exc and s are precalculated using the numerical analysis framework in the second step these matrices and the matrix c p that is created based on the pto damping coefficients of a possible solution are used to calculate cf or hr the two step procedure is adopted for evaluating the objective functions because all the matrices m m a c d k k rf f exc and s are insensitive to c pi and hence should be predetermined to avoid unnecessary repeated calculation for every generations in differential evolution this two step procedure for evaluating the objective function has also been used for other optimization studies on vlfs and wec nguyen et al 2019b 2018 the set f m cr that provides the most satisfactory optimization performance for a given input can be obtained by performing optimization studies for all possible sets f m cr however this approach is time consuming because it requires a large number of analyses ho huu et al 2016 effective techniques for selection of f m cr are being investigated ho huu et al 2016 wang et al 2011 in this study for simplicity f m and cr are selected within the ranges of f m and cr used in previous studies where f m is within 0 4 1 ho huu et al 2016 wang et al 2011 and cr is close to 1 wang et al 2011 or is within 0 7 1 ho huu et al 2016 based on these recommended ranges f m and cr are set to 0 8 and 0 9 respectively the accuracy of the optimal solution obtained by using de is verified by comparing with the optimal solution obtained by performing a lot of parametric studies this optimization approach is called conventional optimization approach the verification is carried out for 208 cases for 13 wave periods t 4 5 16 s 8 mode configurations and 2 objective functions for the conventional optimization approach c pi where i 1 2 3 are selected within a set of 37 discrete values 1e4 2e4 3e4 1e5 2e5 3e5 1e8 nms rad thus for each wave period and mode configuration the optimal solution is obtained from the results of 37 np analyses i e 373 or 50653 analyses because n p 3 due to the symmetry of the mode configuration for all examined cases the optimal pto damping coefficients obtained from the conventional optimization approach are almost the same as those obtained from de approach given in figs 6 and 15 the differences in the objective function values obtained by using the two optimization approaches are negligible for reference the details of the comparison between the two optimization approaches for mc vvv hvv and t 7 10 s are presented in tables b 1 and b 2 as compared with the number of analyses na required for the conventional optimization approach na required for de is much smaller thus de approach is superior to the conventional optimization approach here na np g total 1 where g total is the total number of generations required to obtain the optimal solution pedroso et al 2017 the computational time required for optimization t opt is also provided in tables b1 and b2 the high performance computing hpc system with 20 processors at the university of queensland is used the computational time t opt that is underlined in table b1 is obtained when a desktop computer 64 bit operating system 16 gb ram intel core i7 7700 cpu 3 6 ghz is used for each mode configuration and wave period t opt is generally not linearly proportional to na this may be because different jobs i e matlab codes submitted to the hpc system may be assigned to different computer nodes within the hpc system in addition the use of the requested multiple processors is not controlled by users and may be not the same for different runs note that t opt shown in tables b1 and b 2 does not include the computational time required to obtain the precalculated matrices m m a c d k k rf f exc s which ranges from 2 to 4 h by using the hpc system with 8 processors 
22138,proposed herein is a two mode wave energy converter type attachment to the fore edge of pontoon type very large floating structures vlfss for wave energy extraction and reduction of hydroelastic response this attachment consists of floating horizontal and submerged vertical plates that are connected to the vlfs with hinges and linear power take off systems the use of both floating horizontal and submerged vertical plates combines the superior performances of floating plates in extracting wave energy from short waves t 5 s and of submerged vertical plates in extracting wave energy from intermediate and long waves t 7 s when deployed in sites where 5 s t 7 s the two mode attachment yields a larger power production than the sole usage of floating plates or the sole usage of submerged vertical plates interestingly the two mode attachment also combines the superior performance of submerged vertical plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively short waves t 7 s and the superior performance of floating plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively long waves t 9 s moreover this two mode attachment furnishes a good balance between extracting wave energy and reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs for the same wave period keywords very large floating structure hydroelastic response raft wave energy converter oscillating wave surge converter 1 introduction since wave energy converters wecs were first studied by yoshio masuda in 1940s many techniques for extracting wave energy have been proposed and by 1980 more than 1000 wec related patents had been filed falcão 2010 nowadays although the number of available techniques for extracting wave energy remains large only a few of them have been adopted for wave energy projects that include model tests in real sea conditions according to csiro 2012 only about six wecs had been tested in real sea conditions among these wecs the pelamis and oyster wecs have received a great worldwide attention from engineers and scientists whittaker and folley 2012 yemm et al 2012 the pelamis wec which may be also called a raft wec haren and mei 1979 consists of pontoons connected to one another with hinges and power take off pto systems the oyster wec which may be also called the oscillating wave surge converter owsc whittaker and folley 2012 comprises a submerged vertical plate connected to a base structure at the seabed with a hinge and pto system the main advantage of the raft wec lies in the high wave energy conversion efficiency when compared to other wec concepts yemm et al 2012 on the other hand the main advantage of the owsc is its wide efficiency bandwidth flocard and finnigan 2010 and hence it may be effectively used for extracting wave energy for a wide range of wave conditions which includes a relatively long wave condition although a great deal of effort has been invested in the development of wecs for the last few decades wec technology remains at an early implementation stage as compared to other renewable energy technologies as well as the conventional energy technologies such as coal and fossil fuel energy technologies falcão 2010 mustapa et al 2017 this makes the electricity generated from ocean waves currently much more expensive than the electricity generated from other sources of energy irena 2014 one possible way to reduce the cost of wave power is to improve the power capture factor by innovative designs of wave energy converters another promising way is to reduce costs for installation mooring foundation operation and maintenance according to the international renewable energy agency report irena 2014 these costs may account for about 41 of wave energy project life cost these costs may be reduced through cost sharing between wecs and other purpose marine structures when integrated irena 2014 mustapa et al 2017 other potential benefits of integration of wecs with other purpose marine structures include i limiting the negative environmental impact irena 2014 ii reducing hydrodynamic motions of marine structures under wave actions as wecs are wave energy absorbers iii improving the ability of marine structures in breaking waves if the marine structures are partly fully functioned as breakwaters iv providing power supply for operations on marine structures v increasing the reliability and hence lifetime of wecs by providing additional strength to wecs to withstand strong waves and by allowing some components of wecs to be placed on the marine structures mustapa et al 2017 which are usually more stable under wave action as compared to stand alone wecs examples of the integration between wecs and marine structures are the wec type breakwater mustapa et al 2017 and the combined wind wave energy converter pérez collazo et al 2015 on another front of ocean utilization pontoon type very large floating structures vlfss have been shown to be one promising solution for creating artificial land on the ocean lamas pardo et al 2015 suzuki 2005 watanabe et al 2004 vlfs usually has large horizontal dimensions as compared to wavelengths and relatively small flexural rigidity wang et al 2007 because of these two properties the dynamic response of vlfs under wave action is dominated by elastic deformations and hence may be called hydroelastic response there are many methods proposed for reducing the hydroelastic response of vlfs under wave action as described in a review paper by wang et al 2010 these methods include the use of bottom founded breakwaters ohmatsu 2000 or floating breakwaters tay et al 2009 floating auxiliary structures attached to the fore of vlfs kim et al 2005 submerged vertical horizontal plates or submerged box shaped structures rigidly connected to the fore of vlfs ohta et al 1999 pham et al 2008 takagi et al 2000 and semi rigid connections between vlfs modules riyansyah et al 2010 other more recent methods are the use of dual inclined perforated submerged plates cheng et al 2016 vertical mooring lines nguyen et al 2018 and vertical porous barriers singla et al 2018 motivated by the benefits of the integration between wecs and other purpose marine structures and the necessity to reduce hydroelastic response of vlfs tay 2019 recently proposed a raft wec type attachment for extracting wave energy while reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs this attachment consists of a single wide pontoon connected to the fore edge of vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto systems by using the same wave energy conversion concept ren et al 2019 studied the use of pto systems placed at the outermost hinge connection of multi purpose floating structures by adopting the modular concept for the owsc sarkar et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019a proposed a modular raft wec type attachment where the single wide pontoon of the raft wec type attachment tay 2019 is replaced by multiple independent narrow pontoons this replacement brings several advantages including i flexibility for downsizing expansion of the overall width of the attachment ii increasing reliability of the attachment as the system has higher redundancy iii lower costs for manufacturing and deployment owing to the modularity in design and iv more power produced in oblique wave conditions if the width of the whole device is comparable to the wavelength nguyen et al 2019a wilkinson et al 2017 however the effectiveness of the modular raft wec type attachment in extracting wave energy is rather limited for relatively long waves nguyen et al 2019b to overcome this limitation of the modular raft wec type attachment and motivated by the advantages of the owsc and the raft wec this study presents a novel two mode wec type attachment comprising floating horizontal plates and submerged vertical plates connected to the fore edge of vlfs with hinges and linear pto systems these auxiliary plates are of the same dimensions and are connected to different portions of the fore edge of vlfs this wec type attachment allows wave energy to be extracted by two different modes i e from using floating auxiliary plates and from using submerged vertical plates in this study the performance of the two mode wec type attachment is examined for various mode configurations which are specified by the numbers and locations of the floating horizontal auxiliary plates and the submerged vertical auxiliary plates here the performance of a wec type attachment is assessed via the power production reduction in hydroelastic response of vlfs and horizontal linear wave forces acting on submerged vertical plates which are then transmitted to the mooring system via the vlfs for the hydroelastic analysis vlfs is modelled as a plate wang and wang 2008 while the linear wave theory faltinsen 1990 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 is used for modelling fluid motions the hydroelastic analysis is performed in the frequency domain by using the finite element boundary element fe be method kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 2 problem definition assumptions and formulation 2 1 problem definition and assumptions consider a rectangular vlfs which is modelled as a floating rectangular plate with length l width b and thickness h as shown in fig 1 the plate has young s modulus e poisson s ratio ν and mass density ρ there are n p number of thin and rigid auxiliary plates connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges for convenience these plates are numbered from 1 to n p starting from the plate with the smallest y coordinate each auxiliary plate is either a floating horizontal plate or submerged vertical plate and has length l p width b p thickness h p and mass density ρ p1 for floating auxiliary plates or ρ p2 for submerged vertical plates note that b n p b p the gap between auxiliary plates and the fore edge of vlfs is denoted by s the zero gap between auxiliary plates is considered by referring to the studies on the modular owsc michele et al 2016 and on the venice storm gate adamo and mei 2005 it is assumed that the horizontal motions of the vlfs are completely constrained by the mooring dolphin rubber fender system for simplicity the draft of vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates are assumed to be zero gao et al 2011 power take off pto systems are installed in between auxiliary plates and the fore edge of vlfs see fig 1 the behaviour of pto systems is assumed to be linear and hence the ith pto system i 1 2 n p may be modelled as a rotational linear damper zheng et al 2015 with damping coefficient c pi in fig 1b the subscript j i and j 1 2 n p the vlfs with the two mode wec type attachment floats on an ideal fluid domain and is subjected to regular waves a regular wave is characterized by wave period t with the corresponding wavelength λ and wave amplitude a the wave amplitude is assumed to be small where the linear wave theory may be used for modelling fluid motions the head sea condition is considered the seabed is assumed to be flat and the water depth is denoted by h the mode configuration mc of a two mode wec type attachment may be represented by a string of letters involving h and v for example if mc vhv it means that the first and the third auxiliary plates are submerged vertical plates while the second auxiliary plate is a floating horizontal plate 2 2 equation of motion for vlfs with two mode wec type attachment similar to a conventional floating structure the displacement vector u n t of an arbitrary point within the vlfs with two mode wec type attachment consists of six components i e u n t u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t ψ 1 t ψ 2 t ψ 3 t t where u 1 t u 2 t and u 3 t are respectively the displacements along the x y and z axes and ψ 1 t ψ 2 t and ψ 3 t are respectively the rotations about the x y and z axes the subscript t denotes the transpose and t denotes the time in the frequency domain the displacement vector may be expressed as 1 u n t x y z t re u n x y z e i ω t where re implies the real part i 1 ω is the incident wave frequency u n u 1 u 2 u 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ 3 t is the vector of the frequency dependent complex amplitudes of displacements the fluid structure interaction analysis of vlfs with two mode wec type attachment in the frequency domain may be carried out by using the hybrid finite element higher order boundary element method kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 in this method the vlfs and the auxiliary plates are first discretised into elements each element has n e nodes and each node has six degrees of freedom that correspond to the six components of the nodal displacement vector this vector is given by u ˆ n u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 u ˆ 3 ψ ˆ 1 ψ ˆ 2 ψ ˆ 3 t where the ˆ sign above each variable indicates the nodal variable the vector u n of an arbitrary point in the structure may be approximated by the formula u n n e u ˆ e where n e is the matrix containing the interpolation function values of the eth element where the considered point is in and u ˆ e is the vector containing the vectors u ˆ n of all nodes of the eth element liu and quek 2003 by following the finite element procedure kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 the equation of motion for vlfs with two mode wec type attachment may be written in the following matrix form 2 ω 2 m m a ω i ω c p c d ω k k rf u ˆ f exc where m is the global mass matrix m a the global matrix of added mass k the global stiffness matrix k rf the global matrix of restoring stiffness which results from the action of the hydrostatic force and the gravitational force senjanović et al 2008 c p the global matrix of pto damping c d the global matrix of hydrodynamic damping f exc the global vector that consists of frequency dependent complex amplitudes of nodal excitation wave forces u ˆ the vector of the frequency dependent complex amplitudes of displacements of the structure the vector u ˆ comprises the vectors u ˆ n of all nodes of the discretised model the determination of the matrices m a c d and the vector f exc called hydrodynamic matrices vector may be done by using the boundary element method as given in sec 2 3 and in appendix a the matrices k and m may be obtained using the numerical procedures for shell elements fu et al 2007 liu and quek 2003 the hinge connections between the auxiliary plates and the vlfs are taken into account by modifying the stiffness matrix k using the penalty method liu and quek 2003 the constraints that the horizontal motions i e the motions along x and y axes as well as the rotation about z axis at any points within the vlfs are zero because of the presence of the mooring system may be imposed by using the same approach as for the hinge connections if the kth node and the lth node are connected via the ith pto system the non zero components of the matrix c p are nguyen et al 2019a zheng et al 2015 c p l 5 l 5 c p k 5 k 5 c pi c p l 5 k 5 c p k 5 l 5 c pi where the subscript 5 denotes the degree of freedom corresponding to the rotation about y axis a general calculation approach for k rf has been given by kim et al 2013 however because the drafts of vlfs and floating auxiliary plates are zero and the submerged vertical auxiliary plates are thin and rigid the restoring stiffness matrix may be calculated in a simpler manner in sum the restoring stiffness matrix k rf comprises the restoring stiffness matrix of the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates k rf h and that of the submerged vertical plates k rf v and given by 3 k rf k rf h 0 0 k rf v the restoring stiffness matrix of the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates k rf h may be calculated in the same manner as for the case where the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates resting on a winkler foundation with stiffness ρ w g where g is the gravitational acceleration and ρ w the water mass density wang and wang 2008 the restoring stiffness matrix of the submerged vertical plates may be obtained based on the following formulation of the frequency dependent complex amplitude f rf v of the restoring moment that acts on an arbitrary point within the submerged vertical plates 4 f rf v ρ p 2 ρ w g h p r p ψ 2 where r p is the vertical distance between the considered point within the submerged vertical plates to the hinge connection eq 4 indicates that the rotational restoring stiffness at an arbitrary point ρ p 2 ρ w g h p r p is only positive if the mass density of the submerged vertical plate is larger than the water mass density this condition is in contrast to the corresponding condition for the owsc this is because the rotational restoring stiffness at an arbitrary point within the submerged vertical flap of the owsc should be ρ w ρ p 2 g h p r p noad and porter 2015 which is only positive if the mass density of the submerged vertical plate is smaller than the water mass density in order to reduce the size of the system of linear equations in eq 2 so as to speed up the computation the modal expansion method kim et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019b is employed following the modal expansion method eq 2 may be rewritten as 5 s t ω 2 m m a ω i ω c p c d ω k k rf s ς s t f exc where s s 1 s 2 s ne ς ς 1 ς 2 ς ne t and 6 u ˆ ς 1 s 1 ς 2 s 2 ς n e s n e

eigenvector may be obtained from the free vibration analysis of the structure the amplitude vector ς is unknown and may be obtained by solving eq 5 the vector of frequency dependent complex amplitudes of nodal displacements of the structure is then obtained by using eq 6 2 3 formulation of the fluid 2 3 1 hydrodynamic equations the fluid motion may be represented in terms of the velocity potential φ t sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 in the frequency domain the velocity potential is given by 7 φ t x y z t re φ x y z e i ω t where φ x y z is time independent and is usually called the spatial velocity potential this spatial velocity potential must satisfy the following laplace equation faltinsen 1990 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 8 2 φ x y z 0 the boundary conditions are expressed as faltinsen 1990

appendix a 2 4 performance indices the performance of two mode wec type attachment is assessed by the power capture factor as well as the hydroelastic response reduction in addition as the two mode wec type attachment consists of several submerged vertical plates the horizontal wave force acting on these submerged plates is much larger than that acting on the floating horizontal auxiliary plates which have a shallow draft assumed to be zero in this study for simplicity thus the total horizontal linear wave force acting on the submerged vertical plates is also considered in the performance assessment of the two mode wec type attachment the power capture factor is the ratio between the total power produced p av and the incident wave power p in and is written as 19 cf p av p in the determination of the power produced p av may be done using the following formula zheng et al 2015 20 p av 1 2 ω 2 i 1 n p c p i δ ψ 2 i 2 where δ ψ 2 i is the amplitude of the relative rotation about the y axis between the two nodes that are connected to each other via the ith pto system the power of incident wave p in is defined as falnes 2002 21 p in 1 4 ρ w g a 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h b the hydroelastic response reduction hr may be defined as the reduction in the amplitude of the maximum vertical displacement over the entire vlfs as follows 22 hr 1 u 3 max u 3 0 max where u 3 0 max is the maximum vertical displacement amplitude of the vlfs without the two mode wec type attachment and u 3 max the maximum vertical displacement amplitude of the vlfs with the attachment the frequency dependent complex amplitude of the total horizontal wave force acting on submerged vertical plates is given by 23 f x i ω ρ w s v φ d s v s v φ d s v where s v indicates the right wetted surface perpendicular to ox of the submerged vertical plates and s v indicates the left wetted surface of the submerged vertical plates 3 verification because numerical experimental results of vlfs with two mode wec type attachment are currently not available the present formulation and computer code are verified for two related problems including i vlfs without the wec type attachment and ii owsc comprising a submerged vertical plate connected to a base structure fixed at the seabed for the first problem the input for verification is given in table 1 fig 2 shows that the numerical results obtained by using the present formulation and computer code agree very well with the published numerical results i e ref num fu et al 2007 as well as the published experimental results i e ref exp yago and endo 1996 note that for vlfs consisting of two interconnected modules the numerical results obtained by using the present formulation and computer code also agree very well with the published numerical results fu et al 2007 as presented in our previous study nguyen et al 2019a for the second problem the present numerical results are first compared with the published numerical results yu et al 2016 for the owsc defined in fig 3 a the mass density of the submerged plate is 300 kg m3 the present numerical results are also compared with the experimental results given by henry 2008 for the owsc defined in fig 4 a the oscillating submerged plate of owsc in fig 4a is not connected directly to the seabed with a hinge like so of owsc in fig 3a but it is connected to a base structure fixed at the seabed and the hinge connection between the base structure and the oscillating plate is located at 1 5 m above the seabed the comparison with experimental results is only carried out for the excitation wave torque m exc acting on the oscillating submerged plate because of its availability henry 2008 as the excitation wave torque is independent with respect to the material properties of the submerged plate as well as the properties of pto system these parameters are not specified although the experiment was carried out in a wave flume the measured excitation wave torque may still be used for comparison with the numerically estimated excitation torque in an open sea which is considered in the present formulation this is because the width of the wave flume is about 5 times larger than the width of the scaled model henry 2008 which may make the measured excitation wave torque negligibly affected by the wave flume walls chakrabarti 1999 figs 3b and 4b show that the present numerical results show a very good agreement with published numerical experimental results for all considered cases thereby confirming the validity and accuracy of the present formulation and computer code 4 performance of two mode wec type attachment the vlfs with physical and geometric parameters given in table 1 which was used in previous research studies fu et al 2007 nguyen et al 2019a yago and endo 1996 is again adopted for numerical studies in this section the number of auxiliary plates and their dimensions are selected as in table 2 by referring to the designs of langlee wec and the oyster wec babarit et al 2012 the auxiliary plate thickness is 1 m which is relatively similar to the thickness of the owscs in sec 3 the mass density of floating auxiliary plates and that of submerged vertical plates are chosen as in table 2 the gap between the auxiliary plates and the fore edge of vlfs is 1 m liu et al 2017 yu et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 with regard to properties of sea sites the water depth h 20 m and wave period t ranging from 4 s to 16 s are considered as cf and hr are independent on the wave amplitude a the wave amplitude a is not specified for numerical studies however the wave amplitude a needs to be small to ensure that the adopted linear wave theory is valid for simplicity the mode configuration of the attachment is assumed to be symmetrical with respect to ox the performance of two mode wec type attachment is assessed for all 8 possible mode configurations including 1 hhhhhh or only the first three letters hhh for brevity because of the symmetry 2 vvv 3 hvv 4 vhh 5 vhv 6 hvh 7 hhv 8 vvh the pto damping coefficients are optimally selected within 1e4 1e8 nms rad for maximizing either cf or hr for each wave period and each mode configuration in sections 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 the objective function is maximizing cf whereas in sections 4 4 and 4 5 the objective function is either maximizing hr or maximizing cf the upper bound of pto damping coefficients is set to 1e8 nms rad by referring to the design of oyster wec babarit et al 2012 unless specified hereafter the pto damping coefficient of each pto system is considered as an independent design variable this unequal pto damping strategy was adopted for the modular owsc sarkar et al 2016 the mathematical statement of the optimization problem is given in appendix b the optimization process to obtain the optimal pto damping coefficients is based on differential evolution de price et al 2005 de generally outperforms the genetic algorithms gas which have been used in optimization studies of wec and vlfs gao et al 2013 michailides and angelides 2015 with respect to the convergence rate and the quality of the optimal solution hegerty et al 2009 de has recently been used for research studies on vlfs and wec nguyen et al 2019b 2018 the details of the optimization process based on de may be found in appendix b 4 1 power production fig 5 shows the variations of the power capture factor and the corresponding power produced with respect to wave period for all 8 mode configurations of the two mode wec type attachment the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing cf are given in fig 6 fig 5 shows that for mc hhh cf is largest when t 4 s and then it decreases with respect to wave period the largest cf is observed for t 4 s because for this wave period the ratio between the length of the auxiliary plates and the wavelength is close to 1 3 which is the ideal ratio for using floating auxiliary plates in wave energy extraction nguyen et al 2019a the corresponding ideal ratio for the raft wec is about 1 2 zheng et al 2015 for mc vvv fig 5 shows that cf first increases with respect to wave period and reaches its maximum value at a certain wave period t 7 s thereafter cf decreases with increasing wave period this variation for mc vvv is relatively similar to the corresponding variation for the owsc renzi and dias 2013 fig 5 shows that among the 8 mode configurations preferable mode configurations for wave energy extraction are changed significantly for three different ranges of wave periods which are indicated by the three different shaded areas for t 5 s a mode configuration with a larger number of floating horizontal auxiliary plates shows larger power production this means that the use of the floating auxiliary plates is preferable to submerged vertical plates this may be because in this wave condition the ratio between the length of the auxiliary plates and the wavelength is close to the ideal ratio i e 1 3 for extracting wave energy using floating auxiliary plates note that the corresponding ideal ratio for the use of the submerged vertical plates is smaller about 0 12 based on the data in fig 5 for mc vvv because cf is largest when t 7 s or when λ 72 m for t 7 s a mode configuration with a larger number of submerged vertical plates yields larger power production the use of the submerged vertical plates is preferable because for this wave condition the ratio between the length of auxiliary plates and the wavelength is closer to the ideal ratio for submerged vertical plates than that for floating auxiliary plates because the former ideal ratio is smaller than the latter one for 5 s t 7 s preferable mode configurations for extracting wave energy are generally changed from mode configurations having a larger number of floating auxiliary plates to mode configurations having a larger number of submerged vertical plates as the wave period increases from 5 s to 7 s interestingly in this wave condition power production for mode configurations with both submerged vertical plates and floating auxiliary plates may be larger than that for the hhh and vvv mode configurations this observation implies that the interaction between submerged vertical plates and floating auxiliary plates of the two mode wec type attachment may result in enhancing the power production of the attachment thus for this wave condition the use of the two mode wec type attachment consisting of both floating and submerged vertical plates may be preferable to the use of the attachment comprising solely floating auxiliary plates or solely submerged vertical plates fig 7 shows the variations of cf i i 1 2 3 with respect to the wave period for mc hhh vvv here cf i is the power capture factor associated with the ith auxiliary plate and is defined as cf i p av i p in n p where p av i is the power produced by the ith pto system see eq 20 fig 7a shows that the power capture factors associated with different auxiliary plates in hhh configuration are almost the same for all wave periods considered this observation is expected because wave forces acting on different floating auxiliary plates should be almost the same for the head sea condition fig 7b shows that the power capture factor associated with an auxiliary plate cf i in vvv configuration is generally lowest for the outermost plate 1st plate and highest for the central plate 3rd plate in other words cf i increases as one moves from the edge plate to the central plate this variation is expected because the wave force acting on a submerged plate is generally minimum for the outermost submerged plate and maximum for the central plate sarkar et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2017 fig 8 shows the variations of cf i i 1 2 3 with respect to the wave period for mc hvv vhh vhv hvh hhv vvh among the mode configurations with the same number of submerged plates a mode configuration allowing a larger number of submerged plates placed next to one another generally shows a higher power capture factor associated with submerged plates for example among the three mode configurations hvv vhv vvh the power capture factors associated with submerged plates are generally highest for mc hvv and smallest for mc vhv this observation may be explained by the fact that when submerged plates are placed next to one another the difference in water pressures acting on the two surfaces of submerged plates should be not zero along the edges adjacent to those of other submerged plates hence by placing a larger number of submerged vertical plates next to one another the wave force acting on submerged plates should increase see sec 4 3 thereby leading to an increased power capture factor from the submerged plates this arrangement of submerged plates next to one another also produces higher power capture factor cf for intermediate and long waves t 7 s as evident in fig 5 fig 8 shows that the power capture factors associated with horizontal plates for mc hvv vhh vhv hvh hhv vvh are higher than those for mc hhh for most wave periods t 5 s thus it is beneficial to have some submerged vertical plates to improve the power capture factors associated with horizontal plates this finding agrees with that for wecs with three hinged bodies yu et al 2016 the improvement in the power capture factors associated with horizontal plates may be due to the interference between the incident wave and the reflected wave from submerged vertical plates that increases the vertical displacements of horizontal plates the increase in vertical displacements of horizontal plates due to the presence of submerged vertical plates can be seen in fig 9 by comparing the vertical displacement amplitude of the second auxiliary plate for mc hhh with that for other mode configurations 4 2 hydroelastic response reduction fig 10 shows the variations of the hydroelastic response reduction with respect to wave period for all 8 mode configurations of the two mode wec type attachment fig 10 shows that for all mode configurations the hydroelastic response reduction is largest when t 4 s and it decreases as the wave period increases as expected fig 10 shows that similar to preferable mode configurations for wave energy extraction preferable mode configurations for hydroelastic response mitigation are changed considerably for three different ranges of wave periods which are indicated by the three different shaded areas in fig 10 interestingly these three shaded areas are in reverse order as compared to those in fig 5 for t 7 s fig 10 shows that a mode configuration with a larger number of submerged vertical plates generally shows larger hr this result may also be seen in fig 11 which shows the hydroelastic response of the vlfs without the attachment and with the attachment for several mode configurations for t 5 s the use of submerged vertical plates for reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs is preferable because for this wave condition the length of the submerged vertical plates is relatively close to the depth of the region where the water particle motion is non zero or where the hydrodynamic pressure is non zero this depth is about λ 2 for the short wave condition which corresponds to the deep sea condition dean and dalrymple 1991 thus a large portion of incident wave should be reflected from the submerged vertical plates resulting in decreasing significantly the amount of incident wave energy absorbed by the vlfs and hence reducing considerably the hydroelastic response of the vlfs for t 9 s a mode configuration with a larger number of floating auxiliary plates shows larger hr see fig 10 this observation may also be seen in fig 12 which shows the hydroelastic response of the vlfs without the attachment and with the attachment for several mode configurations for t 10 s this observation implies that the use of submerged vertical plates is not preferable for reducing hydroelastic response of the vlfs under action of long waves this finding agrees with the finding for a submerged vertical plate rigidly connected to the fore edge of a vlfs masanobu et al 2003 ohta et al 1999 where the submerged vertical plate was claimed to be not effective in reducing the hydroelastic response of the vlfs for long waves for very long waves t 13 s it was also claimed that the use of the submerged vertical plate may result in increasing the hydroelastic response of the vlfs ohta et al 1999 for 7 s t 9 s preferable mode configurations for hydroelastic response mitigation are generally changed from mode configurations having a larger number of submerged vertical plates to mode configurations having a larger number of floating auxiliary plates as the wave period increases from 7 s to 9 s in this wave condition the worst mode configuration for hydroelastic response mitigation is not necessarily hhh or vvv but it may be another mode configuration this indicates that the interaction between the submerged vertical plates and the floating auxiliary plates may result in decreasing the hydroelastic response reduction 4 3 horizontal wave force acting on submerged vertical plates fig 13 a shows the variations of the amplitude of the total horizontal linear wave force acting on submerged vertical plates with respect to wave period for several mode configurations fig 13b shows the variations of the horizontal force reduction fr with respect to wave period here fr 1 f x i f x 0 where f x 0 is the amplitude of the horizontal force for the vvv or 2nd mode configuration and f x i is the amplitude of the horizontal force for the ith mode configuration i 3 4 8 fig 13 shows that the wave force decreases as the number of submerged vertical plates decreases the horizontal force reduction for the mode configurations hvv vhv and vvh is about 30 60 this figure is about 65 85 for the mode configurations vhh hvh hhv fig 13 also shows that among mode configurations with the same number of submerged vertical plates a mode configuration allowing a larger number of the submerged vertical plates placed next to one another generally shows a larger horizontal wave force for example the horizontal wave force for hvv is larger than that for vvh because the arrangement of the six auxiliary plates for hvv is hvvvvh and that for vvh is vvhhvv similarly it may be seen that the horizontal wave force for vvh is larger than that for vhv 4 4 wave energy generation versus hydroelastic response mitigation fig 14 shows the variations of cf and hr with respect to wave period for the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing hr the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing hr are given in fig 15 in general fig 14 shows that both the variations of cf and hr with respect to wave period for various mode configurations are rather similar to the corresponding variations for the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing cf thus the findings in sec 4 1 and sec 4 2 are generally still valid for the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing hr fig 16 shows the variations of δcf and δhr with respect to wave period here δcf cf 2 cf 1 and δhr hr 2 hr 1 where the superscript 1 indicates the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing cf and the superscript 2 indicates the case where pto damping coefficients are optimized for maximizing hr fig 16 shows that for mc hhh both δcf and δhr are small about 0 025 for all wave periods this indicates that for mc hhh if pto damping coefficients are designed for maximizing cf or hr the resulting hr or cf obtained is almost equal to its maximum attainable value this finding agrees with that given by nguyen et al 2019b for mc vvv the absolute values of δcf and δhr are large up to about 0 15 when t 7 s for longer waves δcf and δhr are small about 0 025 this finding implies that for mc vvv if pto damping coefficients are designed for maximizing only cf or hr the resulting hr or cf is generally much smaller than its maximum attainable value for t 7 s but the resulting hr or cf is almost equal to its maximum attainable value for longer waves the large absolute values of δcf and δhr for short waves and the small absolute values for longer waves for mc vvv may be explained by the power produced and the amount of incident wave reflected from the submerged vertical plates for these two different wave conditions in detail the incident wave energy is mainly transformed into i the energy of the reflected wave from the submerged vertical plates ii the useable energy and iii the energy restored in the motions of the vlfs and the submerged vertical plates thus in general if a larger amount of power is produced or a larger amount of incident wave is reflected hr should be larger for relatively short wave conditions t 7 s because a large portion of incident wave should be reflected and the amount of power produced is not large as discussed in sec 4 1 and sec 4 2 hr may be mainly dependent on the amount of incident waves reflected as the amount of reflected wave may increase by limiting the motion of the submerged vertical plates hr may increase by generally increasing the pto damping coefficients this makes the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing hr large as compared to the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing cf see figs 6 and 15 for t 7 s and mc vvv however for longer waves t 7 s because the amount of reflected wave should be smaller than that for short waves and the amount of power produced is generally larger than that for short waves hr may mainly depend on the amount power produced thus for this wave condition increasing the power produced generally results in increasing hr this makes the optimal pto damping coefficients for maximizing hr close to and not necessarily larger than those for maximizing cf see figs 6 and 15 for t 7 s and mc vvv for other mode configurations fig 16 shows that the variations of δcf and δhr are quite similar to those for mc vvv however the absolute values of δcf and δhr may be larger than those for mc vvv which may result from the interaction between submerged vertical plates and floating auxiliary plates 4 5 unequal damping strategy versus equal damping strategy fig 17 shows the variations of cf 1 unequal cf 1 equal and hr 1 unequal hr 1 equal with respect to the wave period for various mode configurations while fig 18 shows the variations of cf 2 unequal cf 2 equal and hr 2 unequal hr 2 equal here the superscript 1 indicates the case where the objective is to maximize cf while the superscript 2 denotes the case where the objective is to maximize hr the subscripts unequal and equal denote the corresponding pto damping strategies for the case where the equal pto damping strategy is adopted i e damping coefficients are the same for all pto systems the optimal pto damping coefficients for various wave periods and mode configurations are given in fig 19 for mc hhh vvv figs 17 and 18 show that both cf and hr are almost insensitive to pto damping strategy this is expected because all auxiliary plates for mc hhh or mc vvv have the same dimensions and the same operation mode the insensitivity of cf and hr to pto damping strategy implies that the equal pto damping strategy should be adopted for these mode configurations to facilitate selection and control of pto systems but without compromising cf and hr for other mode configurations figs 17 and 18 show that the effects of pto damping strategy on cf and hr appear to be not significant except for a special case where the objective is to maximize hr and for short waves t 6 s for this special case see fig 18 for t 6 s by altering the pto damping strategy from the unequal damping strategy to the equal damping strategy hr decreases by up to about 0 14 thus while the equal damping strategy can be adopted to facilitate selection and control of pto system the maximum attainable hydroelastic response reduction may be comprised considerably note that for the special case where the objective is to maximize hr and for short waves t 6 s if the unequal pto damping strategy is adopted the optimal pto damping coefficients for submerged plates are much larger than those for horizontal plates e g see fig 15 for mc hvh 5 conclusions and recommendations for future studies presented herein is a two mode wave energy converter wec type attachment to pontoon type vlfs for wave energy extraction and reduction in hydroelastic response the two mode wec type attachment comprises floating horizontal auxiliary plates and submerged vertical auxiliary plates connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges and linear pto systems the following key findings may be drawn from this study i a two mode wec type attachment with a larger number of floating auxiliary plates and hence a smaller number of submerged vertical plates generally shows larger power production for short waves t 5 s but smaller power production for intermediate and long waves t 7 s thus while the use of floating auxiliary plates for wave energy extraction is preferable in short waves the use of submerged vertical plates is preferable in intermediate and long waves ii a two mode wec type attachment with a larger number of submerged vertical plates and hence a smaller number of floating auxiliary plates yields larger hydroelastic response reduction in relatively short waves t 7 s but smaller hydroelastic response reduction in relatively long waves t 9 s thus while the use of submerged vertical plates is preferable for hydroelastic response mitigation in relatively short waves the use of floating auxiliary plates is preferable in relatively long waves iii for intermediate and long waves t 7 s when pto damping coefficients are designed for maximum cf or hr the resulting hr or cf is also almost maximized in the case of short waves the same finding is observed for the wec type attachment with solely floating horizontal plates however if submerged vertical plates are introduced designing pto damping coefficients for maximizing cf or hr poses a problem that the resulting hr or cf is generally much smaller than its maximum attainable value iv among mode configurations with the same number of submerged vertical plates a mode configuration involving a larger number of submerged vertical plates placed next to one another results in a larger horizontal force as compared to the wec type attachment comprising either solely submerged vertical plates or solely floating horizontal plates the two mode wec attachment possesses several positive features including i good wave energy extraction performance for a wide range of wave periods owing to the combination of the superior performance of floating horizontal plates in extracting wave energy for short waves and the superior performance of submerged vertical plates in extracting wave energy for intermediate and long waves ii good hydroelastic response mitigation performance for a wide range of wave periods owing to the combination of the superior performance of submerged vertical plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively short waves and the superior performance of floating horizontal plates in reducing hydroelastic response for relatively long waves iii higher cf for ocean waves with 5 s t 7 s owing to the interaction between the vertical plates the horizontal plates iv better balance between extracting wave energy and reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs for the same wave period where although cf or hr for a certain wave period is smaller than its maximum attainable value the resulting hr or cf for the same wave period is closer to its maximum attainable value v smaller horizontal wave force acting on submerged vertical plates and therefore on the mooring system as compared to the vvv mode configuration this study shows that the mode configuration may be tuned to the incident wave period for maximum wave energy production or hydroelastic response reduction and for reducing horizontal wave forces acting on submerged vertical plates and hence a reduced horizontal force on the mooring system in fact a floating plate may be submerged by increasing the mass density of the plate e g filling its compartments with water in addition a submerged vertical plate may become a floating auxiliary plate by ballasting however if the mode configuration is allowed to be tuned to the incident wave period a more detailed design of pto systems is necessary some recommendations for future studies are given below i the present study is based on the linear wave theory where the wave amplitude is small for strong waves where nonlinearity is important cfd computational fluid dynamics analyses and physical model tests should be carried out ii hydroelastic analysis and optimization of vlfs with two mode wec type attachment are usually time consuming because of the vlfs large dimensions this problem becomes more serious when the number of design variables or the number of objective functions increases in order to speed up the hydroelastic analysis and optimization future research studies should focus on using faster optimization techniques such as parallel differential evolution pedroso et al 2017 and using faster evaluation methods for the matrices that are related to the green function such as the fast multipole method utsunomiya and watanabe 2006 or the pre corrected fft method jiang et al 2012 iii the behaviour of pto systems is assumed to be linear in this study this assumption has been widely adopted when analysing conceptual designs of wecs renzi and

test function φ x to both sides of eq 16 and then integrate the both sides over the entire wetted surface s hb as follows kim et al 2013 wang and wang 2008 a 1 α s hb φ x φ x d x s hb φ in x φ x d x s hb s hb g x ξ n ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u j ξ n j ξ d ξ φ x d x because the submerged vertical plates are assumed to be thin the wetted surfaces of each submerged plate that are perpendicular to oy and oz may be neglected in the numerical model and only the wetted surfaces that are perpendicular to ox are considered because of this simplification an artificial continuity condition is imposed along the submerged edges of the considered wetted surfaces to ensure that the difference in the velocity potential between these surfaces are zero along the submerged edges this artificial continuity condition has been used for fluid structure interaction analysis of submerged thin plates noad and porter 2015 renzi and dias 2013 the wetted surface of the entire structure s hb may be decomposed into three component surfaces including i s h that is the wetted surface of the vlfs and the floating auxiliary plates ii s v that is the right wetted surface perpendicular to ox of the submerged vertical plates iii s v that is the left wetted surface of the submerged vertical plates following the boundary element procedure these wetted surfaces are discretised into elements that possess the same properties i e the interpolation functions and the number of nodes in each element of the elements used for the fem formulation in sec 2 2 however different from the nodes in the fem formulation each node in the bem formulation has only one degree of freedom that corresponds to the nodal spatial velocity potential φ ˆ the spatial velocity potential of an arbitrary point may be approximated from the nodal spatial velocity potentials by using the formula φ n e φ ˆ e where the subscript e denotes the element where the considered point is in φ ˆ e is the vector containing the nodal spatial velocity potentials of the element and is obtained by assembling the vectors φ ˆ of all nodes of the element n e the vector containing the interpolation function values liu and quek 2003 note that while the size of the vector n e is 1 n e the size of the vector n e in sec 2 2 is 1 6n e we first consider the case where the source point is in s h i e x s h eq a 1 may be rewritten as a 2 s h φ x φ x d x s h φ in x φ x d x s h s h ω 2 g g x ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u 3 ξ d ξ φ x d x s h s v g x ξ x ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u 1 ξ d ξ φ x d x s h s v g x ξ x ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u 1 ξ d ξ φ x d x where the first derivative of the green function with respect to x is given by a 3 g x ξ x ξ m 0 k 1 k m r π h 1 sin 2 k m h 2 k m h cos k m z h cos k m ζ h k m x ξ r where k 1 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order one eq a 2 may be transformed in a matrix form as follows a 4 φ h k i 1 φ ˆ h φ h k i 1 φ ˆ in h ω 2 g φ h g 1 φ ˆ h i ω φ h g 1 u ˆ 3 h φ h g x 1 φ ˆ v i ω φ h g 2 u ˆ 1 v φ h g x 2 φ ˆ v i ω φ h g 3 u ˆ 1 v where each term in eq a 4 is the matrix form of the corresponding term in eq a 2 the superscript h denotes that the vectors are for s h the subscript v implies that the vectors are for s v the subscript v indicates that the vectors are for s v the matrices g 1 g 2 and g 3 are related to the green function the matrices g x1 g x2 are related to the first derivative of the green function with respect to x by eliminating φ h from all terms of eq a 2 and by setting u ˆ 1 v u ˆ 1 v u ˆ 1 v eq a 4 becomes a 5 k i 1 φ ˆ h k i 1 φ ˆ in h ω 2 g g 1 φ ˆ h i ω g 1 u ˆ 3 h g x 1 φ ˆ v i ω g 2 u

6 note that the matrix 0 before φ ˆ v indicates the fact that for the case where both the source and the field points are in s v the first derivative of the green function eq a 3 is zero next we consider the case where x s v eq a 2 may be rewritten as a 8 s v 1 2 φ x φ x d x s v φ in x φ x d x s v s h ω 2 g g x ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u 3 ξ d ξ φ x d x s v s v g x ξ x ξ φ ξ i ω g x ξ u 1 ξ d ξ φ x d

where each term in eq a 9 is the matrix form after eliminating φ v of the corresponding term in eq a 8 the matrix 0 before φ ˆ v results from the fact that the first derivative of the green function eq a 3 is zero when both the source and the field points are in s v from eqs a 5 a 7 and a 9 we obtain the following system of equations a 10 k i 1 ω 2 g g 1 g x 1 g x 2 ω 2 g g 4 1 2 k i 2 g x 3 ω 2

rewritten as a 11 e φ ˆ h φ ˆ v φ ˆ v f φ ˆ in h φ ˆ in v φ ˆ in v i ω h u ˆ 3 h u ˆ 1 v u ˆ 1 v where the matrices e f and h represents the corresponding matrices in eq a 10 similar to the continuity conditions for the hinge connections between the vlfs and the auxiliary plates the artificial continuity condition for the velocity potential along the submerged edges of the submerged vertical plates can be imposed in the numerical model by using the penalty method liu and quek 2003 for the matrix e in eq a 11 after applying the boundary element procedure to transform eq 16 into eq a 11 we now discuss the calculation of the vector of frequency dependent complex amplitudes of nodal hydrodynamic force p g in eq 18 this vector is related to the nodal velocity potential vector as follows a 12 p g i ω ρ w t g k i 1 0 0 0 k i 2 k i 2 φ ˆ h φ ˆ v φ ˆ v where t g is the transformation matrix that is used to transform the vector for nodal hydrodynamic forces in the bem formulation into the corresponding vector for nodal hydrodynamic forces in the fem formulation this transformation process is required because while each node in the bem formulation has only one degree of freedom that in the fem formulation has six degrees of freedom as discussed earlier the size of the matrix t g is 6n n n n where is n n the number of nodes of the entire discretised fem model the component vector of the matrix t g for each node is 0 0 1 0 0 0 t if the node is within the vlfs or the floating auxiliary plates and is 1 0 0 0 0 0 t if the node is within the submerged vertical plates eq a 12 may also be expressed as a 13 p g i ω ρ w t g l φ ˆ h φ ˆ v φ ˆ v where the matrix l in eq a 13 represents the corresponding matrix in eq a 12 by substituting the vector for nodal velocity potential from eq a 11 into eq a 13 we obtain the following equation a 14 p g i ω ρ w t g l e 1 f φ ˆ in h φ ˆ in v φ ˆ in v ω 2 ρ w t g l e 1 h t v u ˆ 3 h u ˆ 1 v where t v is the transformation matrix given by a 15 t v i 1 0 0 i 2 0 i 2 where i 1 i 2 are the identity matrices and their sizes are equal to the sizes of k i1 and k i2 respectively by expressing the vector u ˆ 3 h u ˆ 1 v t in eq a 14 in terms of the global vector u ˆ eq a 14 becomes a 16 p g i ω ρ w t g l e 1 f φ ˆ in ω 2 ρ w t g l e 1 h t v t g t u ˆ from eq a 16 and eq 18 the matrices m a c d and f exc may be obtained as follows a 17 m a ρ w re t g l e 1 h t v t g t a 18 c d ω ρ w im t g l e 1 h t v t g t a 19 f exc i ω ρ w t g l e 1 f φ ˆ in where im indicates the imaginary part appendix b optimization of pto damping coefficients the optimization problem is defined as follows b 1 maximize f x b 2 subject to c pi c p l c p u where f x may be either cf x or hr x as discussed in sec 4 x c p1 c p2 c p n p the vector of pto damping coefficients of n p numbers of pto systems c p l the lower bound of pto damping coefficients in the search space and c p u the upper bound of pto damping coefficients in the search space the search space for pto damping coefficients is 1e4 1e8 nms rad c pi i 1 2 n p are considered as continuous design variables the optimization process is presented in fig b1 the optimization process starts with the generation of np numbers of initial solutions x j 0 c p1 j 0 c p2 j 0 c p n p j 0 where the subscript 0 denotes the initial generation and j 1 2 np np must be at least 4 to have enough vectors for the mutation phase see eq b 4 and np needs to be sufficiently large to avoid premature convergence price et al 2005 in this study np is set to a large value np 10n p storn and price 1997 each component c pi j 0 i 1 2 n p of the vector x j 0 is created as follows price et al 2005 b 3 c p i j 0 c p l rand i 0 1 c p u c p l where rand i 0 1 is a number randomly generated within the range 0 1 after generating the initial solutions the mutation phase is employed to generate np numbers of mutant vectors v j g where the subscript g denotes the current generation as follows price et al 2005 b 4 v j g x r 1 g f m x r 2 g x r 3 g where f m is called a scale factor which is a positive real number and is usually not greater than 1 r1 r2 r3 are randomly selected from 1 2 np and r1 r2 r3 j in the crossover phase the vector v j g and the vector x j g are used to create a trial vector u j g the ith component u i j g of the vector u j g is created as follows price et al 2005 b 5 u i j g v i j g if rand i 0 1 c r or i i rand c p i j g otherwise where v i j g is the ith component of the vector v j g c p i j g is the ith component of the vector x j g cr 0 1 is the crossover control value i rand is a random index within 1 to n p in the selection phase each vector x j g 1 for the next generation is selected within the vectors u j g and x j g based on the objective function value as follows price et al 2005 b 6 x j g 1 u j g if f u j g f x j g x j g otherwise if the following stopping condition is satisfied the optimization process is terminated and the optimal solution is found price et al 2005 b 7 f worst f best 1 t o l e r where toler is a user defined value and is set to 10 5 in the present study f worst and f best are respectively the smallest and the largest objective function values over the objective function values for np numbers of possible solutions x j g 1 if the stopping condition is not satisfied the mutation crossover and selection phases are employed again the selection phase requires the evaluation of the objective function this evaluation may be done by using directly the input and the numerical analysis framework that is based on the numerical formulation given in sec 2 however this direct evaluation approach is time consuming nguyen et al 2019b to speed up the computation a two step procedure is proposed to evaluate the objective function as shown in fig b 1 in the first step the matrices m m a c d k k rf f exc and s are precalculated using the numerical analysis framework in the second step these matrices and the matrix c p that is created based on the pto damping coefficients of a possible solution are used to calculate cf or hr the two step procedure is adopted for evaluating the objective functions because all the matrices m m a c d k k rf f exc and s are insensitive to c pi and hence should be predetermined to avoid unnecessary repeated calculation for every generations in differential evolution this two step procedure for evaluating the objective function has also been used for other optimization studies on vlfs and wec nguyen et al 2019b 2018 the set f m cr that provides the most satisfactory optimization performance for a given input can be obtained by performing optimization studies for all possible sets f m cr however this approach is time consuming because it requires a large number of analyses ho huu et al 2016 effective techniques for selection of f m cr are being investigated ho huu et al 2016 wang et al 2011 in this study for simplicity f m and cr are selected within the ranges of f m and cr used in previous studies where f m is within 0 4 1 ho huu et al 2016 wang et al 2011 and cr is close to 1 wang et al 2011 or is within 0 7 1 ho huu et al 2016 based on these recommended ranges f m and cr are set to 0 8 and 0 9 respectively the accuracy of the optimal solution obtained by using de is verified by comparing with the optimal solution obtained by performing a lot of parametric studies this optimization approach is called conventional optimization approach the verification is carried out for 208 cases for 13 wave periods t 4 5 16 s 8 mode configurations and 2 objective functions for the conventional optimization approach c pi where i 1 2 3 are selected within a set of 37 discrete values 1e4 2e4 3e4 1e5 2e5 3e5 1e8 nms rad thus for each wave period and mode configuration the optimal solution is obtained from the results of 37 np analyses i e 373 or 50653 analyses because n p 3 due to the symmetry of the mode configuration for all examined cases the optimal pto damping coefficients obtained from the conventional optimization approach are almost the same as those obtained from de approach given in figs 6 and 15 the differences in the objective function values obtained by using the two optimization approaches are negligible for reference the details of the comparison between the two optimization approaches for mc vvv hvv and t 7 10 s are presented in tables b 1 and b 2 as compared with the number of analyses na required for the conventional optimization approach na required for de is much smaller thus de approach is superior to the conventional optimization approach here na np g total 1 where g total is the total number of generations required to obtain the optimal solution pedroso et al 2017 the computational time required for optimization t opt is also provided in tables b1 and b2 the high performance computing hpc system with 20 processors at the university of queensland is used the computational time t opt that is underlined in table b1 is obtained when a desktop computer 64 bit operating system 16 gb ram intel core i7 7700 cpu 3 6 ghz is used for each mode configuration and wave period t opt is generally not linearly proportional to na this may be because different jobs i e matlab codes submitted to the hpc system may be assigned to different computer nodes within the hpc system in addition the use of the requested multiple processors is not controlled by users and may be not the same for different runs note that t opt shown in tables b1 and b 2 does not include the computational time required to obtain the precalculated matrices m m a c d k k rf f exc s which ranges from 2 to 4 h by using the hpc system with 8 processors 
22139,marine disasters have occurred frequently in recent years causing enormous economic losses due to marine disasters engineers of design standards have focused on rare events with annual exceedance probabilities of 10 4 or even lower in this paper the ultra long return level of wind speed is calculated based on the deductive method which in turn is based on physical principles and the laws of probability the data is from the best track dataset for tropical cyclones over the western north pacific ocean and the wind speed is calculated by cardone s parametric wind model this wind field model has been verified by 4 observations in this paper contrary to the deductive methods used previously the sample points in the circular sub region are simulated by a non homogeneous spatial point poisson process which has a better reproducibility in addition typhoon parameters are sampled at the time of maximum wind speed instead of the time of the closest approach which is more consistent with the extremum theory the comparison of return levels in coastal cities near the south china sea indicates that the results of this study are the closest to the design codes six typical points in the south china sea are selected to calculate the extreme wind speed the wind speeds return level in the 10000 year period ranges from 50 to 58 m s in the south china sea in addition this indicates that the ultra long return level of wind speed has an increasing trend from southwest to northeast in the south china sea in terms of analyzing the uncertainty it is apparent that the deductive model has a lower uncertainty than the history method keywords extreme wind speed ultra long return period deductive method stochastic simulation typhoon parameters uncertainty abbreviation api american petroleum institute pot peak over threshold cevd compound extreme value distribution ci confidence interval qq quantile quantile ks test kolmogorov smirnov test 1 introduction typhoons are strong tropical cyclone tc occurring in the northwest pacific ocean and it is one of the most lethal and costly natural disasters affecting mankind the design of marine structures to withstand wind speed is a key consideration for marine engineering for traditional constructions of marine engineering much attention has been devoted to sea states with return periods of 30 50 and even up to 100 years however due to the increase in the number and magnitude of marine disasters in recent years stricter requirements are needed for the safety of structures what s more some scholars have found that both wind speed and wave height are increasing shi et al 2019 if the original design standards are followed the structural safety level may be too low to defend an area from severe sea states when a strong typhoon hits these marine structures they may suffer damage and fail therefore the interests in marine engineers have been shifting to extreme rare events with an annual probability of 10 4 or even lower in order to enhance the security of structures according to api standards designers require metocean parameters at very low probabilities or recurrence rates e g with a return period of 100 1000 or 10 000 years a large mount of extrapolation methods have been used based on historical data but no single method are theoretically superior even with long datasets estimations of very low probability parameters are also influenced by the extrapolation methods to a considerable degree strong winds high waves and severe storm surges associated with typhoons pose the most devastating hazards to coastal regions wu et al 2014 2018 many super typhoons passed the china sea and landed in mainland in recent years causing economic losses and even casualties the super typhoon maria july 2018 resulted in seawater flowing back into wenzhou where some marine infrastructure was damaged severely causing a direct economic loss of 3 28 billion yuan the super typhoon haiyan in 2013 resulted in 6245 deaths and thousands of injured or missing despite its early prediction holden and marshall 2018 it is supposed that a higher design strength of marine structures would have reduced the losses in addition the super typhoon mangkhut that occurred in september 2018 resulted in the strongest winds and highest storms tides ever recorded in this area in the modern era schembri 2018 current marine structures such as offshore platforms may not be able to withstand such super typhoons pes et al 2017 asserted that there was an increase in the maximum extreme wind in brazil based on the mann kendall test bertin et al 2013 developed a 109 year numerical wind wave hind cast for the north atlantic ocean based on 20th century atmospheric reanalysis the results show an increase in significant wave height of the whole north atlantic ocean when superimposed on the inter annual variability this increase reaches rates of 0 01 m year in the north of the 50 n latitude therefore the current design strength of structures are too low to use in the future and some researchers estimated design standards considering the climate change vanem 2017 established joint statistical models of significant wave height and wave period in a changing climate kulkarni et al 2014 evaluated changes in the design and operational wind due to climate change at indian offshore sites adherence to original design standards without change may result in marine disasters a study in the united states indicated that because most constructions follow the standard project hurricane fortification standard blindly new orleans has suffered devastating damage on the account of hurricanes katrina and rita with more than 100 platforms collapsing in the gulf of mexico carter 2005 mittal 2005 wisch and ward 2007 the exact calculation of extreme sea states with ultra long return periods is an effective method to reduce typhoon hazards and economic losses as a result many extreme value prediction models have been proposed and studied the peak over threshold pot method considers all higher significant wave heights above a certain threshold to adjust the parametric distribution which can increase sample size effectively durán rosal et al 2017 liu et al 2008 niroomandi et al 2018 shao et al 2018a vanem 2015 wang 2017 liu et al 2006 proposed a method called compound extreme value distribution cevd which predicts typhoon induced extreme disaster events compared with other methods cevd takes into account the typhoon frequency and it will have higher estimations the environmental contour lines method results in proper estimates of long term extremes using a short term analysis haver and winterstein 2009 li et al 2016 vanem 2016 mohammadi et al 2017 characterized the wind speed and wind power in canada by applying the birnbaum saunders distribution and it had excellent results in addition shao et al 2018b blended parameter wind field with post reported wind field improving the precision of wind field during typhoons theoretically the uncertainty of estimation will increase with the return period rising the effective design of marine defense depends on the precision of the design quantile hamdi et al 2018 the history method is suitable for estimating wind speeds for states with a return period lower than 100 years because this return period is comparable to the duration of a hurricane dataset according to iso 19901 1 a good rule of thumb is not to derive metocean parameters with return periods of more than a factor of four than the length of the dataset the effective tc records of the south china sea began in 1949 therefore accurate hind casting can go back no further than 300 years the confidence interval ci which reflects the statistical uncertainty will become wider for hind casts of ultra long return periods the ci of hind casting has to be considered for the design of marine structures using the upper limit of ci will increase investments wastefully because of very wide ci orimolade et al 2016 estimated 100 year significant wave heights using three models initial distribution model peak over threshold model and annual maxima model the study indicated that the estimated results differed from each other and that the degree of variability in the estimates depended on the dataset it showed the importance of uncertainties when estimating extreme wave values during design stages therefore the estimated results of 10 000 years will be meaningless due to the larger uncertainty in the history method in api and 2met 2005 metocean return values for periods longer than 200 years are derived based on a physical approach based on the physical relationship between typhoon parameters and the laws of probability deductive probabilistic models are proposed which is more suitable for estimating the probabilities of rare events because of its lower uncertainty the deductive probabilistic model produces new samples based on original historical data and physical mechanisms and then calculates the statistics wen and banon 1991 developed a methodology that generates the joint probability information of winds waves and current where the statistical input is based on historical hurricane information in the gulf calculating the extreme sea states in the gulf of mexico toro et al 2004 compared the deductive method with the history method the results indicated that the deductive method exhibited lower statistical uncertainties than the historical method unless the latter pools data this solves the problem that hind casting of rare events has larger uncertainty based on the concept of the deductive method many scholars estimated extreme wind speeds and analyzed typhoon wind hazards in coastal cities li and hong 2015 ou et al 2002 xiao et al 2011 mathisen and hørte 2013 developed a metocean model that can produce random hurricanes to expand the sample size some researchers have used the stochastic tc model which generates a virtual synthetic tc rumpf et al 2007 emanuel et al 2006 nakajo et al 2014 generally tcs in certain sites have a major forward direction therefore the approach angle and minimum distance of tcs to a site are not distributed uniformly and they are related however the correlation between the approach angle and minimum distance is not considered in the previously mentioned deductive model which requires further investigation in this paper the data is derived from the best track dataset for tcs over the western north pacific area based on the data wind speeds over the south china sea were calculated by the parametric typhoon model samples of typhoon parameters are selected at the time of maximum wind speed rather than the time of the closest approach in the deductive method the typhoon parameters are simulated stochastically the pressure deficit and forward velocity are generated by monte carlo simulations contrary to the previous deductive model the position of data points in the circular sub region is simulated by the non homogeneous poisson point process which improves the reproducibility of the approach angle and minimum distance in addition estimating the return levels and uncertainty of wind speeds with ultra long return periods 10 000 years or even longer the deductive method and history method are compared the pressure deficit and forward velocity are fitted by alternative distributions to analyze the uncertainty in deductive method the organization of this paper is as follows the data and preliminary analysis are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the method to calculate ultra long return levels of wind speed is introduced in section 4 the wind field model is introduced and verified in section 5 extreme value calculation model is compared and verified and the ultra long return levels of six points in the south china sea are calculated and analyzed in section 6 we discuss the sampling method

grades tc number coordinates of typhoon center central pressure and the maximum wind speed the data include the whole process of a tropical depression growing into a typhoon and a typhoon weakening to a tropical depression with snapshots every 6 h ying et al 2014 the classification of intensity grade in the dataset is shown as table 1 the weaker tc may influence the results and the parametric typhoon model is suitable for the mature tc only therefore the data is filtered only the tcs whose intensity tag is between 2 and 6 are selected the data is not used when the tc hasn t grown into tropical storm intensity tag is 0 or 1 or has undergone a process of extratropical transition intensity tag is 9 the number of tc decreased from 2355 to 1899 when filtered reducing 19 4 the frequency of tc in each year is shown as fig 1 to extract key parameters that influence a typhoon typhoon data need to be selected a certain way the method adopted generally is the circular sub region method which is based on defining a circle around the calculated point typhoons whose tracks touch this area are selected as a set of original data for samples in fig 2 the left figure shows the circular sub region and typhoons passing it whereas the right figure shows the data points in the circular sub region the circular sub region in the two sub figures represent the same area and the points in the right figure are positions of typhoon centers recorded by the dataset we suppose that typhoons passing outside the circle area have little impact on the calculated point in this paper the radius r of circle is 250 km li and hong 2015 compared data for different values of r 150 200 250 300 350 km and found both the mean value and standard deviation of typhoon parameters in the circular sub region were not sensitive to r 2 2 design standard and corresponding return period generally the design standards of ocean engineering are specified by return levels i e the design strength is determined by the extreme value of the environment load in a certain return period in other words we must ensure the safety of marine structures with a large probability when they are in service for example the failure probability of a structure in the next 50 years is required to be no more than 0 1 1 pr τ 1 50 0 1 where τ 1 is the service time year when the load on the structure first exceeds its design strength therefore we have 2 pr τ 1 k pr x 1 μ x k 1 μ x k μ q 1 q k 1 k 1 2 3 where x i is the maximum load operating on the structures in the i th year μ is the design strength of the structures q 1 f μ is the exceedance probability and t 1 q is the return period of the corresponding quantile x p therefore the following equation can be easily obtained 3 pr τ 1 k q i 1 k 1 q i 1 1 1 q k k 1 2 equation 3 represents the probability that an event xi μ occurs at least once within k years according to 1 1 q 50 0 1 we can obtain q 0 002105 and the corresponding return period is approximately 475 years the design return period is nearly 500 years although the service period is 50 years from equation 3 the higher the safety level required in structures during its service period the longer the design return period will be table 2 according to table 2 if the exceedance probability i e failure probability requirement is less than 0 01 in the next 100 years then the design return period of structures will be nearly 10 000 years obviously the estimation of a 10 000 year return level is not equivalent to forecast the sea states in the next 10 000 years in order to increase the safety of marine structures the extreme values of marine environmental elements in the ultra long return period should be calculated because marine structures are often destroyed by such rare events 2 3 extreme value distribution the extreme value distribution focuses on the extreme values of some objects while these extreme events are in the tail of the distribution generally the probability of occurrence is difficult to estimate on account of its small value the significance of the extreme value theory is to establish a distribution model which can accurately describe the characteristics of extreme events and provide forecasts of extreme events happening in the long term supposing the sample x 1 x n is a set of random variables from an independent identical distribution f x is the distribution function of totality and x i represents the value of a process in a unit of time such as the maximum wind speed at a certain observation point during a typhoon sequence the sample in ascending order x n n x 1 n and x n n x 1 n is called order statistics if we define m n max x 1 x n x 1 n m n will be called the maximum value order statistics therefore the distribution of mn is called the extreme value distribution if the length of unit time is one year mn represents the yearly maximum value let sample x 1 x n be a set of random variables from an independent identical distribution if a n 0 and b n exist when n the following equation can be established 4 lim n p r m n b n a n x h x x r where h x is a distribution of nondegenerates then h must belong the following three distribution types type ⅰ 5a h 1 x exp e x x type ii 5b h 2 x α 0 x 0 exp x α x 0 α 0 type iii 5c h 3 x α exp x α x 0 1 x 0 α 0 the type i distribution is also called the gumbel distribution type ii is also called the frechet distribution and type iii is also called the weibull distribution all of these three distributions are collectively referred to as the extreme distribution a n and b n are normalized constants this is called fisher tippett extremal type theorem if the location parameter i e μ and scale parameter i e σ are incorporated into the gumbel distribution the distribution function can be rewritten as follows 6 h 1 x exp exp x μ σ x if the scale parameter is incorporated into the weibull distribution the distribution function can be rewritten as follows 7 h 3 x α exp x σ α x 0 the two parameter gumbel distribution and two parameter weibull are used to fit samples in this paper using the extreme value theory coles et al 2001 proved that these three types of extreme value distribution could be transformed into one uniform form generalized extreme value gev distribution the distribution function of gev is 8 h x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ 1 ξ x μ σ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter the standard form of the gev distribution is when μ 0 and σ 1 the weibull distribution is obtained when ξ 0 the gumbel distribution when ξ 0 and the frechet distribution when ξ 0 3 method 3 1 overview in order to calculate the extreme wind speed in a certain return period the corresponding quantile of wind speed should be obtained according to the wind speed sample in the history model the extreme wind speed is fitted by probability distribution directly based on the original sample however the main characteristic of deductive model is to deduce the new wind speed samples according to the mechanism of wind and existing data and analyzing the new samples mainly unlike the history method which works directly with wind speed the deductive method decomposes the wind speed into basic typhoon parameter elements fitting probability distributions to these elements the new samples of parameter elements can be obtained by sampling from fitting distribution randomly the new samples of wind speed are then combined in a manner consistent with their physical relationship based on the new samples of parameter elements the occurrence and track of the typhoon are random but the wind field of a mature typhoon can be described by key physical parameters the physical parameters of the typhoon can reflect the characteristics of typhoon which may provide a train of thought for researchers to analyze the disaster of typhoon the line of thought for history method and deductive method are shown in fig 3 3 2 the calculation of typhoon parameters in general the key parameters of typhoon include the pressure deficit δp radius to maximum winds r max and forward velocity v f in addition to these three parameters the approach angle θ and the minimum distance from the typhoon track to the site r also affect wind speed at the calculated point toro et al 2004 a diagram of these parameters is shown in fig 4 the typhoon pressure deficit is the difference between the typhoon s periphery pressure p 1010 hpa for northwest pacific and its central pressure p 0 9 δ p p p 0 δp has the greatest influence on the typhoon intensity among the five typhoon parameters the forward speed of the typhoon is calculated by the location between the two adjacent points of the typhoon center in the typhoon path 10 v f β δ l l a t 2 δ l l o n 2 6 where β is the range parameter associated with the latitude as shown in table 3 it is generally believed that the isobar of a typhoon is proximate concentric circles whose center are the typhoon eye the maximum wind speed forms a circle and its radius is rmax in this paper rmax is calculated by an empirical formula proposed by graham 1959 11 r max 28 52 tanh 0 0873 φ 28 12 22 exp p 0 1010 33 86 0 2 v f 37 22 where φ represents the latitude of typhoon center the unit of p0 is hpa and the unit of rmax is km the value of rmax can be calculated using the central pressure forward velocity and position of data point the geometry of the typhoon is characterized by the minimum distance r from the typhoon track to the site and the direction of travel the minimum distance is calculated as follows 12 r 111 199 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 2 λ 1 λ 2 2 cos 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 2 1 2 where φ1 and φ2 are the latitude of the two points and λ1 and λ2 are the longitudes of the two points respectively the calculated result is expressed in km the initial data of these typhoon parameters can be calculated according to records of the best track dataset the purpose of the deductive method is to produce enough samples of these parameters and then obtain the samples of wind speed by incorporating the samples of typhoon parameters through the wind model the monte carlo simulation is an effective method to produce virtual samples if sample size of wind speed is big enough the empirical model will be selected to calculate the extreme value in this paper the extreme wind speeds are calculated by an empirical model in the deductive model as it does not require any assumptions regarding the form of the tails of the wind speed distribution 3 3 fitting and sampling key typhoon parameters typhoons can be described by δp vf rmax which are interrelated according to equation 11 rmax can be calculated using δp and vf therefore rmax is considered a function of δp and vf rather than a random variable in this paper fig 5 shows scatter plot of δp and vf for hong kong and points in figure are not clustered around a line it indicates that there is no obvious correlation between δp and vf for the other areas all the linear correlation coefficients are below 0 25 therefore their correlation can be ignored in the present work the samples are fitted by corresponding distribution the alternative fitting distributions of δp have normal log normal gumbel and weibull the alternative fitting distributions of vf have normal log normal and gumbel all distributions are analyzed with the ks test and the best fitted distribution is chosen for sampling if the p values of the ks test of each alternative distribution are less than 0 5 it will be fitted using a non parametric method the approach angle θ and minimum distance r also affect the wind speed of calculated site this is related to the position of data points in the circular sub region which is not uniform in most conditions hence θ and r are correlated and their relationship cannot be described by a linear correlation in most references θ and r are fitted and sampled without considering this correlation however the appearance of each sample point can be taken as a point process the data points are simulated by a non homogeneous spatial point poisson process in this paper for non homogeneous point processes non parametric methods can be used to estimate the density function of spatial points suppose x1 x2 xn be the sample of a spatial point the kernel density estimation of the density function f x in the circular sub region is defined as 13 f ˆ h x 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h where k is the kernel function which is selected for the gaussian distribution in this paper and h is the bandwidth the value of the bandwidth will affect the accuracy and smoothness of the function according to the mean integrated squared error minimization principle the best bandwidth can be estimated as 14 h 1 06 σ n 1 5 where n is the sample size and σ is the standard deviation taking hong kong as an example fig 6 shows the sample points in the circular sub region and the density function estimated by non parametric method arrows in figure indicate main forward direction of typhoon in this area the black line is perpendicular to the main forward direction of typhoon it can be seen that much more sample points are distributed over either side of the black line and it is apparent that there are more points below the black line than above it this is because hong kong is a coastal city the typhoon will decay once landfall the selection rejection method which is a monte carlo sampling method was used to extract samples from the density function the steps are as follows a generate a point x in the circular sub region randomly b calculate the probability density value p x at point x and the maximum value p m of the probability density function c generate a random number u from the uniform distribution u 0 1 d if u p x p m accept point x otherwise reject point x e repeat the above steps until enough sample points are generated the equal proportion simulation is adopted to extract the same number of points as the original sample in hong kong as shown in fig 7 the points in left sub figure are simulated by the poisson point process while the points in right sub figure are simulated by r and θ it indicates that sample points simulated by point poisson process are mainly distributed over both sides of the black line while simulated by r and θ are uniformly throughout the circle compared to the original sample in fig 6 sample simulated by point poisson process are more similar to the original sample the distributions of the simulated corresponding parameters r and θ by the two methods are shown in fig 8 a quantitative comparison is performed by using the error index k defined in the following equation 15 k i p s i p h i here p s and p h are the simulated and history frequency of tc parameters r and θ and i is the bin of the histogram the small value of k indicates a good simulation for r and θ the k values simulated by poisson are 78 and 42 respectively and simulated by uniform distribution are 92 and 124 respectively the k value of poisson simulation is smaller than uniform simulation especially for θ it indicates that the distribution of r and θ sample simulated by point poisson process is closer to distribution of original sample therefore simulation by the point poisson process has a better reproducibility than the uniform distribution 4 parametric wind model 4 1 overview of wind model according to the information documented in the cma sti dataset the wind speed can be calculated by the typhoon model cardone et al 1975 developed a parametric wind model that can accurately calculate wind speed this model is used in this paper 16 d w d t f w 1 ρ a δ p k h δ w τ h ρ a where w is the vertically averaged horizontal velocity f the coriolis parameter ρ a the mean air density k h the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient and h the planetary boundary layer depth the wind surface stress τ was calculated used a quadratic drag law the pressure field δ p was specified with a simple vortex cardone et al 1992 also present numerous comparisons between the model and data documenting the model s credibility the parametric equation for wind speed 20 m above the mean sea level averaged for 1 min is as follows 17 w w m r r max a r r max w m 1 exp 3 1 r r max r r max where 18 a 0 38 0 08 cos θ w m 0 885 5 6 δ p 0 5 r max f v f cos θ f 2 ω sin ϕ all terms are expressed in meter kilogram second except pressure which is in hpa 4 2 verification of wind field model to verify that the wind field model is applicable to this area two typical typhoons that occurred in northwest pacific ocean are selected for comparing between calculation and observation the position of observation stations and corresponding typhoon tracks are shown in fig 9 and table 4 the time interval of the observed values is 1 h and typhoon parameters used for calculating the wind speed are also interpolated into 1 h the results of this verification are shown in fig 10 which indicates that the simulated values are consistent with the observed values the comparison included the correlation coefficient and extreme wind speed which are shown in table 5 the correlation coefficients are all above 0 75 and the error rates of extreme wind speed are no more than 17 therefore this typhoon model is able to simulate an actual typhoon accurately 5 calculation results of extreme wind speed 5 1 comparison of calculation results the abovementioned wind field and deductive calculating models were used to calculate the extreme wind speed in five coastal cities these cities are near the south china sea and their positions are shown in fig 9 the extreme wind speed of these cities with return period of 50 years and 100 years are calculated and compared with different models and different studies to compare the deductive model with historical models the alternative distributions in historical models are fitted to the wind speed data i e gumbel weibull and gev all three distributions passed the kolmogorov smirnov ks test α 0 05 the calculated results of historical models and deductive models are shown in table 6 from the table the calculated results in historical model have a big difference what s more the results calculated by deductive model are within the results of historical models in addition the calculated extreme wind speeds are compared with the design codes and results obtained by other studies which are shown in table 7 it can be seen that the values in the present study are between those obtained by ou et al 2002 and xiao et al 2011 and are generally the closest to the design codes this indicates that this model is applicable for extreme wind calculation in the south china sea 5 2 the ultra long return level of wind speed to analyze extreme wind speeds in the south china sea six representative points were selected to calculate the return levels including ultra long return levels of the wind speed the positions of these points are shown as blue points in fig 9 and the calculated results are shown in table 8 from the table we can conclude that the return level of the 10000 year period is between 50 and 58 m s which is approximately 30 higher than the return level of the 100 year period the wind speed increases from point 1 to point 3 or from point 4 to point 6 which indicates that the extreme wind speed in the northeast is stronger than that in the southwest for points of the same longitude but different latitude the extreme wind speed in the higher latitudes is stronger than that at lower latitudes which indicate that the extreme wind speed strengthens with the increase of latitude in the south china sea this is because the south china sea is located at a low latitude and has a high temperature and typhoon will intensify as they travel northward in this region generally 6 discussion 6 1 data sampling previous studies on the deductive method select data at the time of the closest approach according to the extreme value theory we should select the maximum wind data as the sample to calculate the extreme values it cannot be denied that the maximum wind speed occurs at the time of the closest approach under most conditions however this is not always the case for example the site can be so close to typhoon that it is in the typhoon eye which results in very low wind speeds although such cases are rare it is enough to affect the results of extreme calculations therefore we selected the data at the time of maximum wind take point 1 as an example in fig 11 sample 1 represents the wind speed sample calculated by the data at the time of closest approach while sample 2 represents that calculated at the time of maximum wind the boxplot in fig 11 indicates that the values of sample 2 are much larger than those of sample 1 overall the red line in the blue box represents the mean value and this value of sample 2 is 3 64 m s larger than that of sample 1 while the return level for an exceedance probability of 10 4 estimated by sample 2 is 7 26 m s higher than that estimated by sample 1 what needs to be added is that the samples are fitted by the weibull distribution 6 2 uncertainty analysis the parameter δp has the largest influence on wind speed among the previously mentioned various typhoon parameters to illustrate the insensitivity of deductive methods to distribution models toro et al 2004 selected different distributions for fitting δp however fitting one of the typhoon parameters with different distributions cannot explain why the deductive models have a lower sensitivity for distribution models although δp is the most influential parameter in this paper δp and v f are fitted by two alternative distributions which gives four different combinations for the fitting of these two typhoon parameters these combinations are shown in table 9 bootstrapping naess and hungnes 2001 is applied to characterize the statistical uncertainty of both historical and deductive methods this method is based on resampling from a given sample supposing a set of independent samples μ μ 1 μ 2 μ n obtained from observed data of a random variable u which follows a distribution f u μ θ where θ is an unknown parameter to calculate the ci of statistics r r θ the procedure is as follows a calculate the estimated value θ ˆ of θ the probability density function is written as f u μ θ ˆ b sample from f u μ θ ˆ k times and it has n independent observed values each time which results in k sets of observed data μ j j 1 2 k c calculate the estimated value θ ˆ j according to the observed value of each set μ j which gives k estimated values of the parameter d the ci of r can be calculated using the following equations 19 s r 1 k 1 j 1 k r j r 2 20 c i r ˆ w q 2 s r r ˆ w q 2 s r where r j r θ ˆ j r 1 k j 1 k r j and w q 2 is a quantile of the normal distribution take point 1 as an example for the four combinations of the deductive method and the different distributions of the history method the ci of return levels can be calculated by the bootstrapping method for each group the comparison of the 10000 year return levels and their ci obtained by using the deductive method and history method are shown in table 10 and fig 12 the estimated value for an exceedance probability of 10 4 is similar for the four combinations used in the deductive method the maximum value is 54 50 m s calculated with the g l combination and the minimum value is 50 54 m s calculated with the w g combination the maximum difference between the four combinations in the deductive method is 3 96 m s while the difference between the weibull and gumbel distributions in the history method is 18 96 m s it can be seen that the results are more sensitive to the type of distribution in history method which indicates the history method has a larger model uncertainty the significant difference between models results in difficulty for engineers to determine design values in addition all of the estimated values obtained using the deductive method are within the range of those obtained using the history method therefore compared with the history method the deductive method is less sensitive to the distribution shape the longest ci in the deductive method is 3 12 m s in the g l combination whereas the shortest is 2 18 m s in w g combination the length of the ci in the deductive method is shorter than that in the history method which indicates that the deductive method has a lower statistical uncertainty than the history method compared with history method the deductive method has a lower overall uncertainty this is because the deductive method exploits the essential features of rare events the super rare events are often due to a combination of some moderately unlikely events studies focusing only on the ultimate interest neglect valuable information researches on the basic physical elements causing rare events can be improved by an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms in addition to empirical data 7 conclusions typhoons are the most fundamental cause of structural failure and marine disasters accurate prediction of return levels of typhoon wind speed is one of the most important criteria to formulate reasonable design standards due to marine disasters and considering climate change safer structures are required for ocean engineering higher design standards need to be extrapolated due to the enhanced requirement for security however the history method will produce very large uncertainty when hind casting return levels of rare events where the exceeding probability is less than 10 4 to calculate the extreme wind speeds with ultra long return period accurately the deductive method is used in this paper this method decomposed parameter into basic physical elements the wind speed on a site is mainly influenced by five elements δp r max v f r and θ the deductive samples of the five elements are obtained by stochastic simulation the δp and v f are fitted by different distributions and sampled by the monte carlo method and the r max is calculated using an empirical formula that depends on δp and v f the parameters r and θ have a special correlation under the influence of the typhoon s main forward direction which is not considered in the previous study to solve this problem the data points in the circular sub region are simulated by a non homogeneous poisson point process compared to the uniform distribution this method has a better reproducibility for r and θ this study utilizes the best track dataset from cma sti and quality control is taken by removing the weaker tc the sample of wind speed is calculated by cardone s parametric typhoon model the wind field model and deductive model are verified the results indicate that the calculated wind speeds are consistent with the observed values the calculated extreme wind speed for coastal cities by deductive method is the closest to the design codes compared with some other s model six typical points in the south china sea were selected to calculate the return levels including the ultra long return levels the return level of 10 000 year period is ranges from 50 to 58 m s in addition it can be found that the northeast part of the south china sea has a larger extreme wind speed than the southwest in the present work the data is selected when the chosen site has the maximum wind speed during a typhoon instead of at the time of closest approach which is more consistent with the extremum theory the return level for an exceedance probability of 10 4 using this sampling method is 7 26 m s higher than that obtained by sampling at the time of the closest approach the uncertainty of the history and deductive methods is compared in history method the sample is fitted by three different distributions four combinations of typhoon parameters which are each fitted by two alternative distributions are implemented in the deductive method the results indicate that the deductive method is less sensitive to the type of distribution and exhibits a lower statistical uncertainty than the history method therefore the deductive method exhibits a lower overall uncertainty author contributions

22139,marine disasters have occurred frequently in recent years causing enormous economic losses due to marine disasters engineers of design standards have focused on rare events with annual exceedance probabilities of 10 4 or even lower in this paper the ultra long return level of wind speed is calculated based on the deductive method which in turn is based on physical principles and the laws of probability the data is from the best track dataset for tropical cyclones over the western north pacific ocean and the wind speed is calculated by cardone s parametric wind model this wind field model has been verified by 4 observations in this paper contrary to the deductive methods used previously the sample points in the circular sub region are simulated by a non homogeneous spatial point poisson process which has a better reproducibility in addition typhoon parameters are sampled at the time of maximum wind speed instead of the time of the closest approach which is more consistent with the extremum theory the comparison of return levels in coastal cities near the south china sea indicates that the results of this study are the closest to the design codes six typical points in the south china sea are selected to calculate the extreme wind speed the wind speeds return level in the 10000 year period ranges from 50 to 58 m s in the south china sea in addition this indicates that the ultra long return level of wind speed has an increasing trend from southwest to northeast in the south china sea in terms of analyzing the uncertainty it is apparent that the deductive model has a lower uncertainty than the history method keywords extreme wind speed ultra long return period deductive method stochastic simulation typhoon parameters uncertainty abbreviation api american petroleum institute pot peak over threshold cevd compound extreme value distribution ci confidence interval qq quantile quantile ks test kolmogorov smirnov test 1 introduction typhoons are strong tropical cyclone tc occurring in the northwest pacific ocean and it is one of the most lethal and costly natural disasters affecting mankind the design of marine structures to withstand wind speed is a key consideration for marine engineering for traditional constructions of marine engineering much attention has been devoted to sea states with return periods of 30 50 and even up to 100 years however due to the increase in the number and magnitude of marine disasters in recent years stricter requirements are needed for the safety of structures what s more some scholars have found that both wind speed and wave height are increasing shi et al 2019 if the original design standards are followed the structural safety level may be too low to defend an area from severe sea states when a strong typhoon hits these marine structures they may suffer damage and fail therefore the interests in marine engineers have been shifting to extreme rare events with an annual probability of 10 4 or even lower in order to enhance the security of structures according to api standards designers require metocean parameters at very low probabilities or recurrence rates e g with a return period of 100 1000 or 10 000 years a large mount of extrapolation methods have been used based on historical data but no single method are theoretically superior even with long datasets estimations of very low probability parameters are also influenced by the extrapolation methods to a considerable degree strong winds high waves and severe storm surges associated with typhoons pose the most devastating hazards to coastal regions wu et al 2014 2018 many super typhoons passed the china sea and landed in mainland in recent years causing economic losses and even casualties the super typhoon maria july 2018 resulted in seawater flowing back into wenzhou where some marine infrastructure was damaged severely causing a direct economic loss of 3 28 billion yuan the super typhoon haiyan in 2013 resulted in 6245 deaths and thousands of injured or missing despite its early prediction holden and marshall 2018 it is supposed that a higher design strength of marine structures would have reduced the losses in addition the super typhoon mangkhut that occurred in september 2018 resulted in the strongest winds and highest storms tides ever recorded in this area in the modern era schembri 2018 current marine structures such as offshore platforms may not be able to withstand such super typhoons pes et al 2017 asserted that there was an increase in the maximum extreme wind in brazil based on the mann kendall test bertin et al 2013 developed a 109 year numerical wind wave hind cast for the north atlantic ocean based on 20th century atmospheric reanalysis the results show an increase in significant wave height of the whole north atlantic ocean when superimposed on the inter annual variability this increase reaches rates of 0 01 m year in the north of the 50 n latitude therefore the current design strength of structures are too low to use in the future and some researchers estimated design standards considering the climate change vanem 2017 established joint statistical models of significant wave height and wave period in a changing climate kulkarni et al 2014 evaluated changes in the design and operational wind due to climate change at indian offshore sites adherence to original design standards without change may result in marine disasters a study in the united states indicated that because most constructions follow the standard project hurricane fortification standard blindly new orleans has suffered devastating damage on the account of hurricanes katrina and rita with more than 100 platforms collapsing in the gulf of mexico carter 2005 mittal 2005 wisch and ward 2007 the exact calculation of extreme sea states with ultra long return periods is an effective method to reduce typhoon hazards and economic losses as a result many extreme value prediction models have been proposed and studied the peak over threshold pot method considers all higher significant wave heights above a certain threshold to adjust the parametric distribution which can increase sample size effectively durán rosal et al 2017 liu et al 2008 niroomandi et al 2018 shao et al 2018a vanem 2015 wang 2017 liu et al 2006 proposed a method called compound extreme value distribution cevd which predicts typhoon induced extreme disaster events compared with other methods cevd takes into account the typhoon frequency and it will have higher estimations the environmental contour lines method results in proper estimates of long term extremes using a short term analysis haver and winterstein 2009 li et al 2016 vanem 2016 mohammadi et al 2017 characterized the wind speed and wind power in canada by applying the birnbaum saunders distribution and it had excellent results in addition shao et al 2018b blended parameter wind field with post reported wind field improving the precision of wind field during typhoons theoretically the uncertainty of estimation will increase with the return period rising the effective design of marine defense depends on the precision of the design quantile hamdi et al 2018 the history method is suitable for estimating wind speeds for states with a return period lower than 100 years because this return period is comparable to the duration of a hurricane dataset according to iso 19901 1 a good rule of thumb is not to derive metocean parameters with return periods of more than a factor of four than the length of the dataset the effective tc records of the south china sea began in 1949 therefore accurate hind casting can go back no further than 300 years the confidence interval ci which reflects the statistical uncertainty will become wider for hind casts of ultra long return periods the ci of hind casting has to be considered for the design of marine structures using the upper limit of ci will increase investments wastefully because of very wide ci orimolade et al 2016 estimated 100 year significant wave heights using three models initial distribution model peak over threshold model and annual maxima model the study indicated that the estimated results differed from each other and that the degree of variability in the estimates depended on the dataset it showed the importance of uncertainties when estimating extreme wave values during design stages therefore the estimated results of 10 000 years will be meaningless due to the larger uncertainty in the history method in api and 2met 2005 metocean return values for periods longer than 200 years are derived based on a physical approach based on the physical relationship between typhoon parameters and the laws of probability deductive probabilistic models are proposed which is more suitable for estimating the probabilities of rare events because of its lower uncertainty the deductive probabilistic model produces new samples based on original historical data and physical mechanisms and then calculates the statistics wen and banon 1991 developed a methodology that generates the joint probability information of winds waves and current where the statistical input is based on historical hurricane information in the gulf calculating the extreme sea states in the gulf of mexico toro et al 2004 compared the deductive method with the history method the results indicated that the deductive method exhibited lower statistical uncertainties than the historical method unless the latter pools data this solves the problem that hind casting of rare events has larger uncertainty based on the concept of the deductive method many scholars estimated extreme wind speeds and analyzed typhoon wind hazards in coastal cities li and hong 2015 ou et al 2002 xiao et al 2011 mathisen and hørte 2013 developed a metocean model that can produce random hurricanes to expand the sample size some researchers have used the stochastic tc model which generates a virtual synthetic tc rumpf et al 2007 emanuel et al 2006 nakajo et al 2014 generally tcs in certain sites have a major forward direction therefore the approach angle and minimum distance of tcs to a site are not distributed uniformly and they are related however the correlation between the approach angle and minimum distance is not considered in the previously mentioned deductive model which requires further investigation in this paper the data is derived from the best track dataset for tcs over the western north pacific area based on the data wind speeds over the south china sea were calculated by the parametric typhoon model samples of typhoon parameters are selected at the time of maximum wind speed rather than the time of the closest approach in the deductive method the typhoon parameters are simulated stochastically the pressure deficit and forward velocity are generated by monte carlo simulations contrary to the previous deductive model the position of data points in the circular sub region is simulated by the non homogeneous poisson point process which improves the reproducibility of the approach angle and minimum distance in addition estimating the return levels and uncertainty of wind speeds with ultra long return periods 10 000 years or even longer the deductive method and history method are compared the pressure deficit and forward velocity are fitted by alternative distributions to analyze the uncertainty in deductive method the organization of this paper is as follows the data and preliminary analysis are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the method to calculate ultra long return levels of wind speed is introduced in section 4 the wind field model is introduced and verified in section 5 extreme value calculation model is compared and verified and the ultra long return levels of six points in the south china sea are calculated and analyzed in section 6 we discuss the sampling method and uncertainty of the models section 7 then provides a summary and conclusions 2 data preparation and preliminary analysis 2 1 data the data utilized in the present work is derived from the best track dataset tcdata typhoon org cn for tcs over the northwest pacific ocean from 1949 to 2018 this dataset was collected and created by the china meteorological administration shanghai typhoon institute cma sti the dataset records the tc occurring in the region north of the equator and west of 180 e the following information is provided for each snapshot the year of occurrence intensity grades tc number coordinates of typhoon center central pressure and the maximum wind speed the data include the whole process of a tropical depression growing into a typhoon and a typhoon weakening to a tropical depression with snapshots every 6 h ying et al 2014 the classification of intensity grade in the dataset is shown as table 1 the weaker tc may influence the results and the parametric typhoon model is suitable for the mature tc only therefore the data is filtered only the tcs whose intensity tag is between 2 and 6 are selected the data is not used when the tc hasn t grown into tropical storm intensity tag is 0 or 1 or has undergone a process of extratropical transition intensity tag is 9 the number of tc decreased from 2355 to 1899 when filtered reducing 19 4 the frequency of tc in each year is shown as fig 1 to extract key parameters that influence a typhoon typhoon data need to be selected a certain way the method adopted generally is the circular sub region method which is based on defining a circle around the calculated point typhoons whose tracks touch this area are selected as a set of original data for samples in fig 2 the left figure shows the circular sub region and typhoons passing it whereas the right figure shows the data points in the circular sub region the circular sub region in the two sub figures represent the same area and the points in the right figure are positions of typhoon centers recorded by the dataset we suppose that typhoons passing outside the circle area have little impact on the calculated point in this paper the radius r of circle is 250 km li and hong 2015 compared data for different values of r 150 200 250 300 350 km and found both the mean value and standard deviation of typhoon parameters in the circular sub region were not sensitive to r 2 2 design standard and corresponding return period generally the design standards of ocean engineering are specified by return levels i e the design strength is determined by the extreme value of the environment load in a certain return period in other words we must ensure the safety of marine structures with a large probability when they are in service for example the failure probability of a structure in the next 50 years is required to be no more than 0 1 1 pr τ 1 50 0 1 where τ 1 is the service time year when the load on the structure first exceeds its design strength therefore we have 2 pr τ 1 k pr x 1 μ x k 1 μ x k μ q 1 q k 1 k 1 2 3 where x i is the maximum load operating on the structures in the i th year μ is the design strength of the structures q 1 f μ is the exceedance probability and t 1 q is the return period of the corresponding quantile x p therefore the following equation can be easily obtained 3 pr τ 1 k q i 1 k 1 q i 1 1 1 q k k 1 2 equation 3 represents the probability that an event xi μ occurs at least once within k years according to 1 1 q 50 0 1 we can obtain q 0 002105 and the corresponding return period is approximately 475 years the design return period is nearly 500 years although the service period is 50 years from equation 3 the higher the safety level required in structures during its service period the longer the design return period will be table 2 according to table 2 if the exceedance probability i e failure probability requirement is less than 0 01 in the next 100 years then the design return period of structures will be nearly 10 000 years obviously the estimation of a 10 000 year return level is not equivalent to forecast the sea states in the next 10 000 years in order to increase the safety of marine structures the extreme values of marine environmental elements in the ultra long return period should be calculated because marine structures are often destroyed by such rare events 2 3 extreme value distribution the extreme value distribution focuses on the extreme values of some objects while these extreme events are in the tail of the distribution generally the probability of occurrence is difficult to estimate on account of its small value the significance of the extreme value theory is to establish a distribution model which can accurately describe the characteristics of extreme events and provide forecasts of extreme events happening in the long term supposing the sample x 1 x n is a set of random variables from an independent identical distribution f x is the distribution function of totality and x i represents the value of a process in a unit of time such as the maximum wind speed at a certain observation point during a typhoon sequence the sample in ascending order x n n x 1 n and x n n x 1 n is called order statistics if we define m n max x 1 x n x 1 n m n will be called the maximum value order statistics therefore the distribution of mn is called the extreme value distribution if the length of unit time is one year mn represents the yearly maximum value let sample x 1 x n be a set of random variables from an independent identical distribution if a n 0 and b n exist when n the following equation can be established 4 lim n p r m n b n a n x h x x r where h x is a distribution of nondegenerates then h must belong the following three distribution types type ⅰ 5a h 1 x exp e x x type ii 5b h 2 x α 0 x 0 exp x α x 0 α 0 type iii 5c h 3 x α exp x α x 0 1 x 0 α 0 the type i distribution is also called the gumbel distribution type ii is also called the frechet distribution and type iii is also called the weibull distribution all of these three distributions are collectively referred to as the extreme distribution a n and b n are normalized constants this is called fisher tippett extremal type theorem if the location parameter i e μ and scale parameter i e σ are incorporated into the gumbel distribution the distribution function can be rewritten as follows 6 h 1 x exp exp x μ σ x if the scale parameter is incorporated into the weibull distribution the distribution function can be rewritten as follows 7 h 3 x α exp x σ α x 0 the two parameter gumbel distribution and two parameter weibull are used to fit samples in this paper using the extreme value theory coles et al 2001 proved that these three types of extreme value distribution could be transformed into one uniform form generalized extreme value gev distribution the distribution function of gev is 8 h x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ 1 ξ x μ σ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter the standard form of the gev distribution is when μ 0 and σ 1 the weibull distribution is obtained when ξ 0 the gumbel distribution when ξ 0 and the frechet distribution when ξ 0 3 method 3 1 overview in order to calculate the extreme wind speed in a certain return period the corresponding quantile of wind speed should be obtained according to the wind speed sample in the history model the extreme wind speed is fitted by probability distribution directly based on the original sample however the main characteristic of deductive model is to deduce the new wind speed samples according to the mechanism of wind and existing data and analyzing the new samples mainly unlike the history method which works directly with wind speed the deductive method decomposes the wind speed into basic typhoon parameter elements fitting probability distributions to these elements the new samples of parameter elements can be obtained by sampling from fitting distribution randomly the new samples of wind speed are then combined in a manner consistent with their physical relationship based on the new samples of parameter elements the occurrence and track of the typhoon are random but the wind field of a mature typhoon can be described by key physical parameters the physical parameters of the typhoon can reflect the characteristics of typhoon which may provide a train of thought for researchers to analyze the disaster of typhoon the line of thought for history method and deductive method are shown in fig 3 3 2 the calculation of typhoon parameters in general the key parameters of typhoon include the pressure deficit δp radius to maximum winds r max and forward velocity v f in addition to these three parameters the approach angle θ and the minimum distance from the typhoon track to the site r also affect wind speed at the calculated point toro et al 2004 a diagram of these parameters is shown in fig 4 the typhoon pressure deficit is the difference between the typhoon s periphery pressure p 1010 hpa for northwest pacific and its central pressure p 0 9 δ p p p 0 δp has the greatest influence on the typhoon intensity among the five typhoon parameters the forward speed of the typhoon is calculated by the location between the two adjacent points of the typhoon center in the typhoon path 10 v f β δ l l a t 2 δ l l o n 2 6 where β is the range parameter associated with the latitude as shown in table 3 it is generally believed that the isobar of a typhoon is proximate concentric circles whose center are the typhoon eye the maximum wind speed forms a circle and its radius is rmax in this paper rmax is calculated by an empirical formula proposed by graham 1959 11 r max 28 52 tanh 0 0873 φ 28 12 22 exp p 0 1010 33 86 0 2 v f 37 22 where φ represents the latitude of typhoon center the unit of p0 is hpa and the unit of rmax is km the value of rmax can be calculated using the central pressure forward velocity and position of data point the geometry of the typhoon is characterized by the minimum distance r from the typhoon track to the site and the direction of travel the minimum distance is calculated as follows 12 r 111 199 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 2 λ 1 λ 2 2 cos 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 2 1 2 where φ1 and φ2 are the latitude of the two points and λ1 and λ2 are the longitudes of the two points respectively the calculated result is expressed in km the initial data of these typhoon parameters can be calculated according to records of the best track dataset the purpose of the deductive method is to produce enough samples of these parameters and then obtain the samples of wind speed by incorporating the samples of typhoon parameters through the wind model the monte carlo simulation is an effective method to produce virtual samples if sample size of wind speed is big enough the empirical model will be selected to calculate the extreme value in this paper the extreme wind speeds are calculated by an empirical model in the deductive model as it does not require any assumptions regarding the form of the tails of the wind speed distribution 3 3 fitting and sampling key typhoon parameters typhoons can be described by δp vf rmax which are interrelated according to equation 11 rmax can be calculated using δp and vf therefore rmax is considered a function of δp and vf rather than a random variable in this paper fig 5 shows scatter plot of δp and vf for hong kong and points in figure are not clustered around a line it indicates that there is no obvious correlation between δp and vf for the other areas all the linear correlation coefficients are below 0 25 therefore their correlation can be ignored in the present work the samples are fitted by corresponding distribution the alternative fitting distributions of δp have normal log normal gumbel and weibull the alternative fitting distributions of vf have normal log normal and gumbel all distributions are analyzed with the ks test and the best fitted distribution is chosen for sampling if the p values of the ks test of each alternative distribution are less than 0 5 it will be fitted using a non parametric method the approach angle θ and minimum distance r also affect the wind speed of calculated site this is related to the position of data points in the circular sub region which is not uniform in most conditions hence θ and r are correlated and their relationship cannot be described by a linear correlation in most references θ and r are fitted and sampled without considering this correlation however the appearance of each sample point can be taken as a point process the data points are simulated by a non homogeneous spatial point poisson process in this paper for non homogeneous point processes non parametric methods can be used to estimate the density function of spatial points suppose x1 x2 xn be the sample of a spatial point the kernel density estimation of the density function f x in the circular sub region is defined as 13 f ˆ h x 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h where k is the kernel function which is selected for the gaussian distribution in this paper and h is the bandwidth the value of the bandwidth will affect the accuracy and smoothness of the function according to the mean integrated squared error minimization principle the best bandwidth can be estimated as 14 h 1 06 σ n 1 5 where n is the sample size and σ is the standard deviation taking hong kong as an example fig 6 shows the sample points in the circular sub region and the density function estimated by non parametric method arrows in figure indicate main forward direction of typhoon in this area the black line is perpendicular to the main forward direction of typhoon it can be seen that much more sample points are distributed over either side of the black line and it is apparent that there are more points below the black line than above it this is because hong kong is a coastal city the typhoon will decay once landfall the selection rejection method which is a monte carlo sampling method was used to extract samples from the density function the steps are as follows a generate a point x in the circular sub region randomly b calculate the probability density value p x at point x and the maximum value p m of the probability density function c generate a random number u from the uniform distribution u 0 1 d if u p x p m accept point x otherwise reject point x e repeat the above steps until enough sample points are generated the equal proportion simulation is adopted to extract the same number of points as the original sample in hong kong as shown in fig 7 the points in left sub figure are simulated by the poisson point process while the points in right sub figure are simulated by r and θ it indicates that sample points simulated by point poisson process are mainly distributed over both sides of the black line while simulated by r and θ are uniformly throughout the circle compared to the original sample in fig 6 sample simulated by point poisson process are more similar to the original sample the distributions of the simulated corresponding parameters r and θ by the two methods are shown in fig 8 a quantitative comparison is performed by using the error index k defined in the following equation 15 k i p s i p h i here p s and p h are the simulated and history frequency of tc parameters r and θ and i is the bin of the histogram the small value of k indicates a good simulation for r and θ the k values simulated by poisson are 78 and 42 respectively and simulated by uniform distribution are 92 and 124 respectively the k value of poisson simulation is smaller than uniform simulation especially for θ it indicates that the distribution of r and θ sample simulated by point poisson process is closer to distribution of original sample therefore simulation by the point poisson process has a better reproducibility than the uniform distribution 4 parametric wind model 4 1 overview of wind model according to the information documented in the cma sti dataset the wind speed can be calculated by the typhoon model cardone et al 1975 developed a parametric wind model that can accurately calculate wind speed this model is used in this paper 16 d w d t f w 1 ρ a δ p k h δ w τ h ρ a where w is the vertically averaged horizontal velocity f the coriolis parameter ρ a the mean air density k h the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient and h the planetary boundary layer depth the wind surface stress τ was calculated used a quadratic drag law the pressure field δ p was specified with a simple vortex cardone et al 1992 also present numerous comparisons between the model and data documenting the model s credibility the parametric equation for wind speed 20 m above the mean sea level averaged for 1 min is as follows 17 w w m r r max a r r max w m 1 exp 3 1 r r max r r max where 18 a 0 38 0 08 cos θ w m 0 885 5 6 δ p 0 5 r max f v f cos θ f 2 ω sin ϕ all terms are expressed in meter kilogram second except pressure which is in hpa 4 2 verification of wind field model to verify that the wind field model is applicable to this area two typical typhoons that occurred in northwest pacific ocean are selected for comparing between calculation and observation the position of observation stations and corresponding typhoon tracks are shown in fig 9 and table 4 the time interval of the observed values is 1 h and typhoon parameters used for calculating the wind speed are also interpolated into 1 h the results of this verification are shown in fig 10 which indicates that the simulated values are consistent with the observed values the comparison included the correlation coefficient and extreme wind speed which are shown in table 5 the correlation coefficients are all above 0 75 and the error rates of extreme wind speed are no more than 17 therefore this typhoon model is able to simulate an actual typhoon accurately 5 calculation results of extreme wind speed 5 1 comparison of calculation results the abovementioned wind field and deductive calculating models were used to calculate the extreme wind speed in five coastal cities these cities are near the south china sea and their positions are shown in fig 9 the extreme wind speed of these cities with return period of 50 years and 100 years are calculated and compared with different models and different studies to compare the deductive model with historical models the alternative distributions in historical models are fitted to the wind speed data i e gumbel weibull and gev all three distributions passed the kolmogorov smirnov ks test α 0 05 the calculated results of historical models and deductive models are shown in table 6 from the table the calculated results in historical model have a big difference what s more the results calculated by deductive model are within the results of historical models in addition the calculated extreme wind speeds are compared with the design codes and results obtained by other studies which are shown in table 7 it can be seen that the values in the present study are between those obtained by ou et al 2002 and xiao et al 2011 and are generally the closest to the design codes this indicates that this model is applicable for extreme wind calculation in the south china sea 5 2 the ultra long return level of wind speed to analyze extreme wind speeds in the south china sea six representative points were selected to calculate the return levels including ultra long return levels of the wind speed the positions of these points are shown as blue points in fig 9 and the calculated results are shown in table 8 from the table we can conclude that the return level of the 10000 year period is between 50 and 58 m s which is approximately 30 higher than the return level of the 100 year period the wind speed increases from point 1 to point 3 or from point 4 to point 6 which indicates that the extreme wind speed in the northeast is stronger than that in the southwest for points of the same longitude but different latitude the extreme wind speed in the higher latitudes is stronger than that at lower latitudes which indicate that the extreme wind speed strengthens with the increase of latitude in the south china sea this is because the south china sea is located at a low latitude and has a high temperature and typhoon will intensify as they travel northward in this region generally 6 discussion 6 1 data sampling previous studies on the deductive method select data at the time of the closest approach according to the extreme value theory we should select the maximum wind data as the sample to calculate the extreme values it cannot be denied that the maximum wind speed occurs at the time of the closest approach under most conditions however this is not always the case for example the site can be so close to typhoon that it is in the typhoon eye which results in very low wind speeds although such cases are rare it is enough to affect the results of extreme calculations therefore we selected the data at the time of maximum wind take point 1 as an example in fig 11 sample 1 represents the wind speed sample calculated by the data at the time of closest approach while sample 2 represents that calculated at the time of maximum wind the boxplot in fig 11 indicates that the values of sample 2 are much larger than those of sample 1 overall the red line in the blue box represents the mean value and this value of sample 2 is 3 64 m s larger than that of sample 1 while the return level for an exceedance probability of 10 4 estimated by sample 2 is 7 26 m s higher than that estimated by sample 1 what needs to be added is that the samples are fitted by the weibull distribution 6 2 uncertainty analysis the parameter δp has the largest influence on wind speed among the previously mentioned various typhoon parameters to illustrate the insensitivity of deductive methods to distribution models toro et al 2004 selected different distributions for fitting δp however fitting one of the typhoon parameters with different distributions cannot explain why the deductive models have a lower sensitivity for distribution models although δp is the most influential parameter in this paper δp and v f are fitted by two alternative distributions which gives four different combinations for the fitting of these two typhoon parameters these combinations are shown in table 9 bootstrapping naess and hungnes 2001 is applied to characterize the statistical uncertainty of both historical and deductive methods this method is based on resampling from a given sample supposing a set of independent samples μ μ 1 μ 2 μ n obtained from observed data of a random variable u which follows a distribution f u μ θ where θ is an unknown parameter to calculate the ci of statistics r r θ the procedure is as follows a calculate the estimated value θ ˆ of θ the probability density function is written as f u μ θ ˆ b sample from f u μ θ ˆ k times and it has n independent observed values each time which results in k sets of observed data μ j j 1 2 k c calculate the estimated value θ ˆ j according to the observed value of each set μ j which gives k estimated values of the parameter d the ci of r can be calculated using the following equations 19 s r 1 k 1 j 1 k r j r 2 20 c i r ˆ w q 2 s r r ˆ w q 2 s r where r j r θ ˆ j r 1 k j 1 k r j and w q 2 is a quantile of the normal distribution take point 1 as an example for the four combinations of the deductive method and the different distributions of the history method the ci of return levels can be calculated by the bootstrapping method for each group the comparison of the 10000 year return levels and their ci obtained by using the deductive method and history method are shown in table 10 and fig 12 the estimated value for an exceedance probability of 10 4 is similar for the four combinations used in the deductive method the maximum value is 54 50 m s calculated with the g l combination and the minimum value is 50 54 m s calculated with the w g combination the maximum difference between the four combinations in the deductive method is 3 96 m s while the difference between the weibull and gumbel distributions in the history method is 18 96 m s it can be seen that the results are more sensitive to the type of distribution in history method which indicates the history method has a larger model uncertainty the significant difference between models results in difficulty for engineers to determine design values in addition all of the estimated values obtained using the deductive method are within the range of those obtained using the history method therefore compared with the history method the deductive method is less sensitive to the distribution shape the longest ci in the deductive method is 3 12 m s in the g l combination whereas the shortest is 2 18 m s in w g combination the length of the ci in the deductive method is shorter than that in the history method which indicates that the deductive method has a lower statistical uncertainty than the history method compared with history method the deductive method has a lower overall uncertainty this is because the deductive method exploits the essential features of rare events the super rare events are often due to a combination of some moderately unlikely events studies focusing only on the ultimate interest neglect valuable information researches on the basic physical elements causing rare events can be improved by an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms in addition to empirical data 7 conclusions typhoons are the most fundamental cause of structural failure and marine disasters accurate prediction of return levels of typhoon wind speed is one of the most important criteria to formulate reasonable design standards due to marine disasters and considering climate change safer structures are required for ocean engineering higher design standards need to be extrapolated due to the enhanced requirement for security however the history method will produce very large uncertainty when hind casting return levels of rare events where the exceeding probability is less than 10 4 to calculate the extreme wind speeds with ultra long return period accurately the deductive method is used in this paper this method decomposed parameter into basic physical elements the wind speed on a site is mainly influenced by five elements δp r max v f r and θ the deductive samples of the five elements are obtained by stochastic simulation the δp and v f are fitted by different distributions and sampled by the monte carlo method and the r max is calculated using an empirical formula that depends on δp and v f the parameters r and θ have a special correlation under the influence of the typhoon s main forward direction which is not considered in the previous study to solve this problem the data points in the circular sub region are simulated by a non homogeneous poisson point process compared to the uniform distribution this method has a better reproducibility for r and θ this study utilizes the best track dataset from cma sti and quality control is taken by removing the weaker tc the sample of wind speed is calculated by cardone s parametric typhoon model the wind field model and deductive model are verified the results indicate that the calculated wind speeds are consistent with the observed values the calculated extreme wind speed for coastal cities by deductive method is the closest to the design codes compared with some other s model six typical points in the south china sea were selected to calculate the return levels including the ultra long return levels the return level of 10 000 year period is ranges from 50 to 58 m s in addition it can be found that the northeast part of the south china sea has a larger extreme wind speed than the southwest in the present work the data is selected when the chosen site has the maximum wind speed during a typhoon instead of at the time of closest approach which is more consistent with the extremum theory the return level for an exceedance probability of 10 4 using this sampling method is 7 26 m s higher than that obtained by sampling at the time of the closest approach the uncertainty of the history and deductive methods is compared in history method the sample is fitted by three different distributions four combinations of typhoon parameters which are each fitted by two alternative distributions are implemented in the deductive method the results indicate that the deductive method is less sensitive to the type of distribution and exhibits a lower statistical uncertainty than the history method therefore the deductive method exhibits a lower overall uncertainty author contributions
