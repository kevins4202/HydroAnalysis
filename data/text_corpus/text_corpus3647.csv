18235,this study proposed an integrated process for biogas generation and biochar production from thermal hydrolysis pretreated sludge thp sludge in this study the liquid and solids fractions of thp sludge were separately processed for the first time the liquid fraction of thp sludge thp l reached the biodegradability 262 6 5 1 ml ch4 g tcodfeed on the 15th day during anaerobic treatment while the solids fraction of thp sludge thp s only contributed 31 0 to the total methane production and required more than 30 days digestion time we investigated the feasibility to convert thp s into biochar to realize the higher value of the solids fraction the results prove the produced biochar can be used as slow release fertilizer preliminary energy analysis was performed to evaluate the energy efficiency of the integrated approach namely methane generation from thp l coupled with biochar production from thp s the process realized energy surplus of 0 81 mwh tonne dry sludge in addition thp l digested sludge showed better dewaterability lower yield stress and reduced viscosity during digestion the proposed new sludge treatment process therefore has lower operating cost and higher value returns graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion thermal hydrolysis pretreatment liquid solids separation rheological properties energy analysis 1 introduction huge amount

anaerobic digestion ad is a widely adopted and proven technique with relatively lower cost to stabilize sludge and recover energy pilli et al 2014 however the rate limiting step of hydrolysis slows down the overall ad process and hampers the application of this technology tyagi et al 2014 various pretreatment methods have been developed to enhance the hydrolysis efficiency and subsequently to promote ad such as thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp chemical mechanical and biological pretreatment gonzalez et al 2018 li et al 2016 zhen et al 2017 among them thp has been successfully implemented commercially for a few years in the thp process sludge is heated up to around 165 c under high pressure conditions prior to ad han et al 2017 the merits of thp such as enhanced biodegradability improved dewaterability and reduced sludge viscosity have been well documented recently bougrier et al 2008 ennouri et al 2016 up to 60 sludge solubilization could achieve with thp bougrier et al 2008 this means abundant dissolved substances would be present in the liquid fraction of thp sludge thp l soluble organics are regarded as the readily usable carbon source for bacteria compared with solid particulates lu et al 2018b the digestion of thp sludge filtrate has been performed previously and the digestion time is faster than that of thp sludge 7 9 days vs 12 15 days li et al 2017 lu et al 2018a xue et al 2015 thus the solids fraction of thp sludge thp s would have less readily biodegradable organic matters which results in the less biogas generation and or longer digestion period meaning larger reactors however there is no literature so far to report the needs to digest the solids fraction of thp sludge and the contribution to biogas production from the solids portion is not clear it is well known that sludge displays non newtonian flow behavior eshtiaghi et al 2013 zhang et al 2016a its rheological characteristics are important parameters which greatly affect sludge treatment processes including dewatering drying mixing pumping and transport chaari et al 2003 xia et al 2009 with better flowability the energy required to homogenize and transport the feedstock could be reduced due to the lower head loss and pumping power zhang et al 2016a the different sludge origin and solids content would affect the rheology of sludge feng et al 2014 it is known that the dewaterability and flow behavior such as yield stress and viscosity of sludge could be significantly improved by thp treatment barber 2016 the lower viscosity and yield stress usually correspond to the better dewaterability miryahyaei et al 2019 however such good thp sludge properties could not be maintained during the anaerobic digestion the dewaterability of the thp sludge during digestion is generally worse than the original thp sludge zhang et al 2018 thus it would make more sense to carry out the dewatering step prior to ad to separate the liquid and solids portions more efficiently to date it is lack of information on the feasibility and assessment on such separation the main objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the ad performance of thp sludge thp l and thp s 2 study the rheological properties of different sludge fractions during ad 3 propose an integrated system to handle both liquid and solids portions of thp sludge in an energy efficient way the preliminary energy analysis for the proposed process was performed 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge source and preparation waste activated sludge was and anaerobic seed sludge were collected from a local water reclamation plant in singapore they were concentrated and stored at 4 c before use the concentrated was was thermally hydrolyzed with a pressure reactor model 4534 parr instrument company us under 165 4 c for 30 min then the pretreated sludge was cooled down to the room temperature and collected as the original thp sludge after centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min the supernatant and solids part of original thp sludge were collected separately the original thp sludge liquid and solids fractions of original thp sludge were diluted with distilled water named thp sludge thp l and thp s before used as feed for ad three sets of each type of sludge were prepared each set was characterized separately the characteristics of different sludge before anaerobic digestion are shown in table 1 2 2 anaerobic digestion of different types of sludge all ad experiments were conducted using an automatic methane potential test system ampts ⅱ bioprocess control company sweden feed sludge namely thp sludge thp l and thp s was separately fed into the reactors containing anaerobic sludge as seed sludge the vs ratio of inoculum to substrate was around 0 95 g vs g vs according to neves et al 2004 and lu et al 2018b control tests were carried out with was as feed sludge reactors containing deionized water and seed sludge were prepared as blank experiments to correct the background methane potential of the inoculum each reactor had a working volume of 400 ml and headspace of 150 ml all reactors were purged with n2 first and sealed immediately the ad process was operated at 35 c for 30 days with stirring 80 rpm four replicates were set up for each type of feed sludge two reactors were operated for 30 days to monitor the methane production the methane yield was normalized to the unit of ml ch4 g tcodadd the other two reactors were sampled on 0 2nd 5th 10th 15th 30th day to study the organics transformation and sludge behavior changes 2 3 biochar preparation and determination of elemental content biochar was produced through pyrolysis process according to the method described in qian et al 2019 briefly thp s was dried at 70 c ground and sieved 250 μm then it was packed into a crucible and heated in a furnace at 600 c for 2 h after cooling down biochar was ground and sieved 250 μm before test the elements of c h n were measured by the elemental analyzer elementar vario el cube before the determination of metal elements biochar was digested following the process reported in qian et al 2019 after digestion the concentration of p was determined using the molybdate ascorbic acid method the concentrations of fe mg na k and ca were tested by icp oes perkinelmer optima 8300 and the concentrations of heavy metals cr mn ni as mo cd co pb cu al and zn were measured

to the measurement of soluble substances the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min and filtration through 0 45 μm nylon filters sludge filterability was indicated by capillary suction time cst cst was measured using an apparatus ofite capillary suction timer ofi testing equipment houston usa according to sun et al 2018a the improvement of sludge dewaterability was assessed with cst reduction percentage r according to eq 1 1 r c s t 0 c s t d c s t 0 100 where cst0 represents the cst of the sludge before digestion cstd represents the cst of digested sludge 2 4 2

literature xiao et al 2017 after filtrated through 0 45 μm nylon filters the samples were subjected to downstream analysis i e dissolved organic carbon doc polysaccharides proteins and size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection and organic nitrogen detection sec ocd ond analysis doc was assessed with a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan proteins and polysaccharides were measured as previously described lu et al 2018b the composition of doc was classified with a sec ocd ond system doc labor karlsruhe germany the identified hydrophilic organics were mainly divided into biopolymers 20 kda including high molecular weight hmw proteins and hmw polysaccharides humic substances hs building blocks 300 500 da low molecular weight lmw acids 350 da and lmw neutrals 350 da according to the respective properties and molecular weight 1g of proteins and polysaccharides equal to 0 497 and 0 444 g of equivalent carbon based on the proposed chemical formulae of c52 5h6 65n16o21 5s2 and c6h10o5 n the concentration of lmw polysaccharides and lmw proteins was obtained by subtracting hmw polysaccharides and hmw proteins from the total polysaccharides and proteins respectively 2 5 rheological test rheological measurements were carried out by a rheometer physica mcr102 modular compact rheometer anton paar austria equipped with a concentric cylinder system cup radius of 28 92 mm height of 73 10 mm prior to each test the sludge sample was pre sheared at 300 s 1 for 2 5 min followed by 5 min rest at zero shear rate the flow tests were performed to investigate the flow behavior of sludge samples the shear rate ramped up from 9 5 to 1000 s 1 in all the rheological tests the temperature was maintained at 15 c by a chiller herschel bulkley model eq

feed sludge 3 1 1 biodegradability of different feed sludge the cumulative methane production with different feed sludge is compared in fig 1 the maximum methane production 262 6 5 1 ml ch4 g tcodfeed was obtained during the digestion of thp l which is consistent with the results in li et al 2017 who obtained the cumulative methane yield of 240 320 ml g tcod by digesting the filtrate from hydrothermally pretreated sewage sludge 180 c 30 min the digestion of thp sludge obtained the lower methane yield of 134 9 3 6 ml g tcodfeed followed by the digestion of raw was and thp s this indicates the higher percentage of biodegradable substances was in thp l and that was lower in thp s it should be noted the initial methane production rate in thp sludge reactors was slower than that in was reactors which is consistent with the previous report lu et al 2018a besides the initial methane production rate in thp s reactors was much slower than that in was reactors while it was much faster in thp l reactors suggesting that the rate limiting factor of thp sludge digestion was more related to the solids substances the digestion time of thp l was much shorter than other reactors the biogas production ceased in thp l reactors on the 15th day and it stopped in thp sludge digesters on the 22nd day while the raw was and thp s digesters continued the biogas generation till 30th day it confirms the solids fraction prolonged the overall digestion time of thp sludge it should be noted that the digestion time of thp l and thp sludge in this study is slightly longer than other reported results which may be due to the much higher sludge concentration and lower inoculum to substrate ratio jensen et al 2011 3 1 2 contribution of different feed sludge to methane production based on 30 days digestion time the conversion performance of 1 l was to methane through the direct digestion of raw was the digestion of thp sludge or separate digestion of thp l and thp s is shown in fig 2 in this study 1 l of thp sludge was separated to 60 57 g tcod of solids and 47 53 g tcod of liquid 0 85 l the separated thp ad process markedly improved the methane production by 65 93 compared to the traditional ad process with raw was as feed and improved by 24 08 compared to thp sludge ad process without liquid solid separation the methane generation of thp s only accounted for 31 0 of the total methane production and the digestion time was doubled compared to thp l digestion if the digestion stops at day 15 the biogas contribution from thp s would be even less as the biodegradability of the solids fraction is relatively low it would make more sense to treat this part of solids by other methods e g incineration or biochar production the excellent dewaterability of thp sludge also makes the separation of solids feasible table 1 3 1 3 soluble substances transformation during anaerobic digestion fig 3 a shows the organics transformation of different sludge fractions during digestion tb eps was dominant in eps matrix of was while most of organic matters were released to extracellular locations after thp treatment leading to the significant increase of sb eps and lb eps fractions in thp sludge the release is mainly due to the great solubilization of eps matrix and microbial fragments during high temperature thermal hydrolysis lu et al 2018a during digestion all the organics in three eps fractions were consumed gradually while they did not change much in blank reactors fig s1 in was reactors the initial concentration of soluble organics was very low and it barely changed during 30 days digestion process in thp reactors including thp sludge thp l and thp s reactors the reduction of sb eps fraction was the highest followed by lb eps and tb eps which indicates the organics in sb eps and lb eps are more accessible to microbes from fig 3a higher sb eps fraction was found in thp l reactors compared to that in other reactors which may be one of the causes that promoted the biodegradability of thp l within the first 15 days most of the dissolved biodegradable organics were consumed in reactors of thp sludge 95 2 thp l 96 7 and thp s 98 0 as shown in fig 3a particularly the reduction of soluble biodegradable proteins and polysaccharides reached 98 0 and 99 3 respectively in thp l reactors fig s2 thus 15 days of the operation time would be recommended for thp l reactors due to the optimal removal of biodegradable proteins and polysaccharides as well as the achievement of maximum methane generation the specific fractions of soluble organics were determined as shown in fig 3b to study their transformation in anaerobic digesters with different feed sludge in reactors of thp sludge thp l and thp s most of the organic matters were consumed including lmw proteins hmw proteins lmw polysaccharides hmw polysaccharides hs building blocks and lmw neutrals among them lmw proteins lmw neutrals and lmw polysaccharides were greatly removed which accounted for 40 6 19 3 18 3 of total doc removal in thp sludge reactors 42 0 22 3 15 3 in thp l reactors and 54 0 15 2 and 10 4 in thp s reactors respectively the results imply lmw proteins lmw neutrals and lmw polysaccharides are the main contributors to biogas generation the total initial concentration of lmw proteins lmw neutrals and lmw polysaccharides in thp l reactors was 46 7 higher than that in thp sludge digesters and almost 3 times of that in thp s digesters which would explain the higher biogas production in thp l reactors it is noteworthy that the concentration of hs like substances hs and building blocks increased within the first 2 days and reduced gradually from the 5th day during digestion in all reactors fig 3b it is reasonable that the breakdown of other substances could form part of hs like substances which are relatively recalcitrant to anaerobic microbes provenzano et al 2014 and hs degrading microorganisms likely need some acclimation time at the early stage of digestion the percentage of hs like substances reduction was higher in thp l reactors 20 8 followed by thp sludge reactors 16 8 and thp s reactors 9 5 in summary more and relatively easy biodegradable soluble organics existed in thp l reactors which facilitated the access of microbes to organics and promoted the sludge biodegradability 3 2 the physicochemical properties of sludge during anaerobic digestion 3 2 1 the dewaterability of sludge during anaerobic digestion the cst values of different digested sludge from thp sludge thp l and thp s reactors were compared as shown in fig 4 the lower cst value of samples indicates better dewaterability the cst values of digested was samples were higher than 2000 s out of the range of this cst testing equipment which were not shown in this study apparently the dewaterability of thp l digested sludge is the best which may be attributed to the less suspended solids content and the larger surface area of thp l digested sludge miryahyaei et al 2019 during ad operation the cst values of all types of digested sludge decreased indicating that ad could improve the sludge dewaterability this finding could be well supported by xu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2018 however the dewaterability of thp l digested sludge collected on the 30th day was not better than that collected on the 15th day it is noted that the consumption of organics nearly ceased in thp l reactors before day 15 and hmw polysaccharides and hmw proteins even increased with digestion afterwards fig 3b hence the minor starvation condition may cause the excess secretion of eps and deteriorate the sludge dewaterability with long digestion period the highest cst reduction of sludge samples was obtained on the 15th day for thp l reactors 17 0 15th day for thp sludge reactors 16 1 and 30th day for thp s reactors 3 3 the improved dewaterability would be of great benefit for sludge volume reduction and help to save huge amounts of operational cost for sludge conditioning and dewatering before further treatment it should be noted that the worst dewaterability of seed sludge deteriorated the dewaterability of all type of digested sludge once mixed together table 1 separating the solids and liquid fractions of thp sludge before ad would make more sense 3 2 2 the rheological properties of sludge during anaerobic digestion the rheological properties of sludge play an important role in heat and mass transfer process during bioreactions they also affect the design and cost of sludge treatment such as piping stirring and transport generally the apparent viscosity η shear rate at 19 4 s 1 of digested sludge decreased with increasing digestion time fig 5 a suggesting a better flowability of sludge in the digesters this reduction in apparent viscosity was mainly attributed to the reduction of organic matters in sludge mori et al 2008 among these four types of digested sludge samples sludge in was reactors showed the most prominent reduction of apparent viscosity with the reduction of 35 8 during the first five days fig 5a the apparent viscosity of sludge in thp related reactors was much lower than that in was reactors suggesting that thp treatment improved overall sludge properties prior to ad in addition it is reasonable that sludge from thp l reactors was always less viscous due to the exponential relationship between the sludge viscosity and solids content dhar et al 2012 the rheogram of different ad sludge was well fitted by the herschel bulkley model where the τy k and n are shown in fig 5b and table s2 furthermore the yield stress of digested sludge also decreased with the digestion time indicating ad weakened the internal structure in addition it can be observed that the evolution of yield stress with digestion time was highly consistent with that of apparent viscosity for the same type of feed the reduction of both parameters for thp related ad sludge is likely induced by the continuous transformation of dissolved materials to biogas during digestion zhang et al 2016a it is worth noting that the apparent viscosity and yield stress of thp related ad sludge increased slightly at later stage probably due to the formation of eps including hmw polysaccharides and hmw proteins by microorganisms as shown in fig 3b comparing the sludge viscosity with cst values the highly viscous sludge seemed to have poor dewaterability which is consistent with the findings in li and yang 2007 the apparent viscosity and yield stress values of the feed sludge are shown in table 1 the original seed sludge and was had worse flowability while thp treated sludge including thp l thp sludge and thp s behaved better fluidity after mixing with seed sludge the viscosity and yield stress of thp related ad sludge became much higher it would require more energy to stir or pump this digested sludge effectively generally thp sludge has better dewaterability and flowability but these good properties would be affected by mixing with seed sludge even the digested thp sludge has worse filterability and fluidity compared with the original feed thp sludge in addition the liquid fraction of thp sludge could be digested with short retention time and it also has higher biodegradability by contrast the solids portion of thp sludge not only produces less methane but also prolongs the digestion period thus it would be promising if the liquid and solids fractions of thp sludge are separated before ad and transferred to different processes 3 3 biochar production and properties apparently thp l should be separately treated for energy recovery while the solids portion of thp s should be also properly handled with higher recovery value it was reported that the biochar produced from sewage sludge could be used as the fertilizer chen et al 2015 qian et al 2019 and the biochar production from sludge could be energy surplus li et al 2017 therefore the production of valuable biochar would help to solve the problem of sludge reduction and realize the full utilization of sewage sludge biochar yield from the dry thp s was 33 the content of nutrients is important to evaluate if the biochar is suitable to be applied as a fertilizer table 2 shows the content of main elements in biochar including p fe ca al mg k and na the content of p was as high as 61 82 mg g which is comparable to p content of 0 2 73 0 mg g in biochar reported in previous literature chan and xu 2009 sun et al 2018b in practice the addition of biochar to soil was reported to affect the microbial community prayogo et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b proved that applying biochar at a low application rate could improve the grain yields in addition the content of heavy metals in biochar limits its application as the amounts of heavy metals are strictly regulated uysal et al 2010 the content of various heavy metals in the biochar produced from thp s is shown in table 3 it appears that the levels of heavy metals in biochar were all below their limits for fertilizer nzihou and stanmore 2013 moreover the bioavailability and eco toxicity of heavy metals in biochar were significantly reduced after pyrolysis devi and saroha 2014 thus biochar produced from the thp s has potential to be used as a fertilizer or soil remediation additive 3 4 energy analysis the integrated process for target resource recovery from thp sludge is proposed as shown in fig 6 thp l is separately treated for biogas generation and thp s is pyrolyzed to produce biochar for the liquid treatment facility granular or biofilm based process can be employed to further enhance the conversion efficiency it is known that expanded granular sludge bed egsb systems have high organic conversion efficiency with organic loading up to 22 5 kg cod m3 day liu et al 2012 it has been used to treat alkaline fermentation liquid of was high strength organic wastewater landfill leachate and so on jing et al 2016 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 in this study the organic loading rate of thp l reactors was only 1 86 kg cod m3 day 0 096 kg cod kg vss day future study can be focused on employing egsb reactors to handle the thp l stream this would shorten the hydraulic retention time hrt further the facilities set up and operation of the proposed approach are very close to that of the current existing thp ad process fig 6 and fig s5 it includes thermal hydrolysis reactor thp anaerobic digester ad liquid solids separation with the belt press or centrifuge sludge dewatering and sludge dryer drying barber 2016 mills et al 2014 the dried sludge is either sent to incineration plant or pyrolysis plant the energy consumption of pyrolysis plant or incineration plant is estimated while its capital cost is not considered as incineration plant or pyrolysis plant is normally not part of wastewater treatment facilities in wastewater treatment plant furthermore the sludge transportation cost is not included in this study the anaerobic reactor that receives thp l in fact should have a much smaller footprint given the shortened digestion time it suggests the existing sludge treatment facilities and flow in wwtps can be rearranged to facilitate the process and save the capital cost for the proposed process the energy analysis for this sludge management approach was calculated based on a plant with a treatment capacity of 45000 m3 d was it is obvious this process realizes the energy surplus of 1800 mwh d 0 81 mwh tonne ds which is more energy efficient compared with the conventional was ad process and thp ad process table s3 for the proposed approach the main energy cost is for thp s pyrolysis 2000 mwh d and the second major energy input is for sludge thermal hydrolysis 837 mwh d followed by the energy requirement for sludge dewatering and liquid solids separation notwithstanding thp process can be driven by waste heat from various industries barber 2016 the required energy for thickening and dewatering processes highly depends on sludge properties the better dewaterability and lower viscosity of thp sludge and thp l ad sludge would further reduce the total treatment cost on the other hand the benefits of produced biochar 2740 mwh d accounted for more than half of the total output followed by the contribution of methane generated by thp l digestion given the excellent dewaterability of thp sludge before ad the direct separation of thp s for pyrolysis saves energy requirement for sludge drying before incineration which is the top energy consumer in sludge processing table s3 moreover the pyrolysis of solids instead of incineration would decrease the release of air pollutants to the atmosphere and also reduce the incineration ashes as such the integrated process of methane generation from thp l treatment coupled with biochar production from thp s pyrolysis is an environmentally and energy efficiently sustainable approach 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility to recover resources by separating the liquid and solids portions of thp sludge the thp l and thp s portions were anaerobically digested separately compared to thp sludge digestion 24 1 more methane was produced from this separated digestion however the solids portion of thp sludge contributed much less to total methane generation only 31 0 and prolonged the digestion period from 15 to 30 days thus in this study a new approach that converts the solids portion to valuable biochar was proposed the energy assessment confirms that the integrated approach of biochar production from thp s pyrolysis and biogas generation from thp l digestion is energy efficient moreover the better dewaterability and lower viscosity of thp l digested sludge make the process more feasible and practicable

18235,this study proposed an integrated process for biogas generation and biochar production from thermal hydrolysis pretreated sludge thp sludge in this study the liquid and solids fractions of thp sludge were separately processed for the first time the liquid fraction of thp sludge thp l reached the biodegradability 262 6 5 1 ml ch4 g tcodfeed on the 15th day during anaerobic treatment while the solids fraction of thp sludge thp s only contributed 31 0 to the total methane production and required more than 30 days digestion time we investigated the feasibility to convert thp s into biochar to realize the higher value of the solids fraction the results prove the produced biochar can be used as slow release fertilizer preliminary energy analysis was performed to evaluate the energy efficiency of the integrated approach namely methane generation from thp l coupled with biochar production from thp s the process realized energy surplus of 0 81 mwh tonne dry sludge in addition thp l digested sludge showed better dewaterability lower yield stress and reduced viscosity during digestion the proposed new sludge treatment process therefore has lower operating cost and

al 2017 lu et al 2018a xue et al 2015 thus the solids fraction of thp sludge thp s would have less readily biodegradable organic matters which results in the less biogas generation and or longer digestion period meaning larger reactors however there is no literature so far to report the needs to digest the solids fraction of thp sludge and the contribution to biogas production from the solids portion is not clear it is well known that sludge displays non newtonian flow behavior eshtiaghi et al 2013 zhang et al 2016a its rheological characteristics are important parameters which greatly affect sludge treatment processes including dewatering drying mixing pumping and transport chaari et al 2003 xia et al 2009 with better flowability the energy required to homogenize and transport the feedstock could be reduced due to the lower head loss and pumping power zhang et al 2016a the different sludge origin and solids content would affect the rheology of sludge feng et al 2014 it is known that the dewaterability and flow behavior such as yield stress and viscosity of sludge could be significantly improved by thp treatment barber 2016 the lower viscosity and yield stress usually correspond to the better dewaterability miryahyaei et al 2019 however such good thp sludge properties could not be maintained during the anaerobic digestion the dewaterability of the thp sludge during digestion is generally worse than the original thp sludge zhang et al 2018 thus it would make more sense to carry out the dewatering step prior to ad to separate the liquid and solids portions more efficiently to date it is lack of information on the feasibility and assessment on such separation the main objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the ad performance of thp sludge thp l and thp s 2 study the rheological properties of different sludge fractions during ad 3 propose an integrated system to handle both liquid and solids portions of thp sludge in an energy efficient way the preliminary energy analysis for the proposed process was performed 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge source and preparation waste activated sludge was and anaerobic seed sludge were collected from a local water reclamation plant in singapore they were concentrated and stored at 4 c before use the concentrated was was thermally hydrolyzed with a pressure reactor model 4534 parr instrument company us under 165 4 c for 30 min then the pretreated sludge was cooled down to the room temperature and collected as the original thp sludge after centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min the supernatant and solids part of original thp sludge were collected separately the original thp sludge liquid and solids fractions of original thp sludge were diluted with distilled water named thp sludge thp l and thp s before used as feed for ad three sets of each type of sludge were prepared each set was characterized separately the characteristics of different sludge before anaerobic digestion are shown in table 1 2 2 anaerobic digestion of different types of sludge all ad experiments were conducted using an automatic methane potential test system ampts ⅱ bioprocess control company sweden feed sludge namely thp sludge thp l and thp s was separately fed into the reactors containing anaerobic sludge as seed sludge the vs ratio of inoculum to substrate was around 0 95 g vs g vs according to neves et al 2004 and lu et al 2018b control tests were carried out with was as feed sludge reactors containing deionized water and seed sludge were prepared as blank experiments to correct the background methane potential of the inoculum each reactor had a working volume of 400 ml and headspace of 150 ml all reactors were purged with n2 first and sealed immediately the ad process was operated at 35 c for 30 days with stirring 80 rpm four replicates were set up for each type of feed sludge two reactors were operated for 30 days to monitor the methane production the methane yield was normalized to the unit of ml ch4 g tcodadd the other two reactors were sampled on 0 2nd 5th 10th 15th 30th day to study the organics transformation and sludge behavior changes 2 3 biochar preparation and determination of elemental content biochar was produced through pyrolysis process according to the method described in qian et al 2019 briefly thp s was dried at 70 c ground and sieved 250 μm then it was packed into a crucible and heated in a furnace at 600 c for 2 h after cooling down biochar was ground and sieved 250 μm before test the elements of c h n were measured by the elemental analyzer elementar vario el cube before the determination of metal elements biochar was digested following the process reported in qian et al 2019 after digestion the concentration of p was determined using the molybdate ascorbic acid method the concentrations of fe mg na k and ca were tested by icp oes perkinelmer optima 8300 and the concentrations of heavy metals cr mn ni as mo cd co pb cu al and zn were measured

to the measurement of soluble substances the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min and filtration through 0 45 μm nylon filters sludge filterability was indicated by capillary suction time cst cst was measured using an apparatus ofite capillary suction timer ofi testing equipment houston usa according to sun et al 2018a the improvement of sludge dewaterability was assessed with cst reduction percentage r according to eq 1 1 r c s t 0 c s t d c s t 0 100 where cst0 represents the cst of the sludge before digestion cstd represents the cst of digested sludge 2 4 2 extracellular polymeric substances eps extraction and analysis eps of sludge samples was extracted as soluble eps sb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps referring to the literature xiao et al 2017 after filtrated through 0 45 μm nylon filters the samples were subjected to downstream analysis i e dissolved organic carbon doc polysaccharides proteins and size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection and organic nitrogen detection sec ocd ond analysis doc was assessed with a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan proteins and polysaccharides were measured as previously described lu et al 2018b the composition of doc was classified with a sec ocd ond system doc labor karlsruhe germany the identified hydrophilic organics were mainly divided into biopolymers 20 kda including high molecular weight hmw proteins and hmw polysaccharides humic substances hs building blocks 300 500 da low molecular weight lmw acids 350 da and lmw neutrals 350 da according to the respective properties and molecular weight 1g of proteins and polysaccharides equal to 0 497 and 0 444 g of equivalent carbon based on the proposed chemical formulae of c52 5h6 65n16o21 5s2 and c6h10o5 n the concentration of lmw polysaccharides and lmw proteins was obtained by subtracting hmw polysaccharides and hmw proteins from the total polysaccharides and proteins respectively 2 5 rheological test rheological measurements were carried out by a rheometer physica mcr102 modular compact rheometer anton paar austria equipped with a concentric cylinder system cup radius of 28 92 mm height of 73 10 mm prior to each test the sludge sample was pre sheared at 300 s 1 for 2 5 min followed by 5 min rest at zero shear rate the flow tests were performed to investigate the flow behavior of sludge samples the shear rate ramped up from 9 5 to 1000 s 1 in all the rheological tests the temperature was maintained at 15 c by a chiller herschel bulkley model eq

feed sludge 3 1 1 biodegradability of different feed sludge the cumulative methane production with different feed sludge is compared in fig 1 the maximum methane production 262 6 5 1 ml ch4 g tcodfeed was obtained during the digestion of thp l which is consistent with the results in li et al 2017 who obtained the cumulative methane yield of 240 320 ml g tcod by digesting the filtrate from hydrothermally pretreated sewage sludge 180 c 30 min the digestion of thp sludge obtained the lower methane yield of 134 9 3 6 ml g tcodfeed followed by the digestion of raw was and thp s this indicates the higher percentage of biodegradable substances was in thp l and that was lower in thp s it should be noted the initial methane production rate in thp sludge reactors was slower than that in was reactors which is consistent with the previous report lu et al 2018a besides the initial methane production rate in thp s reactors was much slower than that in was reactors while it was much faster in thp l reactors suggesting that the rate limiting factor of thp sludge digestion was more related to the solids substances the digestion time of thp l was much shorter than other reactors the biogas production ceased in thp l reactors on the 15th day and it stopped in thp sludge digesters on the 22nd day while the raw was and thp s digesters continued the biogas generation till 30th day it confirms the solids fraction prolonged the overall digestion time of thp sludge it should be noted that the digestion time of thp l and thp sludge in this study is slightly longer than other reported results which may be due to the much higher sludge concentration and lower inoculum to substrate ratio jensen et al 2011 3 1 2 contribution of different feed sludge to methane production based on 30 days digestion time the conversion performance of 1 l was to methane through the direct digestion of raw was the digestion of thp sludge or separate digestion of thp l and thp s is shown in fig 2 in this study 1 l of thp sludge was separated to 60 57 g tcod of solids and 47 53 g tcod of liquid 0 85 l the separated thp ad process markedly improved the methane production by 65 93 compared to the traditional ad process with raw was as feed and improved by 24 08 compared to thp sludge ad process without liquid solid separation the methane generation of thp s only accounted for 31 0 of the total methane production and the digestion time was doubled compared to thp l digestion if the digestion stops at day 15 the biogas contribution from thp s would be even less as the biodegradability of the solids fraction is relatively low it would make more sense to treat this part of solids by other methods e g incineration or biochar production the excellent dewaterability of thp sludge also makes the separation of solids feasible table 1 3 1 3 soluble substances transformation during anaerobic digestion fig 3 a shows the organics transformation of different sludge fractions during digestion tb eps was dominant in eps matrix of was while most of organic matters were released to extracellular locations after thp treatment leading to the significant increase of sb eps and lb eps fractions in thp sludge the release is mainly due to the great solubilization of eps matrix and microbial fragments during high temperature thermal hydrolysis lu et al 2018a during digestion all the organics in three eps fractions were consumed gradually while they did not change much in blank reactors fig s1 in was reactors the initial concentration of soluble organics was very low and it barely changed during 30 days digestion process in thp reactors including thp sludge thp l and thp s reactors the reduction of sb eps fraction was the highest followed by lb eps and tb eps which indicates the organics in sb eps and lb eps are more accessible to microbes from fig 3a higher sb eps fraction was found in thp l reactors compared to that in other reactors which may be one of the causes that promoted the biodegradability of thp l within the first 15 days most of the dissolved biodegradable organics were consumed in reactors of thp sludge 95 2 thp l 96 7 and thp s 98 0 as shown in fig 3a particularly the reduction of soluble biodegradable proteins and polysaccharides reached 98 0 and 99 3 respectively in thp l reactors fig s2 thus 15 days of the operation time would be recommended for thp l reactors due to the optimal removal of biodegradable proteins and polysaccharides as well as the achievement of maximum methane generation the specific fractions of soluble organics were determined as shown in fig 3b to study their transformation in anaerobic digesters with different feed sludge in reactors of thp sludge thp l and thp s most of the organic matters were consumed including lmw proteins hmw proteins lmw polysaccharides hmw polysaccharides hs building blocks and lmw neutrals among them lmw proteins lmw neutrals and lmw polysaccharides were greatly removed which accounted for 40 6 19 3 18 3 of total doc removal in thp sludge reactors 42 0 22 3 15 3 in thp l reactors and 54 0 15 2 and 10 4 in thp s reactors respectively the results imply lmw proteins lmw neutrals and lmw polysaccharides are the main contributors to biogas generation the total initial concentration of lmw proteins lmw neutrals and lmw polysaccharides in thp l reactors was 46 7 higher than that in thp sludge digesters and almost 3 times of that in thp s digesters which would explain the higher biogas production in thp l reactors it is noteworthy that the concentration of hs like substances hs and building blocks increased within the first 2 days and reduced gradually from the 5th day during digestion in all reactors fig 3b it is reasonable that the breakdown of other substances could form part of hs like substances which are relatively recalcitrant to anaerobic microbes provenzano et al 2014 and hs degrading microorganisms likely need some acclimation time at the early stage of digestion the percentage of hs like substances reduction was higher in thp l reactors 20 8 followed by thp sludge reactors 16 8 and thp s reactors 9 5 in summary more and relatively easy biodegradable soluble organics existed in thp l reactors which facilitated the access of microbes to organics and promoted the sludge biodegradability 3 2 the physicochemical properties of sludge during anaerobic digestion 3 2 1 the dewaterability of sludge during anaerobic digestion the cst values of different digested sludge from thp sludge thp l and thp s reactors were compared as shown in fig 4 the lower cst value of samples indicates better dewaterability the cst values of digested was samples were higher than 2000 s out of the range of this cst testing equipment which were not shown in this study apparently the dewaterability of thp l digested sludge is the best which may be attributed to the less suspended solids content and the larger surface area of thp l digested sludge miryahyaei et al 2019 during ad operation the cst values of all types of digested sludge decreased indicating that ad could improve the sludge dewaterability this finding could be well supported by xu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2018 however the dewaterability of thp l digested sludge collected on the 30th day was not better than that collected on the 15th day it is noted that the consumption of organics nearly ceased in thp l reactors before day 15 and hmw polysaccharides and hmw proteins even increased with digestion afterwards fig 3b hence the minor starvation condition may cause the excess secretion of eps and deteriorate the sludge dewaterability with long digestion period the highest cst reduction of sludge samples was obtained on the 15th day for thp l reactors 17 0 15th day for thp sludge reactors 16 1 and 30th day for thp s reactors 3 3 the improved dewaterability would be of great benefit for sludge volume reduction and help to save huge amounts of operational cost for sludge conditioning and dewatering before further treatment it should be noted that the worst dewaterability of seed sludge deteriorated the dewaterability of all type of digested sludge once mixed together table 1 separating the solids and liquid fractions of thp sludge before ad would make more sense 3 2 2 the rheological properties of sludge during anaerobic digestion the rheological properties of sludge play an important role in heat and mass transfer process during bioreactions they also affect the design and cost of sludge treatment such as piping stirring and transport generally the apparent viscosity η shear rate at 19 4 s 1 of digested sludge decreased with increasing digestion time fig 5 a suggesting a better flowability of sludge in the digesters this reduction in apparent viscosity was mainly attributed to the reduction of organic matters in sludge mori et al 2008 among these four types of digested sludge samples sludge in was reactors showed the most prominent reduction of apparent viscosity with the reduction of 35 8 during the first five days fig 5a the apparent viscosity of sludge in thp related reactors was much lower than that in was reactors suggesting that thp treatment improved overall sludge properties prior to ad in addition it is reasonable that sludge from thp l reactors was always less viscous due to the exponential relationship between the sludge viscosity and solids content dhar et al 2012 the rheogram of different ad sludge was well fitted by the herschel bulkley model where the τy k and n are shown in fig 5b and table s2 furthermore the yield stress of digested sludge also decreased with the digestion time indicating ad weakened the internal structure in addition it can be observed that the evolution of yield stress with digestion time was highly consistent with that of apparent viscosity for the same type of feed the reduction of both parameters for thp related ad sludge is likely induced by the continuous transformation of dissolved materials to biogas during digestion zhang et al 2016a it is worth noting that the apparent viscosity and yield stress of thp related ad sludge increased slightly at later stage probably due to the formation of eps including hmw polysaccharides and hmw proteins by microorganisms as shown in fig 3b comparing the sludge viscosity with cst values the highly viscous sludge seemed to have poor dewaterability which is consistent with the findings in li and yang 2007 the apparent viscosity and yield stress values of the feed sludge are shown in table 1 the original seed sludge and was had worse flowability while thp treated sludge including thp l thp sludge and thp s behaved better fluidity after mixing with seed sludge the viscosity and yield stress of thp related ad sludge became much higher it would require more energy to stir or pump this digested sludge effectively generally thp sludge has better dewaterability and flowability but these good properties would be affected by mixing with seed sludge even the digested thp sludge has worse filterability and fluidity compared with the original feed thp sludge in addition the liquid fraction of thp sludge could be digested with short retention time and it also has higher biodegradability by contrast the solids portion of thp sludge not only produces less methane but also prolongs the digestion period thus it would be promising if the liquid and solids fractions of thp sludge are separated before ad and transferred to different processes 3 3 biochar production and properties apparently thp l should be separately treated for energy recovery while the solids portion of thp s should be also properly handled with higher recovery value it was reported that the biochar produced from sewage sludge could be used as the fertilizer chen et al 2015 qian et al 2019 and the biochar production from sludge could be energy surplus li et al 2017 therefore the production of valuable biochar would help to solve the problem of sludge reduction and realize the full utilization of sewage sludge biochar yield from the dry thp s was 33 the content of nutrients is important to evaluate if the biochar is suitable to be applied as a fertilizer table 2 shows the content of main elements in biochar including p fe ca al mg k and na the content of p was as high as 61 82 mg g which is comparable to p content of 0 2 73 0 mg g in biochar reported in previous literature chan and xu 2009 sun et al 2018b in practice the addition of biochar to soil was reported to affect the microbial community prayogo et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b proved that applying biochar at a low application rate could improve the grain yields in addition the content of heavy metals in biochar limits its application as the amounts of heavy metals are strictly regulated uysal et al 2010 the content of various heavy metals in the biochar produced from thp s is shown in table 3 it appears that the levels of heavy metals in biochar were all below their limits for fertilizer nzihou and stanmore 2013 moreover the bioavailability and eco toxicity of heavy metals in biochar were significantly reduced after pyrolysis devi and saroha 2014 thus biochar produced from the thp s has potential to be used as a fertilizer or soil remediation additive 3 4 energy analysis the integrated process for target resource recovery from thp sludge is proposed as shown in fig 6 thp l is separately treated for biogas generation and thp s is pyrolyzed to produce biochar for the liquid treatment facility granular or biofilm based process can be employed to further enhance the conversion efficiency it is known that expanded granular sludge bed egsb systems have high organic conversion efficiency with organic loading up to 22 5 kg cod m3 day liu et al 2012 it has been used to treat alkaline fermentation liquid of was high strength organic wastewater landfill leachate and so on jing et al 2016 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 in this study the organic loading rate of thp l reactors was only 1 86 kg cod m3 day 0 096 kg cod kg vss day future study can be focused on employing egsb reactors to handle the thp l stream this would shorten the hydraulic retention time hrt further the facilities set up and operation of the proposed approach are very close to that of the current existing thp ad process fig 6 and fig s5 it includes thermal hydrolysis reactor thp anaerobic digester ad liquid solids separation with the belt press or centrifuge sludge dewatering and sludge dryer drying barber 2016 mills et al 2014 the dried sludge is either sent to incineration plant or pyrolysis plant the energy consumption of pyrolysis plant or incineration plant is estimated while its capital cost is not considered as incineration plant or pyrolysis plant is normally not part of wastewater treatment facilities in wastewater treatment plant furthermore the sludge transportation cost is not included in this study the anaerobic reactor that receives thp l in fact should have a much smaller footprint given the shortened digestion time it suggests the existing sludge treatment facilities and flow in wwtps can be rearranged to facilitate the process and save the capital cost for the proposed process the energy analysis for this sludge management approach was calculated based on a plant with a treatment capacity of 45000 m3 d was it is obvious this process realizes the energy surplus of 1800 mwh d 0 81 mwh tonne ds which is more energy efficient compared with the conventional was ad process and thp ad process table s3 for the proposed approach the main energy cost is for thp s pyrolysis 2000 mwh d and the second major energy input is for sludge thermal hydrolysis 837 mwh d followed by the energy requirement for sludge dewatering and liquid solids separation notwithstanding thp process can be driven by waste heat from various industries barber 2016 the required energy for thickening and dewatering processes highly depends on sludge properties the better dewaterability and lower viscosity of thp sludge and thp l ad sludge would further reduce the total treatment cost on the other hand the benefits of produced biochar 2740 mwh d accounted for more than half of the total output followed by the contribution of methane generated by thp l digestion given the excellent dewaterability of thp sludge before ad the direct separation of thp s for pyrolysis saves energy requirement for sludge drying before incineration which is the top energy consumer in sludge processing table s3 moreover the pyrolysis of solids instead of incineration would decrease the release of air pollutants to the atmosphere and also reduce the incineration ashes as such the integrated process of methane generation from thp l treatment coupled with biochar production from thp s pyrolysis is an environmentally and energy efficiently sustainable approach 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility to recover resources by separating the liquid and solids portions of thp sludge the thp l and thp s portions were anaerobically digested separately compared to thp sludge digestion 24 1 more methane was produced from this separated digestion however the solids portion of thp sludge contributed much less to total methane generation only 31 0 and prolonged the digestion period from 15 to 30 days thus in this study a new approach that converts the solids portion to valuable biochar was proposed the energy assessment confirms that the integrated approach of biochar production from thp s pyrolysis and biogas generation from thp l digestion is energy efficient moreover the better dewaterability and lower viscosity of thp l digested sludge make the process more feasible and practicable

18236,changes in the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom the dissolved fraction of natural organic matter during a series of wastewater treatment plant wwtp processes were investigated by using a combination of molecular size analysis and excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis the characteristics of dom were compared following aerobic anoxic and anaerobic treatments three peaks at about 100 000 da high molecular size dom peak 1 and about 900 1 100 da intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 low molecular size dom peak 3 as the shoulder of peak 2 were observed in the distribution of total organic carbon molecular sizes in the influent of the wwtps in this study five fluorescent components c1 to c5 were identified in the eem spectra molecular size analysis and molecular size fractionation revealed that the c3 humic like and c5 specific to sewage fluorophores had intermediate or low molecular sizes comparison of the changes of the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in each reaction tank and investigation of the removal selectivity of each treatment aerobic anaerobic and anoxic suggested that the heterogenous compounds present in dom of the influent were homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity or into c4 fluorophores dom x during anaerobic or anoxic treatment dom x was able to be transformed or removed by aerobic treatment the results suggested that introduction of aerobic treatment at the appropriate stage of wastewater treatment or inclusion of physical or chemical treatment should be an effective way to optimize dom removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords hplc sec eem parafac molecular size fractionation wastewater treatment process 1 introduction as the world s population and economic activity continue to grow scarcity of fresh water has become an urgent global issue to be resolved ensure access to water and sanitation for all is one of the sustainable development goals of the united nations general assembly wastewater reclamation in which secondarily treated wastewater is purified by additional tertiary treatment such as coagulation flocculation ozonation and membrane filtration is one of the successful strategies developed to meet this goal bixio et al 2006 intriago et al 2018 this strategy has been implemented especially in urban areas to provide recycled water for purposes such as toilet flushing landscape improvement and road cleaning meneses et al 2010 pintillie et al 2016 xu et al 2016 jeong et al 2018 to ensure the quality of the reclaimed water concerns associated with dissolved organic matter dom must be addressed because dom causes a variety of problems including coloration and odor of the water and membrane fouling during reclamation treatment chon and cho 2016 wang et al 2017 furthermore dom can be a major precursor of carcinogenic disinfection by products e g trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids produced during the chlorination of water those by products are a serious problem if the reclaimed water is destined for reuse for drinking zhang et al 2013 because the influent to a wastewater reclamation plant wwrp is typically the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp it is essential to have a good understanding of the characteristics of dom in wwtp effluent knowledge of which treatment process in a wwtp efficiently removes problematic dom compounds such as humic substances can facilitate optimization of wwrp treatment processes dom is a heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds that include proteins sugars carboxylic acids nucleic acids and aquatic humic substances imai et al 2001 its characteristics have been studied by using a variety of analytical approaches in this study we focused on two approaches to elucidate changes of dom characteristics during the biological processes in wwtps the first approach was analysis of the molecular size distributions of dom traditionally an ultrafiltration technique has been used to fractionate dom on the basis of molecular size cut off xu et al 2006 wei et al 2008 recently a tangential flow system has been most frequently used ma et al 2013 han et al 2015 broek et al 2017 our method of analyzing the molecular size distribution in dom was high performance liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography hplc sec shon et al 2004 analyzed the molecular size distribution of dom of biologically treated sewage effluent and found that its range was 300 400 000 da tang et al 2014 analyzed the molecular size distribution of resin fractionated dom in wwtp effluents by using hplc sec they estimated molecular size with a total organic carbon toc detector in previous studies the molecular size distribution of dom has been determined by using several different methods for example liu et al 2019 used a fluorescence detector to characterize the dom in textile wastewater and to examine the molecular size distribution of the protein like fluorophores the molecular size distribution of dom has typically been discussed on the basis of the results of a single detection method few studies have compared the molecular size distributions of dom on the basis of measurements of toc concentrations ultraviolet uv absorbance and fluorescence emission her et al 2003 in this study a homemade hplc sec system with toc uv and fluorescence detectors was used to quantitatively evaluate the molecular size distribution of dom in terms of toc uv and fluorescence the system was able to detect dom with molecular sizes as high as 100 000 da although such dom plays an important role in biological processes it has relatively low uv absorbance and has been hardly detected by uv absorbance detectors in previous studies rosario ortiz et al 2007 furthermore we discuss the differences between the molecular size distributions detected by toc uv and fluorescence the second approach for characterizing dom was fluorescence analysis it has been suggested that 40 60 of natural organic matter is fluorescent organic matter baker 2001 a fluorescence technique such as excitation emission matrix spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac has proven to be a powerful monitoring tool for assessing dom in wastewater carstea et al 2016 it is a simple rapid and sensitive method for monitoring dom and requires only a small volume of sample cohen et al 2014 have used eem parafac to monitor the effects of various treatment processes on dom in a wwtp in israel and have found that the fluorescence of a tryptophan like component can be used as an indicator of biological treatment efficacy yu et al 2013 have compared the removal efficiency of each treatment process in a wwtp they have found that the protein like components are more easily removed than fulvic like components during the anaerobic anoxic aerobic process the eem parafac method has recently been used for both the online and real time monitoring for example murphy et al 2011 have used eem parafac to characterize a large and diverse data set of wwtp effluents n 1479 the eems calculated by the parafac model and the original eem were compared the comparison suggested that monitoring with fluorometers and selection of appropriate wavelengths should capture the same information as a full eem goffin et al 2018 have used the concentration scores of multiple components for online monitoring of biological oxygen demand bod and have produced a multiple linear predictive model of bod various previous studies have investigated the characteristics of dom in the effluent of wwtps the changes of dom characteristics in biological treatments such as the activated sludge process or in chemical treatments such as ozonation have also been investigated tran et al 2015 jin et al 2016 however few studies have compared the characteristics of dom in the influent and effluent of wwtps park et al 2010 hur et al 2011 information on the characteristics of dom in influent is especially scarce the objectives of this study were to characterize the changes in the characteristics of dom during a series of wwtp processes and to compare these changes during dom removal under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions we characterized dom by using a combination of eem parafac and hplc sec systems in addition we used an ultrafiltration technique to separate dom into high and low molecular size fractions 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of water samples water samples were collected in october 2016 and march june and august 2017 from a wwtp operating four types of advanced treatment processes type a activated sludge process type b anaerobic anoxic aerobic process a2o type c recirculating denitrification process and type d modified bardenpho process fig 1 influent sewage was branched into the four processes and treated in parallel the confluent of the finished waters was then treated further by rapid sand filtration and chlorination and discharged to a river for comparison influent and effluent water samples were collected from a human excreta treatment plant samples of water from the surface and bottom layer of the river a short distance downstream from the outlet of the wwtp were also collected all samples were immediately cooled in an ice cooler and brought back to the laboratory the water was filtered through a precombusted whatman gf f filter nominal pore size 0 7 μm 2 2 measurement of basic characteristics of dom dom concentrations were quantified in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and uv absorbance uva at a wavelength of 254 nm uva254 doc concentrations were measured as non purgeable organic carbon with a shimadzu toc v toc analyzer equipped with a pt catalyst on quartz wool shimadzu corp kyoto potassium hydrogen phthalate kanto chemical co tokyo was used as a standard at least three measurements were made for each sample and the analytical precision was typically less than 2 uva254 was measured with a shimadzu uv 4500 uv vis spectrometer samples were placed in a quartz cell with a path length of 1 cm milli q water was used as a blank 2 3 measurement of molecular size distributions molecular size distributions were determined with a homemade prototype hplc sec system with a uv absorbance uva detector spd 6a shimadzu a fluorescence detector rf 10a shimadzu and a nondispersive infrared total organic carbon toc detector the wavelength of the uva detector was set at 254 nm a mixture of disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 12h2o and monobasic dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o was adjusted to ph 6 8 and used as a mobile phase the concentration of phosphate and ionic strength of the mobile phase were 0 02 mol l and 0 0335 m respectively sodium polystyrene sulfonate pss was used as a standard for molecular size analysis the sec column was a tskgel g3000swxl tosoh bioscience llc king of prussia the flow rate of the mobile phase was set at 0 5 ml min and the sample volume was set at 100 μl the molecular size range of the pss was 1 920 220 000 da the apparent molecular size of dom in the samples was calculated from the elution time by using a calibration curve based on the pss standards kawasaki et al 2011 have provided further details about the measurement procedure 2 4 molecular size fractionation to fractionate water samples into a high molecular size fraction hmf and low molecular size fraction lmf we used a 10 000 da cut off ultrafiltration membrane set in a centrifuge tube macrosep advance centrifugal device pall corp new york before use each membrane was cleaned by being rinsed with milli q water with centrifuging for 5 min 2000g 3300 rpm in our device at least three times it was then soaked for more than 24 h and then further cleaned three times with milli q water because the membranes were coated with glycerin which would have contaminated the samples with doc we found that this cleaning procedure reduced the contamination level of the filtrate to less than 0 3 mg c l a water sample of about 15 ml was filtered by centrifuging the sample at 2000g for 15 min the filtrate from the first filtration was considered to be the lmf of dom dom remaining on the filter was rinsed with milli q water and then centrifuged at 2000g for 15 min three times and was considered to be the hmf of dom the ability of this rinsing procedure to remove the lmf of dom remaining on the membrane was verified with the hplc sec system described in section 3 3 2 5 eem spectra measurement and parafac analysis fluorescence spectra were measured with a multiwavelength fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi tokyo equipped with a 150 w xenon lamp and a quartz flow cell in an autosampler as 3000 hitachi tokyo the operational conditions were identical to those described by komatsu et al 2019 the spectra were corrected for instrument biases via an excitation correction spectrum derived from a solution of rhodamine b lot no mnf3287 wako osaka and an emission correction spectrum derived by using a ground quartz diffuser as recommended by the manufacturer of the spectrophotometer to allow for the comparison of our results with those of previous studies we standardized our eem spectral data by using integrated raman scattering data for milli q water after subtraction of the eem spectrum of milli q water as suggested by determann et al 1994 matthews et al 1996 and mostafa et al 2005 parafac uses an alternating least squares algorithm to minimize the sum of squared residuals across an eem dataset and the eem data are decomposed into a set of trilinear terms and a residual array as follows x i j k f 1 f a i f b i f c k f ε i j k where x ijk is the intensity of the ith sample at the jth emission variable and kth excitation variable ε ijk is the unexplained signal residuals a if is directly proportional to the concentration of the fth analyte of the ith sample b jf and c kf are estimates of the emission and excitation spectra respectively for the fth fluorophore and f is the number of components of fluorescent dom the analyses were performed for measured eems of dom samples by using matlab 7 10 0 r2016b with the domfluor toolbox according to the methodology described by stedmon and bro 2008 targeted data were excitation wavelengths 260 550 nm and emission wavelengths 260 550 nm the data in the region influenced by rayleigh and raman peaks and the region where the emission wavelength was less than the excitation wavelength were omitted and replaced with missing values nan not a number in matlab the appropriate number of components was validated by split half analysis and random initialization as suggested by murphy et al 2013 2 6 comparison of changes of dom characteristics among treatment types the wwtp treatment processes that we studied were implemented by using various types of reaction tanks with aerobic anaerobic and anoxic treatments see fig 1 in a series of wastewater processes involving completely mixed tanks the dom concentration in the previous tank means the dom concentration in the effluent from the previous tank as well as the dom concentration in the influent to the present reaction tank thus the removal selectivity of each tank could be determined by comparing the characteristics of dom in a reaction tank with those of dom in the previous tank for example the first treatments in the processes were aerobic for type a anaerobic for type b anoxic for type c and anaerobic for type d the treatment efficiencies of the aerobic anaerobic and anoxic processes could therefore be examined by comparing the water quality between the first reaction tank and the primary sedimentation tank to determine the removal selectivity of each type of treatment the difference between dom concentration dom in the reaction tank and that in the previous tank was calculated as follows comparisons were made between the δdoc values and various parameters of δdom δ dom dom previous tank dom present reaction tank dom could be replaced with dom parameters such as doc or uva254 3 results and discussion 3 1 total dom concentrations of wwtp influent and effluent on the one hand the influents were characterized by a wide range of doc concentrations 14 3 27 2 mg c l coefficient of variation cv 0 28 and a wide range of uva254 282 457 mabs cm cv 0 21 table 1 on the other hand the effluents were characterized by relatively narrow ranges of doc concentrations 4 1 5 9 mg c l cv 0 18 and uva254 79 5 98 2 mabs cm cv 0 10 the narrow ranges in the effluent imply that the concentrations of recalcitrant dom were relatively constant in the effluent presumably because wastewater treatment is a biological process intended to stabilize organic matter the efficiency of uva254 reduction by the wwtp was 72 79 similar to the percent removal of doc 70 78 in both the influent and effluent samples obtained in october 2016 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva calculated as uva254 doc was substantially lower than the values obtained in the other seasons the suva indicates the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of dom yang et al 2013 the substantially lower values in october 2016 thus indicate lower concentrations of hydrophobic compounds in the influent comparison of suva between the influent and effluent did not show a clear pattern in both october 2016 and august 2017 suva was higher in the effluent than in the influent this pattern is consistent with the results of park et al 2010 and musikavong and wattanachira 2007 however suva was lower in the effluent than in the influent in the other seasons the percentage removal of doc during wastewater treatment was relatively low when the influent suva was relatively high table 1 this pattern is consistent with a finding reported by hur et al 2011 3 2 changes in molecular size distributions during wwtp processes molecular size distributions were measured in terms of toc corresponding to doc in this study and uva fig 2 a and b in the toc detection three peaks at about 100 000 da high molecular size dom peak 1 and about 900 1 100 da intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 low molecular size dom peak 3 as the shoulder on peak 2 were observed in the influent it was difficult to distinguish between peaks 2 and 3 on the basis of toc detection fig 2a because of the overlap of peaks 2 and 3 the top of the merged peak was a little wider than expected for a single peak furthermore in the cases of the treated water samples a shoulder was clearly apparent on both peaks 2 and 3 because peak 3 was selectively reduced fig s1 in the supplemental material in addition peak 4 at around 300 da was observed only in the sample obtained in june 2017 peaks 1 3 were also observed in the sec chromatograms as uva fig 2b the peak 1 areas expressed as percentages of the total peak area in the influent were 0 5 13 and 20 in october 2016 june 2017 and august 2017 respectively evaluation of the uva detection results showed that the area of peak 1 in the influent was much smaller in october 2016 than in the other seasons nevertheless the ratios were higher in the influent than in aquatic environments such as rivers and lakes for example kawasaki et al 2011 reported that the area of the uva in peak 1 accounted for only about 1 of the total area of uva in lake waters in other words the wwtp influent includes unique high molecular size doms having abundant uv absorbing which was not detected in aquatic environments the removal percentage of each peak in the wwtp was calculated by using the peak areas in the influent and effluent samples table 1 the results on the basis of toc detection revealed that the removal percentages were 83 93 peak 1 51 65 peak 2 and 76 88 peaks 3 4 the implication is that the dom associated with peak 1 was easily degraded or transformed to the dom with a lower molecular size by biological treatment in the wwtp and that the dom associated with peaks 3 4 was also efficiently biodegraded in previous studies low molecular size or intermediate molecular size doms in the range of 100 3 000 da audenaert et al 2013 or smaller than 1 000 da gong et al 2008 remained in the effluent discharged from wwtps in contrast to the case for peak 1 the dom associated with peak 2 around 1 100 da appeared to be relatively resistant to biological treatment the refractory nature of the dom associated with peak 2 might have been due to the presence of decomposition products of peak 1 the dom associated with peak 1 might not have been completely degraded to carbon dioxide and thus might have accumulated as dom that was detected as peak 2 this suggestion is consistent with the results of previous studies wang and wu 2009 studied the molecular size distribution of dom in a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai they suggested that the large molecular size dom in the influent was metabolized and degraded by microorganisms into relatively low molecular size dom in terms of uva detection the removal percentages of peak 1 peak 2 and peak 3 were 96 99 with the exception of a very low removal percentage of 42 in october 2016 31 46 and 47 65 respectively table 1 a comparison of the removal percentages of each peak on the basis of uva and toc detections revealed that uva toc for peak 1 except in october 2016 uva toc for peak 2 and uva toc for peak 3 in summary the biological treatments in the wwtps were able to selectively remove peak 1 dom with high uva peak 2 dom with low uva and peak 3 dom with low uva many studies have reported that high molecular size dom with a peak location similar to that of peak 1 is likely to be biopolymers or polysaccharide materials e g her et al 2002 myat et al 2012 quaranta et al 2012 kimura et al 2014 these high molecular size biopolymers or polysaccharide materials have been associated with low uva and their associated dom was therefore likely to differ from peak 1 dom with high uva in our study peak 3 dom with low uva seemed to correspond to low molecular size acids as reported by huber et al 2011 3 3 variations in parafac components during wastewater treatment five fluorescent components c1 to c5 were identified in the eem spectra table 2 from previous studies c1 is likely to have originated from tryptophan like compounds and c2 c4 from humic like or fulvic like compounds yamashita and tanoue 2003 stedmon and markager 2005 the origin of c5 however is unknown but it may be related to the characteristics of wwtps galapate et al 1998 the parafac scores were in the order of c5 c3 c1 c4 c2 in the influent table 1 and it was apparent that protein like dom was abundant in the influent in the case of the effluent the order of the parafac scores was c5 c3 c4 c2 c1 and humic fulvic like dom was abundant removal percentages of the parafac components were calculated by comparing the parafac scores of each component between the influent and effluent they were in the range of 85 91 for c1 20 31 for c2 47 52 for c3 3 25 for c4 and 40 53 for c5 table 1 the greater removal percentage of c1 than that of doc 70 78 suggested that the fluorophore associated with the protein like c1 was more easily and selectively removed than the other types of parafac components the higher removal percentage of c1 was consistent with the findings of riopel et al 2014 who reported that a wwtp removed an average of 60 of protein like material the c1 fluorophore is likely to be labile for example lønborg et al 2010 have studied the characteristics of the dom in the ria de vígo coastal area of spain and have found a highly linear relationship between protein like fluorescence and the concentration of bioavailable doc moreover c1 is a good indicator of fecal coliforms sorensen et al 2016 the high percentage removal of c1 in the biological treatment at the wwtp seemed to be due to the high bioavailability of c1 fluorophores molecular size distributions of c3 fluorophores the scores of which were the highest among the humic fulvic like components in the influent were measured by using the fluorescence detector in the hplc sec system at excitation emission wavelengths of 340 430 nm there was a peak in the molecular size distribution of the c3 fluorophores at about 900 da a peak that seemed to correspond to peak 3 of the toc and uva distributions with an additional small peak at about 100 da fig 2c these results suggested that the humic like fluorophore probably had a low molecular size of around 900 da her et al 2003 have also shown that humic like dom has low molecular size peaks on a molecular size distribution chromatogram their findings are consistent with ours the removal percentages of the humic like components c2 c3 and c4 were lower than those of doc the humic like fluorophores were barely removed especially in the case of c4 the percent removal of c4 was the lowest during the wastewater treatment processes c4 has been described as a soil fulvic like compound associated with anomeric acetal and ketal carbon chen et al 2003 williams et al 2010 c5 fluorophores which may be specific to sewage galapate et al 1998 were present in substantial amounts in the wwtp influents during this study it has been suggested that c5 is not detected in natural bodies of water such as rivers lakes and coastal seas matthews et al 1996 galapate et al 1998 komatsu et al 2005 in this study a local thermocline in the river formed because of the wwtp effluent which was warmer than the river water the spread of effluent across the surface layer of the river was clearly apparent in the c5 analyses in the river water near the outlet of the wwtp the c5 parafac score in the surface layer was 3 1 times the score in the bottom layer this result implies that c5 was a component specific to the wwtp effluent c5 may therefore be useful for detecting or tracing wwtp effluents in environmental waters the absence of the peak on the eem corresponding to c5 in both the influent and effluent of the human excreta treatment plant fig 3 suggested that its source was not human waste but domestic non fecal wastewater that contained a detergent or fluorescent whitening agent c5 fluorophores have a peak at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm table 2 no reported dom studies have included an investigation of the source of c5 fluorophores however it is known that the fluorescence spectrum of fluorescein one of the green fluorescence dyes has a peak at the same location as c5 smart and laidlaw 1977 fluorescein has a very high quantum efficiency and has been used as a tracer or marker of specific proteins especially in microscopic studies in japan fluorescein has been used for coloring household bath salts the source of c5 might therefore be wastewater from bathtubs in households or industrial wastewater because wastewater from bathtubs accounts for a substantial part of household wastewater to compare the characteristics of c5 and fluorescein the molecular size distribution of c5 was measured with the fluorescence detector in the hplc sec system at excitation emission wavelengths of 490 520 nm however the c5 fluorophores were eluted so slowly that the peak extended past the total elution time the retention time of the peak could therefore not be converted to a molecular size fig 4 because c5 fluorophores may be adsorbed onto the column carrier by hydrophobic interactions the c5 fluorophores may be very hydrophobic huber et al 2011 have also suggested that hydrophobic interactions cause strong retention on a column medium composed of hydrophobic organic carbon the implication is that the c5 fluorophores are likely to be very high in hydrophobicity this line of reasoning seems to be in accord with the high density of benzene rings in fluorescein to investigate the molecular size of the c5 fluorophores the influent during march 2017 was fractionated into two fractions hmf and lmf via a 10 000 da cut off ultrafiltration membrane successful separation of the hmf and lmf was verified by measuring the distribution of the molecular sizes of each fraction fig 5 interestingly the presence of the eem peak corresponding to c5 in only the lmf fig 6 indicated that the c5 fluorophores were associated with dom that had a molecular size below 10 000 da on the basis of the hplc sec analysis intermediate or low molecular size dom furthermore the protein like peak on the eem at excitation emission wavelengths of 280 340 nm corresponding to c1 was observed for both the hmf and lmf fig 6 however the peak intensity of the protein like compounds in the hmf accounted for only 3 of the total hmf lmf this result is a new discovery no previous studies have quantified the partitioning of protein like fluorophores between the hmf and lmf 3 4 comparison of changes of dom characteristics among treatment types to determine the removal selectivity of each type of treatment processes we compared various characteristics of δdom and δdoc fig 7 the points plotted for the samples collected in october 2016 were apparent as outliers circled by dotted lines in fig 7 these data were outliers because the influent sample in october of 2016 had water quality characteristics that were very different from those of the samples collected during the other seasons the suva was substantially lower than the suva during the other seasons as shown in section 3 1 plots of δdoc against δpeak 1 were linear and no differences in this relationship were found among the treatment types aerobic anaerobic and anoxic fig 7a and 7b the concentration of high molecular size dom peak 1 of the toc detection therefore decreased along with the total concentration of dom doc concentration in all treatment tanks the implication is that the high molecular size dom was removed efficiently regardless of the treatment types plotting δdoc against δpeak 2 toc detection revealed a positive correlation regardless of the treatment types fig 7c in the aerobic treatment δpeak 2 toc detection was positive even when δdoc was nearly zero the concentration of intermediate molecular size dom therefore decreased even when the total concentration of dom was not changed in the aerobic treatment these results suggested that the intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 was not so much biodegraded but instead was bio transformed into low molecular size dom during the aerobic treatment in the case of uva detection the relationship between δdoc and δpeak 2 uva detection differed among the treatment types fig 7d in the aerobic treatment the δpeak 2 uva detection values were positive even when δdoc was nearly zero this pattern was very similar to the analogous pattern determined by toc detection however in both the anaerobic and anoxic treatments δpeak 2 uva detection was negative even when δdoc exceeded 10 mgc l in other words in both anaerobic and anoxic treatments the concentration of intermediate molecular size dom with uva seemed to increase even when the dom concentration as doc decreased i e was removed therefore the high or intermediate molecular size dom with substantially low uva seemed to be transformed into intermediate molecular size dom with high uva with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity this transformation appeared to result in the negative values of δpeak 2 uva detection in the anaerobic or anoxic treatment a strong linear relationship between δdoc and δpeak 3 toc detection was observed regardless of the treatment types fig 7e a plot of δdoc versus δpeak 3 uva detection was weakly linear and differences among the treatment types were not clearly apparent fig 7f this low molecular size dom seemed to have been completely and easily biodegraded without transformation plotting of δdoc against δc1 fig 8 a revealed no differences among the treatment types aerobic anaerobic and anoxic the linearity between δdoc and δc1 suggested that protein like dom should be removed efficiently regardless of the treatment types plotting δdoc against δc2 δc3 or δc4 humic like fig 8b to d revealed that these fluorophores could be removed more efficiently and selectively by aerobic treatment than by anaerobic anoxic treatment furthermore in aerobic treatment δc2 δc3 and δc4 were all positive whereas δdoc was nearly zero in other words in aerobic treatment the concentrations of c2 c3 and c4 fluorophores decreased even when the total concentration of dom was not changed when δdoc was low typically in the latter stages of wastewater processing humic like dom might have been transformed into dom that lacked the fluorescence signatures of c2 to c4 and was not completely removed the anaerobic and anoxic processes resulted in negative values of δc4 despite a positive δdoc other dom without the fluorescence of c4 might have been degraded or transformed into dom with a c4 signature during these processes and thus might have contributed to the increase of c4 after the treatment in the targeted wwtp treatment types a b c and d were prepared for the purpose of removing nutrients not dom therefore the dom removal feature did not differ much among treatment types a to d as a whole however detailed comparisons of the dom removal performances among the treatment types revealed that the removal behavior was controlled by the aeration conditions or dissolved oxygen concentrations regardless of the preceding treatments from the results of this study the appropriate order of aerobic anoxic anaerobic treatment might be proposed for the purpose of dom removal 3 5 comparisons with previous studies and a proposal for optimizing dom removal in wwtps as described in section 3 2 the high molecular size dom with high uv absorbance peak 1 in this study seemed to differ from the biopolymer category to which high molecular size dom is generally assigned huber et al 2011 however the removal efficiency of peak 1 was similar to that of biopolymer that is it was relatively high regardless of aerobic anoxic anaerobic treatment intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 the molecular size of which was around 1 000da is often classified as humic substances huber et al 2011 in the field of aquatic chemistry humic substances are operationally and strictly defined as the hydrophobic compounds in the fractionation by using xad 8 resin leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 komatsu et al 2019 and dom of around 1 000da is not completely equivalent to humic substances however the single peak at the same retention time as peak 2 was observed when the standard solution of humic substances provided by the international humic substances society was analyzed by using the hplc sec used in this study data not shown in previous studies humic substances have been reported to be resistant to biological treatment and peak 2 has been clearly observed in the effluent of wwtps imai et al 2002 in the parafac components c2 c3 and c4 are probably related to humic substances this study revealed that the intermediate molecular size dom with high uv absorbance and the fluorophores of c4 named dom x were increased in abundance or synthesized by both anoxic and anaerobic treatments dom x was part of the humic substances and might contribute to the lower removal ratio of the total humic substances in biological treatments many studies e g goldman et al 2012 yu et al 2013 have reported humic like materials to be less decomposed than other doms by biological treatment however our study revealed for the first time that humic substances such as dom x may be produced by biological treatment in wwtps in this study low molecular size dom peak 3 had low uv absorbance and was removed efficiently in aerobic anoxic or anaerobic treatment this result is consistent with previous studies which have suggested that dom under 1 000da is easily biodegraded for example guo et al 2011 have reported that the peak of low molecular size organic materials 500 da on the chromatogram of the influent vanishes after biological treatment furthermore gonzalez et al 2013 have revealed that low molecular size acid is easily removed by biological treatment the protein like component observed in this study was only c1 the removal characteristics of the protein like component during biological treatments have been reported by many studies yu et al 2014 have investigated dom characteristics in the a2o process they have suggested that tryptophan like material is decomposed by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria bridgeman et al 2013 have investigated the change of two tryptophan like peaks on eem and have found that the fluorescence intensities of both peaks were reduced drastically in biological treatment with activated sludge these results are consistent with our findings however cheng et al 2018 have characterized dom during textile wastewater treatment and have found that although the protein like component was removed efficiently by aerobic process the protein like component was removed only slightly by anaerobic or anoxic processes the removal efficiency of the protein like dom might be affected by the type of influent in summary the heterogenous compounds in the dom of the influent of wwtps seemed to be homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity aromaticity or into c4 fluorophores dom x by microorganisms under anoxic or anaerobic conditions furthermore we discovered that the dom x could be transformed or removed by aerobic treatment in addition dom x seemed to have properties similar to those of humic substances and it has been reported that humic substances could be selectively removed by physical or chemical treatments such as coagulation or adsorption by activated carbon komatsu et al 2005 patricia et al 2005 the implication is therefore that introduction of aerobic treatment or insertion of physical chemical treatments at an appropriate stage in wwtp treatment processes should be an effective way to optimize dom removal in wwtp 4 conclusions in this study we investigated changes of dom characteristics during wwtp processes three peaks peak 1 to peak 3 were found on the hplc sec chromatogram based on toc detection in those peaks the dom at peak 2 intermediate molecular size dom was relatively resistant to biological treatment in the eem parafac analysis five fluorescent components c1 to c5 were identified hplc sec analysis and molecular size fractionation techniques revealed that c3 humic like and c5 fluorophores specific to wwtp effluent were low molecular size dom furthermore the c1 fluorophores protein like were observed in both the high molecular size fraction and the low molecular size fraction comparison of the changes of the doc concentrations in each reaction tank and investigation of the removal selectivity of each treatment aerobic anaerobic and anoxic suggested that heterogenous compounds of dom in the influent were homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity or into c4 fluorophores dom x in anaerobic or anoxic treatment we also discovered that dom x could be transformed or removed by aerobic treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18236,changes in the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom the dissolved fraction of natural organic matter during a series of wastewater treatment plant wwtp processes were investigated by using a combination of molecular size analysis and excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis the characteristics of dom were compared following aerobic anoxic and anaerobic treatments three peaks at about 100 000 da high molecular size dom peak 1 and about 900 1 100 da intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 low molecular size dom peak 3 as the shoulder of peak 2 were observed in the distribution of total organic carbon molecular sizes in the influent of the wwtps in this study five fluorescent components c1 to c5 were identified in the eem spectra molecular size analysis and molecular size fractionation revealed that the c3 humic like and c5 specific to sewage fluorophores had intermediate or low molecular sizes comparison of the changes of the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in each reaction tank and investigation of the removal selectivity of each treatment aerobic anaerobic and anoxic suggested that the heterogenous compounds present in dom of the influent were homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity or into c4 fluorophores dom x during anaerobic or anoxic treatment dom x was able to be transformed or removed by aerobic treatment the results suggested that introduction of aerobic treatment at the appropriate stage of wastewater treatment or inclusion of physical or

as the world s population and economic activity continue to grow scarcity of fresh water has become an urgent global issue to be resolved ensure access to water and sanitation for all is one of the sustainable development goals of the united nations general assembly wastewater reclamation in which secondarily treated wastewater is purified by additional tertiary treatment such as coagulation flocculation ozonation and membrane filtration is one of the successful strategies developed to meet this goal bixio et al 2006 intriago et al 2018 this strategy has been implemented especially in

quality of the reclaimed water concerns associated with dissolved organic matter dom must be addressed because dom causes a variety of problems including coloration and odor of the water and membrane fouling during reclamation treatment chon and cho 2016 wang et al 2017 furthermore dom can be a major precursor of carcinogenic disinfection by products e g trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids produced during the chlorination of water those by products are a serious problem if the reclaimed water is destined for reuse for drinking zhang et al 2013 because the influent to a wastewater reclamation plant wwrp is typically the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp it is essential to have a good understanding of the characteristics of dom in wwtp effluent knowledge of which treatment process in a wwtp efficiently removes problematic dom compounds such as humic substances can facilitate optimization of wwrp treatment processes dom is a heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds that include proteins sugars carboxylic acids nucleic acids and aquatic humic substances imai et al 2001 its characteristics have been studied by using a variety of analytical approaches in this study we focused on two approaches to elucidate changes of dom characteristics during the biological processes in wwtps the first approach was analysis of the molecular size distributions of dom traditionally an ultrafiltration technique has been used to fractionate dom on the basis of molecular size cut off xu et al 2006 wei et al 2008 recently a tangential flow system has been most frequently used ma et al 2013 han et al 2015 broek et al 2017 our method of analyzing the molecular size distribution in dom was high performance liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography hplc sec shon et al 2004 analyzed the molecular size distribution of dom of biologically treated sewage effluent and found that its range was 300 400 000 da tang et al 2014 analyzed the molecular size distribution of resin fractionated dom in wwtp effluents by using hplc sec they estimated molecular size with a total organic carbon toc detector in previous studies the molecular size distribution of dom has been determined by using several different methods for example liu et al 2019 used a fluorescence detector to characterize the dom in textile wastewater and to examine the molecular size distribution of the protein like fluorophores the molecular size distribution of dom has typically been discussed on the basis of the results of a single detection method few studies have compared the molecular size distributions of dom on the basis of measurements of toc concentrations ultraviolet uv absorbance and fluorescence emission her et al 2003 in this study a homemade hplc sec system with toc uv and fluorescence detectors was used to quantitatively evaluate the molecular size distribution of dom in terms of toc uv and fluorescence the system was able to detect dom with molecular sizes as high as 100 000 da although such dom plays an important role in biological processes it has relatively low uv absorbance and has been hardly detected by uv absorbance detectors in previous studies rosario ortiz et al 2007 furthermore we discuss the differences between the molecular size distributions detected by toc uv and fluorescence the second approach for characterizing dom was fluorescence analysis it has been suggested that 40 60 of natural organic matter is fluorescent organic matter baker 2001 a fluorescence technique such as excitation emission matrix spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac has proven to be a powerful monitoring tool for assessing dom in wastewater carstea et al 2016 it is a simple rapid and sensitive method for monitoring dom and requires only a small volume of sample cohen et al 2014 have used eem parafac to monitor the effects of various treatment processes on dom in a wwtp in israel and have found that the fluorescence of a tryptophan like component can be used as an indicator of biological treatment efficacy yu et al 2013 have compared the removal efficiency of each treatment process in a wwtp they have found that the protein like components are more easily removed than fulvic like components during the anaerobic anoxic aerobic process the eem parafac method has recently been used for both the online and real time monitoring for example murphy et al 2011 have used eem parafac to characterize a large and diverse data set of wwtp effluents n 1479 the eems calculated by the parafac model and the original eem were compared the comparison suggested that monitoring with fluorometers and selection of appropriate wavelengths should capture the same information as a full eem goffin et al 2018 have used the concentration scores of multiple components for online monitoring of biological oxygen demand bod and have produced a multiple linear predictive model of bod various previous studies have investigated the characteristics of dom in the effluent of wwtps the changes of dom characteristics in biological treatments such as the activated sludge process or in chemical treatments such as ozonation have also been investigated tran et al 2015 jin et al 2016 however few studies have compared the characteristics of dom in the influent and effluent of wwtps park et al 2010 hur et al 2011 information on the characteristics of dom in influent is especially scarce the objectives of this study were to characterize the changes in the characteristics of dom during a series of wwtp processes and to compare these changes during dom removal under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions we characterized dom by using a combination of eem parafac and hplc sec systems in addition we used an ultrafiltration technique to separate dom into high and low molecular size fractions 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of water samples water samples were collected in october 2016 and march june and august 2017 from a wwtp operating four types of advanced treatment processes type a activated sludge process type b anaerobic anoxic aerobic process a2o type c recirculating denitrification process and type d modified bardenpho process fig 1 influent sewage was branched into the four processes and treated in parallel the confluent of the finished waters was then treated further by rapid sand filtration and chlorination and discharged to a river for comparison influent and effluent water samples were collected from a human excreta treatment plant samples of water from the surface and bottom layer of the river a short distance downstream from the outlet of the wwtp were also collected all samples were immediately cooled in an ice cooler and brought back to the laboratory the water was filtered through a precombusted whatman gf f filter nominal pore size 0 7 μm 2 2 measurement of basic characteristics of dom dom concentrations were quantified in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and uv absorbance uva at a wavelength of 254 nm uva254 doc concentrations were measured as non purgeable organic carbon with a shimadzu toc v toc analyzer equipped with a pt catalyst on quartz wool shimadzu corp kyoto potassium hydrogen phthalate kanto chemical co tokyo was used as a standard at least three measurements were made for each sample and the analytical precision was typically less than 2 uva254 was measured with a shimadzu uv 4500 uv vis spectrometer samples were placed in a quartz cell with a path length of 1 cm milli q water was used as a blank 2 3 measurement of molecular size distributions molecular size distributions were determined with a homemade prototype hplc sec system with a uv absorbance uva detector spd 6a shimadzu a fluorescence detector rf 10a shimadzu and a nondispersive infrared total organic carbon toc detector the wavelength of the uva detector was set at 254 nm a mixture of disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 12h2o and monobasic dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o was adjusted to ph 6 8 and used as a mobile phase the concentration of phosphate and ionic strength of the mobile phase were 0 02 mol l and 0 0335 m respectively sodium polystyrene sulfonate pss was used as a standard for molecular size analysis the sec column was a tskgel g3000swxl tosoh bioscience llc king of prussia the flow rate of the mobile phase was set at 0 5 ml min and the sample volume was set at 100 μl the molecular size range of the pss was 1 920 220 000 da the apparent molecular size of dom in the samples was calculated from the elution time by using a calibration curve based on the pss standards kawasaki et al 2011 have provided further details about the measurement procedure 2 4 molecular size fractionation to fractionate water samples into a high molecular size fraction hmf and low molecular size fraction lmf we used a 10 000 da cut off ultrafiltration membrane set in a centrifuge tube macrosep advance centrifugal device pall corp new york before use each membrane was cleaned by being rinsed with milli q water with centrifuging for 5 min 2000g 3300 rpm in our device at least three times it was then soaked for more than 24 h and then further cleaned three times with milli q water because the membranes were coated with glycerin which would have contaminated the samples with doc we found that this cleaning procedure reduced the contamination level of the filtrate to less than 0 3 mg c l a water sample of about 15 ml was filtered by centrifuging the sample at 2000g for 15 min the filtrate from the first filtration was considered to be the lmf of dom dom remaining on the filter was rinsed with milli q water and then centrifuged at 2000g for 15 min three times and was considered to be the hmf of dom the ability of this rinsing procedure to remove the lmf of dom remaining on the membrane was verified with the hplc sec system described in section 3 3 2 5 eem spectra measurement and parafac analysis fluorescence spectra were measured with a multiwavelength fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi tokyo equipped with a 150 w xenon lamp and a quartz flow cell in an autosampler as 3000 hitachi tokyo the operational conditions were identical to those described by komatsu et al 2019 the spectra were corrected for instrument biases via an excitation correction spectrum derived from a solution of rhodamine b lot no mnf3287 wako osaka and an emission correction spectrum derived by using a ground quartz diffuser as recommended by the manufacturer of the spectrophotometer to allow for the comparison of our results with those of previous studies we standardized our eem spectral data by using integrated raman scattering data for milli q water after subtraction of the eem spectrum of milli q water as suggested by determann et al 1994 matthews et al 1996 and mostafa et al 2005 parafac uses an alternating least squares algorithm to minimize the sum of squared residuals across an eem dataset and the eem data are decomposed into a set of trilinear terms and a residual array as follows x i j k f 1 f a i f b i f c k f ε i j k where x ijk is the intensity of the ith sample at the jth emission variable and kth excitation variable ε ijk is the unexplained signal residuals a if is directly proportional to the concentration of the fth analyte of the ith sample b jf and c kf are estimates of the emission and excitation spectra respectively for the fth fluorophore and f is the number of components of fluorescent dom the analyses were performed for measured eems of dom samples by using matlab 7 10 0 r2016b with the domfluor toolbox according to the methodology described by stedmon and bro 2008 targeted data were excitation wavelengths 260 550 nm and emission wavelengths 260 550 nm the data in the region influenced by rayleigh and raman peaks and the region where the emission wavelength was less than the excitation wavelength were omitted and replaced with missing values nan not a number in matlab the appropriate number of components was validated by split half analysis and random initialization as suggested by murphy et al 2013 2 6 comparison of changes of dom characteristics among treatment types the wwtp treatment processes that we studied were implemented by using various types of reaction tanks with aerobic anaerobic and anoxic treatments see fig 1 in a series of wastewater processes involving completely mixed tanks the dom concentration in the previous tank means the dom concentration in the effluent from the previous tank as well as the dom concentration in the influent to the present reaction tank thus the removal selectivity of each tank could be determined by comparing the characteristics of dom in a reaction tank with those of dom in the previous tank for example the first treatments in the processes were aerobic for type a anaerobic for type b anoxic for type c and anaerobic for type d the treatment efficiencies of the aerobic anaerobic and anoxic processes could therefore be examined by comparing the water quality between the first reaction tank and the primary sedimentation tank to determine the removal selectivity of each type of treatment the difference between dom concentration dom in the reaction tank and that in the previous tank was calculated as follows comparisons were made between the δdoc values and various parameters of δdom δ dom dom previous tank dom present reaction tank dom could be replaced with dom parameters such as doc or uva254 3 results and discussion 3 1 total dom concentrations of wwtp influent and effluent on the one hand the influents were characterized by a wide range of doc concentrations 14 3 27 2 mg c l coefficient of variation cv 0 28 and a wide range of uva254 282 457 mabs cm cv 0 21 table 1 on the other hand the effluents were characterized by relatively narrow ranges of doc concentrations 4 1 5 9 mg c l cv 0 18 and uva254 79 5 98 2 mabs cm cv 0 10 the narrow ranges in the effluent imply that the concentrations of recalcitrant dom were relatively constant in the effluent presumably because wastewater treatment is a biological process intended to stabilize organic matter the efficiency of uva254 reduction by the wwtp was 72 79 similar to the percent removal of doc 70 78 in both the influent and effluent samples obtained in october 2016 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva calculated as uva254 doc was substantially lower than the values obtained in the other seasons the suva indicates the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of dom yang et al 2013 the substantially lower values in october 2016 thus indicate lower concentrations of hydrophobic compounds in the influent comparison of suva between the influent and effluent did not show a clear pattern in both october 2016 and august 2017 suva was higher in the effluent than in the influent this pattern is consistent with the results of park et al 2010 and musikavong and wattanachira 2007 however suva was lower in the effluent than in the influent in the other seasons the percentage removal of doc during wastewater treatment was relatively low when the influent suva was relatively high table 1 this pattern is consistent with a finding reported by hur et al 2011 3 2 changes in molecular size distributions during wwtp processes molecular size distributions were measured in terms of toc corresponding to doc in this study and uva fig 2 a and b in the toc detection three peaks at about 100 000 da high molecular size dom peak 1 and about 900 1 100 da intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 low molecular size dom peak 3 as the shoulder on peak 2 were observed in the influent it was difficult to distinguish between peaks 2 and 3 on the basis of toc detection fig 2a because of the overlap of peaks 2 and 3 the top of the merged peak was a little wider than expected for a single peak furthermore in the cases of the treated water samples a shoulder was clearly apparent on both peaks 2 and 3 because peak 3 was selectively reduced fig s1 in the supplemental material in addition peak 4 at around 300 da was observed only in the sample obtained in june 2017 peaks 1 3 were also observed in the sec chromatograms as uva fig 2b the peak 1 areas expressed as percentages of the total peak area in the influent were 0 5 13 and 20 in october 2016 june 2017 and august 2017 respectively evaluation of the uva detection results showed that the area of peak 1 in the influent was much smaller in october 2016 than in the other seasons nevertheless the ratios were higher in the influent than in aquatic environments such as rivers and lakes for example kawasaki et al 2011 reported that the area of the uva in peak 1 accounted for only about 1 of the total area of uva in lake waters in other words the wwtp influent includes unique high molecular size doms having abundant uv absorbing which was not detected in aquatic environments the removal percentage of each peak in the wwtp was calculated by using the peak areas in the influent and effluent samples table 1 the results on the basis of toc detection revealed that the removal percentages were 83 93 peak 1 51 65 peak 2 and 76 88 peaks 3 4 the implication is that the dom associated with peak 1 was easily degraded or transformed to the dom with a lower molecular size by biological treatment in the wwtp and that the dom associated with peaks 3 4 was also efficiently biodegraded in previous studies low molecular size or intermediate molecular size doms in the range of 100 3 000 da audenaert et al 2013 or smaller than 1 000 da gong et al 2008 remained in the effluent discharged from wwtps in contrast to the case for peak 1 the dom associated with peak 2 around 1 100 da appeared to be relatively resistant to biological treatment the refractory nature of the dom associated with peak 2 might have been due to the presence of decomposition products of peak 1 the dom associated with peak 1 might not have been completely degraded to carbon dioxide and thus might have accumulated as dom that was detected as peak 2 this suggestion is consistent with the results of previous studies wang and wu 2009 studied the molecular size distribution of dom in a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai they suggested that the large molecular size dom in the influent was metabolized and degraded by microorganisms into relatively low molecular size dom in terms of uva detection the removal percentages of peak 1 peak 2 and peak 3 were 96 99 with the exception of a very low removal percentage of 42 in october 2016 31 46 and 47 65 respectively table 1 a comparison of the removal percentages of each peak on the basis of uva and toc detections revealed that uva toc for peak 1 except in october 2016 uva toc for peak 2 and uva toc for peak 3 in summary the biological treatments in the wwtps were able to selectively remove peak 1 dom with high uva peak 2 dom with low uva and peak 3 dom with low uva many studies have reported that high molecular size dom with a peak location similar to that of peak 1 is likely to be biopolymers or polysaccharide materials e g her et al 2002 myat et al 2012 quaranta et al 2012 kimura et al 2014 these high molecular size biopolymers or polysaccharide materials have been associated with low uva and their associated dom was therefore likely to differ from peak 1 dom with high uva in our study peak 3 dom with low uva seemed to correspond to low molecular size acids as reported by huber et al 2011 3 3 variations in parafac components during wastewater treatment five fluorescent components c1 to c5 were identified in the eem spectra table 2 from previous studies c1 is likely to have originated from tryptophan like compounds and c2 c4 from humic like or fulvic like compounds yamashita and tanoue 2003 stedmon and markager 2005 the origin of c5 however is unknown but it may be related to the characteristics of wwtps galapate et al 1998 the parafac scores were in the order of c5 c3 c1 c4 c2 in the influent table 1 and it was apparent that protein like dom was abundant in the influent in the case of the effluent the order of the parafac scores was c5 c3 c4 c2 c1 and humic fulvic like dom was abundant removal percentages of the parafac components were calculated by comparing the parafac scores of each component between the influent and effluent they were in the range of 85 91 for c1 20 31 for c2 47 52 for c3 3 25 for c4 and 40 53 for c5 table 1 the greater removal percentage of c1 than that of doc 70 78 suggested that the fluorophore associated with the protein like c1 was more easily and selectively removed than the other types of parafac components the higher removal percentage of c1 was consistent with the findings of riopel et al 2014 who reported that a wwtp removed an average of 60 of protein like material the c1 fluorophore is likely to be labile for example lønborg et al 2010 have studied the characteristics of the dom in the ria de vígo coastal area of spain and have found a highly linear relationship between protein like fluorescence and the concentration of bioavailable doc moreover c1 is a good indicator of fecal coliforms sorensen et al 2016 the high percentage removal of c1 in the biological treatment at the wwtp seemed to be due to the high bioavailability of c1 fluorophores molecular size distributions of c3 fluorophores the scores of which were the highest among the humic fulvic like components in the influent were measured by using the fluorescence detector in the hplc sec system at excitation emission wavelengths of 340 430 nm there was a peak in the molecular size distribution of the c3 fluorophores at about 900 da a peak that seemed to correspond to peak 3 of the toc and uva distributions with an additional small peak at about 100 da fig 2c these results suggested that the humic like fluorophore probably had a low molecular size of around 900 da her et al 2003 have also shown that humic like dom has low molecular size peaks on a molecular size distribution chromatogram their findings are consistent with ours the removal percentages of the humic like components c2 c3 and c4 were lower than those of doc the humic like fluorophores were barely removed especially in the case of c4 the percent removal of c4 was the lowest during the wastewater treatment processes c4 has been described as a soil fulvic like compound associated with anomeric acetal and ketal carbon chen et al 2003 williams et al 2010 c5 fluorophores which may be specific to sewage galapate et al 1998 were present in substantial amounts in the wwtp influents during this study it has been suggested that c5 is not detected in natural bodies of water such as rivers lakes and coastal seas matthews et al 1996 galapate et al 1998 komatsu et al 2005 in this study a local thermocline in the river formed because of the wwtp effluent which was warmer than the river water the spread of effluent across the surface layer of the river was clearly apparent in the c5 analyses in the river water near the outlet of the wwtp the c5 parafac score in the surface layer was 3 1 times the score in the bottom layer this result implies that c5 was a component specific to the wwtp effluent c5 may therefore be useful for detecting or tracing wwtp effluents in environmental waters the absence of the peak on the eem corresponding to c5 in both the influent and effluent of the human excreta treatment plant fig 3 suggested that its source was not human waste but domestic non fecal wastewater that contained a detergent or fluorescent whitening agent c5 fluorophores have a peak at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm table 2 no reported dom studies have included an investigation of the source of c5 fluorophores however it is known that the fluorescence spectrum of fluorescein one of the green fluorescence dyes has a peak at the same location as c5 smart and laidlaw 1977 fluorescein has a very high quantum efficiency and has been used as a tracer or marker of specific proteins especially in microscopic studies in japan fluorescein has been used for coloring household bath salts the source of c5 might therefore be wastewater from bathtubs in households or industrial wastewater because wastewater from bathtubs accounts for a substantial part of household wastewater to compare the characteristics of c5 and fluorescein the molecular size distribution of c5 was measured with the fluorescence detector in the hplc sec system at excitation emission wavelengths of 490 520 nm however the c5 fluorophores were eluted so slowly that the peak extended past the total elution time the retention time of the peak could therefore not be converted to a molecular size fig 4 because c5 fluorophores may be adsorbed onto the column carrier by hydrophobic interactions the c5 fluorophores may be very hydrophobic huber et al 2011 have also suggested that hydrophobic interactions cause strong retention on a column medium composed of hydrophobic organic carbon the implication is that the c5 fluorophores are likely to be very high in hydrophobicity this line of reasoning seems to be in accord with the high density of benzene rings in fluorescein to investigate the molecular size of the c5 fluorophores the influent during march 2017 was fractionated into two fractions hmf and lmf via a 10 000 da cut off ultrafiltration membrane successful separation of the hmf and lmf was verified by measuring the distribution of the molecular sizes of each fraction fig 5 interestingly the presence of the eem peak corresponding to c5 in only the lmf fig 6 indicated that the c5 fluorophores were associated with dom that had a molecular size below 10 000 da on the basis of the hplc sec analysis intermediate or low molecular size dom furthermore the protein like peak on the eem at excitation emission wavelengths of 280 340 nm corresponding to c1 was observed for both the hmf and lmf fig 6 however the peak intensity of the protein like compounds in the hmf accounted for only 3 of the total hmf lmf this result is a new discovery no previous studies have quantified the partitioning of protein like fluorophores between the hmf and lmf 3 4 comparison of changes of dom characteristics among treatment types to determine the removal selectivity of each type of treatment processes we compared various characteristics of δdom and δdoc fig 7 the points plotted for the samples collected in october 2016 were apparent as outliers circled by dotted lines in fig 7 these data were outliers because the influent sample in october of 2016 had water quality characteristics that were very different from those of the samples collected during the other seasons the suva was substantially lower than the suva during the other seasons as shown in section 3 1 plots of δdoc against δpeak 1 were linear and no differences in this relationship were found among the treatment types aerobic anaerobic and anoxic fig 7a and 7b the concentration of high molecular size dom peak 1 of the toc detection therefore decreased along with the total concentration of dom doc concentration in all treatment tanks the implication is that the high molecular size dom was removed efficiently regardless of the treatment types plotting δdoc against δpeak 2 toc detection revealed a positive correlation regardless of the treatment types fig 7c in the aerobic treatment δpeak 2 toc detection was positive even when δdoc was nearly zero the concentration of intermediate molecular size dom therefore decreased even when the total concentration of dom was not changed in the aerobic treatment these results suggested that the intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 was not so much biodegraded but instead was bio transformed into low molecular size dom during the aerobic treatment in the case of uva detection the relationship between δdoc and δpeak 2 uva detection differed among the treatment types fig 7d in the aerobic treatment the δpeak 2 uva detection values were positive even when δdoc was nearly zero this pattern was very similar to the analogous pattern determined by toc detection however in both the anaerobic and anoxic treatments δpeak 2 uva detection was negative even when δdoc exceeded 10 mgc l in other words in both anaerobic and anoxic treatments the concentration of intermediate molecular size dom with uva seemed to increase even when the dom concentration as doc decreased i e was removed therefore the high or intermediate molecular size dom with substantially low uva seemed to be transformed into intermediate molecular size dom with high uva with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity this transformation appeared to result in the negative values of δpeak 2 uva detection in the anaerobic or anoxic treatment a strong linear relationship between δdoc and δpeak 3 toc detection was observed regardless of the treatment types fig 7e a plot of δdoc versus δpeak 3 uva detection was weakly linear and differences among the treatment types were not clearly apparent fig 7f this low molecular size dom seemed to have been completely and easily biodegraded without transformation plotting of δdoc against δc1 fig 8 a revealed no differences among the treatment types aerobic anaerobic and anoxic the linearity between δdoc and δc1 suggested that protein like dom should be removed efficiently regardless of the treatment types plotting δdoc against δc2 δc3 or δc4 humic like fig 8b to d revealed that these fluorophores could be removed more efficiently and selectively by aerobic treatment than by anaerobic anoxic treatment furthermore in aerobic treatment δc2 δc3 and δc4 were all positive whereas δdoc was nearly zero in other words in aerobic treatment the concentrations of c2 c3 and c4 fluorophores decreased even when the total concentration of dom was not changed when δdoc was low typically in the latter stages of wastewater processing humic like dom might have been transformed into dom that lacked the fluorescence signatures of c2 to c4 and was not completely removed the anaerobic and anoxic processes resulted in negative values of δc4 despite a positive δdoc other dom without the fluorescence of c4 might have been degraded or transformed into dom with a c4 signature during these processes and thus might have contributed to the increase of c4 after the treatment in the targeted wwtp treatment types a b c and d were prepared for the purpose of removing nutrients not dom therefore the dom removal feature did not differ much among treatment types a to d as a whole however detailed comparisons of the dom removal performances among the treatment types revealed that the removal behavior was controlled by the aeration conditions or dissolved oxygen concentrations regardless of the preceding treatments from the results of this study the appropriate order of aerobic anoxic anaerobic treatment might be proposed for the purpose of dom removal 3 5 comparisons with previous studies and a proposal for optimizing dom removal in wwtps as described in section 3 2 the high molecular size dom with high uv absorbance peak 1 in this study seemed to differ from the biopolymer category to which high molecular size dom is generally assigned huber et al 2011 however the removal efficiency of peak 1 was similar to that of biopolymer that is it was relatively high regardless of aerobic anoxic anaerobic treatment intermediate molecular size dom peak 2 the molecular size of which was around 1 000da is often classified as humic substances huber et al 2011 in the field of aquatic chemistry humic substances are operationally and strictly defined as the hydrophobic compounds in the fractionation by using xad 8 resin leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 komatsu et al 2019 and dom of around 1 000da is not completely equivalent to humic substances however the single peak at the same retention time as peak 2 was observed when the standard solution of humic substances provided by the international humic substances society was analyzed by using the hplc sec used in this study data not shown in previous studies humic substances have been reported to be resistant to biological treatment and peak 2 has been clearly observed in the effluent of wwtps imai et al 2002 in the parafac components c2 c3 and c4 are probably related to humic substances this study revealed that the intermediate molecular size dom with high uv absorbance and the fluorophores of c4 named dom x were increased in abundance or synthesized by both anoxic and anaerobic treatments dom x was part of the humic substances and might contribute to the lower removal ratio of the total humic substances in biological treatments many studies e g goldman et al 2012 yu et al 2013 have reported humic like materials to be less decomposed than other doms by biological treatment however our study revealed for the first time that humic substances such as dom x may be produced by biological treatment in wwtps in this study low molecular size dom peak 3 had low uv absorbance and was removed efficiently in aerobic anoxic or anaerobic treatment this result is consistent with previous studies which have suggested that dom under 1 000da is easily biodegraded for example guo et al 2011 have reported that the peak of low molecular size organic materials 500 da on the chromatogram of the influent vanishes after biological treatment furthermore gonzalez et al 2013 have revealed that low molecular size acid is easily removed by biological treatment the protein like component observed in this study was only c1 the removal characteristics of the protein like component during biological treatments have been reported by many studies yu et al 2014 have investigated dom characteristics in the a2o process they have suggested that tryptophan like material is decomposed by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria bridgeman et al 2013 have investigated the change of two tryptophan like peaks on eem and have found that the fluorescence intensities of both peaks were reduced drastically in biological treatment with activated sludge these results are consistent with our findings however cheng et al 2018 have characterized dom during textile wastewater treatment and have found that although the protein like component was removed efficiently by aerobic process the protein like component was removed only slightly by anaerobic or anoxic processes the removal efficiency of the protein like dom might be affected by the type of influent in summary the heterogenous compounds in the dom of the influent of wwtps seemed to be homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity aromaticity or into c4 fluorophores dom x by microorganisms under anoxic or anaerobic conditions furthermore we discovered that the dom x could be transformed or removed by aerobic treatment in addition dom x seemed to have properties similar to those of humic substances and it has been reported that humic substances could be selectively removed by physical or chemical treatments such as coagulation or adsorption by activated carbon komatsu et al 2005 patricia et al 2005 the implication is therefore that introduction of aerobic treatment or insertion of physical chemical treatments at an appropriate stage in wwtp treatment processes should be an effective way to optimize dom removal in wwtp 4 conclusions in this study we investigated changes of dom characteristics during wwtp processes three peaks peak 1 to peak 3 were found on the hplc sec chromatogram based on toc detection in those peaks the dom at peak 2 intermediate molecular size dom was relatively resistant to biological treatment in the eem parafac analysis five fluorescent components c1 to c5 were identified hplc sec analysis and molecular size fractionation techniques revealed that c3 humic like and c5 fluorophores specific to wwtp effluent were low molecular size dom furthermore the c1 fluorophores protein like were observed in both the high molecular size fraction and the low molecular size fraction comparison of the changes of the doc concentrations in each reaction tank and investigation of the removal selectivity of each treatment aerobic anaerobic and anoxic suggested that heterogenous compounds of dom in the influent were homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity or into c4 fluorophores dom x in anaerobic or anoxic treatment we also discovered that dom x could be transformed or removed by aerobic treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

sediments in this study in situ monthly field sampling and indoor experiments were combined to measure the soluble reactive p srp soluble fe and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt labile p s in the overlying water sediment and porewater in the jiuxi river estuary by employing high resolution dialysis hr peeper the dgt technique and a microrhizon sampler the consistent tendency between dgt labile s and p in most seasons indicates that p mobilization was dominated by intense dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr causing high srp concentrations and active exchange with the overlying water the circannual cyclical pattern of p is summarized where in addition to temperature monthly changes in runoff and tidal range are crucial external factors to control long term p cycling via changed redox environments and terrigenous materials inputs the mobile p fe and s present higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides in tidal simulation experiments demonstrating that the short term cycling of p fe and s in intertidal surface sediments is highly redox sensitive and controlled by tidal processes the results also reveal that dsr greatly facilitates p mobility and release while sediment oxidation and the induced enhancement in dir and fe cycling can effectively control p immobilization graphical abstract image 1 keywords diffusive gradients in thin films high resolution peeper high resolution spatiotemporal sampling tidal simulation experiment phosphorus mobility small creek estuary 1 introduction phosphorus p is commonly deemed the ultimate limiting nutrient at geologic timescales with the bioavailable p effectively controlling oceanic primary productivity and thus global carbon cycling conley et al 2009 tyrrell 1999 marine sediments and porewater are crucial biogeochemical reactors of mobile diagenetically reactive p which can act as sources or sinks of p to the overlying water markovic et al 2019 pan et al 2019c the degree to which bioavailable p is trapped in the sediment as opposed to being exported to the overlying water is generally redox dependent xiong et al 2019 overlying water hypoxia and an anoxic depositional context facilitate a decrease in the sequestration capacity of the sediment for p and accelerate anaerobic p mineralization and liberation both of which can promote the release of soluble reactive p srp to the overlying water and positive productivity feedback to deteriorate the water quality conley et al 2002 middelburg and levin 2009 in addition a high overlying water srp content can also be retained in the surface oxic sediment which acts as a potential labile p pool for internal p loading under favorable biogeochemical conditions pan et al 2019c sediment internal p mobility has a tight connection with the biogeochemical cycling of iron fe and sulfur s rozan et al 2002 dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr and dissimilatory fe iii reduction dir are two major pathways for marine organic matter om diagenetic mineralization accompanied by anaerobic organic p mineralization which are crucial processes for diagenetic p mobilization markovic et al 2019 rozan et al 2002 srp has a strong affinity to poorly crystalline and amorphous fe iii hydr oxide surfaces leading to significant scavenging of the srp from solution slomp et al 1996 under anoxic conditions fe iii hydr oxides are partially dissolved through dir releasing absorbed p into the ambient porewater lovley and phillips 1988 in addition dsr and sulfide have been found to facilitate p remobilization by chemical fe iii reduction to coprecipitate fes and fes2 which have minimal affinities for p sequestration ingall and jahnke 1997 lehtoranta et al 2009 considering their close relationship detailed insight into the relevant processes of fe and s redox cycling is of particular significance to understand p mobility in marine sediments as the transition of ocean to land an estuary is especially sensitive to increasing anthropogenic p input which can fuel the development of hypoxia and algal blooms kraal et al 2015 the sequestration and release processes of p in estuarine sediments are highly significant for the global oceanic p cycle as the sediment represents a vital p source for the open ocean paytan and mclaughlin 2007 in light of the mounting global climate changes such as sea level rise and runoff changes which can result in persistent or temporary aquatic hypoxia the benthic p cycling in estuaries may be notably converted in response to hypoxia and eutrophication diaz and rosenberg 2008 therefore clarifying the redox dependent p im mobilization processes and release mechanisms in eutrophicated estuaries is essential in addition the depositional and hydrodynamic conditions in an estuary are so dynamic that waves tides river runoff bioturbation and deposition rates are highly variable in both the long term monthly seasonal and short term tidal diurnal diagenetic p cycling in this environment is complicated and dynamic and may exhibit strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity pan et al 2019c rozan et al 2002 nevertheless high frequency field studies of p geochemistry and related processes have been insufficient most study are seasonal e g summer and winter markovic et al 2019 pan et al 2019c rozan et al 2002 and the cyclical pattern of p is not complicated because many environmental factors have not been considered further monthly field surveys and hourly indoor incubation are imperative to better understand the spatiotemporal variations in key chemicals and to summarize the cyclical pattern and im mobilization mechanisms of p which are crucial to predict its geochemical fate and control its pollution previous studies on internal p cycling have paid more attention to intermediate and large river estuaries such as the jiulong river estuary yangtze river estuary and the mouth of the mississippi river cao et al 2017 pan et al 2017 roy et al 2017 while usually ignoring fairly small creeks however a small creek may be highly polluted and eutrophic black malodorous water due to industrial and agricultural activities which lack government oversight and such a creek may have a low self purification capacity yin et al 2019 clarifying the cyclical pattern and im mobilization mechanisms of p in this environment can provide a new insight into estuarine p pollution treatment especially against the background of climate changes sea level rise and runoff changes and anthropogenic activities in this study the monthly distribution of mobile p fe and s in the sediments and porewater of the jiuxi river estuary were determined using in situ high resolution dialysis hr peeper and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt samplers based on which the mobility and pollution of p in estuarine sediments were assessed and a circannual cyclical pattern of p was summarized to explore the effects of tides on the short term changes in fe and s cycling and related p im mobilization a novel indoor tidal simulation experiment was further conducted to study the hourly changes in p fe and s during tidal oscillation using a microrhizon sampler and a dgt probe 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the study site 24 35 38 n 118 16 42 e is located in the estuary of the jiuxi river fig s1 which is a fairly small creek approximately 20 km long with a narrow watercourse dozens of meters wide and a long estuary because of macrotides with a mean tidal range of 4 1 m in addition to the strong tides the water level and hydrological conditions in the estuary are seasonally influenced by runoff this region has a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of 21 0 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1350 mm of which 70 occurs between april and september jin et al 2013 in contrast to large rivers the runoff of the jiuxi river is principally influenced by occasional heavy rainfall as shown in table s1 the dissolved oxygen do concentrations indicate some hypoxia especially in summer and autumn and the overlying water is basically alkalescent the srp concentrations in the adjacent xiamen bay are up to two times higher than those allowed by chinese sea water quality standards liao et al 2013 and are considered as the main reason for frequent eutrophication events and blooms yang et al 2012 2 2 preparation of the dgt and hr peeper probes the hr peeper sampler contained 36 equally spaced 400 μl chambers fully loaded with deionized water with a 5 mm vertical resolution and the chambers were covered by a cellulose nitrate membrane 0 45 μm pore size whatman the principle of the hr peeper is based on diffusion equilibrium allowing solutes to diffuse across the membrane and achieve equilibrium after some time teasdale et al 1995 the dgt technique is a dynamical technique based on fick s first law of diffusion and has the potential to conduct in situ measurements of the labile species in sediments with a high resolution davison and zhang 1994 the dgt measured p s comes from the porewater srp dissolved sulfide and the further release of solid easily exchangeable or mobile p s fractions to resupply the porewater which is referred to as dgt labile p s zhang et al 1995 therefore the dgt uptake process involves dynamic solid solution interactions of chemicals which are affected by their solid lability all hr peeper and zro agi dgt probes provided by easy sensor ltd www easysensor net were prepared according to xu et al 2012 and ding et al 2012 the hr peeper and zro agi dgt devices were stored in deionized water in the dark and deoxygenated with nitrogen for one day prior to deployment 2 3 field methods during the low tide period in each month from may 2018 to april 2019 one hr peeper probe was first inserted into the sediment with four chambers 2 cm above the sediment overlying water interface swi and deployed for one day a zro agi dgt probe was then inserted very close to the hr peeper and the probes were both deployed for one more day the probes were retrieved from the sediment simultaneously and carefully cleaned after that porewater samples were rapidly collected using a pipette a portion of which was acidified with hno3 for the analysis of soluble fe the dgt probes were kept moist and out of the sun prior to analysis a handheld ysi professional plus device was used to measure the overlying water properties during sampling in each month starting in july after retrieval of the hr peeper and dgt probes in each month sediment cores or surface sediments were immediately collected using hollow pvc tubes in july october january and april sediment cores were collected and sectioned at 1 cm intervals uppermost 5 cm or 2 cm intervals 6 15 cm in the remaining months only the surface 5 cm of sediments were collected these samples were sealed in polyethylene bags that had been deoxygenated with nitrogen beforehand and quickly transported to the laboratory for further analysis 2 4 indoor experiments two sediment cores and overlying water were collected using a homemade disassembled poly methyl methacrylate pmma tube and buckets at the sampling site and transported to the laboratory in the control group ten microrhizon samplers rhizon css the netherlands were inserted into the undisturbed sediment fig s2 to simulate the diurnal tide in the intertidal zone a peristaltic pump drew overlying water from the bucket to the incubator at a rate of a 2 m head in 6 h then the overlying water was drawn back to the bucket at the same rate followed by exposure in the next 12 h in the experimental group the sediment was mixed and homogenized in one day for intensive oxidization then microrhizon samplers were inserted and the tide cycle was simulated as for the control group both of which underwent another 3 tide cycles prior to sampling one zro agi dgt probe was deployed in the sediments of the control group and one in those of the experimental group then the simulated flood tide began approximately 0 5 ml porewater was extracted from the inserted microrhizon sampler by a vacuum tube every 3 h when the simulated ebb tide began the dgt probe was retrieved during the flood tide and another dgt probe was deployed during the ebb tide throughout the experiment the porewater was sampled eight times and two dgt probes were deployed for each group 2 5 chemical analyses for dgt labile s analysis the binding gels of the zro agi dgt probes were immediately cut along the open window and scanned using a scanner canon 5600f with a resolution of 600 dpi which corresponds to a pixel size of 0 042 mm 0 042 mm the scanned images were analyzed with imagej 1 46 to convert the images into grayscale intensities widerlund and davison 2007 afterwards the gels were cut into strips at 5 mm vertical intervals using ceramic knives the dgt labile p was extracted by adding 1 0 m naoh solution to the strips ding et al 2012 the concentrations of srp and soluble fe in the porewater and overlying water sampled by the hr peeper and microrhizon samplers as well as the extracted dgt labile p were determined by an enspire microplate reader perkinelmer waltham ma usa using miniaturized spectrophotometry methods laskov et al 2007 the sulfate and chloride ion concentrations were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 1600 usa some of the sediment samples were immediately centrifuged to remove the porewater these samples together with the rest of the samples were then freeze dried at 80 c and ground for further analysis the mobile p and fe were extracted by an ascorbic acid solution using a single step procedure to extract the reactive p pool asc p bound to amorphous iron and the amorphous iron asc fe rozan et al 2002 the measurement of the extracted p and fe in the eluates was also conducted by the microplate reader the total nitrogen tn total reductive sulfur trs defined as the total sulfur corrected for the sulfate removed by the porewater and total organic carbon toc were determined by a vario el iii element analyzer elementar germany the particle size was measured by a mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk using whole samples method blanks duplicates and standard materials were used for quality assurance and quality control standard materials were measured after every 10 to 20 samples three replicate measurements of the toc trs tn sulfate and chloride ion were conducted every 10 to 20 samples two replicate measurements were performed for the porewater srp and soluble fe due to the limited samples three replicate measurements were performed for all other samples the standard materials average values of the standard material recovery and relative standard deviation rsd of the replicates are shown in table s2 2 6 data processing the accumulated mass m μg of the dgt labile p was calculated with eq 1 1 m c e v e f e where c e is the measured p concentration in the eluate v e is the volume of the eluate and f e is the extraction yield the accumulated mass ms μg cm 2 of the dgt labile s was calculated using the calibration curve of the grayscale density y versus ms x ding et al 2012 2 y 171 e x 7 23 220 the fluxes of the dgt labile p s fdgt pg cm 2 s 1 and dgt labile p concentrations cdgt mg l 1 were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively zhang et al 1995 3 f d g t m a t m s t 4 c d g t m δ g d a t where a is the exposure area of the gel strip t is the deployment time δ g is the thickness of the diffusive layer 0 08 cm and d is the diffusion coefficient of p in the diffusion layer cm2 s 1 wang et al 2016 the resupply parameter r is calculated as the ratio of the dgt labile p concentration to the srp concentration where a higher value indicates a higher resupply capacity from the sediment to the porewater the srp concentrations in the vicinity of the swi 2 cm above and below were used to calculate the benthic diffusion flux of srp between the porewater and overlying water the flux was calculated based on fick s first law and the degree of sediment tortuosity according to boudreau 1996 the correlation analysis of kendall s tau was performed using spss ver 13 0 3 results 3 1 properties of sediments and the overlying water the physicochemical properties of the surface sediments over twelve months are shown in table 1 the particle size results suggested that silt was the main sediment type which exhibited seasonal differences fig s3 the c n value ranged from 8 7 to 11 6 indicating a mixed origin of the om which was more thalassogenous overall both the monthly distributions and depth profiles of asc p and asc fe over the four months were quite consistent fig 1 and increased in summer and decreased in winter the distributions of toc and trs were also coincident with the low contents in winter and fluctuated contents in the other months fig 1 the average srp concentrations and other properties of the overlying water in each month are presented in tables 2 and s1 the srp concentrations were higher in summer and lower in winter a low salinity was observed in august march and april in accordance with the river flood season with intense rainfall http en weather com cn the dissolved oxygen do concentrations showed some hypoxia especially in summer and autumn the overlying water was basically alkalescent with a ph ranging from 7 73 to 8 46 3 2 properties of the porewater the concentrations of srp and soluble fe in the overlying water and porewater profiles are shown in fig 2 the mean concentrations of the porewater srp and soluble fe over the whole year were 0 75 mg l 1 and 1 64 mg l 1 respectively with the highest values observed in june 3 93 0 06 mg l 1 and october 6 17 0 09 mg l 1 respectively the average srp concentrations were high in spring and summer from march to october except august and low in winter while the average soluble fe concentrations were evidently high in autumn from september to december fig 8 although the depth profile varied monthly the soluble fe concentration was low in the surface layer and then increased at different depths mostly followed by a decrease and fluctuation to the bottom some srp profiles had similar patterns while other profiles began with relatively high concentrations and decreased with depth in the winter e g november and december which was attributed to the supplied srp from the overlying water the kendall s tau correlations between the srp and soluble fe concentrations in the depth profiles were variable with no positive significant negative and no positive or negative correlations in the different months fig 2 the sulfate concentrations mainly decreased with depth and were the lowest in july while the chloride ion sulfate ratio stably increased with depth and was highest in july 3 3 properties of the dgt labile p and dgt labile s the two dimensional 2d monthly heat maps of the dgt labile s distributions as shown in fig 3 present remarkable spatiotemporal changes with overall high values and high horizontal heterogeneity in the spring and summer the one dimensional 1d depth distributions of dgt labile s converted from the 2d images and dgt labile p distributions fig 4 showed synchronous variation trends with significant positive correlations in most profiles except in january february and march which are characterized by the lowest dgt labile s fluxes the average dgt labile p concentrations were insufficient compared with the dgt labile s in may june and july while the dgt labile p exhibited consistent changes with the dgt labile s in the other months fig 8 in the vertical distributions of dgt labile s p the lowest values occurred in the uppermost or subsurface layer and the values continued to rise and then declined or alternately increased and decreased accompanied by fluctuations to various degrees all the data in july and october were cited from pan et al 2019a 3 4 changes in p fe and s during the indoor experiments in the experimental group as shown in fig 5 a the srp and soluble fe concentrations were lowest at 1 cm depth and they both rapidly increased in the next 2 cm followed by a slight and fluctuating increase to the bottom their changes with time presented prominent and moderate tidal patterns with higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides at 1 cm and 2 cm depth respectively and an irregular tidal pattern at 3 cm depth in the control group as shown in fig 5b the depth distributions of srp and soluble fe were variable and irregular characterized by an apparent decrease in srp with time the changes in soluble fe with time at shallow depths showed patterns similar to those in the experimental group while srp showed a remarkable tidal pattern at all depths in the experimental group as shown in fig 6 the dgt labile s fluxes during flood tides were higher than those during ebb tides with rapid increases in both at approximately 12 cm depth although a positive correlation was observed between the dgt labile p and dgt labile s their distribution trends are not uniform especially the high dgt labile p fluxes accompanied by the nearly undetectable dgt labile s at a depth of 10 cm in the control group the tidal pattern of the dgt labile s was more distinct with generally higher fluxes and shallower depths of the peak values during both flood tides and ebb tides the synchronous distributions between the dgt labile p and dgt labile s were more significant a consistent tendency of high values for both parameters during flood tides and low values for both parameters during ebb tides was also observed 3 5 diffusion fluxes of the srp across the swi the benthic diffusion fluxes of srp across the swi as shown in fig 7 were positive from the porewater to the overlying water only in may june and april negative from the overlying water to the porewater in most months and blank in july and october due to insufficient data the highest positive flux occurred in may 1 23 mg m 2 d 1 while the highest negative flux occurred in september 5 34 mg m 2 d 1 the overall trend of srp diffusion during the whole year was from the overlying water to the porewater we assume that each flux represents the value for each month and the average flux in the whole year can be calculated as 0 580 mg m 2 d 1 4 discussion 4 1 holistic assessment of p mobility and pollution compared with the defined national surface water environmental quality standards gb 3838 2002 and the sea water quality standard gb 3097 1997 in china as well as the quality standard for surface waters set by the council of the european communities 75 440 eec as shown in table 2 the overlying water srp concentrations exceeded different grades mostly grade iii of threshold values from gb 3838 2002 the supreme grade iv threshold values 0 045 mg l 1 from gb 3097 1997 in all months and the indicator level 0 1 mg l 1 for possible problematic algal growth from 75 440 eec in most months the srp concentrations were also obviously higher than those in the adjacent jiulong river estuary 0 075 mg l 1 pan et al 2019b and xixi estuary 0 1 mg l 1 unpublished results around xiamen bay these results indicate relatively inferior water quality and alarming p pollution in the jiuxi river estuary throughout the year and this pollution can be transported to the adjacent xiamen bay and promote its subsequent eutrophication the concentrations of overlying water srp porewater srp and sediment asc p were high in spring and summer and low in winter figs 1 and 8 suggesting that intense p mobilization and pollution occurred in spring and summer which were consistent with high diffusion fluxes fig 7 a previous study found that algal blooms in the xiamen sea area were generally severe in spring yang et al 2012 hence the positive fluxes in spring april may and june may act as crucial internal p loading to promote algal blooms and create a positive productivity feedback that results in deterioration of the water quality when the algae degrade afterwards in summer and autumn the highest concentrations of overlying water srp occurred and migrated back into the porewater with the highest negative fluxes fig 8 which subsequently functioned as reactive p pools for future remobilization during winter however all of the above parameters declined while high concentrations and r values of the dgt labile p were still sustained fig 8 and table 1 this result indicates a strong capacity of the sediment to resupply porewater and thus a high liberation risk to the overlying water is still present 4 2 seasonal changes in sulfate reduction and fe iii reduction and their effects on p mobility the sulfate concentrations and chloride ion sulfate ratios in fig 2 clearly reveal that the degrees of sulfate consumption are in line with the dgt labile s fluxes and have not been limiting factors for the intense dsr even in the deep sediments in july fig 3 the dgt labile s fluxes increased in spring and summer and decreased in autumn and winter figs 3 and 8 demonstrating that the dsr rates and sulfide production are highly temperature dependent possibly due to thermophilic sulfate reducing bacteria van bodegom and stams 1999 relatively low toc contents may also restrict dsr in winter bottrell et al 2009 the significant positive correlations between the dgt labile s and dgt labile p in most months fig 4 indicate a vigorous control of the intense dsr and dissolved sulfide on p mobilization and release via both anaerobic organic p mineralization and sulfide induced reductive dissolution of the fe bound p ding et al 2012 markovic et al 2019 moses and herman 1991 nevertheless the control and correlations become weak when the dsr rates decline in winter january february and march fig 4 suggesting that less dsr and sulfide production results in a decreased control on p mobilization and distribution in winter dir and dsr compete as electron acceptors during om diagenetic mineralization gonzalez silva et al 2009 while dsr commonly gains an advantage over dir and restricts soluble fe distributions in coastal sediments muyzer and stams 2008 due to sufficient om and sulfate in surface sediments the aforementioned is generally in accordance with this study which is characterized by high dgt labile s fluxes compared with a previous study in the adjacent jiulong river estuary pan et al 2019c and subnormal soluble fe concentrations in spring and summer fig 8 this result signifies that intense dsr in spring and summer dramatically suppresses dir and removes soluble fe from the porewater by coprecipitation the highest soluble fe concentrations occurred in autumn when dsr declined with the temperature and thus its restriction on dir was weakened fe iii hydr oxides are known to exert vital control on p mobility by scavenging srp through strong absorption the consistent spatiotemporal distributions of asc fe and asc p in fig 1 and reductive dissolution to release srp kraal et al 2015 rozan et al 2002 resulting in low concentrations in oxic porewater and increasing concentrations in the iron reducing zone for both srp and soluble fe ding et al 2018 however the generally inconsistent distributions and weak positive correlations between srp and soluble fe fig 2 as well as the exceptionally high srp concentrations beyond the suprathreshold values fe p molar ratio of 2 1 of p ferrihydrite assemblages thibault et al 2009 in most profiles demonstrate that fe redox geochemistry is no longer the dominant factor controlling p mobility in most months this change should be explained by the disturbance of dsr and concomitant sulfide to restrain dir coprecipitate with soluble fe cause chemical reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides that diminishes p sequestration capacity and mobilize reactive organic p ingall and jahnke 1997 middelburg and levin 2009 xiong et al 2019 leading to partial removal of soluble fe and additional srp production however due to the declining dgt labile s in the winter january and february fe cycling seems to control p mobility as evidenced by the significant positive correlation between the soluble fe and srp and the exceptional inconsistent distributions between the dgt labile s and p figs 2 and 4 respectively in addition taking the monthly average values as an example the srp concentrations showed significant positive correlations with the asc p fe contents while the dgt labile p concentrations showed significant positive correlations with the toc and trs contents fig s4 the former result indicates that although p retention is dominated by fe iii hydr oxides rozan et al 2002 the solidified fe bound p can act as an important pool for p remobilization ding et al 2015 the latter phenomenon demonstrates that the labile p in sediment is tightly coupled with dsr as toc and trs basically represent the substrate and product of dsr respectively further implying that dsr is a crucial process to improve the p mobility and the resupply capacity for persistent remobilization and liberation respectively the coupling relationship between toc and trs fig 1 also demonstrates that the accumulation of poly sulfide may be facilitated by the om burial associated with expanding hypoxic marine conditions raven et al 2016 2019 4 3 circannual cyclical pattern of p and the underlying mechanisms as the major sensitive indicators reflecting p mobility in sediments the srp and dgt labile p concentrations exhibited different monthly seasonal changes with the highest values in june and july for srp and in september and april for dgt labile p and the lowest values in the winter for both parameters fig 8 based on the monthly changes in srp and dgt labile p as well as the fe and s cycling discussed in section 4 2 and other environmental factors the underlying mechanisms responsible for the monthly seasonal p im mobilization are discussed below illustrated in fig 9 4 3 1 may june and july dsr greatly suppressed dir and dominated p mobilization via om mineralization and chemical reductive dissolution of the fe bound p resulting in the highest porewater srp concentrations fig 8 and thus considerable diffusion fluxes to the overlying water fig 7 nevertheless the dgt labile p concentrations and especially the r values were unstable even though the dgt labile p exhibited tight coupling with the dgt labile s this phenomenon could be explained by the high asc fe contents that have not been completely consumed by microbial chemical reduction thus sustaining a high p sequestration ability lin et al 2017 and persistent srp diffusion to the overlying water which greatly weakens the desorption and resupply capacities of the sediment labile p ernstberger et al 2005 4 3 2 august a week of heavy rain occurred in the beginning of august leading to a rising water level especially during low tide times pan et al 2019c have confirmed that enhanced anaerobic p mobilization and migration to the overlying water can occur under hypoxic conditions during the flood season leading to rapid labile p exhaustion in a short period this phenomenon was in accordance with the pronounced decreases in the srp dgt labile p and asc p concentrations in this study when sampling was conducted after the flood season moreover sampling coincided with the astronomical tide exceeding 5 5 m characterized by nearly evaporated overlying water during low tide time thereby maintaining a relatively well oxygenated surface layer to restrain dir and dsr with valley values until approximately 6 or 4 cm depth respectively figs 2 and 3 due to the preceding p consumption and srp diffusion from the overlying water to the sediment combined with the decreased asc fe the p resupply from the sediment is promoted to obtain the observed high dgt labile p concentrations and r values 4 3 3 september october november and december in september the increased toc input from algal degradation promoted dsr and dir while the continual and considerable srp supplementation from the overlying water fig 7 caused considerable dgt labile p concentrations during the dry season of autumn dsr still dominated p mobilization although the rates gradually decreased with decreasing temperature dir was rapidly increased and asc fe p was constantly consumed which also facilitated p mobilization with the high asc p and toc consumption levels in november the srp concentrations rapidly declined with moderately decreased dgt labile s and soluble fe concentrations however although intensive dir may contribute greatly to p mobilization the prominent increased soluble fe and existing high srp concentrations appear to exceed concentration thresholds that can trigger noteworthy fe p authigenic minerals e g vivianite nriagu 1972 vivianite has been widely found and described in marine sediments in recent years egger et al 2015 marz et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 the presence of vivianite is verified by the significant negative correlations between srp and soluble fe especially the declined srp concentrations accompanied by peak values of the soluble fe fig 2 in addition to the continual srp supplementation from the overlying water and conspicuously consumed asc fe figs 7 and 1 the presence of vivianite is also the key reason to explain the surprising r values above 1 in november and december via the established precipitation equilibrium of vivianite whereby srp supersaturation of the porewater occurs via resupply which is captured by dgt 4 3 4 january and february in winter both the dsr and dir rates decrease especially dsr with the lowest dgt labile s fluxes leading to weak p mobilization with valley levels for both srp and dgt labile p fig 8 dissolution of mobile vivianite may be the dominant p source for porewater resulting in elevated srp concentrations that occur in the porewater as the soluble fe concentrations decrease through weak dir the still high r values are due to reasons that are analogous to those for november and december 4 3 5 march and april with the temperature and precipitation rising in spring as well as the increased runoff and toc input intense dsr is resumed and dominated p mobilization leading to overall mounting srp and dgt labile p concentrations figs 2 and 4 however the elevated asc fe contents from terrigenous input can restrain p mobility by detention as asc p in surface layers fig 1 thus sustaining low concentrations of mobile p concentrations which also explains the decreased r value 0 68 in the surface layer in april on the whole the seasonal changes in dsr and s redox cycling are the main internal drivers for p mobilization and release while dir and fe cycling have been widely accepted in previous studies kraal et al 2015 pan et al 2017 xu et al 2012 this is the first time that visible evidence of coupled labile p s fig 4 has been provided to clarify the spatiotemporal domination of dsr on p mobilization in estuarine sediments in addition previous estuarine and coastal studies have revealed that temperature induced seasonal changes in the redox environment are the main external factor controlling p cycling via changed fe and s cycling liu et al 2018 pan et al 2019c rozan et al 2002 however in this study we emphasize that in addition to temperature monthly changes in runoff and tidal range are crucial external factors to control long term p cycling via changed redox environments and terrigenous material inputs this research demonstrates the significance and necessity of high resolution spatiotemporal field study for summarizing the circannual pattern of p which should reasonably consider the spatiotemporal variations in important environmental factors 4 4 verification of the tide induced p fe and s changes by the indoor experiments recently pan et al 2019c revealed that the dgt labile s in intertidal surface sediments exhibits a prominent tidal pattern with higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides in field studies our indoor experiments thoroughly verify the previous field observations of dgt labile s enrichment and consumption explained by hypoxia fueled dsr and sulfide reoxidation during the tidal cycle fig 6 furthermore we find for the first time that the soluble fe srp and dgt labile p also present similar tidal patterns during indoor experiments figs 5 and 6 demonstrating that the short term cycling of p fe and s in intertidal surface sediments is highly redox sensitive and is controlled by tidal processes in the experimental group the mixing and oxidization of sediment successfully suppressed dsr until a depth of 12 cm and weakened the consistent distributions between dgt labile s and p fig 6 however the high soluble fe concentrations and significant positive correlations with srp at all times fig s5 suggest that oxidization slightly affected dir resulting in intense dir without restriction by dsr to dominate p mobilization till at least a depth of 8 cm in addition both soluble fe and srp showed tidal patterns at a depth of 2 cm fig 5a further indicating that the domination of p mobilization and the relevant tidal pattern are controlled by fe cycling in the control group of undisturbed sediment a high dgt labile s flux occurred below the 2 cm depth during flood tides and rapidly decreased during ebb tides fig 6 accompanied by consistent dgt labile p and srp distributions figs 5b and 6 as well as irregular and declined soluble fe concentrations demonstrating that dsr effectively suppressed dir and dominated p mobilization this finding was further confirmed by the weak correlations between the soluble fe and srp fig s6 under these circumstances the tidal pattern of p occurring at all shallow depths fig 5b is also attributed to a change in dsr while the soluble fe showed a tidal pattern only at a depth of 1 cm overall the indoor experiments further verify the leading role of dsr in om mineralization and p mobilization while suppressing dir in addition the tidal pattern of dsr and associated p mobilization are remarkable which may induce intensive periodic p liberation to the overlying water high values of srp and dgt labile p in the surface layers during flood tides figs 5b and 6 however treatment by sediment oxidization can effectively restrain dsr and convert to a dir dominated system unlike dsr the tidal pattern of dir and associated p mobilization are moderate and sustain relatively low srp and dgt labile p concentrations in the surface layers even during flood tides figs 5a and 6 however against the background of accelerated global changes such as sea level rise climate change and anthropogenic activities that might result in expanding marine hypoxic conditions together with the increased om and external p input the challenge of enhanced internal p loading in estuaries and coasts is severe and more attention must be paid to this issue 5 conclusions this study provided detailed insights into the monthly seasonal p mobility and pollution in dynamic estuarine sediments and further clarified the underlying mechanisms of p im mobilization the overlying water analyses indicate a relatively inferior water quality and alarming p pollution throughout the year which are closely related to internal p cycling especially in spring and summer with high diffusion fluxes both positive and negative in spring and summer intense dsr dominated p mobilization via om mineralization and chemical reductive dissolution of the fe bound p moreover dsr suppressed dir and consumed the soluble fe by coprecipitation with sulfide this process may be enhanced during the river flood season resulting in substantial p mobilization and liberation to the overlying water in autumn the dsr rates gradually decreased with decreasing temperature and thus dir rapidly increased with high soluble fe concentrations leading to noteworthy fe p authigenesis minerals e g vivianite and declining srp concentrations however labile vivianite can act as a vital p source in winter via the precipitation equilibrium to resupply srp and dgt labile p as the soluble fe concentrations decreased due to weak dir in the following spring with increased runoff and toc input intense dsr resumed and dominated p mobilization leading to increasing srp and dgt labile p levels this circannual cyclical pattern of p indicates that dsr and s redox cycling are the main internal drivers for p mobilization while monthly changes in runoff and tidal range are crucial external factors to control long term p cycling via changed redox environments and terrigenous materials inputs the soluble fe srp and dgt labile p s presented remarkable tidal patterns in the indoor experiments with higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides demonstrating that the short term cycling of p fe and s in intertidal surface sediments is highly redox sensitive and is controlled by tidal processes the indoor experiments combined with the monthly field observations suggest that intense dsr both long term and short term greatly facilitates p mobility and release while dominant dir and fe cycling can effectively control p immobilization treatment by sediment oxidization can effectively restrain dsr and convert to a dir dominated system therefore in addition to controlling external om and p inputs we emphasize that extensive sediment oxidation can play a crucial role in

18237,internal phosphorus p mobility is crucially important to overlying water ecosystems while its spatiotemporal variations and mechanisms remain to be studied especially in dynamic estuarine sediments in this study in situ monthly field sampling and indoor experiments were combined to measure the soluble reactive p srp soluble fe and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt labile p s in the overlying water sediment and porewater in the jiuxi river estuary by employing high resolution dialysis hr peeper the dgt technique and a microrhizon sampler the consistent tendency between dgt labile s and p in most seasons indicates that p mobilization was dominated by intense dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr causing high srp concentrations and active exchange with the overlying water the circannual cyclical pattern of p is summarized where in addition to temperature monthly changes in runoff and tidal range are crucial external factors to control long term p cycling via changed redox environments and terrigenous materials inputs the mobile p fe and s present higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides in tidal simulation experiments demonstrating that the short term cycling of p fe and s in intertidal surface sediments is highly redox sensitive and controlled by tidal processes the results also reveal that dsr greatly facilitates p mobility and release while sediment oxidation and the induced enhancement in dir and fe cycling can effectively control p immobilization graphical abstract image 1 keywords diffusive gradients in thin films high resolution peeper high resolution spatiotemporal sampling tidal simulation experiment phosphorus mobility small creek estuary 1 introduction phosphorus p is commonly deemed the ultimate limiting nutrient at geologic timescales with the bioavailable p effectively controlling oceanic primary productivity and thus global carbon cycling conley et al 2009 tyrrell 1999 marine sediments and porewater are crucial biogeochemical reactors of mobile diagenetically reactive p which can act as sources or sinks of p to the overlying water markovic et al 2019 pan et al 2019c the degree to which bioavailable p is trapped in the sediment as opposed to being exported to the overlying water is generally redox dependent xiong et al 2019 overlying water hypoxia and an anoxic depositional context facilitate a decrease in the sequestration capacity of the sediment for p and accelerate anaerobic p mineralization and liberation both of which can promote the release of soluble reactive p srp to the overlying water and positive productivity feedback to deteriorate the water quality conley et al 2002 middelburg and levin 2009 in addition a high overlying water srp content can also be retained in the surface oxic sediment which acts as a potential labile p pool for internal p loading under favorable biogeochemical conditions pan et al 2019c sediment internal p mobility has a tight connection with the biogeochemical cycling of iron fe and sulfur s rozan et al 2002 dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr and dissimilatory fe iii reduction dir are two major pathways for marine organic matter om diagenetic mineralization accompanied by anaerobic organic p mineralization which are crucial processes for diagenetic p mobilization markovic et al 2019 rozan et al 2002 srp has a strong affinity to poorly crystalline and amorphous fe iii hydr oxide surfaces leading to significant scavenging of the srp from solution slomp et al 1996 under anoxic conditions fe iii hydr oxides are partially dissolved through dir releasing absorbed p into the ambient porewater lovley and phillips 1988 in addition dsr and sulfide have been found to facilitate p remobilization by chemical fe iii reduction to coprecipitate fes and fes2 which have minimal affinities for p sequestration ingall and jahnke 1997 lehtoranta et al 2009 considering their close relationship detailed insight into the relevant processes of fe and s redox cycling is of particular significance to understand p mobility in marine sediments as the transition of ocean to land an estuary is especially sensitive to increasing anthropogenic p input which can fuel the development of hypoxia and algal blooms kraal et al 2015 the sequestration and release processes of p in estuarine sediments are highly significant for the global oceanic p cycle as the sediment represents a vital p source for the open ocean paytan and mclaughlin 2007 in light of the mounting global climate changes such as sea level rise and runoff changes which can result in persistent or temporary aquatic hypoxia the benthic p cycling in estuaries may be notably converted in response to hypoxia and eutrophication diaz and rosenberg 2008 therefore clarifying the redox dependent p im mobilization processes and release mechanisms in eutrophicated estuaries is essential in addition the depositional and hydrodynamic conditions in an estuary are so dynamic that waves tides river runoff bioturbation and deposition rates are highly variable in both the long term monthly seasonal and short term tidal diurnal diagenetic p cycling in this environment is complicated and dynamic and may exhibit strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity pan et al 2019c rozan et al 2002 nevertheless high frequency field studies of p geochemistry and related processes have been insufficient most study are seasonal e g summer and winter markovic et al 2019 pan et al 2019c rozan et al 2002 and the cyclical pattern of p is not complicated because many environmental factors have not been considered further monthly field surveys and hourly indoor incubation are imperative to better understand the spatiotemporal variations in key chemicals and to summarize the cyclical pattern and im mobilization mechanisms of p which are crucial to predict its geochemical fate and control its pollution previous studies on internal p cycling have paid more attention to intermediate and large river estuaries such as the jiulong river estuary yangtze river estuary and the mouth of the mississippi river cao et al 2017 pan et al 2017 roy et al 2017 while usually ignoring fairly small creeks however a small creek may be highly polluted and eutrophic black malodorous water due to industrial and agricultural activities which lack government oversight and such a creek may have a low self purification capacity yin et al 2019 clarifying the cyclical pattern and im mobilization mechanisms of p in this environment can provide a new insight into estuarine p pollution treatment especially against the background of climate changes sea level rise and runoff changes and anthropogenic activities in this study the monthly distribution of mobile p fe and s in the sediments and porewater of the jiuxi river estuary were determined using in situ high resolution dialysis hr peeper and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt samplers based on which the mobility and pollution of p in estuarine sediments were assessed and a circannual cyclical pattern of p was summarized to explore the effects of tides on the short term changes in fe and s cycling and related p im mobilization a novel indoor tidal simulation experiment was further conducted to study the hourly changes in p fe and s during tidal oscillation using a microrhizon sampler and a dgt probe 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the study site 24 35 38 n 118 16 42 e is located in the estuary of the jiuxi river fig s1 which is a fairly small creek approximately 20 km long with a narrow watercourse dozens of meters wide and a long estuary because of macrotides with a mean tidal range of 4 1 m in addition to the strong tides the water level and hydrological conditions in the estuary are seasonally influenced by runoff this region has a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of 21 0 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1350 mm of which 70 occurs between april and september jin et al 2013 in contrast to large rivers the runoff of the jiuxi river is principally influenced by occasional heavy rainfall as shown in table s1 the dissolved oxygen do concentrations indicate some hypoxia especially in summer and autumn and the overlying water is basically alkalescent the srp concentrations in the adjacent xiamen bay are up to two times higher than those allowed by chinese sea water quality standards liao et al 2013 and are considered as the main reason for frequent eutrophication events and blooms yang et al 2012 2 2 preparation of the dgt and hr peeper probes the hr peeper sampler contained 36 equally spaced 400 μl chambers fully loaded with deionized water with a 5 mm vertical resolution and the chambers were covered by a cellulose nitrate membrane 0 45 μm pore size whatman the principle of the hr peeper is based on diffusion equilibrium allowing solutes to diffuse across the membrane and achieve equilibrium after some time teasdale et al 1995 the dgt technique is a dynamical technique based on fick s first law of diffusion and has the potential to conduct in situ measurements of the labile species in sediments with a high resolution davison and zhang 1994 the dgt measured p s comes from the porewater srp dissolved sulfide and the further release of solid easily exchangeable or mobile p s fractions to resupply the porewater which is referred to as dgt labile p s zhang et al 1995 therefore the dgt uptake process involves dynamic solid solution interactions of chemicals which are affected by their solid lability all hr peeper and zro agi dgt probes provided by easy sensor ltd www easysensor net were prepared according to xu et al 2012 and ding et al 2012 the hr peeper and zro agi dgt devices were stored in deionized water in the dark and deoxygenated with nitrogen for one day prior to deployment 2 3 field methods during the low tide period in each month from may 2018 to april 2019 one hr peeper probe was first inserted into the sediment with four chambers 2 cm above the sediment overlying water interface swi and deployed for one day a zro agi dgt probe was then inserted very close to the hr peeper and the probes were both deployed for one more day the probes were retrieved from the sediment simultaneously and carefully cleaned after that porewater samples were rapidly collected using a pipette a portion of which was acidified with hno3 for the analysis of soluble fe the dgt probes were kept moist and out of the sun prior to analysis a handheld ysi professional plus device was used to measure the overlying water properties during sampling in each month starting in july after retrieval of the hr peeper and dgt probes in each month sediment cores or surface sediments were immediately collected using hollow pvc tubes in july october january and april sediment cores were collected and sectioned at 1 cm intervals uppermost 5 cm or 2 cm intervals 6 15 cm in the remaining months only the surface 5 cm of sediments were collected these samples were sealed in polyethylene bags that had been deoxygenated with nitrogen beforehand and quickly transported to the laboratory for further analysis 2 4 indoor experiments two sediment cores and overlying water were collected using a homemade disassembled poly methyl methacrylate pmma tube and buckets at the sampling site and transported to the laboratory in the control group ten microrhizon samplers rhizon css the netherlands were inserted into the undisturbed sediment fig s2 to simulate the diurnal tide in the intertidal zone a peristaltic pump drew overlying water from the bucket to the incubator at a rate of a 2 m head in 6 h then the overlying water was drawn back to the bucket at the same rate followed by exposure in the next 12 h in the experimental group the sediment was mixed and homogenized in one day for intensive oxidization then microrhizon samplers were inserted and the tide cycle was simulated as for the control group both of which underwent another 3 tide cycles prior to sampling one zro agi dgt probe was deployed in the sediments of the control group and one in those of the experimental group then the simulated flood tide began approximately 0 5 ml porewater was extracted from the inserted microrhizon sampler by a vacuum tube every 3 h when the simulated ebb tide began the dgt probe was retrieved during the flood tide and another dgt probe was deployed during the ebb tide throughout the experiment the porewater was sampled eight times and two dgt probes were deployed for each group 2 5 chemical analyses for dgt labile s analysis the binding gels of the zro agi dgt probes were immediately cut along the open window and scanned using a scanner canon 5600f with a resolution of 600 dpi which corresponds to a pixel size of 0 042 mm 0 042 mm the scanned images were analyzed with imagej 1 46 to convert the images into grayscale intensities widerlund and davison 2007 afterwards the gels were cut into strips at 5 mm vertical intervals using ceramic knives the dgt labile p was extracted by adding 1 0 m naoh solution to the strips ding et al 2012 the concentrations of srp and soluble fe in the porewater and overlying water sampled by the hr peeper and microrhizon samplers as well as the extracted dgt labile p were determined by an enspire microplate reader perkinelmer waltham ma usa using miniaturized spectrophotometry methods laskov et al 2007 the sulfate and chloride ion concentrations were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 1600 usa some of the sediment samples were immediately centrifuged to remove the porewater these samples together with the rest of the samples were then freeze dried at 80 c and ground for further analysis the mobile p and fe were extracted by an ascorbic acid solution using a single step procedure to extract the reactive p pool asc p bound to amorphous iron and the amorphous iron asc fe rozan et al 2002 the measurement of the extracted p and fe in the eluates was also conducted by the microplate reader the total nitrogen tn total reductive sulfur trs defined as the total sulfur corrected for the sulfate removed by the porewater and total organic carbon toc were determined by a vario el iii element analyzer elementar germany the particle size was measured by a mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk using whole samples method blanks duplicates and standard materials were used for quality assurance and quality control standard materials were measured after every 10 to 20 samples three replicate measurements of the toc trs tn sulfate and chloride ion were conducted every 10 to 20 samples two replicate measurements were performed for the porewater srp and soluble fe due to the limited samples three replicate measurements were performed for all other samples the standard materials average values of the standard material recovery and relative standard deviation rsd of the replicates are shown in table s2 2 6 data

of the dgt labile p s fdgt pg cm 2 s 1 and dgt labile p concentrations cdgt mg l 1 were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively zhang et al 1995 3 f d g t m a t m s t 4 c d g t m δ g d a t where a

2016 the resupply parameter r is calculated as the ratio of the dgt labile p concentration to the srp concentration where a higher value indicates a higher resupply capacity from the sediment to the porewater the srp concentrations in the vicinity of the swi 2 cm above and below were used to calculate the benthic diffusion flux of srp between the porewater and overlying water the flux was calculated based on fick s first law and the degree of sediment tortuosity according to boudreau 1996 the correlation analysis of kendall s tau was performed using spss ver 13 0 3 results 3 1 properties of sediments and the overlying water the physicochemical properties of the surface sediments over twelve months are shown in table 1 the particle size results suggested that silt was the main sediment type which exhibited seasonal differences fig s3 the c n value ranged from 8 7 to 11 6 indicating a mixed origin of the om which was more thalassogenous overall both the monthly distributions and depth profiles of asc p and asc fe over the four months were quite consistent fig 1 and increased in summer and decreased in winter the distributions of toc and trs were also coincident with the low contents in winter and fluctuated contents in the other months fig 1 the average srp concentrations and other properties of the overlying water in each month are presented in tables 2 and s1 the srp concentrations were higher in summer and lower in winter a low salinity was observed in august march and april in accordance with the river flood season with intense rainfall http en weather com cn the dissolved oxygen do concentrations showed some hypoxia especially in summer and autumn the overlying water was basically alkalescent with a ph ranging from 7 73 to 8 46 3 2 properties of the porewater the concentrations of srp and soluble fe in the overlying water and porewater profiles are shown in fig 2 the mean concentrations of the porewater srp and soluble fe over the whole year were 0 75 mg l 1 and 1 64 mg l 1 respectively with the highest values observed in june 3 93 0 06 mg l 1 and october 6 17 0 09 mg l 1 respectively the average srp concentrations were high in spring and summer from march to october except august and low in winter while the average soluble fe concentrations were evidently high in autumn from september to december fig 8 although the depth profile varied monthly the soluble fe concentration was low in the surface layer and then increased at different depths mostly followed by a decrease and fluctuation to the bottom some srp profiles had similar patterns while other profiles began with relatively high concentrations and decreased with depth in the winter e g november and december which was attributed to the supplied srp from the overlying water the kendall s tau correlations between the srp and soluble fe concentrations in the depth profiles were variable with no positive significant negative and no positive or negative correlations in the different months fig 2 the sulfate concentrations mainly decreased with depth and were the lowest in july while the chloride ion sulfate ratio stably increased with depth and was highest in july 3 3 properties of the dgt labile p and dgt labile s the two dimensional 2d monthly heat maps of the dgt labile s distributions as shown in fig 3 present remarkable spatiotemporal changes with overall high values and high horizontal heterogeneity in the spring and summer the one dimensional 1d depth distributions of dgt labile s converted from the 2d images and dgt labile p distributions fig 4 showed synchronous variation trends with significant positive correlations in most profiles except in january february and march which are characterized by the lowest dgt labile s fluxes the average dgt labile p concentrations were insufficient compared with the dgt labile s in may june and july while the dgt labile p exhibited consistent changes with the dgt labile s in the other months fig 8 in the vertical distributions of dgt labile s p the lowest values occurred in the uppermost or subsurface layer and the values continued to rise and then declined or alternately increased and decreased accompanied by fluctuations to various degrees all the data in july and october were cited from pan et al 2019a 3 4 changes in p fe and s during the indoor experiments in the experimental group as shown in fig 5 a the srp and soluble fe concentrations were lowest at 1 cm depth and they both rapidly increased in the next 2 cm followed by a slight and fluctuating increase to the bottom their changes with time presented prominent and moderate tidal patterns with higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides at 1 cm and 2 cm depth respectively and an irregular tidal pattern at 3 cm depth in the control group as shown in fig 5b the depth distributions of srp and soluble fe were variable and irregular characterized by an apparent decrease in srp with time the changes in soluble fe with time at shallow depths showed patterns similar to those in the experimental group while srp showed a remarkable tidal pattern at all depths in the experimental group as shown in fig 6 the dgt labile s fluxes during flood tides were higher than those during ebb tides with rapid increases in both at approximately 12 cm depth although a positive correlation was observed between the dgt labile p and dgt labile s their distribution trends are not uniform especially the high dgt labile p fluxes accompanied by the nearly undetectable dgt labile s at a depth of 10 cm in the control group the tidal pattern of the dgt labile s was more distinct with generally higher fluxes and shallower depths of the peak values during both flood tides and ebb tides the synchronous distributions between the dgt labile p and dgt labile s were more significant a consistent tendency of high values for both parameters during flood tides and low values for both parameters during ebb tides was also observed 3 5 diffusion fluxes of the srp across the swi the benthic diffusion fluxes of srp across the swi as shown in fig 7 were positive from the porewater to the overlying water only in may june and april negative from the overlying water to the porewater in most months and blank in july and october due to insufficient data the highest positive flux occurred in may 1 23 mg m 2 d 1 while the highest negative flux occurred in september 5 34 mg m 2 d 1 the overall trend of srp diffusion during the whole year was from the overlying water to the porewater we assume that each flux represents the value for each month and the average flux in the whole year can be calculated as 0 580 mg m 2 d 1 4 discussion 4 1 holistic assessment of p mobility and pollution compared with the defined national surface water environmental quality standards gb 3838 2002 and the sea water quality standard gb 3097 1997 in china as well as the quality standard for surface waters set by the council of the european communities 75 440 eec as shown in table 2 the overlying water srp concentrations exceeded different grades mostly grade iii of threshold values from gb 3838 2002 the supreme grade iv threshold values 0 045 mg l 1 from gb 3097 1997 in all months and the indicator level 0 1 mg l 1 for possible problematic algal growth from 75 440 eec in most months the srp concentrations were also obviously higher than those in the adjacent jiulong river estuary 0 075 mg l 1 pan et al 2019b and xixi estuary 0 1 mg l 1 unpublished results around xiamen bay these results indicate relatively inferior water quality and alarming p pollution in the jiuxi river estuary throughout the year and this pollution can be transported to the adjacent xiamen bay and promote its subsequent eutrophication the concentrations of overlying water srp porewater srp and sediment asc p were high in spring and summer and low in winter figs 1 and 8 suggesting that intense p mobilization and pollution occurred in spring and summer which were consistent with high diffusion fluxes fig 7 a previous study found that algal blooms in the xiamen sea area were generally severe in spring yang et al 2012 hence the positive fluxes in spring april may and june may act as crucial internal p loading to promote algal blooms and create a positive productivity feedback that results in deterioration of the water quality when the algae degrade afterwards in summer and autumn the highest concentrations of overlying water srp occurred and migrated back into the porewater with the highest negative fluxes fig 8 which subsequently functioned as reactive p pools for future remobilization during winter however all of the above parameters declined while high concentrations and r values of the dgt labile p were still sustained fig 8 and table 1 this result indicates a strong capacity of the sediment to resupply porewater and thus a high liberation risk to the overlying water is still present 4 2 seasonal changes in sulfate reduction and fe iii reduction and their effects on p mobility the sulfate concentrations and chloride ion sulfate ratios in fig 2 clearly reveal that the degrees of sulfate consumption are in line with the dgt labile s fluxes and have not been limiting factors for the intense dsr even in the deep sediments in july fig 3 the dgt labile s fluxes increased in spring and summer and decreased in autumn and winter figs 3 and 8 demonstrating that the dsr rates and sulfide production are highly temperature dependent possibly due to thermophilic sulfate reducing bacteria van bodegom and stams 1999 relatively low toc contents may also restrict dsr in winter bottrell et al 2009 the significant positive correlations between the dgt labile s and dgt labile p in most months fig 4 indicate a vigorous control of the intense dsr and dissolved sulfide on p mobilization and release via both anaerobic organic p mineralization and sulfide induced reductive dissolution of the fe bound p ding et al 2012 markovic et al 2019 moses and herman 1991 nevertheless the control and correlations become weak when the dsr rates decline in winter january february and march fig 4 suggesting that less dsr and sulfide production results in a decreased control on p mobilization and distribution in winter dir and dsr compete as electron acceptors during om diagenetic mineralization gonzalez silva et al 2009 while dsr commonly gains an advantage over dir and restricts soluble fe distributions in coastal sediments muyzer and stams 2008 due to sufficient om and sulfate in surface sediments the aforementioned is generally in accordance with this study which is characterized by high dgt labile s fluxes compared with a previous study in the adjacent jiulong river estuary pan et al 2019c and subnormal soluble fe concentrations in spring and summer fig 8 this result signifies that intense dsr in spring and summer dramatically suppresses dir and removes soluble fe from the porewater by coprecipitation the highest soluble fe concentrations occurred in autumn when dsr declined with the temperature and thus its restriction on dir was weakened fe iii hydr oxides are known to exert vital control on p mobility by scavenging srp through strong absorption the consistent spatiotemporal distributions of asc fe and asc p in fig 1 and reductive dissolution to release srp kraal et al 2015 rozan et al 2002 resulting in low concentrations in oxic porewater and increasing concentrations in the iron reducing zone for both srp and soluble fe ding et al 2018 however the generally inconsistent distributions and weak positive correlations between srp and soluble fe fig 2 as well as the exceptionally high srp concentrations beyond the suprathreshold values fe p molar ratio of 2 1 of p ferrihydrite assemblages thibault et al 2009 in most profiles demonstrate that fe redox geochemistry is no longer the dominant factor controlling p mobility in most months this change should be explained by the disturbance of dsr and concomitant sulfide to restrain dir coprecipitate with soluble fe cause chemical reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides that diminishes p sequestration capacity and mobilize reactive organic p ingall and jahnke 1997 middelburg and levin 2009 xiong et al 2019 leading to partial removal of soluble fe and additional srp production however due to the declining dgt labile s in the winter january and february fe cycling seems to control p mobility as evidenced by the significant positive correlation between the soluble fe and srp and the exceptional inconsistent distributions between the dgt labile s and p figs 2 and 4 respectively in addition taking the monthly average values as an example the srp concentrations showed significant positive correlations with the asc p fe contents while the dgt labile p concentrations showed significant positive correlations with the toc and trs contents fig s4 the former result indicates that although p retention is dominated by fe iii hydr oxides rozan et al 2002 the solidified fe bound p can act as an important pool for p remobilization ding et al 2015 the latter phenomenon demonstrates that the labile p in sediment is tightly coupled with dsr as toc and trs basically represent the substrate and product of dsr respectively further implying that dsr is a crucial process to improve the p mobility and the resupply capacity for persistent remobilization and liberation respectively the coupling relationship between toc and trs fig 1 also demonstrates that the accumulation of poly sulfide may be facilitated by the om burial associated with expanding hypoxic marine conditions raven et al 2016 2019 4 3 circannual cyclical pattern of p and the underlying mechanisms as the major sensitive indicators reflecting p mobility in sediments the srp and dgt labile p concentrations exhibited different monthly seasonal changes with the highest values in june and july for srp and in september and april for dgt labile p and the lowest values in the winter for both parameters fig 8 based on the monthly changes in srp and dgt labile p as well as the fe and s cycling discussed in section 4 2 and other environmental factors the underlying mechanisms responsible for the monthly seasonal p im mobilization are discussed below illustrated in fig 9 4 3 1 may june and july dsr greatly suppressed dir and dominated p mobilization via om mineralization and chemical reductive dissolution of the fe bound p resulting in the highest porewater srp concentrations fig 8 and thus considerable diffusion fluxes to the overlying water fig 7 nevertheless the dgt labile p concentrations and especially the r values were unstable even though the dgt labile p exhibited tight coupling with the dgt labile s this phenomenon could be explained by the high asc fe contents that have not been completely consumed by microbial chemical reduction thus sustaining a high p sequestration ability lin et al 2017 and persistent srp diffusion to the overlying water which greatly weakens the desorption and resupply capacities of the sediment labile p ernstberger et al 2005 4 3 2 august a week of heavy rain occurred in the beginning of august leading to a rising water level especially during low tide times pan et al 2019c have confirmed that enhanced anaerobic p mobilization and migration to the overlying water can occur under hypoxic conditions during the flood season leading to rapid labile p exhaustion in a short period this phenomenon was in accordance with the pronounced decreases in the srp dgt labile p and asc p concentrations in this study when sampling was conducted after the flood season moreover sampling coincided with the astronomical tide exceeding 5 5 m characterized by nearly evaporated overlying water during low tide time thereby maintaining a relatively well oxygenated surface layer to restrain dir and dsr with valley values until approximately 6 or 4 cm depth respectively figs 2 and 3 due to the preceding p consumption and srp diffusion from the overlying water to the sediment combined with the decreased asc fe the p resupply from the sediment is promoted to obtain the observed high dgt labile p concentrations and r values 4 3 3 september october november and december in september the increased toc input from algal degradation promoted dsr and dir while the continual and considerable srp supplementation from the overlying water fig 7 caused considerable dgt labile p concentrations during the dry season of autumn dsr still dominated p mobilization although the rates gradually decreased with decreasing temperature dir was rapidly increased and asc fe p was constantly consumed which also facilitated p mobilization with the high asc p and toc consumption levels in november the srp concentrations rapidly declined with moderately decreased dgt labile s and soluble fe concentrations however although intensive dir may contribute greatly to p mobilization the prominent increased soluble fe and existing high srp concentrations appear to exceed concentration thresholds that can trigger noteworthy fe p authigenic minerals e g vivianite nriagu 1972 vivianite has been widely found and described in marine sediments in recent years egger et al 2015 marz et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 the presence of vivianite is verified by the significant negative correlations between srp and soluble fe especially the declined srp concentrations accompanied by peak values of the soluble fe fig 2 in addition to the continual srp supplementation from the overlying water and conspicuously consumed asc fe figs 7 and 1 the presence of vivianite is also the key reason to explain the surprising r values above 1 in november and december via the established precipitation equilibrium of vivianite whereby srp supersaturation of the porewater occurs via resupply which is captured by dgt 4 3 4 january and february in winter both the dsr and dir rates decrease especially dsr with the lowest dgt labile s fluxes leading to weak p mobilization with valley levels for both srp and dgt labile p fig 8 dissolution of mobile vivianite may be the dominant p source for porewater resulting in elevated srp concentrations that occur in the porewater as the soluble fe concentrations decrease through weak dir the still high r values are due to reasons that are analogous to those for november and december 4 3 5 march and april with the temperature and precipitation rising in spring as well as the increased runoff and toc input intense dsr is resumed and dominated p mobilization leading to overall mounting srp and dgt labile p concentrations figs 2 and 4 however the elevated asc fe contents from terrigenous input can restrain p mobility by detention as asc p in surface layers fig 1 thus sustaining low concentrations of mobile p concentrations which also explains the decreased r value 0 68 in the surface layer in april on the whole the seasonal changes in dsr and s redox cycling are the main internal drivers for p mobilization and release while dir and fe cycling have been widely accepted in previous studies kraal et al 2015 pan et al 2017 xu et al 2012 this is the first time that visible evidence of coupled labile p s fig 4 has been provided to clarify the spatiotemporal domination of dsr on p mobilization in estuarine sediments in addition previous estuarine and coastal studies have revealed that temperature induced seasonal changes in the redox environment are the main external factor controlling p cycling via changed fe and s cycling liu et al 2018 pan et al 2019c rozan et al 2002 however in this study we emphasize that in addition to temperature monthly changes in runoff and tidal range are crucial external factors to control long term p cycling via changed redox environments and terrigenous material inputs this research demonstrates the significance and necessity of high resolution spatiotemporal field study for summarizing the circannual pattern of p which should reasonably consider the spatiotemporal variations in important environmental factors 4 4 verification of the tide induced p fe and s changes by the indoor experiments recently pan et al 2019c revealed that the dgt labile s in intertidal surface sediments exhibits a prominent tidal pattern with higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides in field studies our indoor experiments thoroughly verify the previous field observations of dgt labile s enrichment and consumption explained by hypoxia fueled dsr and sulfide reoxidation during the tidal cycle fig 6 furthermore we find for the first time that the soluble fe srp and dgt labile p also present similar tidal patterns during indoor experiments figs 5 and 6 demonstrating that the short term cycling of p fe and s in intertidal surface sediments is highly redox sensitive and is controlled by tidal processes in the experimental group the mixing and oxidization of sediment successfully suppressed dsr until a depth of 12 cm and weakened the consistent distributions between dgt labile s and p fig 6 however the high soluble fe concentrations and significant positive correlations with srp at all times fig s5 suggest that oxidization slightly affected dir resulting in intense dir without restriction by dsr to dominate p mobilization till at least a depth of 8 cm in addition both soluble fe and srp showed tidal patterns at a depth of 2 cm fig 5a further indicating that the domination of p mobilization and the relevant tidal pattern are controlled by fe cycling in the control group of undisturbed sediment a high dgt labile s flux occurred below the 2 cm depth during flood tides and rapidly decreased during ebb tides fig 6 accompanied by consistent dgt labile p and srp distributions figs 5b and 6 as well as irregular and declined soluble fe concentrations demonstrating that dsr effectively suppressed dir and dominated p mobilization this finding was further confirmed by the weak correlations between the soluble fe and srp fig s6 under these circumstances the tidal pattern of p occurring at all shallow depths fig 5b is also attributed to a change in dsr while the soluble fe showed a tidal pattern only at a depth of 1 cm overall the indoor experiments further verify the leading role of dsr in om mineralization and p mobilization while suppressing dir in addition the tidal pattern of dsr and associated p mobilization are remarkable which may induce intensive periodic p liberation to the overlying water high values of srp and dgt labile p in the surface layers during flood tides figs 5b and 6 however treatment by sediment oxidization can effectively restrain dsr and convert to a dir dominated system unlike dsr the tidal pattern of dir and associated p mobilization are moderate and sustain relatively low srp and dgt labile p concentrations in the surface layers even during flood tides figs 5a and 6 however against the background of accelerated global changes such as sea level rise climate change and anthropogenic activities that might result in expanding marine hypoxic conditions together with the increased om and external p input the challenge of enhanced internal p loading in estuaries and coasts is severe and more attention must be paid to this issue 5 conclusions this study provided detailed insights into the monthly seasonal p mobility and pollution in dynamic estuarine sediments and further clarified the underlying mechanisms of p im mobilization the overlying water analyses indicate a relatively inferior water quality and alarming p pollution throughout the year which are closely related to internal p cycling especially in spring and summer with high diffusion fluxes both positive and negative in spring and summer intense dsr dominated p mobilization via om mineralization and chemical reductive dissolution of the fe bound p moreover dsr suppressed dir and consumed the soluble fe by coprecipitation with sulfide this process may be enhanced during the river flood season resulting in substantial p mobilization and liberation to the overlying water in autumn the dsr rates gradually decreased with decreasing temperature and thus dir rapidly increased with high soluble fe concentrations leading to noteworthy fe p authigenesis minerals e g vivianite and declining srp concentrations however labile vivianite can act as a vital p source in winter via the precipitation equilibrium to resupply srp and dgt labile p as the soluble fe concentrations decreased due to weak dir in the following spring with increased runoff and toc input intense dsr resumed and dominated p mobilization leading to increasing srp and dgt labile p levels this circannual cyclical pattern of p indicates that dsr and s redox cycling are the main internal drivers for p mobilization while monthly changes in runoff and tidal range are crucial external factors to control long term p cycling via changed redox environments and terrigenous materials inputs the soluble fe srp and dgt labile p s presented remarkable tidal patterns in the indoor experiments with higher values during flood tides and lower values during ebb tides demonstrating that the short term cycling of p fe and s in intertidal surface sediments is highly redox sensitive and is controlled by tidal processes the indoor experiments combined with the monthly field observations suggest that intense dsr both long term and short term greatly facilitates p mobility and release while dominant dir and fe cycling can effectively control p immobilization treatment by sediment oxidization can effectively restrain dsr and convert to a dir dominated system therefore in addition to controlling external om and p inputs we emphasize that extensive sediment oxidation can play a crucial role in controlling the internal p loading in estuarine sediments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

18238,ammonium removal by a coupling process of microalgae chlorella sorokiniana with partial nitrifying granules was evaluated in batch reactors illuminated in a wide range of light intensities 0 100 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ammonium oxidation performance for different light exposure time showed that the granules had a light stress tolerance at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for up to 12 h but continuous illumination induced severe inhibition on nitrifying bacteria thereafter ammonium removal efficiencies at the end of tests were 66 62 5 and 10 due to ammonification for 0 100 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively the nitrogen mass balance shows co occurrence of microalgal growth taking up 24 of fed ammonium and nitrifying bacteria oxidizing 38 of fed ammonium at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 while both nitrification and microalgal growth are inhibited at light intensity above 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in comparing results from this study with previous results it was found that the ammonium removal pathway i e nitrification or microalgal uptake is regulated more strongly by daily average light intensity than by instantaneous light intensity empirical model equations to estimate the oxygen balance in consortium reactors categorized the effect of daily average light intensities on process performance as follows i below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 insufficient oxygen for nitrification ii 27 to 35 sufficient oxygen for nitrification via nitrite iii 35 to 180 sufficient oxygen for nitrification via nitrate iv above approximately 200 300 oversaturated dissolved oxygen excess free ammonia and or intensive light inhibitions graphical abstract image 1 keywords energy saving process photo oxygenation short cut nitrogen removal ammonium removal pathway empirical model 1 introduction modern development has been associated with intensive urbanization and industrialization which have accelerated serious environmental pollution ammonium nh4 is contained in municipal wastewater and various industrial wastewaters from coking petroleum refining tanneries textile manufacturing pharmaceutical production catalyst factories sludge digester liquor and landfill leachate atkins jr and scherger 1997 lai et al 2013 nosratinia et al 2014 peng et al 2004 zhang et al 1998 direct discharge of these wastewaters into lakes and rivers can cause eutrophication the most commonly used nh4 removal process in wastewater is sequential nitrification denitrification nh4 is oxidized to nitrate no3 in aerobic nitrification while no3 is converted into nitrogen gas n2 in anoxic denitrification process in those processes mechanical aeration must be conducted for nitrification and addition of chemical reagents such as methanol must be added for denitrification leading to high investment and operating costs which goes against the current trend of sustainable development therefore it is desirable to develop a more cost and energy effective approach in the past decade using a consortium of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae for nh4 containing wastewater treatment has gained attention because it offers the following advantages i minimises costly mechanical aeration via photo oxygenation by the microalgae karya et al 2013 ii it reduces inorganic nitrogen compounds due to nutrient assimilation by the microalgae iii it mitigates problems with free ammonia fa nh3 stress during algal treatment of high nh4 strength wastewaters through nitrification de godos et al 2009 iv it increases the phosphorus to nitrogen p n ratio which makes the medium suitable for microalgae cultivation praveen et al 2018 and v it produces commercial co products such as biofuels bioplastics biofertilizers and animal aquatic feed from harvested microalgae gouveia et al 2016 rizwan et al 2018 nitrogen removal through nitrite no2 rather than through no3 is an environmentally friendly process because it requires less aeration and low external carbon demand due to the oxidation of nh4 to no2 and its direct denitrification this short cut process can theoretically reduce 25 of oxygen o2 requirements in the nitrification and 40 of the organic carbon demand for denitrification in comparison with conventional nitrogen removal via no3 chung et al 2007 coupling microalgae photosynthesis with short cut nitrogen removal via no2 can be a most effective method for treating nh4 containing wastewaters several studies have shown the applicability of consortia of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae for nh4 removal via no3 from wastewaters akizuki et al 2019 de godos et al 2009 jia and yuan 2018 karya et al 2013 vargas et al 2016 although there are fewer studies on nh4 removal via no2 than there are on nh4 removal via no3 the effectiveness of the method has been confirmed wang et al 2015 most previous studies on consortia of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae have used mild light intensities below approximately 200 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to conduct their experiments de godos et al 2009 karya et al 2013 vargas et al 2016 wang et al 2015 however there is limited information regarding the effect of strong light intensities for the wastewater treatment system to be economically feasible sunlight often exceeding 1000 2000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 bohutskyi et al 2016 morita et al 2000 is preferable to artificial light as the source of illumination thus the study on the effect of wide range of light intensities on the consortia is required in consortia reactors nh4 removal occurs via two different pathways oxidation by nitrification and microalgal uptake knowing the nh4 removal pathway is important for maintaining process stability for instance if nitrification is a dominant pathway o2 supply by microalgae photosynthesis will be limited which may result in process failure conversely if microalgal uptake is the dominant pathway and nitrification is limited the advantages of harvesting a co culture of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria i e adjusting the medium by increase of p n ratio and or mitigating fa inhibition will be nullified light intensity seems to be a one of main regulating factors for determining the nh4 removal pathway because nitrifying bacteria are inhibited by light illumination merbt et al 2012 while microalgae need light for their photosynthetic growth as energy source however previous studies have shown the differences in the amount of nh4 via each pathway even under similar light conditions for instance karya et al 2013 operated an open photo bioreactor with a light intensity of 63 μmol photons m 2 s 1 at 30 c they reported that more than 80 of nh4 removal was performed by nitrification and the remaining 20 by microalgal uptake in a study of vargas et al 2016 who used a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr illuminated at light intensity of 67 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 at 27 2 c contribution of nitrification to nh4 removal was approximately 60 which is lower than the result of karya et al 2013 it is necessary to understand the factors regulating the nh4 removal pathway in consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different light intensities on the nh4 removal ability of consortium of microalgae and partial nitrifying bacteria microbial aggregates granules have an excellent settling ability which helps to separate suspended microalgae and bacterial granules easily simplifying microalgae harvest procedure even so combination of suspended microalgae and granulated bacteria have been rarely studied because previous studies have commonly focused on the use of microalgae bacteria aggregates arcila and buitrón 2016 zou et al 2018 in addition our previous work indicates that granulated nitrifying bacteria have stronger light stress tolerance than dispersed nitrifying bacteria akizuki et al submitted therefore the nitrifying granules were used as inoculum in this study furthermore regulating factors for determining the relative contribution of nitrification and microalgal uptake to nh4 removal were revealed by summarizing the results of this study and previous studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculums and synthetic wastewater the seed sludge was obtained from an aerobic tank in a full scale anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o treatment system at the hokubu sludge treatment centre yokohama japan the collected

average light intensity was assumed to be the dominant factor regulating nh4 removal pathway seefig 5b we used the slope of the regression of nh4 vs daily light intensity to estimate the o2 supplied

were combined into one figure to compare the estimated o2 supplied by microalgae and o2 required for nitrification via no3 and via no2 at different daily average light intensity see fig 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 process performance fig 1 shows nitrogen compound concentrations over time under each lighting condition during the experimental period no3 was not detected under any conditions indicating that partial nitrification occurred without no2 oxidation to no3 during the first 12 h of the experiment nh4 concentration decreased and no2 concentration increased for all batch conditions representing the progress of partial nitrification after that the tendency differed depending on light intensities at the lower light intensities of 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 partial nitrification continued until the end of the experiment with no2 concentrations reaching 27 9 and 16 5 mg n l 1 respectively meanwhile at light intensity of 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nitrification stopped completely after 24 h of the experiment and nh4 concentration stayed at the same level at the highest light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nitrification stopped after 12 h and the nh4 concentration actually increased thereafter ward 2011 reported that photoinhibition of nitrifying bacteria may occur because cytochromes involved in the energy transduction pathways of nitrification are damaged by strong light in addition to its inhibitory effects on ammonia oxidization vanzella et al 1989 the photochemical generation of carbon monoxide from dissolved organic matter sipma et al 2006 makes the mechanism of nitrification photoinhibition more complex vanzella et al 1990 our results for higher light intensities show that nitrifying bacteria was inhibited under light intensities of 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 or higher this observation is consistent with previous literature merbt et al 2012 vergara et al 2016 it is known that some portion of bacterial cells is slowly biodegradable chen et al 2008 and the cell contents can be released from the decayed bacteria zekker et al 2012 it is thought that at light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nitrifying bacteria were inhibited and may even have decayed due to strong light exposure possibly causing an increase in nh4 concentration our previous work showed that nitrifying granules tolerate strong light exposure up to 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this is better tolerance than dispersed and flocculated nitrifying bacteria akizuki et al submitted however notable decrease in no2 production was observed at above 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in this study this difference could be explained by the difference the granules light exposure time fig 2 shows the normalized partial nitrification efficiencies i e no2 production at each light intensity divided by no2 production at dark condition at different light exposure time at 12 h normalized efficiency decreased slightly with increasing light intensity but remained at approximately 70 level even at a strongest light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result is consistent with the result of our prior work where we conducted a 12 h batch assay akizuki et al submitted this phenomenon is probably due to light attenuation inside the granules for example kühl et al 1996 reported that incident light at the bottom of the biofilm was strongly attenuated to 5 10 of incident surface irradiance wang et al 2005 analysed transmittance of the light blue filter kb 4 olympus from the surface to the centre of an aerobic granule they reported that transmission of incident light clearly decreased with increasing thickness of the layer so that around 50 of incident light was obscured at 250 μm from surface as the average radius in the partial nitrifying granules used in this study was around 150 μm probably the incident light was probably partially attenuated inside the granules leading to a light stress tolerance at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for up to 12 h however at longer experimental times 24 48 and 72 h the normalized nitrification efficiency at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 drastically decreased to 32 8 17 2 and 9 4 respectively this implies that longer exposure time to light increased light stress in nitrifying bacteria this argument is supported by several previous studies merbt et al 2012 examined the effect of light intensity on different nitrifying bacteria nitrosopumilus maritinmus nitrosotalea devanaterra nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosopira multiformis under continuous illumination and light dark cycles 8 h light 16 h dark they showed that a light dark cycle was associated with lower light inhibition than continuous illumination wan et al 2018 reported that the activity of nitrifying bacteria was reduced by light exposure but not completely inhibited within a diel cycle in this study although partial nitrifying granules had a certain light stress tolerance at strong light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 until 12 h continuous illumination induced severe inhibition on nitrifying bacteria with experimental time thus a diel light cycle may be a practical approach to allow nitrifying bacteria to recover from light stress if this hypothesis gains support from further research the partial nitrifying granules may be applied to the natural light condition table 1 shows specific nh4 removal and no2 production rates similar nh4 removal rates of 18 8 and 17 1 mg n g ss 1 d 1 were observed at 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the linear regression of the nh4 removal rate was not statistically significant because nh4 stopped decreasing after 24 h of the experiment at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 a slight release of nh4 with a value of 0 119 mg n g ss 1 d 1 was observed the specific no2 production rates decreased with increasing light intensity 16 8 10 3 and 3 0 mg n g ss 1 d 1 at 0 100 and 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the linear regression of the no2 production rate was not statistically significant because no2 production almost stopped after 12 h of the experiment although the no2 production rate at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was lower than that at 0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the similar nh4 removal rates were observed this indicates that nh4 uptake by microalgae in addition to nh4 oxidation occurred at the 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the do values at the end of the experiment were 6 10 0 27 7 19 0 34 6 87 0 16 and 7 75 0 29 mg l 1 respectively for the 0 100 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 cases fig 3 this result indicates that an adequate do concentration for complete nitrification reaction approximately 2 0 2 5 mg l 1 ruiz et al 2003 jianlong and ning 2004 was maintained and there was no lack of oxygen during the experimental period the do value at 0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was significantly p 0 05 dunnett s test lower than the do value at other light intensities the highest do value was observed at the highest light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 probably because there was no o2 consumption by nitrifying bacteria due to light inhibition although active nh4 oxidation by partial nitrification occurred at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the do value observed at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was higher than that observed at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result implies that photosynthesis by microalgae occurred effectively at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 while that at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ceased may be due to photoinhibition this inhibition could also be attributed to ph variations however despite ph not being measured during the experiment both nitrification and microalgae activities were scarcely detected at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 therefore the ph of the culture was likely stable enough as to not induce marked inhibition 3 2 nitrogen mass balance nh4 removal efficiency and the nitrogen mass balance at the end of the experiment are shown in fig 4 relatively higher nh4 removal efficiencies of 66 4 and 61 6 were achieved at 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively the efficiency decreased drastically to 5 2 at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and even to 10 due to release of nh4 at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the nitrogen mass balance shows considerable microalgal uptake of nh4 10 mg n l 1 corresponding to 22 3 of added nh4 at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 but not at 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result indicates that strong light intensity inhibited not only nitrifying bacteria but also microalgae chlorella sorokiniana growth this result indicates that strong light intensity inhibited microalgae chlorella sorokiniana growth it was previously reported that the primary mechanism of photoinhibition comes into play when antenna complexes enter triplet states during light absorption and create reactive oxygen species ros that damage the photosynthetic machinery erickson et al 2015 in consortia reactors of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria weak light intensity can induce low nutrient uptake as well as insufficient o2 supplied by microalgae even so extreme light exposure can result in the failure of the process due to the sensitiveness of both the nitrifying bacteria and microalgae it has been confirmed that appropriate light intensity for photosynthesis can vary over a wide range for different aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms bohutskyi et al 2016 philips and mitsui 1982 reported that saturated light intensity tolerance for the identified 24 microalgae species primarily dinoflagellates and diatoms ranged from 30 to 280 μmol photons m 2 s 1 another study reported that scenedesmus spp showed high biomass yield at 250 and 400 μmol photons m 2 s 1 than at 50 μmol photons m 2 s 1 liu et al 2012 several studies reported that chlorella sp prefer lower light intensity than other species for instance cheirsilp and torpee 2012 showed that marine chlorella sp grew better at a light intensity below 5000 lux approximately 90 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nurminen and horppila 2006 than did nannochloropsis sp meanwhile nannochloropsis sp continued to grow even at light intensities above 6000 lux approximately 108 μmol photons m 2 s 1 other studies have shown that saturated light intensity tolerance was 62 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for chlorella vulgaris and 250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for chlorella kesskeri kim et al 2002 as microalgae have a unique requirement for light intensity and chlorella sp have a lower tolerance to light exposure the growth of chlorella sorokiniana in this study was possibly inhibited at light intensities greater than 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 leading to lower nh4 removal efficiencies since outdoor light intensity on sunny day often exceed to 1000 2000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 several strategies such as using shading nets pizzera et al 2019 or photo acclimatization to extreme illumination levels dubinsky and stambler 2009 need to be examined to mitigate light inhibition prior to scaling up a process 3 3 factors regulating the nh4 removal pathway to evaluate the effect of operating parameters on the nh4 removal pathway i e oxidation by nitrification or microalgal uptake different studies on consortia of microalgal and nitrifying bacteria including this study were summarized table 2 the relative contribution of nitrification microalgal uptake to nh4 removal varied widely from 0 to 99 5 100 0 5 depending on the study in the studies of karya et al 2013 van der steen et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and the 0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 experiment of our work nitrification was the main pathway relative contribution 82 5 99 5 vargas et al 2016 found both the nitrification and microalgal uptake were main pathways 60 and 40 respectively meanwhile de godos et al 2009 showed that nh4 removal was mainly performed by microalgal uptake 77 100 the relationship between the relative contribution of nitrification to nh4 removal and possible factors controlling nh4 removal pathway is shown in fig 5 this figure includes the results of this study and previous studies except for the results at 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 of our work because those high light intensities induced severe inhibition on nh4 removal performance fig 4 and table 2 based on the slope of the linear regressions shown in fig 4 daily average light intensity exerted the highest influence on the relative contribution of nitrification y 0 473x 100 r 0 957 p 0 01 fig 5b followed by instantaneous light intensity y 0 414x 100 r 0 865 p 0 01 fig 5a although it has been widely accepted that light intensity affects the cultivation of microalgae feng et al 2011 cheirsilp and torpee 2012 the daily average light intensity regulates the nh4 pathway more strongly compared to instantaneous light intensity some previous studies reported that in addition to the light intensity the illumination period also affects microalgal growth for instance dumrattana and tansakul 2006 showed that better growth of botryococcus braunii is achieved under continuous illumination with a light intensity of 120 μmol photons m 2 s 1 compared to diurnal illumination cycles under 12 12 h and 16 8 h light dark khoeyi et al 2012 demonstrated that even at the same light intensity of 62 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 maximum biomass production of chlorella vulgaris was observed under a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod higher than under 8 16 and 12 12 h cycles as a consequence it is worth noting that daily average light intensity can accurately characterize the relative contribution of nh4 removal in consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria within the range of observation i e 0 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 even with different conditions including reactor type continuous sequential batch and batch substrate type synthetic and real wastewaters microalgae species bacterial source form dispersed and granulated light intensity 0 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 water temperature 21 30 c ph 7 5 8 1 and initial nh4 concentration 26 6 1500 mg n l 1 even so it should be mentioned that this relationship can be changed under large scale outdoor conditions the corresponding slope value showed that ph values also have a significant relationship with the nh4 removal pathway y 138x 1121 r 0 887 p 0 01 fig 5c this result may be due to the difference in favourable ph range for microalgae and nitrifying bacteria however contrary to expectation previous research has not shown a large difference in appropriate ph ranges among nitrifying bacteria 7 8 8 9 wild et al 1971 7 5 8 0 painter and loveless 1983 7 5 8 6 metcalf and eddy 1991 and microalgae species used in consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria 7 5 8 0 chlorella vulgaris sakarika and kornaros 2019 7 7 8 0 pleurochrysis carterae moheimani 2005 7 8 nannochloris sp kim and lee 2016 we also found a positive correlation between ph and light intensity and daily average light intensity r 0 859 p 0 01 thus the positive correlation observed between ph and the relative contribution of nitrification to nh4 removal may be an indirect consequence of the ph increase derived from active photosynthesis there is a possibility that the ph values directly affect the nh4 removal pathway when dominant microalgae are acidophilic or alkaliphilic species such as chlamydomonas eustigma hirooka et al 2017 or arthrospira platensis benelhadj et al 2016 because these species show a large difference in optimal ph with nitrifying bacteria 3 4 optimization of daily average light intensity comparison of nitrification via no2 vs no3 in a microalgal nitrifying bacterial reactor without mechanical aeration the presence of o2 in the reactor will fluctuate based on the balance between o2 supply by microalgae and o2 consumption by nitrifying bacteria if photosynthesis is limited and o2 supply is insufficient for the progress of nitrification nh4 removal efficiency will decrease meanwhile if there is too much o2 supply then the system is consuming more energy than it needs to to produce light unless sunlight is used in addition a drastic increase in photosynthesis activity may cause i oversaturated do which inhibits microalgal growth kumar et al 2010 and ii fa inhibition of nitrifying bacteria and also of the microalgae themselves azov and goldman 1982 due to fa s uncoupling effect on photosynthetic processes in isolated chloroplasts crofts 1966 therefore the o2 balance has to be carefully considered to avoid process failure at daily average light intensities below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 o2 supplied by microalgae was lower than the o2 requirement for nitrification fig 6 i this means that additional mechanical aeration is needed to achieve effective nh4 oxidation in those light conditions in the range of 27 35 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the o2 supply exceeded the o2 requirement for nitrification via no2 but fell to a level too low for nitrification via no3 fig 6ii this result indicates that combination of microalgal growth with partial nitrification is an efficient strategy for reducing illumination costs compared to that with conventional nitrification via no3 o2 production exceeded the o2 requirement for both nitrification via no2 and via no3 at above 35 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 6iii under the 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 condition of our study an adequate o2 was initially added before illumination which resulted in excess o2 supply for partial nitrification however our estimation shows that applied light intensity can be reduced close to 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 which corresponds to a savings of 70 of light energy without any external aeration within the range of used empirical data for developing empirical equations table 2 stable complete nitrification can be achieved up to 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 6iii above this range an excess o2 supply over o2 requirement for nitrification may occur due to excessive daily average light intensity which results in microalgae inhibition by oversaturated do unless degassing takes place efficiently fig 6iv for instance in the study of yang et al 2018 focusing on a solely microalgal chlorella sp system excess light illumination caused a harmful do value of 18 mg l 1 on the 2nd day of the batch experiment in addition with an increase in photosynthtic activity an increase in fa concentration may also occur especially when treating high nh4 containing wastewater such as anaerobic digester effluents unless ph control is employed uggetti et al 2014 evaluated the effect of varying fa on initial growth of mixed microalgal cultures dominated by scenedesmus sp with diluted anaerobic digestate that had initial nh4 concentrations ranging from 50 to 260 mg n l 1 which resulted in fa concentrations ranging from 2 to 34 mg l 1 in their no ph controlled continuously illuminated experiments the increase in fa concentration from 9 to 34 mg l 1 caused approximately 80 reduction of the growth rate furthermore high light intensity may induce light inhibition of microalgae as indicated by the results of the 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 tests of our study we developed an empirical model that estimates process performance of consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria based on the value of daily average light intensity as follows i process failure occurs due to the absence of oxygen below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ii simultaneous photosynthesis and nitrification via no2 proceeds effectively within a range of 27 35 μmol photons m 2 s 1 iii nitrification via no3 occurs within a range of 35 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 iv process failure occurs due to oversaturated do excess fa and or light inhibitions above around 200 300 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to gain further understanding of the process stability of consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria studies on the effect of low and high water temperature ranges 20 c and 30 c as well as acidic and alkaline ph range would be helpful it is well known that organic matter enhances heterotrophic bacterial growth which competes with autotrophic nitrifying bacteria for oxygen and nutrients sharma and ahlert 1977 there are pros and cons to this growth of heterotrophic bacteria it can mitigate an excess increase in do and ph due to o2 consumption and co2 production but it can also cause a decrease in nitrification activity thus the effect of organic matter concentration should be evaluated in addition in the case of an open system surface gas liquid interface oxygen transfer cannot be ignored especially under low do concentrations this effect will be also incorporated into further research in the future scale up experiments under outdoor conditions should be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the process prior to planning field scale application 4 conclusions the effect of a wide range of light intensities on nh4 removal in a consortium of chlorella sorokiniana and partial nitrifying granules was examined in batch reactors similar nh4 removal efficiencies were observed at 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 66 and 62 but the efficiency decreased drastically to 5 and 10 ammonification at 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively indicating the inhibition on the both nitrification and microalgal growth by comparing results from this study and previous literature it was found that daily average light intensity was a strong control on the nh4 removal pathway linear regression analysis r 0 957 p 0 01 an empirical model was developed which assumes that mechanical aeration is not used and demonstrated that daily average light intensity below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 leads to process failure due to absence of oxygen 27 35 is effective for simultaneous photosynthesis and partial nitrification to no2 35 180 is appropriate for complete nitrification

18238,ammonium removal by a coupling process of microalgae chlorella sorokiniana with partial nitrifying granules was evaluated in batch reactors illuminated in a wide range of light intensities 0 100 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ammonium oxidation performance for different light exposure time showed that the granules had a light stress tolerance at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for up to 12 h but continuous illumination induced severe inhibition on nitrifying bacteria thereafter ammonium removal efficiencies at the end of tests were 66 62 5 and 10 due to ammonification for 0 100 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively the nitrogen mass balance shows co occurrence of microalgal growth taking up 24 of fed ammonium and nitrifying bacteria oxidizing 38 of fed ammonium at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 while both nitrification and microalgal growth are inhibited at light intensity above 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in comparing results from this study with previous results it was found that the ammonium removal pathway i e nitrification or microalgal uptake is regulated more strongly by daily average light intensity than by instantaneous light intensity empirical model equations to estimate the oxygen balance in consortium reactors categorized the effect of daily average light intensities on process performance as follows i below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 insufficient oxygen for nitrification ii 27 to 35 sufficient oxygen for nitrification via nitrite iii 35 to 180 sufficient oxygen for nitrification via nitrate iv above approximately 200 300 oversaturated dissolved oxygen excess free ammonia and or intensive light inhibitions graphical abstract image 1 keywords energy saving process photo oxygenation short cut nitrogen removal ammonium removal pathway empirical model 1 introduction modern development has been associated with intensive urbanization and industrialization which have accelerated serious environmental pollution ammonium nh4 is contained in municipal wastewater and various industrial wastewaters from coking petroleum refining tanneries textile manufacturing pharmaceutical production catalyst factories sludge digester liquor and landfill leachate atkins jr and scherger 1997 lai et al 2013 nosratinia et al 2014 peng et al 2004 zhang et al 1998 direct discharge of these wastewaters into lakes and rivers can cause eutrophication the most commonly used nh4 removal process in wastewater is sequential nitrification denitrification nh4 is oxidized to nitrate no3 in aerobic nitrification while no3 is converted into nitrogen gas n2 in anoxic denitrification process in those processes mechanical aeration must be conducted for nitrification and addition of chemical reagents such as methanol must be added for denitrification leading to high investment and operating costs which goes against the current trend of sustainable development therefore it is desirable to develop a more cost and energy effective approach in the past decade using a consortium of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae for nh4 containing wastewater treatment has gained attention because it offers the following advantages i minimises costly mechanical aeration via photo oxygenation by the microalgae karya et al 2013 ii it reduces inorganic nitrogen compounds due to nutrient assimilation by the microalgae iii it mitigates problems with free ammonia fa nh3 stress during algal treatment of high nh4 strength wastewaters through nitrification de godos et al 2009 iv it increases the phosphorus to nitrogen p n ratio which makes the medium suitable for microalgae cultivation praveen et al 2018 and v it produces commercial co products such as biofuels bioplastics biofertilizers and animal aquatic feed from harvested microalgae gouveia et al 2016 rizwan et al 2018 nitrogen removal through nitrite no2 rather than through no3 is an environmentally friendly process because it requires less aeration and low external carbon demand due to the oxidation of nh4 to no2 and its direct denitrification this short cut process can theoretically reduce 25 of oxygen o2 requirements in the nitrification and 40 of the organic carbon demand for denitrification in comparison with conventional nitrogen removal via no3 chung et al 2007 coupling microalgae photosynthesis with short cut nitrogen removal via no2 can be a most effective method for treating nh4 containing wastewaters several studies have shown the applicability of consortia of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae for nh4 removal via no3 from wastewaters akizuki et al 2019 de godos et al 2009 jia and yuan 2018 karya et al 2013 vargas et al 2016 although there are fewer studies on nh4 removal via no2 than there are on nh4 removal via no3 the effectiveness of the method has been confirmed wang et al 2015 most previous studies on consortia of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae have used mild light intensities below approximately 200 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to conduct their experiments de godos et al 2009 karya et al 2013 vargas et al 2016 wang et al 2015 however there is limited information regarding the effect of strong light intensities for the wastewater treatment system to be economically feasible sunlight often exceeding 1000 2000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 bohutskyi et al 2016 morita et al 2000 is preferable to artificial light as the source of illumination thus the study on the effect of wide range of light intensities on the consortia is required in consortia reactors nh4 removal occurs via two different pathways oxidation by nitrification and microalgal uptake knowing the nh4 removal pathway is important for maintaining process stability for instance if nitrification is a dominant pathway o2 supply by microalgae photosynthesis will be limited which may result in process failure conversely if microalgal uptake is the dominant pathway and nitrification is limited the advantages of harvesting a co culture of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria i e adjusting the medium by increase of p n ratio and or mitigating fa inhibition will be nullified light intensity seems to be a one of main regulating factors for determining the nh4 removal pathway because nitrifying bacteria are inhibited by light illumination merbt et al 2012 while microalgae need light for their photosynthetic growth as energy source however previous studies have shown the differences in the amount of nh4 via each pathway even under similar light conditions for instance karya et al 2013 operated an open photo bioreactor with a light intensity of 63 μmol photons m 2 s 1 at 30 c they reported that more than 80 of nh4 removal was performed by nitrification and the remaining 20 by microalgal uptake in a study of vargas et al 2016 who used a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr illuminated at light intensity of 67 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 at 27 2 c contribution of nitrification to nh4 removal was approximately 60 which is lower than the result of karya et al 2013 it is necessary to understand the factors regulating the nh4 removal pathway in consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different light intensities on the nh4 removal ability of consortium of microalgae and partial nitrifying bacteria microbial aggregates granules have an excellent settling ability which helps to separate suspended microalgae and bacterial granules easily simplifying microalgae harvest procedure even so combination of suspended microalgae and granulated bacteria have been rarely studied because previous studies have commonly focused on the use of microalgae bacteria aggregates arcila and buitrón 2016 zou et al 2018 in addition our previous work indicates that granulated nitrifying bacteria have stronger light stress tolerance than dispersed nitrifying bacteria akizuki et al submitted therefore the nitrifying granules were used as inoculum in this study furthermore regulating factors for determining the relative contribution of nitrification and microalgal uptake to nh4 removal were revealed by summarizing the results of this study and previous studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculums and synthetic wastewater the seed sludge was obtained from an aerobic tank in a full scale anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o treatment system at the hokubu sludge treatment centre yokohama japan the collected

reaction time 23 5 h settling and decanting time 20 min during the operation the settling time gradually decreased and induced shortening of sludge retention time to inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the system ge et al 2015 the average granule diameter was approximately 0 3 mm and the granules showed efficient no2 accumulation almost 100 of added nh4 microalgae strain chlorella sorokiniana was

indicating that partial nitrification occurred without no2 oxidation to no3 during the first 12 h of the experiment nh4 concentration decreased and no2 concentration increased for all batch conditions representing the progress of partial nitrification after that the tendency differed depending on light intensities at the lower light intensities of 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 partial nitrification continued until the end of the experiment with no2 concentrations reaching 27 9 and 16 5 mg n l 1 respectively meanwhile at light intensity of 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nitrification stopped completely after 24 h of the experiment and nh4 concentration stayed at the same level at the highest light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nitrification stopped after 12 h and the nh4 concentration actually increased thereafter ward 2011 reported that photoinhibition of nitrifying bacteria may occur because cytochromes involved in the energy transduction pathways of nitrification are damaged by strong light in addition to its inhibitory effects on ammonia oxidization vanzella et al 1989 the photochemical generation of carbon monoxide from dissolved organic matter sipma et al 2006 makes the mechanism of nitrification photoinhibition more complex vanzella et al 1990 our results for higher light intensities show that nitrifying bacteria was inhibited under light intensities of 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 or higher this observation is consistent with previous literature merbt et al 2012 vergara et al 2016 it is known that some portion of bacterial cells is slowly biodegradable chen et al 2008 and the cell contents can be released from the decayed bacteria zekker et al 2012 it is thought that at light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nitrifying bacteria were inhibited and may even have decayed due to strong light exposure possibly causing an increase in nh4 concentration our previous work showed that nitrifying granules tolerate strong light exposure up to 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this is better tolerance than dispersed and flocculated nitrifying bacteria akizuki et al submitted however notable decrease in no2 production was observed at above 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in this study this difference could be explained by the difference the granules light exposure time fig 2 shows the normalized partial nitrification efficiencies i e no2 production at each light intensity divided by no2 production at dark condition at different light exposure time at 12 h normalized efficiency decreased slightly with increasing light intensity but remained at approximately 70 level even at a strongest light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result is consistent with the result of our prior work where we conducted a 12 h batch assay akizuki et al submitted this phenomenon is probably due to light attenuation inside the granules for example kühl et al 1996 reported that incident light at the bottom of the biofilm was strongly attenuated to 5 10 of incident surface irradiance wang et al 2005 analysed transmittance of the light blue filter kb 4 olympus from the surface to the centre of an aerobic granule they reported that transmission of incident light clearly decreased with increasing thickness of the layer so that around 50 of incident light was obscured at 250 μm from surface as the average radius in the partial nitrifying granules used in this study was around 150 μm probably the incident light was probably partially attenuated inside the granules leading to a light stress tolerance at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for up to 12 h however at longer experimental times 24 48 and 72 h the normalized nitrification efficiency at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 drastically decreased to 32 8 17 2 and 9 4 respectively this implies that longer exposure time to light increased light stress in nitrifying bacteria this argument is supported by several previous studies merbt et al 2012 examined the effect of light intensity on different nitrifying bacteria nitrosopumilus maritinmus nitrosotalea devanaterra nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosopira multiformis under continuous illumination and light dark cycles 8 h light 16 h dark they showed that a light dark cycle was associated with lower light inhibition than continuous illumination wan et al 2018 reported that the activity of nitrifying bacteria was reduced by light exposure but not completely inhibited within a diel cycle in this study although partial nitrifying granules had a certain light stress tolerance at strong light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 until 12 h continuous illumination induced severe inhibition on nitrifying bacteria with experimental time thus a diel light cycle may be a practical approach to allow nitrifying bacteria to recover from light stress if this hypothesis gains support from further research the partial nitrifying granules may be applied to the natural light condition table 1 shows specific nh4 removal and no2 production rates similar nh4 removal rates of 18 8 and 17 1 mg n g ss 1 d 1 were observed at 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the linear regression of the nh4 removal rate was not statistically significant because nh4 stopped decreasing after 24 h of the experiment at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 a slight release of nh4 with a value of 0 119 mg n g ss 1 d 1 was observed the specific no2 production rates decreased with increasing light intensity 16 8 10 3 and 3 0 mg n g ss 1 d 1 at 0 100 and 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the linear regression of the no2 production rate was not statistically significant because no2 production almost stopped after 12 h of the experiment although the no2 production rate at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was lower than that at 0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the similar nh4 removal rates were observed this indicates that nh4 uptake by microalgae in addition to nh4 oxidation occurred at the 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the do values at the end of the experiment were 6 10 0 27 7 19 0 34 6 87 0 16 and 7 75 0 29 mg l 1 respectively for the 0 100 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 cases fig 3 this result indicates that an adequate do concentration for complete nitrification reaction approximately 2 0 2 5 mg l 1 ruiz et al 2003 jianlong and ning 2004 was maintained and there was no lack of oxygen during the experimental period the do value at 0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was significantly p 0 05 dunnett s test lower than the do value at other light intensities the highest do value was observed at the highest light intensity of 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 probably because there was no o2 consumption by nitrifying bacteria due to light inhibition although active nh4 oxidation by partial nitrification occurred at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the do value observed at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 was higher than that observed at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result implies that photosynthesis by microalgae occurred effectively at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 while that at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ceased may be due to photoinhibition this inhibition could also be attributed to ph variations however despite ph not being measured during the experiment both nitrification and microalgae activities were scarcely detected at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 therefore the ph of the culture was likely stable enough as to not induce marked inhibition 3 2 nitrogen mass balance nh4 removal efficiency and the nitrogen mass balance at the end of the experiment are shown in fig 4 relatively higher nh4 removal efficiencies of 66 4 and 61 6 were achieved at 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively the efficiency decreased drastically to 5 2 at 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and even to 10 due to release of nh4 at 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the nitrogen mass balance shows considerable microalgal uptake of nh4 10 mg n l 1 corresponding to 22 3 of added nh4 at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 but not at 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 this result indicates that strong light intensity inhibited not only nitrifying bacteria but also microalgae chlorella sorokiniana growth this result indicates that strong light intensity inhibited microalgae chlorella sorokiniana growth it was previously reported that the primary mechanism of photoinhibition comes into play when antenna complexes enter triplet states during light absorption and create reactive oxygen species ros that damage the photosynthetic machinery erickson et al 2015 in consortia reactors of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria weak light intensity can induce low nutrient uptake as well as insufficient o2 supplied by microalgae even so extreme light exposure can result in the failure of the process due to the sensitiveness of both the nitrifying bacteria and microalgae it has been confirmed that appropriate light intensity for photosynthesis can vary over a wide range for different aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms bohutskyi et al 2016 philips and mitsui 1982 reported that saturated light intensity tolerance for the identified 24 microalgae species primarily dinoflagellates and diatoms ranged from 30 to 280 μmol photons m 2 s 1 another study reported that scenedesmus spp showed high biomass yield at 250 and 400 μmol photons m 2 s 1 than at 50 μmol photons m 2 s 1 liu et al 2012 several studies reported that chlorella sp prefer lower light intensity than other species for instance cheirsilp and torpee 2012 showed that marine chlorella sp grew better at a light intensity below 5000 lux approximately 90 μmol photons m 2 s 1 nurminen and horppila 2006 than did nannochloropsis sp meanwhile nannochloropsis sp continued to grow even at light intensities above 6000 lux approximately 108 μmol photons m 2 s 1 other studies have shown that saturated light intensity tolerance was 62 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for chlorella vulgaris and 250 μmol photons m 2 s 1 for chlorella kesskeri kim et al 2002 as microalgae have a unique requirement for light intensity and chlorella sp have a lower tolerance to light exposure the growth of chlorella sorokiniana in this study was possibly inhibited at light intensities greater than 450 μmol photons m 2 s 1 leading to lower nh4 removal efficiencies since outdoor light intensity on sunny day often exceed to 1000 2000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 several strategies such as using shading nets pizzera et al 2019 or photo acclimatization to extreme illumination levels dubinsky and stambler 2009 need to be examined to mitigate light inhibition prior to scaling up a process 3 3 factors regulating the nh4 removal pathway to evaluate the effect of operating parameters on the nh4 removal pathway i e oxidation by nitrification or microalgal uptake different studies on consortia of microalgal and nitrifying bacteria including this study were summarized table 2 the relative contribution of nitrification microalgal uptake to nh4 removal varied widely from 0 to 99 5 100 0 5 depending on the study in the studies of karya et al 2013 van der steen et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and the 0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 experiment of our work nitrification was the main pathway relative contribution 82 5 99 5 vargas et al 2016 found both the nitrification and microalgal uptake were main pathways 60 and 40 respectively meanwhile de godos et al 2009 showed that nh4 removal was mainly performed by microalgal uptake 77 100 the relationship between the relative contribution of nitrification to nh4 removal and possible factors controlling nh4 removal pathway is shown in fig 5 this figure includes the results of this study and previous studies except for the results at 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 of our work because those high light intensities induced severe inhibition on nh4 removal performance fig 4 and table 2 based on the slope of the linear regressions shown in fig 4 daily average light intensity exerted the highest influence on the relative contribution of nitrification y 0 473x 100 r 0 957 p 0 01 fig 5b followed by instantaneous light intensity y 0 414x 100 r 0 865 p 0 01 fig 5a although it has been widely accepted that light intensity affects the cultivation of microalgae feng et al 2011 cheirsilp and torpee 2012 the daily average light intensity regulates the nh4 pathway more strongly compared to instantaneous light intensity some previous studies reported that in addition to the light intensity the illumination period also affects microalgal growth for instance dumrattana and tansakul 2006 showed that better growth of botryococcus braunii is achieved under continuous illumination with a light intensity of 120 μmol photons m 2 s 1 compared to diurnal illumination cycles under 12 12 h and 16 8 h light dark khoeyi et al 2012 demonstrated that even at the same light intensity of 62 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 maximum biomass production of chlorella vulgaris was observed under a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod higher than under 8 16 and 12 12 h cycles as a consequence it is worth noting that daily average light intensity can accurately characterize the relative contribution of nh4 removal in consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria within the range of observation i e 0 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 even with different conditions including reactor type continuous sequential batch and batch substrate type synthetic and real wastewaters microalgae species bacterial source form dispersed and granulated light intensity 0 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 water temperature 21 30 c ph 7 5 8 1 and initial nh4 concentration 26 6 1500 mg n l 1 even so it should be mentioned that this relationship can be changed under large scale outdoor conditions the corresponding slope value showed that ph values also have a significant relationship with the nh4 removal pathway y 138x 1121 r 0 887 p 0 01 fig 5c this result may be due to the difference in favourable ph range for microalgae and nitrifying bacteria however contrary to expectation previous research has not shown a large difference in appropriate ph ranges among nitrifying bacteria 7 8 8 9 wild et al 1971 7 5 8 0 painter and loveless 1983 7 5 8 6 metcalf and eddy 1991 and microalgae species used in consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria 7 5 8 0 chlorella vulgaris sakarika and kornaros 2019 7 7 8 0 pleurochrysis carterae moheimani 2005 7 8 nannochloris sp kim and lee 2016 we also found a positive correlation between ph and light intensity and daily average light intensity r 0 859 p 0 01 thus the positive correlation observed between ph and the relative contribution of nitrification to nh4 removal may be an indirect consequence of the ph increase derived from active photosynthesis there is a possibility that the ph values directly affect the nh4 removal pathway when dominant microalgae are acidophilic or alkaliphilic species such as chlamydomonas eustigma hirooka et al 2017 or arthrospira platensis benelhadj et al 2016 because these species show a large difference in optimal ph with nitrifying bacteria 3 4 optimization of daily average light intensity comparison of nitrification via no2 vs no3 in a microalgal nitrifying bacterial reactor without mechanical aeration the presence of o2 in the reactor will fluctuate based on the balance between o2 supply by microalgae and o2 consumption by nitrifying bacteria if photosynthesis is limited and o2 supply is insufficient for the progress of nitrification nh4 removal efficiency will decrease meanwhile if there is too much o2 supply then the system is consuming more energy than it needs to to produce light unless sunlight is used in addition a drastic increase in photosynthesis activity may cause i oversaturated do which inhibits microalgal growth kumar et al 2010 and ii fa inhibition of nitrifying bacteria and also of the microalgae themselves azov and goldman 1982 due to fa s uncoupling effect on photosynthetic processes in isolated chloroplasts crofts 1966 therefore the o2 balance has to be carefully considered to avoid process failure at daily average light intensities below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 o2 supplied by microalgae was lower than the o2 requirement for nitrification fig 6 i this means that additional mechanical aeration is needed to achieve effective nh4 oxidation in those light conditions in the range of 27 35 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the o2 supply exceeded the o2 requirement for nitrification via no2 but fell to a level too low for nitrification via no3 fig 6ii this result indicates that combination of microalgal growth with partial nitrification is an efficient strategy for reducing illumination costs compared to that with conventional nitrification via no3 o2 production exceeded the o2 requirement for both nitrification via no2 and via no3 at above 35 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 6iii under the 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 condition of our study an adequate o2 was initially added before illumination which resulted in excess o2 supply for partial nitrification however our estimation shows that applied light intensity can be reduced close to 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 which corresponds to a savings of 70 of light energy without any external aeration within the range of used empirical data for developing empirical equations table 2 stable complete nitrification can be achieved up to 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 fig 6iii above this range an excess o2 supply over o2 requirement for nitrification may occur due to excessive daily average light intensity which results in microalgae inhibition by oversaturated do unless degassing takes place efficiently fig 6iv for instance in the study of yang et al 2018 focusing on a solely microalgal chlorella sp system excess light illumination caused a harmful do value of 18 mg l 1 on the 2nd day of the batch experiment in addition with an increase in photosynthtic activity an increase in fa concentration may also occur especially when treating high nh4 containing wastewater such as anaerobic digester effluents unless ph control is employed uggetti et al 2014 evaluated the effect of varying fa on initial growth of mixed microalgal cultures dominated by scenedesmus sp with diluted anaerobic digestate that had initial nh4 concentrations ranging from 50 to 260 mg n l 1 which resulted in fa concentrations ranging from 2 to 34 mg l 1 in their no ph controlled continuously illuminated experiments the increase in fa concentration from 9 to 34 mg l 1 caused approximately 80 reduction of the growth rate furthermore high light intensity may induce light inhibition of microalgae as indicated by the results of the 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 tests of our study we developed an empirical model that estimates process performance of consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria based on the value of daily average light intensity as follows i process failure occurs due to the absence of oxygen below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 ii simultaneous photosynthesis and nitrification via no2 proceeds effectively within a range of 27 35 μmol photons m 2 s 1 iii nitrification via no3 occurs within a range of 35 180 μmol photons m 2 s 1 iv process failure occurs due to oversaturated do excess fa and or light inhibitions above around 200 300 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to gain further understanding of the process stability of consortia of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria studies on the effect of low and high water temperature ranges 20 c and 30 c as well as acidic and alkaline ph range would be helpful it is well known that organic matter enhances heterotrophic bacterial growth which competes with autotrophic nitrifying bacteria for oxygen and nutrients sharma and ahlert 1977 there are pros and cons to this growth of heterotrophic bacteria it can mitigate an excess increase in do and ph due to o2 consumption and co2 production but it can also cause a decrease in nitrification activity thus the effect of organic matter concentration should be evaluated in addition in the case of an open system surface gas liquid interface oxygen transfer cannot be ignored especially under low do concentrations this effect will be also incorporated into further research in the future scale up experiments under outdoor conditions should be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the process prior to planning field scale application 4 conclusions the effect of a wide range of light intensities on nh4 removal in a consortium of chlorella sorokiniana and partial nitrifying granules was examined in batch reactors similar nh4 removal efficiencies were observed at 0 and 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 66 and 62 but the efficiency decreased drastically to 5 and 10 ammonification at 450 and 1600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively indicating the inhibition on the both nitrification and microalgal growth by comparing results from this study and previous literature it was found that daily average light intensity was a strong control on the nh4 removal pathway linear regression analysis r 0 957 p 0 01 an empirical model was developed which assumes that mechanical aeration is not used and demonstrated that daily average light intensity below 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 leads to process failure due to absence of oxygen 27 35 is effective for simultaneous photosynthesis and partial nitrification to no2 35 180 is appropriate for complete nitrification to no3 and above around 200 300 leads to process failure due to oversaturated dissolved oxygen excess fa and or in intensive light inhibitions to microalgae and nitrifying bacteria declaration of

18239,after the federal emergency in flint mi was declared in early 2016 in response to elevated lead in water and incidence of legionnaires disease concerns arose that contaminants in residential water heaters could continue to contribute to poor quality tap water here a comprehensive field survey of residential water heaters n 30 and associated water quality was conducted and the subsequent effects of an aggressive manual water heater clean out was determined including draining the tank and removing sediments via brushing and flushing before cleaning inorganics accumulated in the tank sediments did not serve as a source of metals measured at hot water outlets after cleaning hardness calcium magnesium silica and corrosion associated inorganics lead iron copper aluminum zinc decreased by 64 in samples from sediment cleanout drain valves culturable l pneumophila was only detected in 1 home 3 3 prior to cleaning and 2 homes 6 7 after cleaning thus quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify potential effects on unculturable strains despite the limitation of differentiating live and dead cells after the cleaning protocol legionella spp and l pneumophila gene numbers decreased or remained non detectable in 83 and 98 of samples respectively homes with less than 0 4 mg l influent free chlorine tended to have quantifiable legionella spp gene numbers in water entering the home and had elevated l pneumophila and legionella spp gene numbers throughout the home plumbing also legionella spp and l pneumophila gene numbers were highest for water heaters set at or below 42 c and significantly decreased 51 c consistent with legionella s preferred temperature range examination of the only home that had culturable l pneumophila both before and after the cleaning protocol revealed that the organism was culturable from several sample locations throughout the home including in water representative of the water main notably the home was located in close proximity to mclaren hospital where an outbreak of legionnaires disease was reported and the water heater had a setpoint within the legionella growth range of 44 2 c considering that other factors were more strongly associated with legionella occurrence and water heater sediment was not detectably mobilizing to tap water it was concluded that water heater cleaning had some benefits but was not an overarching factor contributing to possible human health risks graphical abstract image 1 keywords flint mi legionella water heater sediment flushing risk factors 1 introduction after switching from lake huron to the flint river as the drinking water source in april 2014 widespread distribution system water quality problems occurred in flint mi ultimately leading to a federal emergency declaration edwards et al 2015 rose 2015 masten et al 2016 fema 2016 citywide lead in water contamination and elevated lead in children s blood pieper et al 2017 2018 hanna attisha et al 2016 prompted a switch back to lake huron source water purchased from detroit in october 2015 in january 2016 authorities announced that outbreaks of legionnaires disease had occurred in summers of 2014 and 2015 although the switch back to the lake huron water source in october 2015 reinstated corrosion control and improved disinfectant residuals there was lingering concern about persistent public health threats all available data collected in early 2016 demonstrated relatively low levels of l pneumophila in small single story buildings schwake et al 2016a b rhoads et al 2017 fachep 2016 suggesting that l pneumophila occurrence and legionnaires disease incidence were primarily associated with large buildings however the state of michigan and the federal emergency management agency were concerned about possible high levels of legionella bacteria in home water systems especially due to the high rates of water main breaks and red water from 2014 to 2016 nationally it is believed that 96 of reported legionnaires disease is not associated with outbreaks with the origin of 64 of reported cases never reliably being identified hicks et al 2011 shah et al 2018 residential plumbing systems are a potential source of unidentified legionnaires disease stout et al 1987 1992 pedro botet et al 2002 straus et al 1996 byrne et al 2018 detected l pneumophila serogroup 6 strains in 12 of flint homes n 130 in late 2016 which differed from serogroup 1 clinical strains detected by the urine antigen test all available clinical isolates were also found to belong to serogroup 1 while isolates recovered from tap water in early 2016 were found to belong to serogroup 1 or serogroup 6 garner et al 2019 but of a different sequence type of serogroup 6 than that reported by byrne et al 2018 following the federal emergency declaration in flint there was concern that legionella could have colonized water heater sediments during the water crisis creating a long term reservoir for legionella sediments are known to react with disinfectants and reduce their efficacy while also providing nutrients shelter and surface area for attached microbial growth including for legionella lu et al 2015 qin et al 2017 sediments also decrease heat transfer and energy efficiency weingarten 1992 after the flint water crisis there were also general concerns that accumulation of iron and lead from water main breaks and corrosion might increase disinfectant loss microbial growth and lead exposure although hot water is not considered by epa to be potable water used for consumption drinking or cooking current recommendations for water heater cleanout including flushing vacuuming and or dissolving sediments are designed to remove hardness scale weingarten 1992 widder and baechler 2013 water heater flushing protocols were developed following the elk river 4 methylcyclohexanemethanol mchm spill however the protocols were not rigorously designed validated or verified in the field and there are concerns that flushing might have even increased consumer exposure to mchm omur ozbek et al 2016 eventually science based recommendations were developed casteloes et al 2015 hawes et al 2017 ragain et al 2019 for the water soluble chemicals of concern but they were not designed for removal of contaminants that settled or deposited in plumbing in surveying the occurrence of legionella it is also important to evaluate all relevant factors that could contribute to its proliferation in particular water heater set point has been identified as a critical parameter for legionella colonization of residential plumbing systems with settings less than 49 c 120 f facilitating legionella growth in the storage tanks lee et al 1988 while michigan code allows residential water heater temperature settings up to 60 c 140 f default or resident preferred temperatures are typically lower due to a desire to decrease energy demand reduce scaling and prevent scalding gas heaters tend to have lower prevalence of legionella than electric heaters likely due to heating from the tank bottom as opposed to side mounted electrical elements resistors that create stratification alary and joly 1991 dufresne et al 2011 brazeau and edwards 2013 in addition while free chlorine levels in the distribution system had improved markedly by summer 2016 relative to during the period the city was using the flint river water rhoads et al 2017 zahran et al 2018 residents were using little water due to high water bills readily available bottled water and concerns about the safety of bath water roy and edwards 2019 there was also concern that the improved disinfectant residuals were not being consistently delivered to the residential plumbing due to low water use here we evaluated the hypothesis that a thorough water heater sediment cleaning event would improve water quality at hot water outlets by reducing inorganic contamination disinfectant demand and legionella proliferation and release we conducted a comprehensive field sampling campaign during the flint mi federal emergency response deploying a rigorous water heater sediment cleaning protocol at 30 single family flint residences located near the epicenter of the reported legionnaires disease outbreaks at mclaren hospital mdhhs 2018 the goal was to provide insight into the potential for water heater flushing to reduce risk of exposure to legionella and other water contaminants following major corrosion or other massive contamination events 2 methods 2 1 sample collection two sampling campaigns were conducted in july 2016 including 30 homes near the two hospitals in flint mi where the majority of the legionnaires disease cases and highest water ages were reported six samples were collected from each home before and 5 6 days after performing the water heater cleaning protocol three of the samples were stagnant first draws from the 1 cold kitchen outlet 2 hot kitchen outlet and 3 shower head or bathtub spout sample of mixed hot and cold water further samples were collected from the 4 kitchen outlet flushed hot water after a stable hot water temperature was reached 5 water heater drain valve and 6 an outside hose bib or outlet nearest to the point of entry to the home after 5 min of maximum flow rate flushing the last sample was intended to be representative of influent water to the house from the main distribution system the stagnant samples were collected in two sequential 1 l bottles for biological and inorganic chemical analysis respectively the first 1 l sterile polypropylene sample bottle was pre dosed with 24 mg of sodium thiosulfate to remove disinfectant residual and after mixing 250 ml was aliquoted for culture into a sterile polypropylene bottle while the remainder was used for dna extraction appendix a the second 1 l sample from the outlet was collected in an acid washed high density polyethylene bottle and temperature free chlorine total chlorine and ph were measured in the field a portion of the sample was filtered in the field with a 0 45 μm pore size syringe filter whatman where inorganics in the filtrate were operationally defined as soluble the remainder of the sample was acid digested to determine total inorganic content for the hot flushed samples two consecutive 1 l samples were collected and processed for biological and chemical analysis as described above except that an additional 250 ml sample was also collected directly from the outlet into a polypropylene bottle dosed with 6 mg sodium thiosulfate for culture the sampling procedure for cold flushed water was identical to that of the hot flushed samples except 2 l bottles dosed with 48 mg sodium thiosulfate were collected for molecular analysis to increase the mass of dna in filter concentrated extracts from cold water mains which tend to have less biomass samples for culture were shipped overnight at ambient temperature while molecular samples were shipped overnight on ice all culture and molecular samples were processed within 30 h of collection 2 2 water heater flushing protocol the water heater cleaning procedure had three progressive levels of flushing first water was repeatedly flushed from the bottom drain valve of the tank until it consistently ran clear second the water heater was drained and sediments were repeatedly scoured using gravity and pressurized flow sprayed into the drained heater via the cold water influent dip tube third the drain valves were completely removed and the interior of the tank was scrubbed with a coarse brush to loosen sediments followed by more pressurized scouring with cold water until water from the tank ran clear the heaters were then re filled with water and outlets flushed to re pressurize the system meta data about the system and the home size age primary plumbing material were collected onsite 2 3 sample analysis temperature and ph were measured using an orion 100 series ph meter calibrated with a three point calibration curve with automatic temperature correction free and total chlorine were quantified using a hand held hach loveland co pocket colorimeter using standard method 4500 cl the remaining sample was transported to virginia tech and acidified with 2 nitric acid or hydroxylamine for samples with a large amount of visible iron sediment for quantification of inorganics by inductively coupled plasma

fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals legionella spp 23s rrna and l pneumophila mip were enumerated by quantitative pcr qpcr using previously published methods nazarian et al 2008 wang et al 2012 though qpcr detects and quantifies both live and dead cells causing potential false positive results relative comparisons between levels occurring at the point of entry to a home and at individual outlets can be used as an indicator for potential regrowth e g rhoads et al 2016 thus qpcr was applied to make relative rather than absolute comparisons briefly a dilution curve performed on a subset of sample types revealed that a 1 10 dilution was adequate to minimize qpcr reaction inhibition for each qpcr run serially diluted standards prepared from m13 pcr primer extracted clone plasmids a non template control and a spike and recovery on environmental samples to confirm absence of inhibition on a subset of samples were run in triplicate wells the quantification limit was set at 50 100 gene copies reaction based on the lowest standard dna template that consistently appeared with a standard curve efficiency of greater than 80 and r2 greater than 0 98 any sample that had two out of three wells appear above the quantification limit was scored as quantifiable while any sample that appeared to be inhibited was re analyzed otherwise results were scored as non detectable and entered as 0 gc ml or below the quantification limit bql and entered as half of the quantification limit 25 gc ml for statistical analyses as appropriate the log enumeration 1 is reported samples for 3 homes were inadvertently discarded before analysis and thus only samples from 27 homes were included in the dna analysis portion of this study 2 6 data analysis and statistics plots and statistical tests were constructed in rstudio r version 3 2 0 and detailed as appropriate in the text 3 results and discussion 3 1 qualitative notes on cleaning protocol for new heaters 1 year old or a few heaters that had been flushed regularly by the homeowner n 3 only 30 45 min was required to perform the entire cleaning protocol and achieve clear flushed water however in the typical case n 21 the procedure required between 90 and 120 min before the water from the tank ran clear of sediment for worst case heaters n 6 clear water was never achieved and flushing was discontinued at 2 h during the second week of sampling after the heaters had already been cleaned once we selected two heaters that required typical effort to clean during the first week of sampling one tank 6 and one 6 years old and two heaters that had been identified as worst case for further testing for these heaters we repeated a flushing protocol that included draining the tank and scouring the sediment with pressurized water twice the two heaters that had been relatively easy to clean remained clear during the follow up flushing fig 1 a and b however both heaters that had been difficult to clean still had noticeable particulates running from the tank fig 1c red iron corrosion byproduct fig 1d white particulates the sediment removed during the follow up flushing in fig 1c did not settle in a graduated cylinder over a 5 min period unlike the sediment collected from the initial procedure at this home fig 1e suggesting that sediments removed during the initial cleaning were larger particulates 3 2 water tank sediment quantity and composition the cleaning protocol decreased the amount of accumulated sediments released from the water heater drain valve the sum of all inorganic constituents measured by icp ms were used as a measure of total inorganic mass in samples cold distribution system water collected at the hose bib after 5 min of flushing is representative of soluble inorganics levels of 42 8 49 9 2 mg l both before and after the cleaning protocol was performed particulate inorganics coming from water heater drain valves were quantified by subtracting total concentrations of each inorganic measured in flushed cold water from the water heater drain valve samples at each home to account for inorganics in the cold influent water to each home before the first cleaning the water heater drain valve samples contributed 23 8 mg l excess inorganics on average 54 higher than the level dissolved in distribution system water with high standard deviation 79 0 mg l in the follow up sample after the water heater cleaning protocol the total excess mass released from the water heater tank sediment was 8 6 mg l on average 19 higher than distribution system water with standard deviation 32 9 mg l reflecting lowered concentrations of scoured particulates after cleaning table d1 fig 2 thus the total mass of particulate inorganics released decreased by 64 or an average of 15 2 mg l after the cleaning was performed paired wilcox test p value 0 00086 n 30 table d1 figure d1 the water heater sediment was found to consist of a combination of hardness associated components magnesium silica calcium and metal corrosion related solids magnesium aluminum phosphorus iron copper zinc lead fig 3 these constituents are associated with precipitates due to heating of the water calcium corrosion of water heater components sacrificial magnesium or aluminum anode rod and precipitated or mobilized corrosion scale from iron water mains service line or premise plumbing phosphorus iron lead before the cleaning calcium aluminum phosphorus and iron accounted for 70 0 of the particulate inorganics on average range 3 6 97 7 median 79 7 the mass of all particulates decreased significantly after the cleaning protocol paired wilcox test p value 1 32 10 5 0 049 n 30 there was no correlation between water heater age which ranged from 1 to 10 years old and any particulate inorganics released before or after the cleaning spearman rank correlation p value 0 066 0 18 n 30 with the exception of calcium rho 0 57 p value 0 0049 n 30 appendix e primary home plumbing material did not impact the total particulate inorganics iron or copper released from the drain valves before or after the cleaning kruskal wallis test p value 0 076 0 86 table f1 f3 however there was more zinc particulate released in homes with galvanized plumbing before the water heater cleaning was performed dunn test with bonferroni posthoc correction p value 0 020 but not after the cleaning protocol p value 0 94 total zinc and iron concentrations were significantly correlated in stagnant cold and all hot water samples spearman rank correlation p values 5 10 8 0 008 table g1 but not in flushed cold water representative of the distribution system this suggests that a significant source of the accumulated sediments in these homes was due to corrosion of the galvanized plumbing 3 3 impact of water tank sediment on inorganics at hot outlets the only constituents higher in hot stagnant or flushed water samples versus cold water samples before the cleaning were magnesium and aluminum mg kruskal wallis p values 0 0083 0 0133 al p value 0 0007 table g3 which is expected due to their presence in water heater anodes the absolute elevation in aluminum 52 increase or 56 ppb higher relative to 108 ppb in cold distributed water and magnesium 3 increase or 200 ppb higher relative 7890 ppb in cold distributed water on average in the hot water lines was relatively low only 4 of hot stagnant and 9 of hot flushed samples exceeded the 15 ppb action level for lead which is in the range of the 3 9 of cold water samples table g2 although 69 of drain valve samples exceeded 15 ppb this is not unexpected given that the action level does not apply to hot water especially drain valves because it is not meant for human consumption 3 4 water quality parameters temperature and chlorine from water main samples were not significantly different before and after the cleaning protocol median free chlorine residuals delivered to homes were consistent at 0 59 0 60 mg l during the study table 1 once in the home plumbing the chlorine residual decayed to varying degrees and levels were slightly higher 0 01 0 07 mg l comparing medians before after cleaning after the cleaning this was likely due to flushing increased water use and high velocity associated with the cleaning protocol and variable stagnation times which were not assessed in this study chlorine was routinely detected in cold stagnant samples median 0 41 and 0 50 mg l before and after the cleaning respectively but was lower in hot water samples as expected due to the water residence time in the water heater storage tank and faster chlorine decay at higher temperature median 0 01 0 20 mg l across all hot water samples water heater temperature set point quantified by the hot flushed water temperature ranged from 33 4 to 67 4 c 92 1 153 3 f median 53 3 c 127 9 f table 2 3 5 culturable legionella pneumophila culturable l pneumophila was detected in only two homes sampled in this study 6 6 before the cleaning protocol one home tested positive for culturable l pneumophila in the flushed hot water the water heater drain valve and even the cold flushed water sample thought to be representative of the distribution system after the cleaning this same home still yielded culturable l pneumophila in all the stagnant samples collected from distal locations cold and hot water at the kitchen outlet and at the showerhead another home was found to have culturable l pneumophila in the hot stagnant sample only interestingly this was after the cleaning all isolates identified in this study were mab2 positive serogroup 1 strains i e positive for lag 1 and wzm genes by pcr and classified as sequence type 192 via whole genome sequencing described elsewhere garner et al 2019 the home that was positive both before and after the cleaning was re sampled in august 2016 garner et al 2019 in this follow up sampling only the stagnant shower sample was positive and the isolate was again identified as a mab2 positive l pneumophila serogroup 1 strain by pcr but was classified as sequence type 1 instead of 192 garner et al 2019 there is precedence for multiple sequence types of l pneumophila being identified at the same location bédard et al 2019 notably the august 2016 sequence type 1 isolate is the same sequence type identified in 3 of 10 legionnaires disease clinical isolates collected from 2015 examined by garner et al 2019 and differed from one clinical isolate by only 38 snps via single nucleotide polymorphism analysis this was the highest similarity of any environmental isolate compared to clinical isolates examined by garner et al 2019 the one home with culturable l pneumophila both before and after the cleaning including in the sample representative of water entering the home was located in close geographical proximity to mclaren hospital 0 3 miles direct sight 1 6 1 9 miles by road which was associated with 51 of the 90 legionnaires disease cases that occurred during 2014 2015 mdhhs 2018 it also had several risk factors that deviated somewhat from other homes in this study the free chlorine levels entering the home 0 36 ppm as cl2 was on the lower end of that entering other homes median 0 59 0 60 mg l this home was also located towards the end of an hydraulically isolated neighborhood within a high water age region of the flint distribution system estimated to be 9 or more days arcadis 2018 which likely contributed to lower residuals and potentially the isolate detected in water entering the home the hot water set point 44 2 c was more than 9 c below the average water heater temperatures in this study and in the high risk range for legionella growth yee wadowsky 1982 several samples had elevated iron levels 250 μg l compared to other homes median 41 3 50 9 μg l before after cleaning in addition our team found that this water heater was one of the three that were very difficult to clean while all of these factors individually or in combination could increase the likelihood of legionella detection there were at least some other homes that had greater individual risk factors but which did not yield culturable legionella or elevated levels of legionella spp or l pneumophila gene numbers which are presented in section 3 6 the other home that had culturable legionella and only in the hot stagnant sample after cleaning had no significant risk factors given the high water temperature set point 52 c and influent free chlorine concentrations 0 6 0 71 ppm as cl2 before after cleaning this home also had relatively low iron levels only one sample sligly elevated at 88 μg l and spikes of iron did not occur as in the other home with culturable l pneumophila however the water heater was again one of three heaters judged very difficult to clean even after six attempts to clean the heater the water was still turbid in sum 2 of 6 of homes with difficult to clean heaters also happened to yield culturable l pneumophila the reported positivity rates for culturable l pneumophila serogroup 1 of 1 8 of samples n 7 of 372 and 6 7 of homes n 2 of 30 are comparable to some prior reports byrne et al 2018 detected l pneumophila serogroup 1 in only one of 130 homes 0 7 in flint from september october 2016 however byrne et al identified l pneumophila serogroup 6 in 12 of residences n 130 sampled in general l pneumophila serogroup 1 is thought to be the dominant agent of legionnaires disease in the us as observed in a survey of sputum cultures collected from 508 patients l pneumophila serogroup 1 was identified in 84 2 sputum cultures yu et al 2002 further mab2 is considered to be a strong indicator of virulence e g in on study it was detected in 75 of 100 clinical isolates and only 8 of 50 environmental isolates kozak et al 2009 still it must be acknowledged that clinical diagnostics of legionnaires disease is inherently biased towards serogroup 1 strains both because of the urine antigen test and non pneumophila species tend to be more difficult to isolate mercante and winchell 2015 lee et al 1993 lucas et al 2011 the fact that this study and byrne et al 2018 independently report very low rates of l pneumophila serogroup 1 in homes sampled in 2016 and a third study reported non detection in small building water samples in late 2015 rhoads et al 2017 is a mystery because the residential water systems in flint had multiple risk factors for colonization by legionella and there was a major disease outbreak in a hospital in 2014 and 2015 table 3 in particular 60 of homes in this study had water heater temperature settings lower than the recommended levels to inhibit legionella growth and one quarter of home water heater temperature settings were at very high risk temperatures of 33 4 46 3 c 92 115 f we speculate that one reason incidence of legionella was so low is because the majority of water heaters 86 sampled in this study were gas even though efforts were made to identify and sample higher risk electric water heaters alary and joly 1991 3 6 legionella gene copy numbers 3 6 1 impact of the cleaning protocol on legionella positivity the proportion of samples with detectable legionella gene copies i e positivity decreased after the water heater tank cleaning legionella spp positivity decreased from 73 before to 40 after and l pneumophila positivity decreased from 23 to 4 table 4 legionella spp positivity decreased across all sample types after the cleaning protocol except cold stagnant samples table 4 mcnemar test p value 0 0001 0 023 the change in l pneumophila positivity was less frequently significant among individual sample types likely due to the low number of positive samples both before and after the cleaning protocol samples that were negative before the cleaning tended to remain negative after the cleaning overall only 5 samples that were negative for legionella spp before the cleaning were positive after the cleaning and only 1 sample negative before cleaning was positive afterwards for l pneumophila table h1 3 6 2 trends in legionella gene copy numbers though there were low levels of legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copy numbers in samples overall table h2 h4 figure h1 and h2 influent conditions appeared to be an important factor for detecting sporadically high levels in individual homes for instance there were 20 homes nbefore 12 nafter 8 with quantifiable levels of legionella spp in the cold flushed water sample representative of water entering the home i e 5 min flushing at hose bib or nearest outlet to the point of entry these homes had significantly more legionella spp and l pneumophila dna within the home plumbing compared to homes without quantifiable legionella spp dna in water entering the home kruskal test p value 1 68 10 16 and 3 98 10 8 respectively fig 4 a b however legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copies did not increase within these homes relative to the cold water entering the home fig 4 a b in addition while there was no significant correlation between free chlorine and overall legionella spp or l pneumophila gene copy numbers spearman rank p value 0 65 0 76 figure h3 or even amongst the different types of samples p value 0 15 0 85 homes with influent free chlorine 0 4 mg l n 11 contained significantly higher legionella spp but not l pneumophila copy numbers than homes that had influent free chlorine 0 4 mg l kruskal test p value 1 21 10 6 and 0 68 respectively fig 4 c d of the eight homes with median legionella spp gene copy numbers from all samples above the quantification limit six of them had free chlorine levels less than 0 4 mg l the home with culturable l pneumophila both before and after the cleaning had low influent free chlorine 0 24 0 36 mg l this home also had the highest levels of legionella gene markers on average an order of magnitude more legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copies than the 90th percentile of all samples 104 1 vs 103 2 gc ml and 102 6 vs below the quantification limit of 101 4 gc ml respectively it is widely recognized that lower chlorine residuals at the point of entry to buildings can be a risk factor for legionella colonization e g strauss et al 1996 but a target disinfectant residual for controlling legionella in homes has not been specified there is no work in residential water heaters specifically or residential hot water systems in general that specifies a residual to be achieved and maintained to inhibit legionella colonization the american society of heating refrigeration and air conditioning engineers ashrae once proposed a minimum cold water influent chlorine residual of 0 5 mg l as desirable threshold to achieve in a public draft version of ashrae 188 ashrae 2011 but this was not included in the final version likely because it was based on anecdotal evidence and was unclear how this would be enforced rhoads et al 2014 though the proposed ashrae target influent chlorine concentration appears to be consistent with this work it still is not clear how this would translate to large building plumbing systems that are more likely to have issues with legionella growth due to having more complicated plumbing and higher water retention times however a recent survey of main water distribution systems reported that 69 2 of l pneumophila culture positive samples only 13 of 317 total samples were positive also had free chlorine residuals 0 5 mg l lechevallier 2019 which is consistent with the findings of this study elevated stored hot water temperatures were associated with decreased positivity of legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copy numbers in hot water samples samples were binned into four broad categories based on the predicted impacts of temperature on legionella growth 32 c survival or moderate growth up to 32 c 89 6 f 32 c and 42 c optimal growth range 89 6 107 6 f 42 c and 51 c moderate growth or survival 107 6 123 8 f and 51 c death 123 8 f though not statistically significant legionella spp and l pneumophila levels trended higher with increasing temperatures up to approximately 42 c 107 6 f fig 5 above 42 c 107 6 f quantifiable legionella spp spearman rank p42 51 0 017 p 51 0 045 and l pneumophila p 51 0 039 significantly decreased as temperature increased samples with temperatures 51 c 123 8 f also had significantly less legionella spp gene copies than either 32 c or 32 42 c 89 6 f or 89 6 107 6 f dunn test with bonferroni correction p value 0 0002 and 0 0031 respectively an identical result showing lower levels of legionella spp gene copy numbers 42 c 107 6 f was reported in an australian survey of 68 homes hayes phillips et al 2019 there were no significant differences in legionella spp or l pneumophila gene copy numbers based on primary plumbing material kruskal wallis test p value 0 51 0 91 nor were there differences in categories of water heater ages 2 2 to 5 5 to 10 and 10 years old kruskal wallis test p value 0 081 0 13 among the inorganics analyzed only the copper concentration was a consistent and significant positive predictor of legionella spp gene concentration across all samples and ordinary least squares ols multiple linear regression models ols step forward ols step backward ols step best subset p value 0 0016 however all possible models were poor in predicting the variability of in legionella spp gene numbers adjusted r2 0 05 and copper was not generally correlated with legionella spp gene numbers spearman rank correlation p values by sample type ranged 0 06 0 29 this suggests that levels of legionella spp gene copy numbers in the water collected may co vary with elevated copper and low chlorine residuals which may simply serve as indicators for stagnation within domestic plumbing drinking water systems during stagnation free chlorine can react with cupric hydroxide solids on copper pipe walls nguyen et al 2011 rapidly eliminating the disinfectant residual in stagnant building plumbing other researchers have sporadically documented that inorganic or metal concentrations have played a role in legionella building colonization including zinc and copper e g borella et al 2004 but do not typically collect enough information to evaluate if the incidence of these metals are simply co factors during stagnation 4 conclusions the one time cleanout of sediment accumulated in flint michigan water heater tanks reduced the amount of particulate inorganics released from the drain valve had no major impact on the level of inorganics sampled at other outlets kitchen shower within homes indicating that water heater sediments do not serve as a regular source of inorganics at hot water point of use outlets and at least temporarily reduced the occurrence and levels of legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copy numbers possibly due to scouring of particulate sediment and biofilms by high velocity flushing of cold water from the distribution system during the heater flushing protocol however the flushing protocol also introduced large amounts of distribution system water to the home with free chlorine residual which may have also contributed to the lower levels of gene copy numbers quantifiable levels of legionella spp and l pneumophila within homes co occurred with free chlorine levels that were below 0 4 mg l in flushed cold influent water to the home from the main distribution system were negatively correlated with temperature when water temperature was 42 c and co occurred when quantifiable levels of legionella spp were present in flushed cold influent water finally the detection of culturable l pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence type 192 in flushed cold influent water of one home in this study occurred in a part of the system with high water age and relatively low chlorine residual demonstrating that distributed water is sometimes a source of legionella to buildings at risk buildings as defined by ashrae 188 should consider routine monitoring of water quality at the

18239,after the federal emergency in flint mi was declared in early 2016 in response to elevated lead in water and incidence of legionnaires disease concerns arose that contaminants in residential water heaters could continue to contribute to poor quality tap water here a comprehensive field survey of residential water heaters n 30 and associated water quality was conducted and the subsequent effects of an aggressive manual water heater clean out was determined including draining the tank and removing sediments via brushing and flushing before cleaning inorganics accumulated in the tank sediments did not serve as a source of metals measured at hot water outlets after cleaning hardness calcium magnesium silica and corrosion associated inorganics lead iron copper aluminum zinc decreased by 64 in samples from sediment cleanout drain valves culturable l pneumophila was only detected in 1 home 3 3 prior to cleaning and 2 homes 6 7 after cleaning thus quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify potential effects on unculturable strains despite the limitation of differentiating live and dead cells after the cleaning protocol legionella spp and l pneumophila gene numbers decreased or remained non detectable in 83 and 98 of samples respectively homes with less than 0 4 mg l influent free chlorine tended to have quantifiable legionella spp gene numbers in water entering the home and had elevated l pneumophila and legionella spp gene numbers throughout the home plumbing also legionella spp and l pneumophila gene numbers were highest for water heaters set at or below 42 c and significantly decreased 51 c consistent with legionella s preferred temperature range examination of the only home that had culturable l pneumophila both before and after the cleaning protocol revealed that the organism was culturable from several sample locations throughout the home including in water representative of the water main notably the home was located in close proximity to mclaren hospital where an outbreak of legionnaires disease was reported and the water heater had a setpoint within the legionella growth range of 44 2 c considering that other factors were more strongly associated with legionella occurrence and water heater sediment was not detectably mobilizing to tap water it was concluded that water heater cleaning had some benefits but was not an overarching factor contributing to possible human health risks graphical abstract image 1 keywords flint mi legionella water heater sediment flushing risk factors 1 introduction after switching from lake huron to the flint river as the drinking water source in april 2014 widespread distribution system water quality problems occurred in flint mi ultimately leading to a federal emergency declaration edwards et al 2015 rose 2015 masten et al 2016 fema 2016 citywide lead in water contamination and elevated lead in children s blood pieper et al 2017 2018 hanna attisha et al 2016 prompted a switch back to lake huron source water purchased from detroit in october 2015 in january 2016 authorities announced that outbreaks of legionnaires disease had occurred in summers of 2014 and 2015 although the switch back to the lake huron water source in october 2015 reinstated corrosion control and improved disinfectant residuals there was lingering concern about persistent public health threats all available data collected in early 2016 demonstrated relatively low levels of l pneumophila in small single story buildings schwake et al 2016a b rhoads et al 2017 fachep 2016 suggesting that l pneumophila occurrence and legionnaires disease incidence were primarily associated with large buildings however the state of michigan and the federal emergency management agency were concerned about possible high levels of legionella bacteria in home water systems especially due to the high rates of water main breaks and red water from 2014 to 2016 nationally it is believed that 96 of reported legionnaires disease is not associated with outbreaks with the origin of 64 of reported cases never reliably being identified hicks et al 2011 shah et al 2018 residential plumbing systems are a potential source of unidentified legionnaires disease stout et al 1987 1992 pedro botet et al 2002 straus et al 1996 byrne et al 2018 detected l pneumophila serogroup 6 strains in 12 of flint homes n 130 in late 2016 which differed from serogroup 1 clinical strains detected by the urine antigen test all available clinical isolates were also found to belong to serogroup 1 while isolates recovered from tap water in early 2016 were found to belong to serogroup 1 or serogroup 6 garner et al 2019 but of a different sequence type of serogroup 6 than that reported by byrne et al 2018 following the federal emergency declaration in flint there was concern that legionella could have colonized water heater sediments during the water crisis creating a long term reservoir for legionella sediments are known to react with disinfectants and reduce their efficacy while also providing nutrients shelter and surface area for attached microbial growth including for legionella lu et al 2015 qin et al 2017 sediments also decrease heat transfer and energy efficiency weingarten 1992 after the flint water crisis there were also general concerns that accumulation of iron and lead from water main breaks and corrosion might increase disinfectant loss microbial growth and lead exposure although hot water is not considered by epa to be potable water used for consumption drinking or cooking current recommendations for water heater cleanout including flushing vacuuming and or dissolving sediments are designed to remove hardness scale weingarten 1992 widder and baechler 2013 water heater flushing protocols were developed following the elk river 4 methylcyclohexanemethanol mchm spill however the protocols were not rigorously designed validated or verified in the field and there are concerns that flushing might have even increased consumer exposure to mchm omur ozbek et al 2016 eventually science based recommendations were developed casteloes et al 2015 hawes et al 2017 ragain et al 2019 for the water soluble chemicals of concern but they were not designed for removal of contaminants that settled or deposited in plumbing in surveying the occurrence of legionella it is also important to evaluate all relevant factors that could contribute to its proliferation in particular water heater set point has been identified as a critical parameter for legionella colonization of residential plumbing systems with settings less than 49 c 120 f facilitating legionella growth in the storage tanks lee et al 1988 while michigan code allows residential water heater temperature settings up to 60 c 140 f default or resident preferred temperatures are typically lower due to a desire to decrease energy demand reduce scaling and prevent scalding gas heaters tend to have lower prevalence of legionella than electric heaters likely due to heating from the tank bottom as opposed to side mounted electrical elements resistors that create stratification alary and joly 1991 dufresne et al 2011 brazeau and edwards 2013 in addition while free chlorine levels in the distribution system had improved markedly by summer 2016 relative to during the period the city was using the flint river water rhoads et al 2017 zahran et al 2018 residents were using little water due to high water bills readily available bottled water and concerns about the safety of bath water roy and edwards 2019 there was also concern that the improved disinfectant residuals were not being consistently delivered to the residential plumbing due to low water use here we evaluated the hypothesis that a thorough water heater sediment cleaning event would improve water quality at hot water outlets by reducing inorganic contamination disinfectant demand and legionella proliferation and release we conducted a comprehensive field sampling campaign during the flint mi federal emergency response deploying a rigorous water heater sediment cleaning protocol at 30 single family flint residences located near the epicenter of the reported legionnaires disease outbreaks at mclaren hospital mdhhs 2018 the goal was to provide insight into the potential for water heater flushing to reduce risk of exposure to legionella and other water contaminants following major corrosion or other massive contamination events 2 methods 2 1 sample collection two sampling campaigns were conducted in july 2016 including 30 homes near the two hospitals in flint mi where the majority of the legionnaires disease cases and highest water ages were reported six samples were collected from each home before and 5 6 days after performing the water heater cleaning protocol three of the samples were stagnant first draws from the 1 cold kitchen outlet 2 hot kitchen outlet and 3 shower head or bathtub spout sample of mixed hot and cold water further samples were collected from the 4 kitchen outlet flushed hot water after a stable hot water temperature was reached 5 water heater drain valve and 6 an outside hose bib or outlet nearest to the point of entry to the home after 5 min of maximum flow rate flushing the last sample was intended to be representative of influent water to the house from the main distribution system the stagnant samples were collected in two sequential 1 l bottles for biological and inorganic chemical analysis respectively the first 1 l sterile polypropylene sample bottle was pre dosed with 24 mg of sodium thiosulfate to remove disinfectant residual and after mixing 250 ml was aliquoted for culture into a sterile polypropylene bottle while the remainder was used for dna extraction appendix a the second 1 l sample from the outlet was collected in an acid washed high density polyethylene bottle and temperature free chlorine total chlorine and ph were measured in the field a portion of the sample was filtered in the field with a 0 45 μm pore size syringe filter whatman where inorganics in the filtrate were operationally defined as soluble the remainder of the sample was acid digested to determine total inorganic content for the hot flushed samples two consecutive 1 l samples were collected and processed for biological and chemical analysis as described above except that an additional 250 ml sample was also collected directly from the outlet into a polypropylene bottle dosed with 6 mg sodium thiosulfate for culture the sampling procedure for cold flushed water was identical to that of the hot flushed samples except 2 l bottles dosed with 48 mg sodium thiosulfate were collected for molecular analysis to increase the mass of dna in filter concentrated extracts from cold water mains which tend to have less biomass samples for culture were shipped overnight at ambient temperature while molecular samples were shipped overnight on ice all culture and molecular samples were processed within 30 h of collection 2 2 water heater flushing protocol the water heater cleaning procedure had three progressive levels of flushing first water was repeatedly flushed from the bottom drain valve of the tank until it consistently ran clear second the water heater was drained and sediments were repeatedly scoured using gravity and pressurized flow sprayed into the drained heater via the cold water influent dip tube third the drain valves were completely removed and the interior of the tank was scrubbed with a coarse brush to loosen sediments followed by more pressurized scouring with cold water until water from the tank ran clear the heaters were then re filled with water and outlets flushed to re pressurize the system meta data about the system and the home size age primary plumbing material were collected onsite 2 3 sample analysis temperature and ph were measured using an orion 100 series ph meter calibrated with a three point calibration curve with automatic temperature correction free and total chlorine were quantified using a hand held hach loveland co pocket colorimeter using standard method 4500 cl the remaining sample was transported to virginia tech and acidified with 2 nitric acid or hydroxylamine for samples with a large amount of visible iron sediment for quantification of inorganics by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using standard method 3125b apha awwa wef 1998 a total of 28 inorganics are included in the icp ms suite limits of quantification are indicated in appendix b 2 4 culture methods water samples were filter concentrated 50x using a 0 22 μm pore size mixed cellulose ester membrane filter resuspended in the original unconcentrated sample and plated onto buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye media with 0 4 g l l cysteine 3 g l ammonium free glycine 80 000 units l polymyxin b sulfate 0 001 g l vancomycin and 0 08 g l cycloheximide a matrix of sample treatments including heat incubation at 50 c 122 f for 30 min as well as 1 10 and 1 100 dilutions were used to increase legionella culturability potential legionella isolates were culture confirmed on bcye media with and without 0 4 g l of l cysteine and then t streaked suspended in 50 μl of molecular grade water frozen at 20 c 4 f overnight heated to 90 c 194 f on a heat block to lyse cells pelleted using a microcentrifuge and the supernatant used directly in polymerase chain reaction pcr for isolate confirmation 2 5 molecular methods isolates were confirmed using previously published legionella spp 23s rrna l pneumophila mip l pneumophila serogroup 1 wzm and monoclonal antibody group two mab2 positive l pneumophila serogroup 1 specific primers lag 1 merault et al 2011 wullings et al 2011 kozak et al 2009 appendix c positive controls included l pneumophila strain 130b acquired from the centers for disease control negative controls included a non template control of molecular grade purity water and an unknown environmental bacterial isolate that readily grew on l cysteine negative bcye agar plates each pcr reaction was analyzed in triplicate and product size was confirmed using gel electrophoresis with low mass ladder quantification on a 1 2 agarose gel environmental dna was extracted from filter concentrated as before samples using a commercially available dna extraction kit fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals legionella spp 23s rrna and l pneumophila mip were enumerated by quantitative pcr qpcr using previously published methods nazarian et al 2008 wang et al 2012 though qpcr detects and quantifies both live and dead cells causing potential false positive results relative comparisons between levels occurring at the point of entry to a home and at individual outlets can be used as an indicator for potential regrowth e g rhoads et al 2016 thus qpcr was applied to make relative rather than absolute comparisons briefly a dilution curve performed on a subset of sample types revealed that a 1 10 dilution was adequate to minimize qpcr reaction inhibition for each qpcr run serially diluted standards prepared from m13 pcr primer extracted clone plasmids a non template control and a spike and recovery on environmental samples to confirm absence of inhibition on a subset of samples were run in triplicate wells the quantification limit was set at 50 100 gene copies reaction based on the lowest standard dna template that consistently appeared with a standard curve efficiency of greater than 80 and r2 greater than 0 98 any sample that had two out of three wells appear above the quantification limit was scored as quantifiable while any sample that appeared to be inhibited was re analyzed otherwise results were scored as non detectable and entered as 0 gc ml or below the quantification limit bql and entered as half of the quantification limit 25 gc ml for statistical analyses as appropriate the log enumeration 1 is reported samples for 3 homes were inadvertently discarded before analysis and thus only samples from 27 homes were included in the dna analysis portion of this study 2 6 data analysis and statistics plots and statistical tests were constructed in rstudio r version 3 2 0 and detailed as appropriate in the text 3 results and discussion 3 1 qualitative notes on cleaning protocol for new heaters 1 year old or a few heaters that had been flushed regularly by the homeowner n 3 only 30 45 min was required to perform the entire cleaning protocol and achieve clear flushed water however in the typical case n 21 the procedure required between 90 and 120 min before the water from the tank ran clear of sediment for worst case heaters n 6 clear water was never achieved and flushing was discontinued at 2 h during the second week of sampling after the heaters had already been cleaned once we selected two heaters that required typical effort to clean during the first week of sampling one tank 6 and one 6 years old and two heaters that had been identified as worst case for further testing for these heaters we repeated a flushing protocol that included draining the tank and scouring the sediment with pressurized water twice the two heaters that had been relatively easy to clean remained clear during the follow up flushing fig 1 a and b however both heaters that had been difficult to clean still had noticeable particulates running from the tank fig 1c red iron corrosion byproduct fig 1d white particulates the sediment removed during the follow up flushing in fig 1c did not settle in a graduated cylinder over a 5 min period unlike the sediment collected from the initial procedure at this home fig 1e suggesting that sediments removed during the initial cleaning were larger particulates 3 2 water tank sediment quantity and composition the cleaning protocol decreased the amount of accumulated sediments released from the water heater drain valve the sum of all inorganic constituents measured by icp ms were used as a measure of total inorganic mass in samples cold distribution system water collected at the hose bib after 5 min of flushing is representative of soluble inorganics levels of 42 8 49 9 2 mg l both before and after the cleaning protocol was performed particulate inorganics coming from water heater drain valves were quantified by subtracting total concentrations of each inorganic measured in flushed cold water from the water heater drain valve samples at each home to account for inorganics in the cold influent water to each home before the first cleaning the water heater drain valve samples contributed 23 8 mg l excess inorganics on average 54 higher than the level dissolved in distribution system water with high standard deviation 79 0 mg l in the follow up sample after the water heater cleaning protocol the total excess mass released from the water heater tank sediment was 8 6 mg l on average 19 higher than distribution system water with standard deviation 32 9 mg l reflecting lowered concentrations of scoured particulates after cleaning table d1 fig 2 thus the total mass of particulate inorganics released decreased by 64 or an average of 15 2 mg l after the cleaning was performed paired wilcox test p value 0 00086 n 30 table d1 figure d1 the water heater sediment was found to consist of a combination of hardness associated components magnesium silica calcium and metal corrosion related solids magnesium aluminum phosphorus iron copper zinc lead fig 3 these constituents are associated with precipitates due to heating of the water calcium corrosion of water heater components sacrificial magnesium or aluminum anode rod and precipitated or mobilized corrosion scale from iron water mains service line or premise plumbing phosphorus iron lead before the cleaning calcium aluminum phosphorus and iron accounted for 70 0 of the particulate inorganics on average range 3 6 97 7 median 79 7 the mass of all particulates decreased significantly after the cleaning protocol paired wilcox test p value 1 32 10 5 0 049 n 30 there was no correlation between water heater age which ranged from 1 to 10 years old and any particulate inorganics released before or after the cleaning spearman rank correlation p value 0 066 0 18 n 30 with the exception of calcium rho 0 57 p value 0 0049 n 30 appendix e primary home plumbing material did not impact the total particulate inorganics iron or copper released from the drain valves before or after the cleaning kruskal wallis test p value 0 076 0 86 table f1 f3 however there was more zinc particulate released in homes with galvanized plumbing before the water heater cleaning was performed dunn test with bonferroni posthoc correction p value 0 020 but not after the cleaning protocol p value 0 94 total zinc and iron concentrations were significantly correlated in stagnant cold and all hot water samples spearman rank correlation p values 5 10 8 0 008 table g1 but not in flushed cold water representative of the distribution system this suggests that a significant source of the accumulated sediments in these homes was due to corrosion of the galvanized plumbing 3 3 impact of water tank sediment on inorganics at hot outlets the only constituents higher in hot stagnant or flushed water samples versus cold water samples before the cleaning were magnesium and aluminum mg kruskal wallis p values 0 0083 0 0133 al p value 0 0007 table g3 which is expected due to their presence in water heater anodes the absolute elevation in aluminum 52 increase or 56 ppb higher relative to 108 ppb in cold distributed water and magnesium 3 increase or 200 ppb higher relative 7890 ppb in cold distributed water on average in the hot water lines was relatively low only 4 of hot stagnant and 9 of hot flushed samples exceeded the 15 ppb action level for lead which is in the range of the 3 9 of cold water samples table g2 although 69 of drain valve samples exceeded 15 ppb this is not unexpected given that the action level does not apply to hot water especially drain valves because it is not meant for human consumption 3 4 water quality parameters temperature and chlorine from water main samples were not significantly different before and after the cleaning protocol median free chlorine residuals delivered to homes were consistent at 0 59 0 60 mg l during the study table 1 once in the home plumbing the chlorine residual decayed to varying degrees and levels were slightly higher 0 01 0 07 mg l comparing medians before after cleaning after the cleaning this was likely due to flushing increased water use and high velocity associated with the cleaning protocol and variable stagnation times which were not assessed in this study chlorine was routinely detected in cold stagnant samples median 0 41 and 0 50 mg l before and after the cleaning respectively but was lower in hot water samples as expected due to the water residence time in the water heater storage tank and faster chlorine decay at higher temperature median 0 01 0 20 mg l across all hot water samples water heater temperature set point quantified by the hot flushed water temperature ranged from 33 4 to 67 4 c 92 1 153 3 f median 53 3 c 127 9 f table 2 3 5 culturable legionella pneumophila culturable l pneumophila was detected in only two homes sampled in this study 6 6 before the cleaning protocol one home tested positive for culturable l pneumophila in the flushed hot water the water heater drain valve and even the cold flushed water sample thought to be representative of the distribution system after the cleaning this same home still yielded culturable l pneumophila in all the stagnant samples collected from distal locations cold and hot water at the kitchen outlet and at the showerhead another home was found to have culturable l pneumophila in the hot stagnant sample only interestingly this was after the cleaning all isolates identified in this study were mab2 positive serogroup 1 strains i e positive for lag 1 and wzm genes by pcr and classified as sequence type 192 via whole genome sequencing described elsewhere garner et al 2019 the home that was positive both before and after the cleaning was re sampled in august 2016 garner et al 2019 in this follow up sampling only the stagnant shower sample was positive and the isolate was again identified as a mab2 positive l pneumophila serogroup 1 strain by pcr but was classified as sequence type 1 instead of 192 garner et al 2019 there is precedence for multiple sequence types of l pneumophila being identified at the same location bédard et al 2019 notably the august 2016 sequence type 1 isolate is the same sequence type identified in 3 of 10 legionnaires disease clinical isolates collected from 2015 examined by garner et al 2019 and differed from one clinical isolate by only 38 snps via single nucleotide polymorphism analysis this was the highest similarity of any environmental isolate compared to clinical isolates examined by garner et al 2019 the one home with culturable l pneumophila both before and after the cleaning including in the sample representative of water entering the home was located in close geographical proximity to mclaren hospital 0 3 miles direct sight 1 6 1 9 miles by road which was associated with 51 of the 90 legionnaires disease cases that occurred during 2014 2015 mdhhs 2018 it also had several risk factors that deviated somewhat from other homes in this study the free chlorine levels entering the home 0 36 ppm as cl2 was on the lower end of that entering other homes median 0 59 0 60 mg l this home was also located towards the end of an hydraulically isolated neighborhood within a high water age region of the flint distribution system estimated to be 9 or more days arcadis 2018 which likely contributed to lower residuals and potentially the isolate detected in water entering the home the hot water set point 44 2 c was more than 9 c below the average water heater temperatures in this study and in the high risk range for legionella growth yee wadowsky 1982 several samples had elevated iron levels 250 μg l compared to other homes median 41 3 50 9 μg l before after cleaning in addition our team found that this water heater was one of the three that were very difficult to clean while all of these factors individually or in combination could increase the likelihood of legionella detection there were at least some other homes that had greater individual risk factors but which did not yield culturable legionella or elevated levels of legionella spp or l pneumophila gene numbers which are presented in section 3 6 the other home that had culturable legionella and only in the hot stagnant sample after cleaning had no significant risk factors given the high water temperature set point 52 c and influent free chlorine concentrations 0 6 0 71 ppm as cl2 before after cleaning this home also had relatively low iron levels only one sample sligly elevated at 88 μg l and spikes of iron did not occur as in the other home with culturable l pneumophila however the water heater was again one of three heaters judged very difficult to clean even after six attempts to clean the heater the water was still turbid in sum 2 of 6 of homes with difficult to clean heaters also happened to yield culturable l pneumophila the reported positivity rates for culturable l pneumophila serogroup 1 of 1 8 of samples n 7 of 372 and 6 7 of homes n 2 of 30 are comparable to some prior reports byrne et al 2018 detected l pneumophila serogroup 1 in only one of 130 homes 0 7 in flint from september october 2016 however byrne et al identified l pneumophila serogroup 6 in 12 of residences n 130 sampled in general l pneumophila serogroup 1 is thought to be the dominant agent of legionnaires disease in the us as observed in a survey of sputum cultures collected from 508 patients l pneumophila serogroup 1 was identified in 84 2 sputum cultures yu et al 2002 further mab2 is considered to be a strong indicator of virulence e g in on study it was detected in 75 of 100 clinical isolates and only 8 of 50 environmental isolates kozak et al 2009 still it must be acknowledged that clinical diagnostics of legionnaires disease is inherently biased towards serogroup 1 strains both because of the urine antigen test and non pneumophila species tend to be more difficult to isolate mercante and winchell 2015 lee et al 1993 lucas et al 2011 the fact that this study and byrne et al 2018 independently report very low rates of l pneumophila serogroup 1 in homes sampled in 2016 and a third study reported non detection in small building water samples in late 2015 rhoads et al 2017 is a mystery because the residential water systems in flint had multiple risk factors for colonization by legionella and there was a major disease outbreak in a hospital in 2014 and 2015 table 3 in particular 60 of homes in this study had water heater temperature settings lower than the recommended levels to inhibit legionella growth and one quarter of home water heater temperature settings were at very high risk temperatures of 33 4 46 3 c 92 115 f we speculate that one reason incidence of legionella was so low is because the majority of water heaters 86 sampled in this study were gas even though efforts were made to identify and sample higher risk electric water heaters alary and joly 1991 3 6 legionella gene copy numbers 3 6 1 impact of the cleaning protocol on legionella positivity the proportion of samples with detectable legionella gene copies i e positivity decreased after the water heater tank cleaning legionella spp positivity decreased from 73 before to 40 after and l pneumophila positivity decreased from 23 to 4 table 4 legionella spp positivity decreased across all sample types after the cleaning protocol except cold stagnant samples table 4 mcnemar test p value 0 0001 0 023 the change in l pneumophila positivity was less frequently significant among individual sample types likely due to the low number of positive samples both before and after the cleaning protocol samples that were negative before the cleaning tended to remain negative after the cleaning overall only 5 samples that were negative for legionella spp before the cleaning were positive after the cleaning and only 1 sample negative before cleaning was positive afterwards for l pneumophila table h1 3 6 2 trends in legionella gene copy numbers though there were low levels of legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copy numbers in samples overall table h2 h4 figure h1 and h2 influent conditions appeared to be an important factor for detecting sporadically high levels in individual homes for instance there were 20 homes nbefore 12 nafter 8 with quantifiable levels of legionella spp in the cold flushed water sample representative of water entering the home i e 5 min flushing at hose bib or nearest outlet to the point of entry these homes had significantly more legionella spp and l pneumophila dna within the home plumbing compared to homes without quantifiable legionella spp dna in water entering the home kruskal test p value 1 68 10 16 and 3 98 10 8 respectively fig 4 a b however legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copies did not increase within these homes relative to the cold water entering the home fig 4 a b in addition while there was no significant correlation between free chlorine and overall legionella spp or l pneumophila gene copy numbers spearman rank p value 0 65 0 76 figure h3 or even amongst the different types of samples p value 0 15 0 85 homes with influent free chlorine 0 4 mg l n 11 contained significantly higher legionella spp but not l pneumophila copy numbers than homes that had influent free chlorine 0 4 mg l kruskal test p value 1 21 10 6 and 0 68 respectively fig 4 c d of the eight homes with median legionella spp gene copy numbers from all samples above the quantification limit six of them had free chlorine levels less than 0 4 mg l the home with culturable l pneumophila both before and after the cleaning had low influent free chlorine 0 24 0 36 mg l this home also had the highest levels of legionella gene markers on average an order of magnitude more legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copies than the 90th percentile of all samples 104 1 vs 103 2 gc ml and 102 6 vs below the quantification limit of 101 4 gc ml respectively it is widely recognized that lower chlorine residuals at the point of entry to buildings can be a risk factor for legionella colonization e g strauss et al 1996 but a target disinfectant residual for controlling legionella in homes has not been specified there is no work in residential water heaters specifically or residential hot water systems in general that specifies a residual to be achieved and maintained to inhibit legionella colonization the american society of heating refrigeration and air conditioning engineers ashrae once proposed a minimum cold water influent chlorine residual of 0 5 mg l as desirable threshold to achieve in a public draft version of ashrae 188 ashrae 2011 but this was not included in the final version likely because it was based on anecdotal evidence and was unclear how this would be enforced rhoads et al 2014 though the proposed ashrae target influent chlorine concentration appears to be consistent with this work it still is not clear how this would translate to large building plumbing systems that are more likely to have issues with legionella growth due to having more complicated plumbing and higher water retention times however a recent survey of main water distribution systems reported that 69 2 of l pneumophila culture positive samples only 13 of 317 total samples were positive also had free chlorine residuals 0 5 mg l lechevallier 2019 which is consistent with the findings of this study elevated stored hot water temperatures were associated with decreased positivity of legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copy numbers in hot water samples samples were binned into four broad categories based on the predicted impacts of temperature on legionella growth 32 c survival or moderate growth up to 32 c 89 6 f 32 c and 42 c optimal growth range 89 6 107 6 f 42 c and 51 c moderate growth or survival 107 6 123 8 f and 51 c death 123 8 f though not statistically significant legionella spp and l pneumophila levels trended higher with increasing temperatures up to approximately 42 c 107 6 f fig 5 above 42 c 107 6 f quantifiable legionella spp spearman rank p42 51 0 017 p 51 0 045 and l pneumophila p 51 0 039 significantly decreased as temperature increased samples with temperatures 51 c 123 8 f also had significantly less legionella spp gene copies than either 32 c or 32 42 c 89 6 f or 89 6 107 6 f dunn test with bonferroni correction p value 0 0002 and 0 0031 respectively an identical result showing lower levels of legionella spp gene copy numbers 42 c 107 6 f was reported in an australian survey of 68 homes hayes phillips et al 2019 there were no significant differences in legionella spp or l pneumophila gene copy numbers based on primary plumbing material kruskal wallis test p value 0 51 0 91 nor were there differences in categories of water heater ages 2 2 to 5 5 to 10 and 10 years old kruskal wallis test p value 0 081 0 13 among the inorganics analyzed only the copper concentration was a consistent and significant positive predictor of legionella spp gene concentration across all samples and ordinary least squares ols multiple linear regression models ols step forward ols step backward ols step best subset p value 0 0016 however all possible models were poor in predicting the variability of in legionella spp gene numbers adjusted r2 0 05 and copper was not generally correlated with legionella spp gene numbers spearman rank correlation p values by sample type ranged 0 06 0 29 this suggests that levels of legionella spp gene copy numbers in the water collected may co vary with elevated copper and low chlorine residuals which may simply serve as indicators for stagnation within domestic plumbing drinking water systems during stagnation free chlorine can react with cupric hydroxide solids on copper pipe walls nguyen et al 2011 rapidly eliminating the disinfectant residual in stagnant building plumbing other researchers have sporadically documented that inorganic or metal concentrations have played a role in legionella building colonization including zinc and copper e g borella et al 2004 but do not typically collect enough information to evaluate if the incidence of these metals are simply co factors during stagnation 4 conclusions the one time cleanout of sediment accumulated in flint michigan water heater tanks reduced the amount of particulate inorganics released from the drain valve had no major impact on the level of inorganics sampled at other outlets kitchen shower within homes indicating that water heater sediments do not serve as a regular source of inorganics at hot water point of use outlets and at least temporarily reduced the occurrence and levels of legionella spp and l pneumophila gene copy numbers possibly due to scouring of particulate sediment and biofilms by high velocity flushing of cold water from the distribution system during the heater flushing protocol however the flushing protocol also introduced large amounts of distribution system water to the home with free chlorine residual which may have also contributed to the lower levels of gene copy numbers quantifiable levels of legionella spp and l pneumophila within homes co occurred with free chlorine levels that were below 0 4 mg l in flushed cold influent water to the home from the main distribution system were negatively correlated with temperature when water temperature was 42 c and co occurred when quantifiable levels of legionella spp were present in flushed cold influent water finally the detection of culturable l pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence type 192 in flushed cold influent water of one home in this study occurred in a part of the system with high water age and relatively low chlorine residual demonstrating that distributed water is sometimes a source of legionella to buildings at risk buildings as defined by ashrae 188 should consider routine monitoring of water quality at the
