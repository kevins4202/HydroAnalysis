2155,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from reservoirs have received increasing attention in recent years despite extensive studies in single reservoirs ghg emission patterns in cascades of multiple reservoirs which are becoming increasingly common worldwide remain unknown this study investigated the spatial patterns of diffusive carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions as well as their total co2 equivalent co2 eq for a cascade hydropower system in the heavily dammed upper mekong river china results demonstrated that ghg emissions in cascade reservoirs were higher than that in the upstream channel since the accumulated sediments fueled microbes for ghg production in cascade reservoirs co2 made the largest contribution 58 6 84 8 to total co2 eq while the contribution of n2o was marginal deep reservoirs emitted less co2 which was attributed to higher co2 consumption by phytoplankton reservoirs formerly occupying the most upstream position for the longest period of time in the cascade emitted the most ch4 perhaps due to accumulations of river borne sediments the total co2 eq generally increased with distance downstream except within deep reservoirs these findings indicate that with respect to mitigating ghg emissions the deepest most upstream reservoir should be constructed first in the configuration of cascade hydropower reservoirs and less sediment will enter downstream reservoirs which have higher co2 eq emissions keywords upper mekong river dam methane carbon dioxide nitrous oxide data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as climate warms greenhouse gas ghg emissions from inland waters particularly from reservoirs have received widespread attentions deemer 2016 maavara 2019 global rivers are extensively dammed for the purposes of hydropower production and over 8 600 dams primarily designed for hydropower generation are in operation zarfl et al 2015 a cascade configuration i e a sequence of multiple dams on the same river is becoming increasingly common particularly on large rivers grumbine and xu 2011 for instance on the 1200 km mainstream of the upper mekong river china 10 hydropower dams have been built and 11 dams are under construction or are being planned fan et al 2015 kondolf et al 2014 the role of hydropower reservoirs as contributors to the emissions of ghgs such as carbon dioxide co 2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o however remains a topic of controversy barros 2011 deemer 2016 prairie 2017 rosa and schaeffer 1995 ghg emissions from reservoirs have the potential to counteract the environmental benefits of hydropower giles 2006 qiu 2009 santos et al 2006 it was estimated that global reservoirs emit 120 5 g co2 c m 2 year 1 43 8 g ch4 c m 2 year 1 and 0 1 g n2o n m 2 year 1 which contribute greatly to global budgets of anthropogenic ghg emissions bastviken et al 2011 deemer 2016 after river damming sediment accumulation supplies rich substrates nitrogen organic carbon to fuel microbes for ghg production creating hotspots of ghg emissions barros 2011 berberich et al 2020 maavara et al 2017 tranvik 2009 which have been extensively studied in single hydropower reservoirs abril 2005 chen et al 2009 delsontro et al 2016 harrison et al 2017 lu 2011 maeck 2013 zheng 2011 maeck et al maeck 2013 found that sediment accumulation in deposition zones such as dam forebays fuels high ch4 emissions in the reservoir before being emitted to the atmosphere ghg concentrations may also change due to biogeochemical cycles along their pathway liang 2019 for example co2 can be consumed through photosynthetic uptake by phytoplankton van dam et al 2018 which is potentially controlled by hydraulic residence time since phytoplankton prefer to proliferate in reservoirs with long hydraulic residence time chen 2020 in a reservoir cascade the order of dam construction location and the physical properties hydraulic residence time etc of the constructed reservoirs may drive trends in ghg emission patterns by affecting sediment transport phytoplankton growth and biogeochemical cycling recently ebullitive emissions of ghg from cascade reservoirs have been documented liu 2020 however the spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions from cascade reservoirs and the driving factors remain unclear in this study we aim to explore spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions in particular we investigate the role of known drivers water and sediment properties hydraulic residence time reservoir age and water depth on diffusive ghg emissions from individual reservoirs and quantify the interacting impacts of parameters specifically associated with reservoir cascades including the spatial order and timing of construction of dams within a cascade the microbes responsible for ghg production were also analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr method the findings can add our understanding of diffusive ghg emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mekong river fig 1 originates in the tibetan plateau and empties into the south china sea after flowing along 4 909 km through six nations china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and viet nam making it among the largest river systems in the world the mean annual discharge at the outlet of this river is 457 km3 yr 1 and it has a watershed area of 760 000 km2 shi 2017 it is customary to divide the mekong basin into an upper basin that resides within china where it is known as the lancang river and a lower basin extending from yunnan china through southeast asia the most precipitous drop in the mekong river occurs in the upper basin where it falls 4 500 m over 2 139 km and has a flow over 76 5 km3 yr 1 creating large potential for hydropower production from 1993 through 2018 nine hydropower dams were built on the mainstream of the upper mekong river they are from upstream dahua r1 huangdeng r2 miaowei r3 gongguoqiao r4 xiaowan r5 manwan r6 dachaoshan r7 nuozhadu r8 and jinghong r9 creating a system of connected reservoirs along the river channel the basic information of the nine reservoirs is shown in fig 1 the heavily dammed upper mekong river provides a distinct case to investigate spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions 2 2 sample collection and analyses a field survey was carried out at 65 sites fig 1 along the upper mekong river in september 2018 to minimize the variations incurred by the timing of sampling the field survey at different sites was conducted synchronously by several workgroups at each site triplicate measurements of co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes across air water interfaces were made method described in section 2 3 while surface water 500 ml volume grab samples and bed sediment 50 g wet mass were sampled in triplicate bed sediment samples were collected with an ekman grab sampler zg0204 shanghai zigui instrument co ltd china completely homogenized after removing large debris stone tree branches etc and then kept frozen in liquid nitrogen due to the lack of bed sediment deposited immediately downstream of dams up to 5 km downstream of r1 r2 r3 r4 r6 and r7 59 sediment samples were collected in the field survey in total in the upstream channel sampling sediment water and ghgs was conducted on a bridge in each reservoir sampling water and ghgs at the site right after the front dam was conducted at the shore sampling sediment water and ghgs at the sites in the lacustrine zone was conducted on a boat in the middle of the channel the water depth and the distance from the dam of each sampling site were presented in supplementary table s1 in the laboratory portions of the homogenized sample were randomly selected for the analyses of sediment characteristics and microbes in triplicate see the details below 300 ml of water samples or 200 ml when phytoplankton was very dense was filtered on gf f filters 0 45 μm to collect phytoplankton for chl a analysis using the hot ethanol extraction method chen 2016 a vario macro cube elemental analyser elementar inc germany was used to measure sediment organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations following the freeze drying and hand grinding of these sediment samples grain size was analysed by using an ultrasonic oscillator ps 60a shenzhen shenghuatai ultrasonic equipment co ltd china to disperse raw sediment samples after which measurements were made with a mastersizer 2000 laser grain size meter grain size was presented as median diameter value d50 μm water temperature and turbidity were measured in situ via a ysi multiparameter meter yellow springs oh usa 2 3 diffusive co2 ch4 and n2o flux measurements diffusive ghg fluxes were estimated using the thin boundary layer model encinas fernández et al 2014 musenze et al 2014b whitfield et al 2011 1 f k c w c e q m where f corresponds to gas flux between water and atmosphere g m 2h 1 which can be converted to the value

atmospheric concentrations mol m 3 k is gas transfer velocity m h 1 m is gas molar mass g mol 1 c eq is calculated based on the ghg concentrations in the air above the sampling site measured at the time of sampling using the headspace method described below gas transfer velocity was computed as described in prior studies using equation 2 shi 2020 xue 2016 2 k k 600 s c 600 n where the k600 m s 1 was estimated using equation 3 in the lentic reservoirs 62 sampling sites wanninkhof 2014 and equation 4 in the turbulent upper channel 3 sampling sites raymond 2012 ulseth 2019 respectively s c corresponds to the schmidt number at water surface temperature as per prior studies wanninkhof 2014 n was 2 3 for u10 3 7 m s 1 and 1 2 for u10 3 7 m s 1 3 k 600 2 07 0 215 u 10 1 7 where u 10 corresponds to the wind speed at 10 m above the surface of the water m s 1 u 10 was obtained from the wind speed at 5 m above water surface by multiplying a factor of 1 06 jiang et al 2008 and the wind speed at 5 m above water surface was measured using a portable wind meter 16026 aice biotechnology co ltd hangzhou china at the time of sampling 4 k 600 5937 1 2 54 v 2 g d v s 0 89 d 0 58 where v is the flow velocity m s 1 d is the water depth m g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 s is the bed slope unitless the bed slop was calculated by using the bed elevation data which was obtained from huaneng lancang river hydropower co ltd the cross sectional averaged flow velocity and water depth were measured in situ by using a propeller typed current meter ls20b nanjing water conservancy and hydrology automation institute china and a sounding rod geelii 5552 shanghai geelii co ltd china respectively surface water ghg concentrations were quantified via the headspace equilibration approach wang 2009 whitfield et al 2011 briefly water samples 20 ml were collected in pre evacuated 60 ml polypropylene syringes with three way stopcocks at 5 cm below the water surface after which a headspace was generated via adding 20 ml of ambient air into the syringe samples were then shaken for 2 min after which the headspace gas was injected into a 12 ml pre evacuated exetainer vial 839 w labco uk and was analyzed via a agilent 7890b agilent technologies inc usa gas chromatograph equipped with autosampler and a thermal conductivity detector tcd for co2 a flame ionization detector fid for ch4 and a micro electron capture detector ecd for n2o analyses n2 and he were used as carrier gases at a flow rate of 20 ml min 1 gas analyses were conducted within 7 days after collection the concentrations of dissolved ghgs in surface water were calculated using equation 5 hu 2018 5 cw c h c 0 v h α c h v w v w where c0 and ch are headspace gas concentrations before and after shaking respectively mol l 1 vh is headspace volume ml vw is water volume 20 ml α is the bunsen coefficient 0 622 2 4 co2 eq emission calculation total co2 eq emissions at each sampling site were calculated by summing co2 eq of each ghg gas for the given time horizon davidson 2015 ipcc 2021 here we used the 100 year horizon values reported most recently by the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which are 27 2 and 273 for ch4 and n2o respectively ipcc 2021 since ch4 can produce higher radiative forcing than co2 a higher co2 eq will be generated when more organic carbon is mineralized to ch4 rather than co2 thus ch4 co2 was also calculated in this study according to holgerson and raymond holgerson and raymond 2016 2 5 microbial abundance analyses microbes associated with ghg production in sediments were quantified via qpcr most of microbes are responsible for co2 production during the degradation of organic matter and total bacterial 16s rdna was used as biomarker for analyzing microbial co2 production shi 2017 according to fernández baca et al fernández baca et al 2019 mcra was used as biomarker for microbes associated with ch4 production n2o is a nitrification and denitrification byproduct kuypers et al 2018 nitrifier amoa and denitrifiers nirs were used as biomarkers to quantify microbes associated with n2o production hou et al 2013 morales et al 2010 a fastdna power max soil dna isolation kit mp biomedical usa was used based on the provided instructions to isolate sediment dna which was then utilized for qpcr analyses conducted in an iq5 cycler instrument bio rad usa all qpcr reactions were conducted in a 20 μl total volume composed of 10 μl sybr premix ex taqtm toyobo japan 0 5 mm each of forward and reverse primers 0 8 μl of 3 mg ml 1 bovine serum albumin sigma usa template dna and ddh2o the primers and qpcr programs are presented in table s2 in order to construct a standard curve plasmid dna containing the target fragment was serially diluted 10 2 10 8 these qpcr reactions were conducted in sealed 96 well plates bio rad and triplicate dna free negative control samples were run on each plate the abundance value of the microbe corresponding to each ghg gas mi j were transformed to a ratio ai j relative to the largest abundance value among all the sampling sites using equation 6 then a microbe indicator bi for total ghg production at each sampling site was calculated by summing the ratios at this site using equation 7 6 a i j m i j m j max 7 b i j a i j where mi j is the abundance of microbe j j 16 s rdna mcra amoa nirs at sampling site i mj max is the maximum abundance of microbe j among all sampling sites bi is the microbe indicator for total ghg production at sampling site i 2 6 statistical analysis spss v22 0 spss inc il usa was used in all statistical testing logarithmic transformation on the original data was conducted to improve data normality difference in ch4 fluxes between the upstream channel and the most downstream r9 reservoir was compared via t tests after data normality had been assessed by the kolmogorov smirnov and variance homogeneity tests p 0 05 was the significance threshold the correlation between ghg emissions and hydro environmental parameters was analyzed based on the simple linear regression after data normalization outliersin datasets are defined as values thatfallmorethan 3 0standarddeviationsfrom the normal hansen et al 2012 3 results 3 1 hydro environmental and microbial conditions the reservoirs within the cascade on the mainstem of the upper mekong river range in hydraulic residence time from 0 01 to 2 36 years and in age from 1 to 25 years at the time of our field survey in 2018 fig 1c these reservoirs were neither built in order from upstream to downstream or vice versa fig 1b along the flow direction water temperature showed a general increasing trend from 12 5 in the upstream channel to 23 2 1 0 mean sd in the downstream reservoirs fig 2 a sediment organic carbon and total nitrogen rose from 11 2 2 9 mg g 1 mean sd and 0 20 0 01 mg g 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 20 3 2 5 mg g 1 mean sd and 1 25 0 12 mg g 1 mean sd in the most downstream r9 respectively fig 2b chl a was generally below 5 0 μg l 1 in the upper mekong river with peak values observed in the largest reservoirs of r5 and r8 chl a reached maximum values of 35 2 and 82 0 μg l 1 in r5 and r8 respectively fig 2c the abundance of microbes associated with ghg production showed generally an increasing trend along the upper mekong river the ghg microbe indicator increased from 0 43 0 05 mean sd in the upstream channel to 1 26 0 39 mean sd in the most downstream r9 fig 2d 3 2 diffusive ch4 co2 n2o fluxes along the flow direction co2 fluxes generally increased with distance downstream with outlier values at some sampling sites in r5 and r8 the co2 flux increased from 548 5 38 7 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 1328 3 369 7 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the most downstream r9 but was below 210 0 mg m 2 d 1 at some sampling sites in r5 and r8 fig 3 a the ch4 flux was below 1 5 mg m 2 d 1 in the upstream channel which was lower than in the downstream reservoirs t test p 0 05 the ch4 fluxes in downstream cascade reservoirs reached 1 0 12 2 mg m 2 d 1 with extreme values observed in r4 and r6 the ch4 fluxes reached maximum values of 8 7 and 12 2 mg m 2 d 1 in r4 and r6 respectively fig 3a ch4 co2 mass ratio indicated that there were extreme values in r4 r6 and r8 which were 0 022 0 027 and 0 014 respectively the remaining ch4 co2 values generally exhibited an increasing trend along the flow direction fig 3b similarly n2o fluxes also exhibited a consistent rising trend along the flow direction n2o fluxes increased from 0 015 0 001 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 0 032 0 001 mean sd mg m 2 d 1 in the most downstream r9 fig 3a total co2 eq emissions exhibited an increasing trend with outlier values in r5 and r8 which increased from 591 5 40 4 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 1404 9 393 1 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the most downstream r9 while the outlier values were below 250 0 mg m 2 d 1 fig 3c compared with ch4 and n2o co2 has the largest contribution to the total co2 eq emissions which reached 84 7 9 3 mean sd ch4 and n2o contributed to 14 0 8 9 mean sd and 1 4 0 8 mean sd of total co2 eq emissions respectively fig 4 3 3 relations between diffusive ghg emissions and hydro environmental conditions the relations between diffusive ghg emissions and the hydro environmental factors were shown in the heatmap based on correlation analysis fig 5 the co2 was negatively correlated with chl a r 2 0 40 p 0 29 hydraulic residence time r 2 0 23 p 0 55 and water depth r 2 0 43 p 0 25 the ch4 was positively correlated with reservoir age r 2 0 62 p 0 08 but was negatively correlated with water depth r 2 0 24 p 0 54 the ch4 co2 ratio was positively correlated to phytoplankton r 2 0 38 p 0 32 and water depth r 2 0 08 p 0 83 n2o emissions showed a positive relationship with all these hydro environmental factors with the dominant influences of sediment tn r 2 0 81 p 0 01 and water temperature r 2 0 79 p 0 01 4 discussion rivers act as leaky pipes for terrestrial sediment transport to coastal waters cole 2007 after river damming the flow velocity decreases allowing suspended particles to settle in reservoirs providing substrates nitrogen organic carbon for microbial consumption and associated ghg production in reservoirs maeck 2013 as a result higher co2 ch4 and n2o emissions were detected in cascade reservoirs relative to the upstream channel fig 3a following the gradually intensified land use from upstream to downstream fig s1 the contents of organic carbon and nitrogen in sediments generally increased along the flow direction fig 2b concurrently water temperature increases gradually fig 2a due to the large decrease in elevation the flow direction from north towards south and the thermal accumulation in reservoirs ren et al 2020 which favors microbial proliferation in sediments with the presence of sufficient substrates microbes associated with ghg production methanogens nitrifiers and denitrifiers generally exhibited an increase from the upstream channel to cascade reservoirs fig 2d leading to the increasing trends of diffusive ghg emissions along the flow direction especially for n2o emissions fig 3a co2 was the dominant contributor to the total co2 eq emissions making the total co2 eq emissions exhibit similar spatial patterns to co2 along the river which generally increased along the flow direction except sharp decreases in the large reservoirs of r5 and r8 fig 3a co2 emissions were most strongly controlled by water depth and phytoplankton biomass which are interrelated and show inverse relationships with co2 emissions fig 5 large water depth often means high dam and hence big reservoirs with long hydraulic residence time after river damming riverine or lotic environments are converted to lentic habitat favoring phytoplankton proliferation especially evident in large reservoirs with long hydraulic residence times chen 2020 soballe and kimmel 1987 in the upper mekong river r5 and r8 are the two largest reservoirs with the hydraulic residence time over 1 8 years enabling the development of dense phytoplankton for consuming co2 fig 2c indicating the primary drivers of co2 emissions in the upper mekong river are controlled by the hydraulic properties of each individual reservoir ch4 was found to be positively correlated to reservoir age fig 5 however barros et al barros 2011 reported that ch4 emissions declined with reservoir age the different findings in this study could be because of strict biomass removal policies implemented in the flooded areas prior to reservoir impoundment in china shi 2017 therefore the emissions are not mainly dependent on initial organic matter stored in flooded areas but on reservoir primary production as well as the magnitude of subsequently accumulated sediment and substrate from influxes in particular the old reservoirs with larger age are mainly located in the downstream after mw reservoir in fig 1 where there are larger drainage areas as well as higher contents of organic carbon and nitrogen in runoff due to intensified land use fig s1 meanwhile ch4 emissions as well as their contributions to total co2 eq emissions are closely related to the historic location within the dam cascade high ch4 concentrations were observed in r4 and r6 which are formerly occupied the most upstream position in the cascade in reservoirs high deposition of suspended particles builds up thick potentially anoxic sediment layers which is favorable for ch4 production and thus a large fraction of organic carbon can be recycled as ch4 rather than co2 shi 2018 in the upper mekong river water turbidity decreased sharply after passing through the cascade dams fig s2 furthermore the sediment input of the most upstream reservoir is mainly from the headwater region due to the narrow drainage area along the upstream reach of this canyon river fig s1 r4 and r6 were the most upstream reservoirs for the longest time 26 and 7 years respectively fig 1c and received and subsequently deposited large amounts of sediments from the upstream region fig s2 potentially promoting anoxia in the deep bottom sediments and enabling high ch4 emissions accordingly ch4 emission peaks were observed after the dam fig 3a due to turbine degassing an important ghg emission pathway deemer 2016 since ch4 has a higher co2 eq value than co2 organic carbon mineralizing to ch4 rather than co2 result in greater warming effects therefore the elevated contribution of ch4 to total co2 eq emissions should receive attentions in future evaluation of global warming effects on dammed river systems particularly if a high sediment load is anticipated as in the most upstream reservoir in a cascade in the upper mekong additional long term monitoring should be continued in the current upstream most reservoir r1 which was built in the same year of the data collection and already showed elevated ch4 emissions fig 3a n2o showed the clearest relationship between distance downstream and emissions magnitude fig 3a n2o is a byproduct of nitrification and denitrification beaulieu 2011 ni et al 2011 su et al 2019 n2o emissions in the upper mekong dam cascade were positively correlated with all the environmental parameters tested but most strongly related to substrate availability and water temperature given the continuous nearly linear increase with distance through the cascade the n2o emissions are most strongly controlled by the north south upstream to downstream temperature gradient from high elevation to low elevation increases in water temperature along the flow direction enhances microbe mediated n2o production shi 2020 additionally nitrogen substrates and organic carbon often act as limiting factors of n2o emissions in aquatic systems gómez alday 2014 wang et al 2014 the additionally strong correlation with sediment tn which increases with distances downstream due to intensifying land use fig 2b suggests that n2o emissions are highly dependent on the available n substrate largely following the trends in ch4 emissions the ch4 co2 ratio increased gradually along the cascade reservoirs this is because thick bottom anoxic sediments in the reservoirs can make organic carbon mineralize more into ch4 than co2 causing high ch4 co2 ratio maeck 2013 according to the bathymetry survey in 2017 the depth of deposited sediment was on average about 15 20 m in the reservoirs the highest values of ch4 co2 ratio were observed in r4 and r6 which are formerly occupied the most upstream position in the cascade for the longest time the reason was similar to that of ch4 which had already been elaborated above the ch4 co2 ratio was found to be positively correlated to reservoir age fig 5 which could be attributed to the high positive correlation between ch4 and reservoir age these findings provide an important step forward in our understanding of ghg emissions during the development of cascade hydropower reservoirs our findings suggest that with respect to mitigating ghg emissions in canyon rivers the most upstream reservoir could be constructed first if possible and that it should ideally be deep in such cases the majority of organic matter will be trapped in the most upstream reservoir and less organic matter enters downstream reservoirs where it is favorable for co2 eq emissions fig 3c although the spatial patterns of ghgs were found to be mainly controlled by the order of dam construction location and reservoir physical properties in the reservoir cascade more field surveys are still needed in future to identify their seasonal variations recently studies have reported thatebullition makes an important contribution to ch4 emissions deemer 2016 liu 2020 particularly in shallow and organic rich reservoirs in this study we did not measure the ebullition flux but focused on diffusive emissions some information about ebullition of ch4 from cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong river can be found in liu et al liu 2020 5 conclusions recently ghg emissions from hydropower reservoirs have received considerable attention in this study we investigated the spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions in the heavily dammed upper mekong river our main conclusions are 1 the total co2 eq emissions in each reservoir generally increased with distance downstream except within deep reservoirs the deep reservoirs had the lower co2 eq emissions 2 co2 made the largest contribution to total co2 eq relative to ch4 and n2o and their emissions were mainly controlled by the hydraulic residence time of each individual reservoir 3 high ch4 emissions were observed in reservoirs that are formerly occupied the most upstream position in the cascade for the longest periods of time and were thus strongly related to the properties of the reservoir cascade 4 n2o emissions showed the clearest linear increase with distance downstream through the cascade and were strongly controlled by the water temperature gradient 5 with respect to the mitigation of ghg emissions from cascade

2155,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from reservoirs have received increasing attention in recent years despite extensive studies in single reservoirs ghg emission patterns in cascades of multiple reservoirs which are becoming increasingly common worldwide remain unknown this study investigated the spatial patterns of diffusive carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions as well as their total co2 equivalent co2 eq for a cascade hydropower system in the heavily dammed upper mekong river china results demonstrated that ghg emissions in cascade reservoirs were higher than that in the upstream channel since the accumulated sediments fueled microbes for ghg production in cascade reservoirs co2 made the largest contribution 58 6 84 8 to total co2 eq while the contribution of n2o was marginal deep reservoirs emitted less co2 which was attributed to higher co2 consumption by phytoplankton reservoirs formerly occupying the most upstream position for the longest period of time in the cascade emitted the most ch4 perhaps due to accumulations of river borne sediments the total co2 eq generally increased with distance downstream except within deep reservoirs these findings indicate that with respect to mitigating ghg emissions the deepest most upstream reservoir should be constructed first in the configuration of cascade hydropower reservoirs and less sediment will enter downstream reservoirs which have higher co2 eq emissions keywords upper mekong river dam methane carbon dioxide nitrous oxide data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as climate warms greenhouse gas ghg emissions from inland waters particularly from reservoirs have received widespread attentions deemer 2016 maavara 2019 global rivers are extensively dammed for the purposes of hydropower production and over 8 600 dams primarily designed for hydropower generation are in operation zarfl et al 2015 a cascade configuration i e a sequence of multiple

been built and 11 dams are under construction or are being planned fan et al 2015 kondolf et al 2014 the role of hydropower reservoirs as contributors to the emissions of ghgs such as carbon dioxide co 2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o however remains a topic of controversy barros 2011 deemer 2016 prairie 2017 rosa and schaeffer 1995 ghg emissions from reservoirs have the potential to counteract the environmental benefits of hydropower giles 2006 qiu 2009 santos et al 2006 it was estimated that global reservoirs emit 120 5 g co2 c m 2 year 1 43 8 g ch4 c m 2 year 1 and 0 1 g n2o n m 2 year 1 which contribute greatly to global budgets of anthropogenic ghg emissions bastviken et al 2011 deemer 2016 after river damming sediment accumulation supplies rich substrates nitrogen organic carbon to fuel microbes for ghg production creating hotspots of ghg emissions barros 2011 berberich et al 2020 maavara et al 2017 tranvik 2009 which have been extensively studied in single

as dam forebays fuels high ch4 emissions in the reservoir before being emitted to the atmosphere ghg concentrations may also change due to biogeochemical cycles along their pathway liang 2019 for example co2 can be consumed through photosynthetic uptake by phytoplankton van dam et al 2018 which is potentially controlled by hydraulic residence time since phytoplankton prefer to proliferate in reservoirs with long hydraulic residence time chen 2020 in a reservoir cascade the order of dam construction location and the physical properties hydraulic residence time etc of the constructed reservoirs may drive trends in ghg emission patterns by affecting sediment transport phytoplankton growth and biogeochemical cycling recently ebullitive emissions of ghg from cascade reservoirs have been documented liu 2020 however the spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions from cascade reservoirs and the driving factors remain unclear in this study we aim to explore spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions in particular we investigate the role of known drivers water and sediment properties hydraulic residence time reservoir age and water depth on diffusive ghg emissions from individual reservoirs and quantify the interacting impacts of parameters specifically associated with reservoir cascades including the spatial order and timing of construction of dams within a cascade

potential for hydropower production from 1993 through 2018 nine hydropower dams were built on the mainstream of the upper mekong river they are from upstream dahua r1 huangdeng r2 miaowei r3 gongguoqiao r4 xiaowan r5 manwan r6 dachaoshan r7 nuozhadu r8 and jinghong r9 creating a system of connected reservoirs along the river channel the basic information of the nine reservoirs is shown in fig 1 the heavily dammed upper mekong river provides a distinct case to investigate spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions 2 2 sample collection and analyses a field survey was carried out at 65 sites fig 1 along the upper mekong river in september 2018 to minimize the variations incurred by the timing of sampling the field survey at different sites was conducted synchronously by several workgroups at each site triplicate measurements of co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes across air water interfaces were made method described in section 2 3 while surface water 500 ml volume grab samples and bed sediment 50 g wet mass were sampled in triplicate bed sediment samples were collected with an ekman grab sampler zg0204 shanghai zigui instrument co ltd china completely homogenized after removing large debris stone tree branches etc and then kept frozen in liquid nitrogen due to the lack of bed sediment deposited immediately downstream of dams up to 5 km downstream of r1 r2 r3 r4 r6 and r7 59 sediment samples were collected in the field survey in total in the upstream channel sampling sediment water and ghgs was conducted on a bridge in each reservoir sampling water and ghgs at the site

corresponds to the wind speed at 10 m above the surface of the water m s 1 u 10 was obtained from the wind speed at 5 m above water surface by multiplying a factor of 1 06 jiang et al 2008 and the wind speed at 5 m above water surface was measured using a portable wind meter 16026 aice biotechnology co ltd hangzhou china at the time of sampling 4 k 600 5937 1 2 54 v 2 g d v s 0 89 d 0 58 where v is the flow velocity m s 1 d is the water depth m g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 s is the bed slope unitless the bed slop was calculated by using the bed elevation data which was

conservancy and hydrology automation institute china and a sounding rod geelii 5552 shanghai geelii co ltd china respectively surface water ghg concentrations were quantified via the headspace equilibration approach wang 2009 whitfield et al 2011 briefly water samples 20 ml were collected in pre evacuated 60 ml polypropylene syringes with three way stopcocks at 5 cm below the water surface after which a headspace was generated via adding 20 ml of ambient air into the syringe samples were then shaken for 2 min after which the headspace gas was injected into a 12 ml pre evacuated

were calculated by summing co2 eq of each ghg gas for the given time horizon davidson 2015 ipcc 2021 here we used the 100 year horizon values reported most recently by the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which are 27 2 and 273 for ch4 and n2o respectively ipcc 2021 since ch4 can produce higher radiative forcing than co2 a higher co2 eq will be generated when more organic carbon is mineralized to ch4 rather than co2 thus ch4 co2 was also calculated in this study according to holgerson and raymond holgerson and raymond 2016 2 5 microbial abundance analyses microbes associated with ghg production in sediments were quantified via qpcr most of microbes are responsible for co2 production during the degradation of organic matter and total bacterial 16s rdna was used as biomarker for analyzing microbial co2 production shi 2017 according to fernández baca et al fernández baca et al 2019 mcra was used as biomarker for microbes associated with ch4 production n2o is a nitrification and denitrification byproduct kuypers et al 2018 nitrifier amoa and denitrifiers nirs were used as biomarkers to quantify microbes associated with n2o production hou et al 2013 morales et al 2010 a fastdna power max soil dna isolation kit mp biomedical usa was used based on the provided instructions to isolate sediment dna which was then utilized for qpcr analyses conducted in an iq5 cycler instrument bio rad usa all qpcr reactions were conducted in a 20 μl total volume composed of 10 μl sybr premix ex taqtm toyobo japan 0 5 mm each of forward

plate the abundance value of the microbe corresponding to each ghg gas mi j were transformed to a ratio ai j relative to the largest abundance value among all the sampling sites using equation 6 then a microbe indicator bi for total ghg production at each sampling site was calculated by summing the ratios at this site using equation 7 6 a i j m i j m j max 7 b i j a i j where mi j is the abundance

2 6 statistical analysis spss v22 0 spss inc il usa was used in all statistical testing logarithmic transformation on the original data was conducted to improve data normality difference in ch4 fluxes between the upstream channel and the most downstream r9 reservoir was compared via t tests after data normality had been assessed by the kolmogorov smirnov and variance homogeneity tests p 0 05 was the significance threshold the correlation between ghg emissions and hydro environmental parameters was analyzed based on the simple linear regression after data normalization outliersin datasets are

of the upper mekong river range in hydraulic residence time from 0 01 to 2 36 years and in age from 1 to 25 years at the time of our field survey in 2018 fig 1c these reservoirs were neither built in order from upstream to downstream or vice versa fig 1b along the flow direction water temperature showed a general increasing trend from 12 5 in the upstream channel to 23 2 1 0 mean sd in the downstream reservoirs fig 2 a sediment organic carbon and total nitrogen rose from 11 2 2 9 mg g 1 mean sd and 0 20 0 01 mg g 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 20 3 2 5 mg g 1 mean sd and 1 25 0 12 mg g 1 mean sd in the most downstream r9 respectively fig 2b chl a was generally below 5 0 μg l 1 in the upper mekong river with peak values observed in the largest reservoirs of r5 and r8 chl a reached maximum values of 35 2 and 82 0 μg l 1 in r5 and r8 respectively fig 2c the abundance of microbes associated with ghg production showed generally an increasing trend along the upper mekong river the ghg microbe indicator increased from 0 43 0 05 mean sd in the upstream channel to 1 26 0 39 mean sd in the most downstream r9 fig 2d 3 2 diffusive ch4 co2 n2o fluxes along the flow direction co2 fluxes generally increased with distance downstream with outlier values at some sampling sites in r5 and r8 the co2 flux increased from 548 5 38 7 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 1328 3 369 7 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the most downstream r9 but was below 210 0 mg m 2 d 1 at some sampling sites in r5 and r8 fig 3 a the ch4 flux was below 1 5 mg m 2 d 1 in the upstream channel which was lower than in the downstream reservoirs t test p 0 05 the ch4 fluxes in downstream cascade reservoirs reached 1 0 12 2 mg m 2 d 1 with extreme values observed in r4 and r6 the ch4 fluxes reached maximum values of 8 7 and 12 2 mg m 2 d 1 in r4 and r6 respectively fig 3a ch4 co2 mass ratio indicated that there were extreme values in r4 r6 and r8 which were 0 022 0 027 and 0 014 respectively the remaining ch4 co2 values generally exhibited an increasing trend along the flow direction fig 3b similarly n2o fluxes also exhibited a consistent rising trend along the flow direction n2o fluxes increased from 0 015 0 001 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 0 032 0 001 mean sd mg m 2 d 1 in the most downstream r9 fig 3a total co2 eq emissions exhibited an increasing trend with outlier values in r5 and r8 which increased from 591 5 40 4 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the upstream channel to 1404 9 393 1 mg m 2 d 1 mean sd in the most downstream r9 while the outlier values were below 250 0 mg m 2 d 1 fig 3c compared with ch4 and n2o co2 has the largest contribution to the total co2 eq emissions which reached 84 7 9 3 mean sd ch4 and n2o contributed to 14 0 8 9 mean sd and 1 4 0 8 mean sd of total co2 eq emissions respectively fig 4 3 3 relations between diffusive ghg emissions and hydro environmental conditions the relations between diffusive ghg emissions and the hydro environmental factors were shown in the heatmap based on correlation analysis fig 5 the co2 was negatively correlated with chl a r 2 0 40 p 0 29 hydraulic residence time r 2 0 23 p 0 55 and water depth r 2 0 43 p 0 25 the ch4 was positively correlated with reservoir age r 2 0 62 p 0 08 but was negatively correlated with water depth r 2 0 24 p 0 54 the ch4 co2 ratio was positively correlated to phytoplankton r 2 0 38 p 0 32 and water depth r 2 0 08 p 0 83 n2o emissions showed a positive relationship with all these hydro environmental factors with the dominant influences of sediment tn r 2 0 81 p 0 01 and water temperature r 2 0 79 p 0 01 4 discussion rivers act as leaky pipes for terrestrial sediment transport to coastal waters cole 2007 after river damming the flow velocity decreases allowing suspended particles to settle in reservoirs providing substrates nitrogen organic carbon for microbial consumption and associated ghg production in reservoirs maeck 2013 as a result higher co2 ch4 and n2o emissions were detected in cascade reservoirs relative to the upstream channel fig 3a following the gradually intensified land use from upstream to downstream fig s1 the contents of organic carbon and nitrogen in sediments generally increased along the flow direction fig 2b concurrently water temperature increases gradually fig 2a due to the large decrease in elevation the flow direction from north towards south and the thermal accumulation in reservoirs ren et al 2020 which favors microbial proliferation in sediments with the presence of sufficient substrates microbes associated with ghg production methanogens nitrifiers and denitrifiers generally exhibited an increase from the upstream channel to cascade reservoirs fig 2d leading to the increasing trends of diffusive ghg emissions along the flow direction especially for n2o emissions fig 3a co2 was the dominant contributor to the total co2 eq emissions making the total co2 eq emissions exhibit similar spatial patterns to co2 along the river which generally increased along the flow direction except sharp decreases in the large reservoirs of r5 and r8 fig 3a co2 emissions were most strongly controlled by water depth and phytoplankton biomass which are interrelated and show inverse relationships with co2 emissions fig 5 large water depth often means high dam and hence big reservoirs with long hydraulic residence time after river damming riverine or lotic environments are converted to lentic habitat favoring phytoplankton proliferation especially evident in large reservoirs with long hydraulic residence times chen 2020 soballe and kimmel 1987 in the upper mekong river r5 and r8 are the two largest reservoirs with the hydraulic residence time over 1 8 years enabling the development of dense phytoplankton for consuming co2 fig 2c indicating the primary drivers of co2 emissions in the upper mekong river are controlled by the hydraulic properties of each individual reservoir ch4 was found to be positively correlated to reservoir age fig 5 however barros et al barros 2011 reported that ch4 emissions declined with reservoir age the different findings in this study could be because of strict biomass removal policies implemented in the flooded areas prior to reservoir impoundment in china shi 2017 therefore the emissions are not mainly dependent on initial organic matter stored in flooded areas but on reservoir primary production as well as the magnitude of subsequently accumulated sediment and substrate from influxes in particular the old reservoirs with larger age are mainly located in the downstream after mw reservoir in fig 1 where there are larger drainage areas as well as higher contents of organic carbon and nitrogen in runoff due to intensified land use fig s1 meanwhile ch4 emissions as well as their contributions to total co2 eq emissions are closely related to the historic location within the dam cascade high ch4 concentrations were observed in r4 and r6 which are formerly occupied the most upstream position in the cascade in reservoirs high deposition of suspended particles builds up thick potentially anoxic sediment layers which is favorable for ch4 production and thus a large fraction of organic carbon can be recycled as ch4 rather than co2 shi 2018 in the upper mekong river water turbidity decreased sharply after passing through the cascade dams fig s2 furthermore the sediment input of the most upstream reservoir is mainly from the headwater region due to the narrow drainage area along the upstream reach of this canyon river fig s1 r4 and r6 were the most upstream reservoirs for the longest time 26 and 7 years respectively fig 1c and received and subsequently deposited large amounts of sediments from the upstream region fig s2 potentially promoting anoxia in the deep bottom sediments and enabling high ch4 emissions accordingly ch4 emission peaks were observed after the dam fig 3a due to turbine degassing an important ghg emission pathway deemer 2016 since ch4 has a higher co2 eq value than co2 organic carbon mineralizing to ch4 rather than co2 result in greater warming effects therefore the elevated contribution of ch4 to total co2 eq emissions should receive attentions in future evaluation of global warming effects on dammed river systems particularly if a high sediment load is anticipated as in the most upstream reservoir in a cascade in the upper mekong additional long term monitoring should be continued in the current upstream most reservoir r1 which was built in the same year of the data collection and already showed elevated ch4 emissions fig 3a n2o showed the clearest relationship between distance downstream and emissions magnitude fig 3a n2o is a byproduct of nitrification and denitrification beaulieu 2011 ni et al 2011 su et al 2019 n2o emissions in the upper mekong dam cascade were positively correlated with all the environmental parameters tested but most strongly related to substrate availability and water temperature given the continuous nearly linear increase with distance through the cascade the n2o emissions are most strongly controlled by the north south upstream to downstream temperature gradient from high elevation to low elevation increases in water temperature along the flow direction enhances microbe mediated n2o production shi 2020 additionally nitrogen substrates and organic carbon often act as limiting factors of n2o emissions in aquatic systems gómez alday 2014 wang et al 2014 the additionally strong correlation with sediment tn which increases with distances downstream due to intensifying land use fig 2b suggests that n2o emissions are highly dependent on the available n substrate largely following the trends in ch4 emissions the ch4 co2 ratio increased gradually along the cascade reservoirs this is because thick bottom anoxic sediments in the reservoirs can make organic carbon mineralize more into ch4 than co2 causing high ch4 co2 ratio maeck 2013 according to the bathymetry survey in 2017 the depth of deposited sediment was on average about 15 20 m in the reservoirs the highest values of ch4 co2 ratio were observed in r4 and r6 which are formerly occupied the most upstream position in the cascade for the longest time the reason was similar to that of ch4 which had already been elaborated above the ch4 co2 ratio was found to be positively correlated to reservoir age fig 5 which could be attributed to the high positive correlation between ch4 and reservoir age these findings provide an important step forward in our understanding of ghg emissions during the development of cascade hydropower reservoirs our findings suggest that with respect to mitigating ghg emissions in canyon rivers the most upstream reservoir could be constructed first if possible and that it should ideally be deep in such cases the majority of organic matter will be trapped in the most upstream reservoir and less organic matter enters downstream reservoirs where it is favorable for co2 eq emissions fig 3c although the spatial patterns of ghgs were found to be mainly controlled by the order of dam construction location and reservoir physical properties in the reservoir cascade more field surveys are still needed in future to identify their seasonal variations recently studies have reported thatebullition makes an important contribution to ch4 emissions deemer 2016 liu 2020 particularly in shallow and organic rich reservoirs in this study we did not measure the ebullition flux but focused on diffusive emissions some information about ebullition of ch4 from cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong river can be found in liu et al liu 2020 5 conclusions recently ghg emissions from hydropower reservoirs have received considerable attention in this study we investigated the spatial patterns of diffusive ghg emissions in the heavily dammed upper mekong river our main conclusions are 1 the total co2 eq emissions in each reservoir generally increased with distance downstream except within deep reservoirs the deep reservoirs had the lower co2 eq emissions 2 co2 made the largest contribution to total co2 eq relative to ch4 and n2o and their emissions were mainly controlled by the hydraulic residence time of each individual reservoir 3 high ch4 emissions were observed in reservoirs that are formerly occupied the most upstream position in the cascade for the longest periods of time and were thus strongly related to the properties of the reservoir cascade 4 n2o emissions showed the clearest linear increase with distance downstream through the cascade and were strongly controlled by the water temperature gradient 5 with respect to the mitigation of ghg emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs the most upstream reservoir is suggested to be constructed first credit authorship contribution statement wenqing shi investigation methodology funding acquisition writing

that can have exceptionally high impacts on ecosystem level fluxes bernhardt et al 2017a a significant challenge has been to understand how fluvial ecosystems streams rivers floodplains wetlands and

elemental cycles 2 ecosystems 3 watersheds 4 scales and 5 disciplines we conclude with a section on dr bernhardt s impact on the hydrologic sciences and beyond through her exceptional dedication to mentorship engagement and service 2 major contributions to the hydrologic sciences 2 1 elemental cycles the bedrock of dr bernhardt s research program is understanding interactions among elemental cycles and how hydrologic connectivity changes those interactions she began her career studying how carbon inputs control nitrogen dynamics in stream ecosystems of the hubbard brook experimental forest hbef her ph d research was some of the first to experimentally enrich whole streams with dissolved organic carbon illustrating how carbon availability can control the capacity of streams to uptake and remove nitrogen bernhardt and likens 2002 these findings and her subsequent analyses of whole stream estimates of nitrification and nitrate uptake across hbef streams changed our understanding of how carbon transport from soils to streams controls in stream nitrogen dynamics prior to watershed export bernhardt et al 2003 bernhardt et al 2002 dr bernhardt leveraged a natural experiment an ice storm that created a major forest disturbance to solidify our understanding of the role of soil stream hydrologic connectivity in linked carbon nitrogen cycling in streams she found that though disturbance caused by the ice storm increased nitrate inputs to hbef streams the impact was mediated by simultaneous increases in carbon and woody debris inputs and greater light availability from tree damage leading to elevated carbon breakdown and in stream algal production respectively these in stream alterations after the storm increased aquatic inorganic nitrogen processing substantially offsetting the increased transport of nitrate from soils to streams such that without in stream processing export of nitrate from damaged watersheds would have been 80 140 higher than observed bernhardt et al 2003 as she often has done in her career dr bernhardt took this localized phenomenon one storm in one year and expanded it to a much larger synthesis she led the analysis of 40 years of stream water chemistry data from hbef to uncover the role of in stream processing in declines in watershed nitrogen exports and unequivocally illustrated with empirical data the importance of in stream nitrogen uptake and removal for watershed nutrient budgets bernhardt et al 2005a over her career dr bernhardt has continued to address how watershed stream and carbon nitrogen interactions can influence in stream nitrogen retention and watershed export including the role of dissolved organic nitrogen and organic matter quality in walker branch tn lutz et al 2011 lutz et al 2012 recovery from acid rain marinos et al 2018 and diurnal patterns of nitrate uptake related to photosynthesis chamberlin et al 2019 dr bernhardt continues to lead and collaborate with drs gene likens emma rosi john campbell and lindsey rustad to maintain the long term rain and stream chemistry record at hbef e g likens et al 2021 with ongoing research focused on acid rain legacies and climate change effects dr bernhardt s research program also uses linked elemental cycles and hydrologic patterns to understand aquatic ecosystem energetics from empirical carter et al 2021 modeling reinhold et al 2019 and data synthesis helton et al 2015 perspectives her work in this area considers how redox conditions control linked elemental cycles driven by the interplay between hydrologic and biogeochemical dynamics in aquatic ecosystems for example in seasonally flowing rivers water flow controls the supply of oxygen which interacts with energetic processes leading to hypoxia and altered elemental cycles carter et al 2021 indeed extensive data analysis across aquatic ecosystems has demonstrated emergent relationships between inorganic nitrogen and carbon that varied among ecosystem types with oxygenated flowing waters more likely to be controlled by stoichiometric constraints while lower oxygen and lentic waters tend to be regulated by redox constraints helton et al 2015 fig 2 this work informs how underlying hydrologic and biogeochemical mechanisms interact to control emergent water chemistry patterns including hypoxia and nutrient enrichment across aquatic ecosystems nearly all the research we highlight in the sections below also addresses multiple elemental cycles dr bernhardt s research directly explores how connections among elemental cycles control the response of coastal wetlands to saltwater intrusion see section 2 2 the relationship of water chemistry to urban land use patterns see section 2 3 1 and the effects of mountaintop removal mining on stream ecosystems see sections 2 3 2 and 2 5 3 a paper that includes only a single element is indeed rare across dr bernhardt s career 2 2 ecosystems dr bernhardt s early research on carbon nitrogen interactions in stream ecosystems centered on hydrologic connectivity from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems she addressed how the interplay of carbon and nitrogen delivery to and processing within streams resulted in patterns of watershed nutrient export see section 2 1 above dr bernhardt s work has continued to demonstrate how hydrologically mediated terrestrial carbon inputs to streams can control in stream elemental cycling for example the organic carbon subsidy delivered by autumn litterfall can drive high heterotrophic nitrate demand and nitrogen limitation covino et al 2018 more broadly dr bernhardt s research explicitly addresses ecosystem boundaries e g aquatic terrestrial freshwater saline oxic anoxic and the role of hydrologic transport in controlling the movement of materials across and processing within those ecosystem interfaces box 1 in this section we use dr bernhardt s extensive research in coastal wetlands to highlight her work on how hydrologic and chemical interfaces influence ecosystem dynamics more than a decade of scientific advancement on ecosystem interfaces has come from dr bernhardt s work in the coastal plain of north carolina her work began at the timberlake observatory for wetland restoration tower one of the largest wetland restoration projects in the u s fig 3 in 2005 dr bernhardt was contacted by a group of private investors who were working on a large scale wetland restoration project in the coastal plain of north carolina at the time the wetland area of the project was the largest wetland restoration project east of the mississippi river the investors were also interested in restoring sections of a stream within the wetland and they contacted dr bernhardt because of her expertise and role in the national river restoration science synthesis nrrss bernhardt et al 2005 see section 2 4 1 below the regulatory agencies u s army corps of engineers u s environmental protection agency and the north carolina division of environmental quality were requiring the investors to engage in large scale excavation and earth movement to create a sinuous stream channel which the investors believed did not reflect natural stream conditions in the area dr bernhardt in collaboration with dr martin doyle partnered with the investors to start a research project to examine how to determine the extent of stream restoration in this landscape the restoration of tower included restoring previously drained and farmed wetlands by constructing a stream channel filling shallow ditches removing large pumps to reconnect the site hydrologically and planting 750 000 trees with funding from the private investors the initial research goal was to monitor the restoration of ecosystem services primarily nutrient retention offered by a large scale wetland mitigation bank and included developing a hydrologic monitoring site which is still operating today in collaboration with dr marcelo ardón a key underpinning of the early research at tower was the importance of hydrologic connectivity for both the success of wetland restoration and moderating the ecosystem services that restored wetlands provide ardón et al 2010a ardón et al 2010b helton et al 2014 morse et al 2012a morse et al 2012b hydrologic restoration of this large wetland complex showed that the site was effective at retaining nitrogen from an upstream farm ardón et al 2010a but released phosphorus after initial reflooding ardón et al 2017 ardón et al 2010b greenhouse gas emissions from the site were lower than those from nearby agricultural fields and mature wetlands findings which contribute to the debate on the emissions consequences of wetland restoration for nutrient retention morse et al 2012a morse et al 2012b the work helped inform stream restoration in north carolina as well as national debates on what is a stream doyle and bernhardt 2011 dr bernhardt collaborated with north carolina state regulators to revise their requirements for stream restoration to more fully consider natural landscape dynamics of stream wetland complexes across the relatively flat coastal plain the early studies of nutrient retention at tower led to the inadvertent discovery of elevated salinity on the site and subsequent expansion of dr bernhardt s research program to investigate the simultaneous controls of hydrology and salinity on wetland biogeochemistry at the interface of fresh and saline ecosystems during the first two years of monitoring a major drought led to saltwater incursion the landward movement of seawater through surface waters inviting investigations at the interface of fresh and saltwater in historically freshwater wetlands drought induced saltwater incursion caused the site to release substantial nitrogen from agricultural legacies ardón et al 2017 ardón et al 2013 increased sulfate and sea salts changed greenhouse gas emissions from the wetland soils but the direction and magnitude depended on antecedent hydrologic conditions ardón et al 2018 helton et al 2019 helton et al 2014 dr bernhardt s work contributed to the growing body of literature and the framework for understanding and evaluating the chemical ecological and social implications of climate change induced salinization tully et al 2019 the changes observed at tower and the growing recognition of the potential ecological implications of saltwater intrusion supported the expansion of the research to a broader area of the albemarle pamlico peninsula bhattachan et al 2018 ury et al 2020 and the southeastern coastal plain white et al 2022 and to incorporate additional interdisciplinary approaches to understand ecosystem dynamics at the saline freshwater interface specifically in microbial and plant community ecology see sections 2 4 and 2 5 for additional examples of dr bernhardt s work across scales and disciplines respectively the saline freshwater interface merges distinct microbiomes in a phenomenon known as community coalescence when freshwater and marine waters were experimentally mixed rocca et al 2020 found that marine microorganisms dominated the microbial community with a substantial emergence of rare microbial taxa these findings led to advances in theory and application of community coalescence to engineered biological systems rocca et al 2021 the movement of the saline freshwater interface also alters plant communities dr bernhardt s team found a decline in tree biomass particularly near the transition between herbaceous marsh and forested wetland along with declines in woody and sensitive herbaceous taxa linked to indicators of salinization low elevation high soil salt content anderson et al 2022 ury et al 2020 plant community changes manifest at the landscape scale leading to significant declines in coastal forested wetland and the emergence of ghost forests a transitional ecosystem characterized by standing dead trees ury et al 2021 white et al 2022 dr bernhardt is currently expanding her interdisciplinary work at the freshwater marine interface as a leader along with remote sensing scientist dr xi yang on the swislr saltwater intrusion and sea level rise research coordination network a broad effort to synthesize understand and share knowledge about social and environmental change in rural coastal plain landscapes 2 3 watersheds dr bernhardt began her research career as a phd student working in systems where the classic small watershed approach was developed bormann and likens 1967 see section 2 1 above based on the concept that stream dynamics reflect watershed controls and thus in stream nutrient dynamics could be used to infer watershed scale processes as a postdoctoral researcher dr bernhardt transitioned to research on stream restoration bernhardt et al 2005b see section 2 4 1 below in the field of stream restoration at the time beneficial outcomes were often expected from reach scale management interventions without explicit consideration of upstream catchment conditions dr bernhardt s subsequent research focused on disentangling reach versus catchment scale controls and she extended the small watershed approach to understand how human changes to the landscape influence stream hydrology and biogeochemistry here we highlight her work on the effects of watershed urbanization and mountaintop removal mining on receiving streams 2 3 1 urbanization dr bernhardt s early synthesis work bernhardt et al 2005 see section 2 4 1 below and subsequent empirical research sudduth et al 2011 violin et al 2011 suggested that watershed scale degradation typically outweighed the benefits of reach scale restoration efforts in an individual stream indeed with some limited exceptions her research found that restored urban stream reaches differ little from un restored urban stream reaches in biodiversity and ecosystem function and that stream organisms do not recover from the impacts of urbanization without catchment level efforts to reduce storm flows and chemical loading sudduth et al 2011 violin et al 2011 across the north carolina piedmont catchment urbanization had consistently greater effects than reach scale variables and resulted in 1 higher baseflow temperatures and temperature variability somers et al 2013 2 significant increases in temperature with stormflow 3 increases in nitrate bioavailable and algal derived organic carbon and metals including lead cadmium and zinc hassett et al 2018 4 loss of macroinvertebrate biodiversity 5 increases in certain ecosystem functions including substrate induced respiration carbon mineralization and denitrification enzyme activity and 6 alterations to the microbial community structure simonin et al 2019 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2011 further through a longitudinal investigation of temperature to examine how far the signal of urban stressors travels from its source somers et al 2016 found that the urban heat signal 1 c was still observable at distances 1 km downstream from urban sources through a forested area illustrating the limits of mitigating such a signal using a reach scale approach and highlighting the upstream downstream hydrologic connectivity between urban land and receiving waters developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of urban land use on downstream aquatic ecosystems requires an understanding of not only the land use composition of watersheds but also the connectivity and configuration of land cover types that alter hydrologic flow paths in collaboration with landscape ecologist dr dean urban dr bernhardt s research addressed this challenge by quantifying how attributes of urban development configuration and connectivity explain variation in the chemical regimes of urban streams in watersheds with similar proportions of urban land cover but variable development configurations she found that higher densities of engineered hydrologic flow paths e g roads and subsurface stormwater piping increase not only the temporal variability in the chemical composition and concentrations of solutes in urban streams blaszczak et al 2019b but also stream macroinvertebrate heavy metal body burdens baruch et al 2018 when whole stream ecosystem function was investigated in a subset of the watersheds spanning the widest gradient in hydrologic flashiness physical flow disturbances decreased the strength of the relationship between light and productivity in streams additionally geomorphic changes in stream channels led to a wide range in stream dissolved oxygen regimes ranging from frequent hypoxia to near constant saturation blaszczak et al 2019a collectively dr bernhardt s work linking watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry to principles from landscape ecology demonstrates the importance of understanding hydrologic connectivity between streams and urban features when predicting the potential influence of urbanization on downstream waters delesantro et al 2021 2 3 2 mountaintop removal coal mining while much of her research centers on how humans alter the land surface a major thread of dr bernhardt s work has addressed a much deeper impact to the earth s surface mountaintop mining with valley fills mtm vf has dramatically altered the topography subsurface structure and overall shape of 6000 km2 of land in central appalachia ross et al 2016 mtm vf is a destructive form of surface mining used in steep appalachian terrain to access shallow coal seams by removing trees soil and overlying bedrock excess rock from these operations is dumped into nearby valleys filling them up with highly fractured bedrock after mining these landscapes shift from having 2 meter deep soil profiles to having highly chemically reactive overburden piles that can be hundreds of meters deep ross et al 2016 though these overburden piles contain ample pyrite which typically causes acid mine drainage there is more than enough calcareous bedrock to neutralize the acidity generated by pyrite leading to alkaline mine drainage characterized by high ph 8 and elevated solute concentration lindberg et al 2011 dr bernhardt s research on the effects of mtm vf began along the upper mud river and its tributaries in west virginia within one of the largest surface mining operations in appalachia dr bernhardt accessed stream sampling locations via public roads and the last remaining private property within the heavily mined watershed the west virginia state supreme court ruled in 2004 that ownership of the property remain with the caudill miller family who had lived on that property for generations despite the attempt to take the property through eminent domain ark land co 2004 building relationships and working closely with the miller family was instrumental in understanding the history of the watershed and the sociopolitical context of the area gaining access to important sampling locations providing short term housing during field campaigns and contextualizing the effects of mtm vf on local communities most of dr bernhardt s research group even attended a large miller family gathering and helped with a potato harvest during one of the group s large field sampling campaigns dr bernhardt was particularly interested in how major physical changes in mined watersheds alter the chemical composition and hydrology of downstream reaches throughout the region while the immediate downstream consequences of alkaline mine drainage from mtm vf were well known dr bernhardt s research expanded both the spatial and temporal scales of mtm vf impacts studying how numerous mining operations impact regional hydrology stream water chemistry and stream biota initial work in the upper mud river found that both active and reclaimed mines export high concentrations of inorganic solutes that accumulate downstream as more mined tributaries contributed their flow to the mainstem lindberg et al 2011 a subsequent regional analysis across 223 watersheds in southwest west virginia confirmed that this pattern in the upper mud river was quite common regionally with percent mining in the upstream catchment explaining half the variation in stream water conductivity across sites bernhardt et al 2012 follow on work highlighted that the volume of bedrock material disturbed by mining could more directly predict variation in water quality ross et al 2016 and that mined watersheds have a much higher capacity to store rainfall which contributes to higher baseflows that deliver elevated solute loads during dry periods nippgen et al 2017 cumulatively these physicochemical changes depress aquatic insect diversity and production during summer months voss and bernhardt 2017 dr bernhardt s study of alkaline mine drainage in the upper mud river emphasizes her overarching view that elemental cycles are connected and therefore must be studied in concert rather than in isolation for example disproportionately high weathering rates of carbonate minerals by sulfuric acid result not only in increased sulfate exports which must be balanced by bicarbonate and base cation export but also in net geologic carbon dioxide release ross et al 2018 furthermore residues from explosives used in mtm vf operations also enhance nitrate export from watersheds a feature that persists even when active mining ceases because newly exposed rock continues to act as a nitrate source brooks et al 2019 dr bernhardt s most recent work on this topic reveals that the cumulative changes from mining i e deepened critical zone disrupted geomorphology altered vegetation lead to long term 30 year changes in watershed and ecosystem function ross et al 2021 dr bernhardt s research on environmental impacts of coal mining overlaps with and merges multiple disciplinary areas detailed below in section 2 5 3 2 4 scales dr bernhardt s research includes many examples of expanding site specific observations to address regional scale phenomena e g see above sections 2 2 saltwater intrusion from wetland scale to the coastal plain and 2 3 2 mtm vf implications from a single mined watershed to central appalachia in this section we focus specifically on her efforts to synthesize numerous and often disparate datasets collected at the local scale to inform research at the continental to global scales in the areas of stream restoration and stream metabolism as part of these efforts dr bernhardt has led the development of open access databases to enable research and standardize analysis for the whole scientific community box 2 expanding her impact beyond the studies conducted in her lab and the sites where her research group has worked 2 4 1 stream restoration stream restoration transitioned from volunteer efforts and scientific experimentation to big business during the 1990s by the early 2000s freshwater scientists sought to understand what was being done in the name of stream restoration and its efficacy drs margaret palmer and j david allen proposed the national river restoration science synthesis nrrss as a working group at the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis nceas in 2002 the funded project hired dr bernhardt as a postdoctoral associate to lead the efforts the initial goal was to collect national datasets of stream restoration projects and their monitoring data to complete a meta analysis of these data and to draw conclusions about the ecological efficacy of the work to date as the project progressed the team quickly discovered that most data about stream restoration were managed only locally frequently without any digitization and that many projects nationwide either were not being monitored or did not have publicly available data relevant to the proposed analysis ultimately nrrss transformed into a data gathering and assembling project creating the first nationwide database of stream restoration projects in the u s managed by the now discontinued national biological information infrastructure program while some data were merged from existing databases most of the data were collected manually by a team of graduate students directly mentored by dr bernhardt who was responsible for weekly coordination of this nationwide group of students the initial analysis of the database was published in bernhardt et al 2005b and revealed that although an astonishing 1 billion per year was spent on stream restoration projects in the u s there was a ubiquitous lack of tracking and evaluation of project actions and outcomes that finding led to a number of highly influential papers that evaluated stream restoration practices and projects e g bernhardt and palmer 2011 bernhardt and palmer 2007 palmer et al 2010 including recommendations for a new set of standards for ecologically successful river restoration palmer et al 2005 the lack of access to monitoring data and the lack of any monitoring in many cases was one of the more important discoveries reported in bernhardt et al 2005b a mismatch between the most commonly stated restoration project goals and the types of practices being performed to reach those goals was also noted as was the lack of any stated goals for some projects in general little information was publicly available about many of these projects this led the working group to turn to a survey of restoration practitioners to better understand the nature of their projects including planning and motivation and to learn about monitoring and goals omitted from publicly available documents dr bernhardt again coordinated the team of graduate students in completing these phone surveys with practitioners and assembling the data into a single database for analysis the results of these efforts identified common mismatches between stated project goals and post project monitoring bernhardt et al 2007 practitioners generally were dissatisfied with their own monitoring but lacked the resources to complete the monitoring themselves suggesting a need for funders to include support for monitoring in addition to other project costs additionally each region of the country had a graduate student led paper written with dr bernhardt s support in analyzing both databases to better examine local patterns and trends most were published alongside bernhardt et al 2007 in a special issue of restoration ecology bernhardt et al 2007 follstad shah et al 2007 hassett et al 2007 katz et al 2007 o donnell and galat 2007 sudduth et al 2007 since then much research has highlighted and worked to address the persistent gap between the promise and realities of restoration practices craig et al 2008 findings show that projects like decommissioning a dam or restoration designs with specific goals in mind yield more ecologically beneficial outcomes doyle et al 2008 ross et al 2015 2 4 2 stream metabolism although the earliest studies of daily ecosystem energetics were conducted in streams and rivers odum 1956 most subsequent studies over the past few decades have occurred in other ecosystem types when studies did measure energetics in streams they typically studied single locations over short time periods primarily due to cost time and technological constraints of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in streams at high resolution for extended periods of time consequently streams and rivers unlike terrestrial ecosystems lack defined biomes that allow ecosystem ecologists to generalize patterns in energetics for integration into global cycles furthermore the components of metabolism gross primary production and ecosystem respiration tend to be uncoupled from each other and more variable in streams than in terrestrial ecosystems dr bernhardt hypothesized that these differences arise because unlike terrestrial ecosystems in rivers 1 seasonal variations in light and temperature are often uncorrelated because of canopy cover sediment loads or colored organic matter 2 frequent high flow events or drying events reduce autotrophic biomass and 3 substantial energetic subsidies from terrestrial systems e g detritus dissolved organic matter are received from the draining watershed at amounts matching or exceeding in stream gross primary production bernhardt et al 2018 fig 4 a dr bernhardt challenged the field to leverage growing datasets of long term dissolved oxygen records to uncover drivers of stream metabolic regimes she found that estimating stream metabolism for one or a few days provides little information about the energetics of rivers where frequent hydrologic disturbances and highly variable light regimes lead to high temporal variation in stream metabolism bernhardt et al 2018 consequently dr bernhardt was one of the leaders of the first continental scale effort to model stream metabolism an effort that estimated gross primary production and ecosystem respiration rates for 365 u s rivers ranging from 61 days to 9 years per site appling et al 2018b see also box 2 she has subsequently contributed to our understanding of how rivers group into distinct metabolic regimes savoy et al 2019 and used this to scale metabolic processes from stream reaches to entire river networks koenig et al 2019 dr bernhardt s recent work culminated in a comprehensive analysis of annual stream metabolism patterns and drivers across 222 rivers with near continuous records of dissolved oxygen concentration for one or more years bernhardt et al 2022 this work dramatically expanded our understanding of riverine metabolic regimes at the continental scale bernhardt et al 2022 found that annual light availability and flow stability are the primary controls on the timing and magnitude of river metabolic regimes which contrasts with terrestrial ecosystems where metabolic variability is primarily driven by temperature and precipitation rivers also tend to respire far more carbon than they fix and have less pronounced seasonality in their metabolic regimes than their terrestrial counterparts bernhardt et al 2022 used their analysis to propose a classification schema for ecosystem metabolism in rivers fig 4b ranging from bright and stable rivers that are highly productive to dark and stormy rivers where both autotrophy and heterotrophy are constrained by light and hydrologic disturbances by linking these regimes to watershed characteristics as well as management activities bernhardt et al 2022 provided a template for advancing scientific understanding and scaling of riverine processes as well as insights for managing rivers toward desired metabolic regimes 2 5 disciplines complex environmental challenges from local to global scales cannot be solved within disciplinary silos weathers et al 2016 indeed interdisciplinary research and its impacts have increased over recent decades leahey and barringer 2020 okamura 2019 dr bernhardt commonly bridges disciplinary boundaries in her research program here we focus on her work specifically bridging and integrating ecotoxicology and microbial ecology with the hydrologic sciences though the interdisciplinarity of dr bernhardt s research program is interwoven throughout many of the sections above in this section we provide specific examples of dr bernhardt s leadership and collaboration within groups that advance interdisciplinary research in the hydrologic sciences 2 5 1 ecological impacts of nanomaterials and emerging contaminants for a decade dr bernhardt was the ecosystem research theme leader for the center for the environmental implications of nanotechnology ceint which performed fundamental research on the behavior of nano scale materials in the laboratory and complex ecosystems the center formed in 2008 included scientists from many disciplinary perspectives including chemistry engineering toxicology ecology and public policy although at the time little was known about the fate and transport of engineered nanoparticles there was a growing concern about the potential for adverse unintended environmental consequences resulting from their widespread release to natural systems from ceint s inception dr bernhardt advocated to apply an ecological perspective to the ecotoxicological framework being used to assess the environmental impacts of these emerging contaminants bernhardt et al 2010 written in collaboration with ecologists a nanogeoscientist and a toxicologist bernhardt et al 2010 considered the potentially parallel behavior of naturally occurring nanoparticles long studied in the soil sciences and historical analogs like pesticides as well as known biological impacts of nanomaterials derived from toxicological research they found that of the nearly 100 000 articles on nanomaterials published before 2009 only 150 included a reference to the environment or ecology rather the vast majority of nanomaterials impact research had been conducted in controlled laboratory experiments with single model organisms or cell cultures in simple media exposed to high concentrations bernhardt et al 2010 called on the scientific community to examine the effects of engineered nanoparticles on a diversity of organisms and their fate and transport in real environmental media and under field relevant conditions recognizing that advancing the science of the impact of nanomaterials on the environment would require substantial interdisciplinary collaboration since then nanomaterials impact research has increased dramatically using a search of the scientific literature similar to bernhardt et al 2010 we found papers that included the key words ecosystem and nanomaterials increased 15 fold over the last 12 years from 59 published in 2009 to 894 published in 2022 based on a scopus search of title abstract and keyword for nanomaterial or nanoparticle and ecosys dr bernhardt s own subsequent experimental research demonstrated how realistic low level chronic release of several widely used nanoparticles can be rapidly transformed in aquatic habitats and cause ecosystem level effects colman et al 2018 colman et al 2014 such as the intensification of eutrophication in wetlands perrotta et al 2020 simonin et al 2018 following her research on nanoparticles dr bernhardt continued her focus on understanding the impacts of emerging contaminants by leading a synthesis paper in which she addressed how rates of synthetic chemical production and diversification have outpaced other agents of global change e g carbon dioxide production nutrient pollution and biodiversity loss that are better recognized funded and studied bernhardt et al 2017b the paper calls for better consideration of contaminants as both independent and interacting global change drivers and recognizes that under consideration of synthetic chemicals has resulted in blind spots that hinder the success of global ecological science with over 450 citations within five years of publication the paper has already motivated and enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration 2 5 2 microbiomes and ecosystem function how and when microorganisms constrain ecosystem processes are critical knowledge gaps at the interface of microbiology and ecology in aquatic ecosystems these questions are even more complex as ecological function is also constrained by hydrologic transport and storage box 1 dr bernhardt has cultivated a strong connection with microbial ecology in her research program and has worked to advance interdisciplinary understanding of microbiomes within the context of ecosystem ecology in 2012 she participated in a usgs john wesley powell center working group next generation of ecological indicators the working group included experts in microbiology microbial ecology molecular biology biogeochemistry and ecosystem ecology and had an overarching goal to identify key microbial indicators of fundamental ecological processes first through literature synthesis the group identified prevalent assumptions that microbiome structure and ecosystem processes are connected but discovered major challenges to whether and how that link is specifically tested bier et al 2015a to push for an improved mechanistic and causal understanding they ultimately proposed a fundamental framework to explicitly link microbiome community attribute data with system level processes hall et al 2018 this approach relies on hierarchically partitioning ecosystem processes until a sub process connects with a specific microbial metabolic pathway determining controls and constraints for the sub process and then investigating influential microbiome characteristics dr bernhardt subsequently applied this guidance to her research one such field study noted that thermodynamic expectations microbial pathways based on terminal electron donor and acceptor availability did not exclusively explain relationships between subsidies stressors and microbial taxonomic and functional diversity in mining impacted streams bier et al 2020 dr bernhardt s team further explored how disturbances mining urbanization and stream connectivity freshwater marine interfaces shaped aquatic microbiomes bier et al 2015b rocca et al 2020 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2011 this work also prompted the discovery of microbial taxa indicative of factors associated with stream urbanization simonin et al 2019 and mtm vf in both sediments and the water column jin et al 2022 simonin et al 2021 2 5 3 ecological impacts of mining an early and long lasting example of cross disciplinary research is dr bernhardt s focus on the hydrological ecological and ecotoxicological impacts of the coal life cycle from mountaintop removal mining valley fill mtm vf extraction practices to the post combustion coal ash waste stream on freshwater ecosystems fig 5 see also section 2 3 2 above disturbing large volumes of bedrock via mtm vf operations directly mobilizes large amounts of complex mixtures of contaminants lindberg et al 2011 ross et al 2016 that can have cascading implications for stream organisms communities and ecosystems dr bernardt s team found that this contaminant loading is associated with shifts in functional genes including depressed nitrogenase and methanogen genes and elevated selenate reductase genes bier et al 2020 bier et al 2015 these changes in gene expression reflect and contribute to shifts in macronutrients of mtm vf impacted streams but also demonstrate microbial gatekeeping on selenium availability to other trophic levels selenium concentrations were elevated in stream biofilms stream macroinvertebrates and riparian consumers in mtm vf affected streams arnold et al 2017 naslund et al 2021 naslund et al 2020 potentially posing toxicological risks to egg laying organisms selenium levels were also elevated in fish from lakes receiving coal combustion waste with levels comparable to those measured during historic fish extirpation events as a consequence of the legacy left from this historic deposition of coal combustion residues these conditions will likely be sustained for many years in the future brandt et al 2017 ultimately dr bernhadt and her team found that extensive coal surface mining could be responsible for the extirpation of 40 of stream biodiversity simonin et al 2021 dr bernhardt s research program impressively worked in parallel across disciplines to quantify hydrologic and geochemical changes caused by mining and to disentangle how these changes affected microbial community and ecosystem level dynamics fig 5 dr bernhardt recognized the importance of interactions among contaminants expanding her research program to consider multi element ecotoxicological effects brandt et al 2019 reported the coupled trophic transfer of coal ash derived elements in recipient food webs and highlighted the importance of considering mixtures in the context of toxicological risks for exposed organisms this led dr bernhardt to explore interactions between selenium and mercury in aquatic ecosystems and aquatic organisms gerson et al 2021 gerson et al 2020a including a critical assessment of the assumptions regarding selenium mercury interactions and whether these were well supported in the literature or required more thorough study gerson et al 2020b similarly to her other work these cross disciplinary studies on selenium and mercury challenged the field to think holistically about linked elemental cycling within aquatic ecosystems with important implications for environmental management and public health dr bernhardt s research to understand how landscape change affects contaminant fate and impact also extends internationally the expanding footprint of artisanal gold mining in the peruvian amazon is impacting the region through the use and release of mercury through this work dr bernhardt s team discovered that expansion of mining ponds and release of mercury collectively lead to increased microbial production of methylmercury a form of mercury generated in anaerobic environments that is more bioavailable and therefore more problematic in its toxicity gerson et al 2020c this project also investigated terrestrial and aquatic linkages finding that intact old growth forests in the amazon are important for intercepting mercury preventing it from reaching aquatic environments where it can be more readily converted into methylmercury gerson et al 2022a 3 engagement service and mentorship the bulk of this paper focuses on dr bernhardt s many impactful research contributions but we consider her phenomenal professional contributions outside of research equally important to highlight dr bernhardt approaches engagement service and mentorship with the same enthusiasm dedication and creativity with which she approaches her science her service and engagement contributions are so many and so broad that we cannot list them all here instead we focus below on some examples that are particularly relevant to the hydrologic sciences and exemplify dr bernhardt s approach to engagement and service of the many mentees that have been part of dr bernhardt s research group the vast majority continue to work as professionals in areas related to their research with dr bernhardt and many continue to be mentored by dr bernhardt long after their official tenures with her research group now that we co authors have increasingly more professional and personal responsibilities ourselves we more deeply appreciate dr bernhardt s consistent focus on mentorship and dedication to engagement and service within and beyond the scientific community 3 1 engagement and service dr bernhardt has served extensively in leadership roles for her university and for many professional societies notably her recent term as the president of the society for freshwater science and current role as president elect for the biogeosciences section of the american geophysical union she has served on numerous federal panels working groups and steering committees including current service on the board of directors and as chair of the science advisory committee for the cary institute of ecosystem studies and as a member of the science and technical advisory committee for the national ecological observatory network notable past positions include serving on the science advisory board panel for the review of the u s epa water body connectivity report and on the national academy of sciences committee on challenges and opportunities in the hydrologic sciences national research council 2012 dr bernhardt played a pivotal role as a scientific expert of the unep scientific and technical advisory panel s report on contaminant management katima and leonard 2020 where she merged perspectives on hydrology and ecosystem ecology to inform an international understanding of contaminants and the impacts they have on wildlife that she is sought out to serve in such a variety of roles and organizations reflects her talent at consensus building cross disciplinary synthesis and creative forward thinking dr bernhardt is also committed to engaging policy makers decision makers and the broader community about her own research findings her work has been influential in policy decisions ranging from mountaintop removal mining to urban stream restoration here are a few examples that reflect the impact of dr bernhardt s engagement activities dr bernhardt built and maintains long standing pro bono consulting relationships with the great dismal swamp mitigation bank southern environmental law center and appalachian center for the economy and the environment co authored a white paper on mtm vf consequences provided to the white house council on environmental quality office of the u s epa director u s senate during senate testimony by dr palmer palmer and bernhardt 2009 participated in a congressional staff briefing on the environmental impacts of surface coal mining in appalachia and gave expert testimony for four cases related to mtm vf operations e g civil action no 3 12 0785 collaborated with the u s army corps of engineers to change their requirements for stream restoration in the coastal plain of north carolina to more fully consider natural landscape dynamics of stream wetland complexes across the relatively flat coastal plain communicated her findings on artisanal gold mining with local stakeholders through the publication of research briefs translated into spanish and shared with local government officials and conservation organizations gerson et al 2020d gerson et al 2022b 3 2 mentorship dr bernhardt has mentored nearly 70 students technicians and postdoctoral associates in the last 18 years the majority of her 50 most recent papers were led by students and only five do not include at least one student author from her research group dr bernhardt s mentees have gone on to be leaders in academia governmental agencies and industry dr bernhardt s mentorship extends well beyond members of her own research group for example students in her biogeochemistry course also routinely publish papers from an assignment in which they learn how to synthesize data and ideas from the scientific literature e g carmichael et al 2014 cha et al 2013 lee et al 2017 singh et al 2016 sudduth et al 2013 she also mentors students through university e g bass connections data plus and environmental impact fellowship program at duke university and society e g esa seeds programs and over her career has also directly mentored nine professional master s students and 16 undergraduate honors students as well as many undergraduate research technicians dr bernhardt is also well known for her mentoring on the fly giving insightful advice during random conversations at conferences seminar visits or other formal or informal gatherings many people personal communications as a group of co authors who have been mentored by dr bernhardt as postdoctoral associates phd students research technicians and a data scientist and range from her first phd student dr jen morse to her most recently graduated phd student dr alice carter we discussed the facets of dr bernhardt s mentorship that were particularly effective for our growth as scientists and professionals though our experiences were each unique we came to the consensus that the following were particularly important aspects of dr bernhardt s mentorship dr bernhardt is a consummate networker and places graduate students in the center of networking she uses her community building skills to build community for her mentees in different ways that help students connect with the right people given their scientific and professional interests provides support in ways that allow her mentees to develop deep ownership of projects and ideas and in turn promotes students as leaders during professional meetings and the publication process this often results in shifting trajectories in her own research program to elevate and extend student interests and ideas models a big questions approach to advancing science she is a conceptual thinker and trains her students to conceptualize and synthesize ideas so that they can place their own findings in broad contexts she values and trains her students in the art of storytelling to communicate scientific ideas and research findings to broad audiences is generous and collaborative in the scientific process she is creative open and sharing in idea generation within her research group and models that approach to her mentees by collaborating widely outside her research group both in relationships with peers and in the approaches she uses to build capacity for research across the scientific community e g see box 2 excels at building community and collaboration within her own research group she does this in several ways by treating her mentees as collaborators rather than subordinates from undergraduates to postdocs by nurturing the professional development of all group members a particular example is her support of long term technicians by supporting independent research projects and individual professional development by

conceptualized how critical the movement of water is for the biogeochemical cycling of elements within and among ecosystems just as water connects elements and ecosystems dr bernhardt s research connects disparate fields to help us improve our understanding of how humans replumbing of the hydrologic cycle has altered biogeochemical cycling from micro to global scales dr bernhardt s dedication

hydrologic connectivity stream ecology aquatic ecosystem ecology ecohydrology mentorship data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction hydrologic connectivity the transport transformation and storage of carbon nutrients and other materials mediated by water has been a fundamental concept of the hydrologic sciences since the 1990s national research council 2012 naiman et al 1995 hydrologic connectivity encompasses upstream downstream aquatic terrestrial surface water groundwater and watershed stream linkages and interfaces covino 2017 that can have exceptionally high impacts on ecosystem level fluxes bernhardt et al 2017a a significant challenge has been to understand how fluvial ecosystems streams rivers floodplains wetlands and lakes move and process elements and how hydrologic connectivity drives the roles these ecosystems play in biogeochemical cycles at broader watershed regional and global scales this challenge has become especially acute as humans have replumbed the earth s hydrology and altered natural element cycles in many ways abbott et al 2019 national research council 2012 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 in

activities that extend her impact on the hydrologic sciences far beyond the bounds of individual studies the most rigorous and far reaching example of dr bernhardt s synthesis work is her co authorship of the textbook biogeochemistry an analysis of global change third and fourth editions schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 schlesinger and bernhardt 2020 the textbook includes syntheses of research that describe the biogeochemistry of aquatic systems wetlands inland waters and oceans as well as global hydrologic and elemental cycles dr bernhardt s work specifically expanded earlier editions treatment of freshwaters and aquatic ecosystems incorporating these systems into a broader understanding and synthesis in the field of biogeochemistry dr bernhardt has also pushed the field forward with her syntheses on many specific topics within the hydrologic sciences including long term water chemistry patterns bernhardt et al 2005a stream restoration bernhardt et al 2005b hot spots and hot moments i e ecosystem control points bernhardt et al 2017a synthetic chemicals bernhardt et al 2017b and river metabolism bernhardt et al 2022 dr bernhardt s research is intertwined with her commitment to mentorship and service and we would be remiss not to include these facets of dr bernhardt s career when synthesizing her major research contributions since joining the faculty at duke university in 2004 dr bernhardt has advised nearly 70 students postdoctoral associates and research technicians who have led some of the most impactful work from her research group the majority of

hydrologic connectivity among ecosystems interfaces and connections across scales e g microbial reactions and watershed export as in marinos and bernhardt 2018 among disciplines interdisciplinarity or even the creation of new disciplines that are defined by disciplinary interfaces e g ecohydrology and between science environmental policy and ecosystem management are also critical for generating new knowledge that is broadly applicable and transferable in the hydrologic sciences dr bernhardt s research is defined by her ability to ask questions and use approaches that explicitly consider connectivity and interfaces in a variety of ways in the following we highlight significant contributions from dr bernhardt s work organized by connectivity interfaces and interactions across 1 elemental cycles 2 ecosystems 3 watersheds 4 scales and 5 disciplines we conclude with a section on dr bernhardt s impact on the hydrologic sciences and beyond through her exceptional dedication to mentorship engagement and service 2 major contributions to the hydrologic sciences 2 1 elemental cycles the bedrock of dr bernhardt s research program is understanding interactions among elemental cycles and how hydrologic connectivity changes those interactions she began her career studying how carbon inputs control nitrogen dynamics in stream ecosystems of the hubbard brook experimental forest hbef her ph d research was some of the first to experimentally enrich whole streams with dissolved organic carbon illustrating how carbon availability can control the capacity of streams to uptake and remove nitrogen bernhardt and likens 2002 these findings and her subsequent analyses of whole stream estimates of nitrification and nitrate uptake across hbef streams changed our understanding of how carbon transport from soils to streams controls in stream nitrogen dynamics prior to watershed export bernhardt et al 2003 bernhardt et al 2002 dr bernhardt leveraged a natural experiment an ice storm that created a major forest disturbance to solidify our understanding of the role of soil stream hydrologic connectivity in linked carbon nitrogen cycling in streams she found that though disturbance caused by the ice storm increased nitrate inputs to hbef streams the impact was mediated by simultaneous increases in carbon and woody debris inputs and greater light availability from tree damage leading to elevated carbon breakdown and in stream algal production respectively these in stream alterations after the storm increased aquatic inorganic nitrogen processing substantially offsetting the increased transport of nitrate from soils to streams such that without in stream processing export of nitrate from damaged watersheds would have been 80 140 higher than observed bernhardt et al 2003 as she often has done in her career dr bernhardt took this localized phenomenon one storm in one year and expanded it to a much larger synthesis she led the analysis of 40 years of stream water chemistry data from hbef to uncover the role of in stream processing in declines in watershed nitrogen exports and unequivocally illustrated with empirical data the importance of in stream nitrogen uptake and removal for watershed nutrient budgets bernhardt et al 2005a over her career dr bernhardt has continued to address how watershed stream and carbon nitrogen interactions can influence in stream nitrogen retention and watershed export including the role of dissolved organic nitrogen and organic matter quality in walker branch tn lutz et al 2011 lutz et al 2012 recovery from acid rain marinos et al 2018 and diurnal patterns of nitrate uptake related to photosynthesis chamberlin et al 2019 dr bernhardt continues to lead and collaborate with drs gene likens emma rosi john campbell and lindsey rustad to maintain the long term rain and stream chemistry record at hbef e g likens et al 2021 with ongoing research focused on acid rain legacies and climate change effects dr bernhardt s research program also uses linked elemental cycles and hydrologic patterns to understand aquatic ecosystem energetics from empirical carter et al 2021 modeling reinhold et al 2019 and data synthesis helton et al 2015 perspectives her work in this area considers how redox conditions control linked elemental cycles driven by the interplay between hydrologic and biogeochemical dynamics in aquatic ecosystems for example in seasonally flowing rivers water flow controls the supply of oxygen which interacts with energetic processes leading to hypoxia and altered elemental cycles carter et al 2021 indeed extensive data analysis across aquatic ecosystems has demonstrated emergent relationships between inorganic nitrogen and carbon that varied among ecosystem types with oxygenated flowing waters more likely to be controlled by stoichiometric constraints while lower oxygen and lentic waters tend to be regulated by redox constraints helton et al 2015 fig 2 this work informs how underlying hydrologic and biogeochemical mechanisms interact to control emergent water chemistry patterns including hypoxia and nutrient enrichment across aquatic ecosystems nearly all the research we highlight in the sections below also addresses multiple elemental cycles dr bernhardt s research directly explores how connections among elemental cycles control the response of coastal wetlands to saltwater intrusion see section 2 2 the relationship of water chemistry to urban land use patterns see section 2 3 1 and the effects of mountaintop removal mining on stream ecosystems see sections 2 3 2 and 2 5 3 a paper that includes only a single element is indeed rare across dr bernhardt s career 2 2 ecosystems dr bernhardt s early research on carbon nitrogen interactions in stream ecosystems centered on hydrologic connectivity from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems she addressed how the interplay of carbon and nitrogen delivery to and processing within streams resulted in patterns of watershed nutrient export see section 2 1 above dr bernhardt s work has continued to demonstrate how hydrologically mediated terrestrial carbon inputs to streams can control in stream elemental cycling for example the organic carbon subsidy delivered by autumn litterfall can drive high heterotrophic nitrate demand and nitrogen limitation covino et al 2018 more broadly dr bernhardt s research explicitly addresses ecosystem boundaries e g aquatic terrestrial freshwater saline oxic anoxic and the role of hydrologic transport in controlling the movement of materials across and processing within those ecosystem interfaces box 1 in this section we use dr bernhardt s extensive research in coastal wetlands to highlight her work on how hydrologic and chemical interfaces influence ecosystem dynamics more than a decade of scientific advancement on ecosystem interfaces has come from dr bernhardt s work in the coastal plain of north carolina her work began at the timberlake observatory for wetland restoration tower one of the largest wetland restoration projects in the u s fig 3 in 2005 dr bernhardt was contacted by a group of private investors who were working on a large scale wetland restoration project in the coastal plain of north carolina at the time the wetland area of the project was the largest wetland restoration project east of the mississippi river the investors were also interested in restoring sections of a stream within the wetland and they contacted dr bernhardt because of her expertise and role in the national river restoration science synthesis nrrss bernhardt et al 2005 see section 2 4 1 below the regulatory agencies u s army corps of engineers u s environmental protection agency and the north carolina division of environmental quality were requiring the investors to engage in large scale excavation and earth movement to create a sinuous stream channel which the investors believed did not reflect natural stream conditions in the area dr bernhardt in collaboration with dr martin doyle partnered with the investors to start a research project to examine how to determine the extent of stream restoration in this landscape the restoration of tower included restoring previously drained and farmed wetlands by constructing a stream channel filling shallow ditches removing large pumps to reconnect the site hydrologically and planting 750 000 trees with funding from the private investors the initial research goal was to monitor the restoration of ecosystem services primarily nutrient retention offered by a large scale wetland mitigation bank and included developing a hydrologic monitoring site which is still operating today in collaboration with dr marcelo ardón a key underpinning of the early research at tower was the importance of hydrologic connectivity for both the success of wetland restoration and moderating the ecosystem services that restored wetlands provide ardón et al 2010a ardón et al 2010b helton et al 2014 morse et al 2012a morse et al 2012b hydrologic restoration of this large wetland complex showed that the site was effective at retaining nitrogen from an upstream farm ardón et al 2010a but released phosphorus after initial reflooding ardón et al 2017 ardón et al 2010b greenhouse gas emissions from the site were lower than those from nearby agricultural fields and mature wetlands findings which contribute to the debate on the emissions consequences of wetland restoration for nutrient retention morse et al 2012a morse et al 2012b the work helped inform stream restoration in north carolina as well as national debates on what is a stream doyle and bernhardt 2011 dr bernhardt collaborated with north carolina state regulators to revise their requirements for stream restoration to more fully consider natural landscape dynamics of stream wetland complexes across the relatively flat coastal plain the early studies of nutrient retention at tower led to the inadvertent discovery of elevated salinity on the site and subsequent expansion of dr bernhardt s research program to investigate the simultaneous controls of hydrology and salinity on wetland biogeochemistry at the interface of fresh and saline ecosystems during the first two years of monitoring a major drought led to saltwater incursion the landward movement of seawater through surface waters inviting investigations at the interface of fresh and saltwater in historically freshwater wetlands drought induced saltwater incursion caused the site to release substantial nitrogen from agricultural legacies ardón et al 2017 ardón et al 2013 increased sulfate and sea salts changed greenhouse gas emissions from the wetland soils but the direction and magnitude depended on antecedent hydrologic conditions ardón et al 2018 helton et al 2019 helton et al 2014 dr bernhardt s work contributed to the growing body of literature and the framework for understanding and evaluating the chemical ecological and social implications of climate change induced salinization tully et al 2019 the changes observed at tower and the growing recognition of the potential ecological implications of saltwater intrusion supported the expansion of the research to a broader area of the albemarle pamlico peninsula bhattachan et al 2018 ury et al 2020 and the southeastern coastal plain white et al 2022 and to incorporate additional interdisciplinary approaches to understand ecosystem dynamics at the saline freshwater interface specifically in microbial and plant community ecology see sections 2 4 and 2 5 for additional examples of dr bernhardt s work across scales and disciplines respectively the saline freshwater interface merges distinct microbiomes in a phenomenon known as community coalescence when freshwater and marine waters were experimentally mixed rocca et al 2020 found that marine microorganisms dominated the microbial community with a substantial emergence of rare microbial taxa these findings led to advances in theory and application of community coalescence to engineered biological systems rocca et al 2021 the movement of the saline freshwater interface also alters plant communities dr bernhardt s team found a decline in tree biomass particularly near the transition between herbaceous marsh and forested wetland along with declines in woody and sensitive herbaceous taxa linked to indicators of salinization low elevation high soil salt content anderson et al 2022 ury et al 2020 plant community changes manifest at the landscape scale leading to significant declines in coastal forested wetland and the emergence of ghost forests a transitional ecosystem characterized by standing dead trees ury et al 2021 white et al 2022 dr bernhardt is currently expanding her interdisciplinary work at the freshwater marine interface as a leader along with remote sensing scientist dr xi yang on the swislr saltwater intrusion and sea level rise research coordination network a broad effort to synthesize understand and share knowledge about social and environmental change in rural coastal plain landscapes 2 3 watersheds dr bernhardt began her research career as a phd student working in systems where the classic small watershed approach was developed bormann and likens 1967 see section 2 1 above based on the concept that stream dynamics reflect watershed controls and thus in stream nutrient dynamics could be used to infer watershed scale processes as a postdoctoral researcher dr bernhardt transitioned to research on stream restoration bernhardt et al 2005b see section 2 4 1 below in the field of stream restoration at the time beneficial outcomes were often expected from reach scale management interventions without explicit consideration of upstream catchment conditions dr bernhardt s subsequent research focused on disentangling reach versus catchment scale controls and she extended the small watershed approach to understand how human changes to the landscape influence stream hydrology and biogeochemistry here we highlight her work on the effects of watershed urbanization and mountaintop removal mining on receiving streams 2 3 1 urbanization dr bernhardt s early synthesis work bernhardt et al 2005 see section 2 4 1 below and subsequent empirical research sudduth et al 2011 violin et al 2011 suggested that watershed scale degradation typically outweighed the benefits of reach scale restoration efforts in an individual stream indeed with some limited exceptions her research found that restored urban stream reaches differ little from un restored urban stream reaches in biodiversity and ecosystem function and that stream organisms do not recover from the impacts of urbanization without catchment level efforts to reduce storm flows and chemical loading sudduth et al 2011 violin et al 2011 across the north carolina piedmont catchment urbanization had consistently greater effects than reach scale variables and resulted in 1 higher baseflow temperatures and temperature variability somers et al 2013 2 significant increases in temperature with stormflow 3 increases in nitrate bioavailable and algal derived organic carbon and metals including lead cadmium and zinc hassett et al 2018 4 loss of macroinvertebrate biodiversity 5 increases in certain ecosystem functions including substrate induced respiration carbon mineralization and denitrification enzyme activity and 6 alterations to the microbial community structure simonin et al 2019 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2011 further through a longitudinal investigation of temperature to examine how far the signal of urban stressors travels from its source somers et al 2016 found that the urban heat signal 1 c was still observable at distances 1 km downstream from urban sources through a forested area illustrating the limits of mitigating such a signal using a reach scale approach and highlighting the upstream downstream hydrologic connectivity between urban land and receiving waters developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of urban land use on downstream aquatic ecosystems requires an understanding of not only the land use composition of watersheds but also the connectivity and configuration of land cover types that alter hydrologic flow paths in collaboration with landscape ecologist dr dean urban dr bernhardt s research addressed this challenge by quantifying how attributes of urban development configuration and connectivity explain variation in the chemical regimes of urban streams in watersheds with similar proportions of urban land cover but variable development configurations she found that higher densities of engineered hydrologic flow paths e g roads and subsurface stormwater piping increase not only the temporal variability in the chemical composition and concentrations of solutes in urban streams blaszczak et al 2019b but also stream macroinvertebrate heavy metal body burdens baruch et al 2018 when whole stream ecosystem function was investigated in a subset of the watersheds spanning the widest gradient in hydrologic flashiness physical flow disturbances decreased the strength of the relationship between light and productivity in streams additionally geomorphic changes in stream channels led to a wide range in stream dissolved oxygen regimes ranging from frequent hypoxia to near constant saturation blaszczak et al 2019a collectively dr bernhardt s work linking watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry to principles from landscape ecology demonstrates the importance of understanding hydrologic connectivity between streams and urban features when predicting the potential influence of urbanization on downstream waters delesantro et al 2021 2 3 2 mountaintop removal coal mining while much of her research centers on how humans alter the land surface a major thread of dr bernhardt s work has addressed a much deeper impact to the earth s surface mountaintop mining with valley fills mtm vf has dramatically altered the topography subsurface structure and overall shape of 6000 km2 of land in central appalachia ross et al 2016 mtm vf is a destructive form of surface mining used in steep appalachian terrain to access shallow coal seams by removing trees soil and overlying bedrock excess rock from these operations is dumped into nearby valleys filling them up with highly fractured bedrock after mining these landscapes shift from having 2 meter deep soil profiles to having highly chemically reactive overburden piles that can be hundreds of meters deep ross et al 2016 though these overburden piles contain ample pyrite which typically causes acid mine drainage there is more than enough calcareous bedrock to neutralize the acidity generated by pyrite leading to alkaline mine drainage characterized by high ph 8 and elevated solute concentration lindberg et al 2011 dr bernhardt s research on the effects of mtm vf began along the upper mud river and its tributaries in west virginia within one of the largest surface mining operations in appalachia dr bernhardt accessed stream sampling locations via public roads and the last remaining private property within the heavily mined watershed the west virginia state supreme court ruled in 2004 that ownership of the property remain with the caudill miller family who had lived on that property for generations despite the attempt to take the property through eminent domain ark land co 2004 building relationships and working closely with the miller family was instrumental in understanding the history of the watershed and the sociopolitical context of the area gaining access to important sampling locations providing short term housing during field campaigns and contextualizing the effects of mtm vf on local communities most of dr bernhardt s research group even attended a large miller family gathering and helped with a potato harvest during one of the group s large field sampling campaigns dr bernhardt was particularly interested in how major physical changes in mined watersheds alter the chemical composition and hydrology of downstream reaches throughout the region while the immediate downstream consequences of alkaline mine drainage from mtm vf were well known dr bernhardt s research expanded both the spatial and temporal scales of mtm vf impacts studying how numerous mining operations impact regional hydrology stream water chemistry and stream biota initial work in the upper mud river found that both active and reclaimed mines export high concentrations of inorganic solutes that accumulate downstream as more mined tributaries contributed their flow to the mainstem lindberg et al 2011 a subsequent regional analysis across 223 watersheds in southwest west virginia confirmed that this pattern in the upper mud river was quite common regionally with percent mining in the upstream catchment explaining half the variation in stream water conductivity across sites bernhardt et al 2012 follow on work highlighted that the volume of bedrock material disturbed by mining could more directly predict variation in water quality ross et al 2016 and that mined watersheds have a much higher capacity to store rainfall which contributes to higher baseflows that deliver elevated solute loads during dry periods nippgen et al 2017 cumulatively these physicochemical changes depress aquatic insect diversity and production during summer months voss and bernhardt 2017 dr bernhardt s study of alkaline mine drainage in the upper mud river emphasizes her overarching view that elemental cycles are connected and therefore must be studied in concert rather than in isolation for example disproportionately high weathering rates of carbonate minerals by sulfuric acid result not only in increased sulfate exports which must be balanced by bicarbonate and base cation export but also in net geologic carbon dioxide release ross et al 2018 furthermore residues from explosives used in mtm vf operations also enhance nitrate export from watersheds a feature that persists even when active mining ceases because newly exposed rock continues to act as a nitrate source brooks et al 2019 dr bernhardt s most recent work on this topic reveals that the cumulative changes from mining i e deepened critical zone disrupted geomorphology altered vegetation lead to long term 30 year changes in watershed and ecosystem function ross et al 2021 dr bernhardt s research on environmental impacts of coal mining overlaps with and merges multiple disciplinary areas detailed below in section 2 5 3 2 4 scales dr bernhardt s research includes many examples of expanding site specific observations to address regional scale phenomena e g see above sections 2 2 saltwater intrusion from wetland scale to the coastal plain and 2 3 2 mtm vf implications from a single mined watershed to central appalachia in this section we focus specifically on her efforts to synthesize numerous and often disparate datasets collected at the local scale to inform research at the continental to global scales in the areas of stream restoration and stream metabolism as part of these efforts dr bernhardt has led the development of open access databases to enable research and standardize analysis for the whole scientific community box 2 expanding her impact beyond the studies conducted in her lab and the sites where her research group has worked 2 4 1 stream restoration stream restoration transitioned from volunteer efforts and scientific experimentation to big business during the 1990s by the early 2000s freshwater scientists sought to understand what was being done in the name of stream restoration and its efficacy drs margaret palmer and j david allen proposed the national river restoration science synthesis nrrss as a working group at the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis nceas in 2002 the funded project hired dr bernhardt as a postdoctoral associate to lead the efforts the initial goal was to collect national datasets of stream restoration projects and their monitoring data to complete a meta analysis of these data and to draw conclusions about the ecological efficacy of the work to date as the project progressed the team quickly discovered that most data about stream restoration were managed only locally frequently without any digitization and that many projects nationwide either were not being monitored or did not have publicly available data relevant to the proposed analysis ultimately nrrss transformed into a data gathering and assembling project creating the first nationwide database of stream restoration projects in the u s managed by the now discontinued national biological information infrastructure program while some data were merged from existing databases most of the data were collected manually by a team of graduate students directly mentored by dr bernhardt who was responsible for weekly coordination of this nationwide group of students the initial analysis of the database was published in bernhardt et al 2005b and revealed that although an astonishing 1 billion per year was spent on stream restoration projects in the u s there was a ubiquitous lack of tracking and evaluation of project actions and outcomes that finding led to a number of highly influential papers that evaluated stream restoration practices and projects e g bernhardt and palmer 2011 bernhardt and palmer 2007 palmer et al 2010 including recommendations for a new set of standards for ecologically successful river restoration palmer et al 2005 the lack of access to monitoring data and the lack of any monitoring in many cases was one of the more important discoveries reported in bernhardt et al 2005b a mismatch between the most commonly stated restoration project goals and the types of practices being performed to reach those goals was also noted as was the lack of any stated goals for some projects in general little information was publicly available about many of these projects this led the working group to turn to a survey of restoration practitioners to better understand the nature of their projects including planning and motivation and to learn about monitoring and goals omitted from publicly available documents dr bernhardt again coordinated the team of graduate students in completing these phone surveys with practitioners and assembling the data into a single database for analysis the results of these efforts identified common mismatches between stated project goals and post project monitoring bernhardt et al 2007 practitioners generally were dissatisfied with their own monitoring but lacked the resources to complete the monitoring themselves suggesting a need for funders to include support for monitoring in addition to other project costs additionally each region of the country had a graduate student led paper written with dr bernhardt s support in analyzing both databases to better examine local patterns and trends most were published alongside bernhardt et al 2007 in a special issue of restoration ecology bernhardt et al 2007 follstad shah et al 2007 hassett et al 2007 katz et al 2007 o donnell and galat 2007 sudduth et al 2007 since then much research has highlighted and worked to address the persistent gap between the promise and realities of restoration practices craig et al 2008 findings show that projects like decommissioning a dam or restoration designs with specific goals in mind yield more ecologically beneficial outcomes doyle et al 2008 ross et al 2015 2 4 2 stream metabolism although the earliest studies of daily ecosystem energetics were conducted in streams and rivers odum 1956 most subsequent studies over the past few decades have occurred in other ecosystem types when studies did measure energetics in streams they typically studied single locations over short time periods primarily due to cost time and technological constraints of measuring dissolved oxygen concentrations in streams at high resolution for extended periods of time consequently streams and rivers unlike terrestrial ecosystems lack defined biomes that allow ecosystem ecologists to generalize patterns in energetics for integration into global cycles furthermore the components of metabolism gross primary production and ecosystem respiration tend to be uncoupled from each other and more variable in streams than in terrestrial ecosystems dr bernhardt hypothesized that these differences arise because unlike terrestrial ecosystems in rivers 1 seasonal variations in light and temperature are often uncorrelated because of canopy cover sediment loads or colored organic matter 2 frequent high flow events or drying events reduce autotrophic biomass and 3 substantial energetic subsidies from terrestrial systems e g detritus dissolved organic matter are received from the draining watershed at amounts matching or exceeding in stream gross primary production bernhardt et al 2018 fig 4 a dr bernhardt challenged the field to leverage growing datasets of long term dissolved oxygen records to uncover drivers of stream metabolic regimes she found that estimating stream metabolism for one or a few days provides little information about the energetics of rivers where frequent hydrologic disturbances and highly variable light regimes lead to high temporal variation in stream metabolism bernhardt et al 2018 consequently dr bernhardt was one of the leaders of the first continental scale effort to model stream metabolism an effort that estimated gross primary production and ecosystem respiration rates for 365 u s rivers ranging from 61 days to 9 years per site appling et al 2018b see also box 2 she has subsequently contributed to our understanding of how rivers group into distinct metabolic regimes savoy et al 2019 and used this to scale metabolic processes from stream reaches to entire river networks koenig et al 2019 dr bernhardt s recent work culminated in a comprehensive analysis of annual stream metabolism patterns and drivers across 222 rivers with near continuous records of dissolved oxygen concentration for one or more years bernhardt et al 2022 this work dramatically expanded our understanding of riverine metabolic regimes at the continental scale bernhardt et al 2022 found that annual light availability and flow stability are the primary controls on the timing and magnitude of river metabolic regimes which contrasts with terrestrial ecosystems where metabolic variability is primarily driven by temperature and precipitation rivers also tend to respire far more carbon than they fix and have less pronounced seasonality in their metabolic regimes than their terrestrial counterparts bernhardt et al 2022 used their analysis to propose a classification schema for ecosystem metabolism in rivers fig 4b ranging from bright and stable rivers that are highly productive to dark and stormy rivers where both autotrophy and heterotrophy are constrained by light and hydrologic disturbances by linking these regimes to watershed characteristics as well as management activities bernhardt et al 2022 provided a template for advancing scientific understanding and scaling of riverine processes as well as insights for managing rivers toward desired metabolic regimes 2 5 disciplines complex environmental challenges from local to global scales cannot be solved within disciplinary silos weathers et al 2016 indeed interdisciplinary research and its impacts have increased over recent decades leahey and barringer 2020 okamura 2019 dr bernhardt commonly bridges disciplinary boundaries in her research program here we focus on her work specifically bridging and integrating ecotoxicology and microbial ecology with the hydrologic sciences though the interdisciplinarity of dr bernhardt s research program is interwoven throughout many of the sections above in this section we provide specific examples of dr bernhardt s leadership and collaboration within groups that advance interdisciplinary research in the hydrologic sciences 2 5 1 ecological impacts of nanomaterials and emerging contaminants for a decade dr bernhardt was the ecosystem research theme leader for the center for the environmental implications of nanotechnology ceint which performed fundamental research on the behavior of nano scale materials in the laboratory and complex ecosystems the center formed in 2008 included scientists from many disciplinary perspectives including chemistry engineering toxicology ecology and public policy although at the time little was known about the fate and transport of engineered nanoparticles there was a growing concern about the potential for adverse unintended environmental consequences resulting from their widespread release to natural systems from ceint s inception dr bernhardt advocated to apply an ecological perspective to the ecotoxicological framework being used to assess the environmental impacts of these emerging contaminants bernhardt et al 2010 written in collaboration with ecologists a nanogeoscientist and a toxicologist bernhardt et al 2010 considered the potentially parallel behavior of naturally occurring nanoparticles long studied in the soil sciences and historical analogs like pesticides as well as known biological impacts of nanomaterials derived from toxicological research they found that of the nearly 100 000 articles on nanomaterials published before 2009 only 150 included a reference to the environment or ecology rather the vast majority of nanomaterials impact research had been conducted in controlled laboratory experiments with single model organisms or cell cultures in simple media exposed to high concentrations bernhardt et al 2010 called on the scientific community to examine the effects of engineered nanoparticles on a diversity of organisms and their fate and transport in real environmental media and under field relevant conditions recognizing that advancing the science of the impact of nanomaterials on the environment would require substantial interdisciplinary collaboration since then nanomaterials impact research has increased dramatically using a search of the scientific literature similar to bernhardt et al 2010 we found papers that included the key words ecosystem and nanomaterials increased 15 fold over the last 12 years from 59 published in 2009 to 894 published in 2022 based on a scopus search of title abstract and keyword for nanomaterial or nanoparticle and ecosys dr bernhardt s own subsequent experimental research demonstrated how realistic low level chronic release of several widely used nanoparticles can be rapidly transformed in aquatic habitats and cause ecosystem level effects colman et al 2018 colman et al 2014 such as the intensification of eutrophication in wetlands perrotta et al 2020 simonin et al 2018 following her research on nanoparticles dr bernhardt continued her focus on understanding the impacts of emerging contaminants by leading a synthesis paper in which she addressed how rates of synthetic chemical production and diversification have outpaced other agents of global change e g carbon dioxide production nutrient pollution and biodiversity loss that are better recognized funded and studied bernhardt et al 2017b the paper calls for better consideration of contaminants as both independent and interacting global change drivers and recognizes that under consideration of synthetic chemicals has resulted in blind spots that hinder the success of global ecological science with over 450 citations within five years of publication the paper has already motivated and enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration 2 5 2 microbiomes and ecosystem function how and when microorganisms constrain ecosystem processes are critical knowledge gaps at the interface of microbiology and ecology in aquatic ecosystems these questions are even more complex as ecological function is also constrained by hydrologic transport and storage box 1 dr bernhardt has cultivated a strong connection with microbial ecology in her research program and has worked to advance interdisciplinary understanding of microbiomes within the context of ecosystem ecology in 2012 she participated in a usgs john wesley powell center working group next generation of ecological indicators the working group included experts in microbiology microbial ecology molecular biology biogeochemistry and ecosystem ecology and had an overarching goal to identify key microbial indicators of fundamental ecological processes first through literature synthesis the group identified prevalent assumptions that microbiome structure and ecosystem processes are connected but discovered major challenges to whether and how that link is specifically tested bier et al 2015a to push for an improved mechanistic and causal understanding they ultimately proposed a fundamental framework to explicitly link microbiome community attribute data with system level processes hall et al 2018 this approach relies on hierarchically partitioning ecosystem processes until a sub process connects with a specific microbial metabolic pathway determining controls and constraints for the sub process and then investigating influential microbiome characteristics dr bernhardt subsequently applied this guidance to her research one such field study noted that thermodynamic expectations microbial pathways based on terminal electron donor and acceptor availability did not exclusively explain relationships between subsidies stressors and microbial taxonomic and functional diversity in mining impacted streams bier et al 2020 dr bernhardt s team further explored how disturbances mining urbanization and stream connectivity freshwater marine interfaces shaped aquatic microbiomes bier et al 2015b rocca et al 2020 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2011 this work also prompted the discovery of microbial taxa indicative of factors associated with stream urbanization simonin et al 2019 and mtm vf in both sediments and the water column jin et al 2022 simonin et al 2021 2 5 3 ecological impacts of mining an early and long lasting example of cross disciplinary research is dr bernhardt s focus on the hydrological ecological and ecotoxicological impacts of the coal life cycle from mountaintop removal mining valley fill mtm vf extraction practices to the post combustion coal ash waste stream on freshwater ecosystems fig 5 see also section 2 3 2 above disturbing large volumes of bedrock via mtm vf operations directly mobilizes large amounts of complex mixtures of contaminants lindberg et al 2011 ross et al 2016 that can have cascading implications for stream organisms communities and ecosystems dr bernardt s team found that this contaminant loading is associated with shifts in functional genes including depressed nitrogenase and methanogen genes and elevated selenate reductase genes bier et al 2020 bier et al 2015 these changes in gene expression reflect and contribute to shifts in macronutrients of mtm vf impacted streams but also demonstrate microbial gatekeeping on selenium availability to other trophic levels selenium concentrations were elevated in stream biofilms stream macroinvertebrates and riparian consumers in mtm vf affected streams arnold et al 2017 naslund et al 2021 naslund et al 2020 potentially posing toxicological risks to egg laying organisms selenium levels were also elevated in fish from lakes receiving coal combustion waste with levels comparable to those measured during historic fish extirpation events as a consequence of the legacy left from this historic deposition of coal combustion residues these conditions will likely be sustained for many years in the future brandt et al 2017 ultimately dr bernhadt and her team found that extensive coal surface mining could be responsible for the extirpation of 40 of stream biodiversity simonin et al 2021 dr bernhardt s research program impressively worked in parallel across disciplines to quantify hydrologic and geochemical changes caused by mining and to disentangle how these changes affected microbial community and ecosystem level dynamics fig 5 dr bernhardt recognized the importance of interactions among contaminants expanding her research program to consider multi element ecotoxicological effects brandt et al 2019 reported the coupled trophic transfer of coal ash derived elements in recipient food webs and highlighted the importance of considering mixtures in the context of toxicological risks for exposed organisms this led dr bernhardt to explore interactions between selenium and mercury in aquatic ecosystems and aquatic organisms gerson et al 2021 gerson et al 2020a including a critical assessment of the assumptions regarding selenium mercury interactions and whether these were well supported in the literature or required more thorough study gerson et al 2020b similarly to her other work these cross disciplinary studies on selenium and mercury challenged the field to think holistically about linked elemental cycling within aquatic ecosystems with important implications for environmental management and public health dr bernhardt s research to understand how landscape change affects contaminant fate and impact also extends internationally the expanding footprint of artisanal gold mining in the peruvian amazon is impacting the region through the use and release of mercury through this work dr bernhardt s team discovered that expansion of mining ponds and release of mercury collectively lead to increased microbial production of methylmercury a form of mercury generated in anaerobic environments that is more bioavailable and therefore more problematic in its toxicity gerson et al 2020c this project also investigated terrestrial and aquatic linkages finding that intact old growth forests in the amazon are important for intercepting mercury preventing it from reaching aquatic environments where it can be more readily converted into methylmercury gerson et al 2022a 3 engagement service and mentorship the bulk of this paper focuses on dr bernhardt s many impactful research contributions but we consider her phenomenal professional contributions outside of research equally important to highlight dr bernhardt approaches engagement service and mentorship with the same enthusiasm dedication and creativity with which she approaches her science her service and engagement contributions are so many and so broad that we cannot list them all here instead we focus below on some examples that are particularly relevant to the hydrologic sciences and exemplify dr bernhardt s approach to engagement and service of the many mentees that have been part of dr bernhardt s research group the vast majority continue to work as professionals in areas related to their research with dr bernhardt and many continue to be mentored by dr bernhardt long after their official tenures with her research group now that we co authors have increasingly more professional and personal responsibilities ourselves we more deeply appreciate dr bernhardt s consistent focus on mentorship and dedication to engagement and service within and beyond the scientific community 3 1 engagement and service dr bernhardt has served extensively in leadership roles for her university and for many professional societies notably her recent

ecosystem ecology to inform an international understanding of contaminants and the impacts they have on wildlife that she is sought out to serve in such a variety of roles and organizations reflects her talent at consensus building cross disciplinary synthesis and creative forward thinking dr bernhardt is also committed to engaging policy makers decision makers and the broader community about her own research findings her work has been influential in policy decisions ranging from mountaintop removal mining to urban stream restoration here are a few examples that reflect the impact of dr bernhardt s engagement activities dr bernhardt built and maintains long standing pro bono consulting relationships with the great dismal swamp mitigation bank southern environmental law center and appalachian center for the economy and the environment co authored a white paper on mtm vf consequences provided to the white house council on environmental quality office of the u s epa director u s

local stakeholders through the publication of research briefs translated into spanish and shared with local government officials and conservation organizations gerson et al 2020d gerson et al 2022b 3 2 mentorship dr bernhardt has mentored nearly 70 students technicians and postdoctoral associates in the last 18 years the majority of her 50 most recent papers were led by students and only five do not include at least one student author from her research group dr bernhardt s mentees have gone on to be leaders in academia governmental agencies and industry dr bernhardt s mentorship extends well beyond members of her own research group for example students in her biogeochemistry course also routinely publish papers from an assignment in which they learn how to synthesize data and ideas from the scientific literature e g carmichael et al 2014 cha et al 2013 lee et al 2017 singh et al 2016 sudduth et al 2013 she also mentors students through university e g bass connections data plus and environmental impact fellowship program at duke university and society e g esa seeds programs and over her career has also directly mentored nine professional master s students and 16 undergraduate honors students as well as many undergraduate research technicians dr bernhardt is also well known for her mentoring on the fly giving insightful advice during random conversations at conferences seminar visits or other formal or informal gatherings many people personal communications as a group of co authors who have been mentored by dr bernhardt as postdoctoral associates phd students research technicians and a data scientist and range from her first phd student dr jen morse to her most recently graduated phd student dr alice carter we discussed the facets of dr bernhardt s mentorship that were particularly effective for our growth as scientists and professionals though our experiences were each unique we came to the consensus that the following were particularly important aspects of dr bernhardt s mentorship dr bernhardt is a consummate networker and places graduate students in the center of networking she uses her community building skills to build community for her mentees in different ways that help students connect with the right people given their scientific and professional interests provides support in ways that allow her mentees to develop deep ownership of projects and ideas and in turn promotes students as leaders during professional meetings and the publication process this often results in shifting trajectories in her own research program to elevate and extend student interests and ideas models a big questions approach to advancing science she is a conceptual thinker and trains her students to conceptualize and synthesize ideas so that they can place their own findings in broad contexts she values and trains her students in the art of storytelling to communicate scientific ideas and research findings to broad audiences is generous and collaborative in the scientific process she is creative open and sharing in idea generation within her research group and models that approach to her mentees by collaborating widely outside her research group both in relationships with peers and in the approaches she uses to build capacity for research across the scientific community e g see box 2 excels at building community and collaboration within her own research group she does this in several ways by treating her mentees as collaborators rather than subordinates from undergraduates to postdocs by nurturing the professional development of all group members a particular example is her support of long term technicians by supporting independent research projects and individual professional development by motivating and inspiring students through the inevitable frustrations of graduate school and early career research by modeling and promoting work life integration by building an ethos of kindness among her group members bernhardt 2016 and by unparalleled enthusiasm for science and silly group activities fig 6 all of us co authors continue to model our own approaches to science and mentorship with inspiration from our experiences in dr bernhardt s research group we strive to develop a welcoming and productive environment within our own groups in many of the same ways that dr bernhardt does for hers 4 concluding thoughts dr bernhardt s work in the hydrologic sciences and beyond is so extensive that we have highlighted only some of her major contributions here this is not intended to be an exhaustive review of dr bernhardt s work and its impacts rather we hope we have shown some of the major ways in which dr bernhardt s research thus far in her career has uncovered described and conceptualized how critical the movement of water is for the biogeochemical cycling of elements within and among ecosystems just as water connects elements and ecosystems dr bernhardt s research connects disparate fields to help us improve our understanding of how humans replumbing of the hydrologic cycle has altered biogeochemical cycling from micro to global scales dr bernhardt s dedication to and enthusiasm for mentoring the next generation of scientists will continue to grow the impact of her work as always we continue to be excited for all the future insights we know will come from dr

2157,the two main factors of groundwater system disturbance in coal mines are mine water inflow caused by overburden destruction and advance drainage projects as the main means of mine water hazard control an urgent problem to be solved in the ecologically fragile area is how to minimize the impact of advance drainage on the groundwater ecological environment while reducing mine water inflow rate to ensure safe production this paper proposes an optimal advance drainage technology based on multi objective groundwater management based on the analysis of the respective relationship between the drainage groundwater level and the capture supply and mine water inflow rate the concept and mathematical expression of the drainage threshold of the mine and the ecological environment are put forward for the first time based on the numerical simulation model this technology fully describes the dynamic changes of the groundwater system and establishes a groundwater management model with multi objective constraints such as mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage the optimal drainage scheme for the boreholes location the drainage volume and the time distribution is obtained through objective programming while reducing drainage volume and ensuring mine production safety the impact on the locally important phreatic groundwater is significantly reduced effectively resolving the contradiction between ecological water resource protection and mine safety production in the example of a coal mine in northwest china by comparing the traditional equal drainage scheme the optimized advance drainage technology fully considers the water richness characteristics and the dynamic changes of the groundwater system during the drainage process the number of boreholes in the optimization scheme is reduced by 50 and the total drainage volume is reduced by 40 60 more importantly under the condition that the decrease of mine water inflow rate in the two schemes is basically the same the average increase of quaternary leakage in the optimization scheme decreases by 53 36 through this technology the ecological critical value in the study area is evaluated when the regional quaternary groundwater level decreases by more than 0 73 m the impact range of the drawdown funnel and the drawdown rate are obviously accelerated it provides a scientific foundation for groundwater resource management and low carbon mining in ecologically fragile areas keywords coal mine water hazard controlling groundwater management model coal water dual resource mining mine water inflow modflow6 data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction deep coal and groundwater resources are in the same geological structure forming a coupling system of surface ecology groundwater resources coal resources in vertical space in the process of developing coal resources groundwater systems will inevitably be affected or damaged in ecologically fragile areas the problem of groundwater and ecological environment damage is more serious song et al 2021 liu et al 2019 xie et al 2018 the protection and utilization of water resources is a major issue facing green coal mining coal mining is an important pillar of the chinese economy wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 however in china coal resources and water resources are inversely distributed according to the shaped distribution pattern in fig 1 in the central region proven coal resources account for 75 6 of the country while water resources account for only 25 5 in the jurassic coalfield of the central region the water resource content is further reduced accounting for only 3 9 of the country in these ecologically fragile areas coal mining consumes 4 3 billion m3 a of water this makes the local ecological problems more acute ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china 2021 the regions with abundant coal resources and high mining intensity are called large coal production bases western china coal bases are mainly mining jurassic coalfields and they mainly face the threat of roof water during the mining process the main means of water hazard control in mines is advance drilling and drainage of directly water filled aquifers wu 2013 the impact of coal seam mining on the groundwater system is divided into two main parts one is the advance drainage of the coal seam before coal seam mining to ensure production safety the other is that during coal seam mining the structure of the overburden aquifer is destroyed and its permeability increases exponentially groundwater flows to the mine s working face through water conducting cracks meng et al 2016 liang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 both processes occur in directly water filled aquifers that are touched by water conducting crack zones however an important thing is often ignored the aquifuge between the direct and indirect aquifers is pinched out or its confining capacity is weak when the gwl of the direct fill aquifer decreases sharply leakage from the indirect aquifer usually the quaternary aquifer also increases which often leads to an imbalance in the surface ecology yang et al 2016 in addition the current advance drainage methods are mainly intended to ensure the safety of mine production the criterion for drainage is to lower the gwl of the direct aquifer to the floor elevation qin 2019 as a result in northwest coal producing areas where water resources are scarce reckless advance drainage methods on the one hand waste and pollute water resources due to a lack of scientific management fan et al 2019 zeng et al 2022a on the other hand it will break the fragile water resources balance in the region and directly affect the sustainable development of the local economy society and ecological environment many studies have been conducted on the groundwater system in the coal seam roof the distribution of the water richness was analyzed by the variable weight theory and the multi source data fusion theory in combination with the development height of the water conducting crack zone of the overburden the method for evaluating the risk of mine water inflow was established wu et al 2011 2015 2017 zeng et al 2016 2018 zhu et al 2018 the risk zoning is very helpful to determine the location of drainage boreholes besides the basic research on hydraulic exchange between aquifer and borehole is of great significance for drainage design tu et al 2020 adequate refinement of the drainage process for laminar and turbulent flow characteristics also can allow for better parameters setting liu et al 2021 numerical simulation is the main means of analyzing changes in groundwater systems okkonen and klove 2011 and is of great help in water inflow rate prediction cheng et al 2020 inter layer hydraulic connection qu et al 2021 and drainage studies zhao et al 2020 2019 however how to fully consider the characteristics of mine water inflow and ecological water security get drainage borehole arrangement drainage volume and drainage time optimal integrated management is an unsolved problem in mine areas too many drainage boreholes undoubtedly reduce drainage efficiency ignoring the proportion of dynamic and static storage of water filled aquifers and setting the drainage target gwl too low will over drain the water volume and capture the leakage of the quaternary indirect water filled aquifer resulting in a large waste of water resources increasing the drainage burden and destroying the ecology of the mining area in fact many objectives such as mine safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage are contradictory the bottleneck of advance drainage technology in ecologically fragile areas is determining the optimal solution multi objective programming is an important branch of operational research it is a mathematical method of scientific management developed to solve multi objective decision making problems mavrotas 2009 it has many applications in groundwater resources management macewan et al 2017 usually the physical constraints of a basin s water system are constructed through groundwater numerical simulation and then combined with economic objectives optimization to drive water management decisions li et al 2013 xin et al 2021 later many scholars combined a data driven model zhao et al 2019 sun et al 2022 a multi objective evolutionary algorithm song 2020 a genetic algorithm ayvaz 2016 and other optimization processes to quickly get the optimal solution of a large scale refined multi objective management model alizadeh et al 2017 vali et al 2021 ejaz et al 2022 there are few studies on multi objective management of mine hydrology mu et al 2022 wu et al 2000 2010 put forward the optimization scheme of mine water inflow treatment in the trinity of drainage water supply and environmental protection from a macro perspective and then gradually formed the five in one optimization management mode of mine water control treatment utilization recharge and ecological protection in section 2 we introduce the whole process of advance drainage technology to achieve multiple objectives in terms of mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage we discuss the importance of groundwater protection in coal mining in ecologically fragile areas and summarize the mathematical concepts of constraints then we describe in section 3 the study region for the technology application detailing the characteristics of groundwater system changes caused by coal mining we can establish a multi objective management model based on the actual data of the study area in section 4 we apply this technology to the quantitative characterization of mine water inflow processes and the design of advance drainage schemes we conclude with a discussion of the effects and keys to implementing this technology this method can effectively solve the contradiction between ecological water resources protection and mine safety production and provide a new management technology for the realization of co mining of mine water dual resources in ecologically fragile areas 2 methods of advance drainage technology we develop an innovative advance drainage technology under multi objective management based on system engineering and multi objective management the method determines the decision variables based on the characteristic parameters of the groundwater system in the water filled aquifer of the coal seam roof sets the water inflow constraint according to mine production safety the indirect aquifer leakage recharge constraint according to ecological water security and the drilling and drainage cost constraint according to economic benefit and constructs multiple objective functions then the optimal solution set of the multi objective management model is obtained by solving the linear objective programming algorithm which can realize the integrated management of drainage borehole layout drainage volume and drainage time while reducing the cost of drainage and ensuring the continuous and efficient mining of coal resources the critical value of water control and drainage in the study area is evaluated to prevent the waste of water resources in the whole groundwater system and avoid the destruction of the ecological environment in the mining area it provides a scientific basis for the management of groundwater resources in ecologically fragile areas and the safe and low carbon mining of mines before fully introducing this optimized drainage technology some concepts and their mathematical calculations should be clarified in the traditional mine hydrogeological analysis only the water filled aquifers within the coal mining fracture zone are concerned therefore this paper refers to them as direct water filled aquifers and the aquifers outside the range of the water conducting fracture zone are called indirect water filled aquifers the influence of such aquifers has often been ignored in past studies indirect aquifers tend to be closer to the surface consist of loose sediments and contain abundant phreatic water resources they are of great significance to vegetation ecology crop irrigation and human daily life in this study two thresholds are set to achieve the protection of ecological water resources one is the drainage ecological groundwater level threshold based on surface ecology it is determined by clarifying the correlation between gwl and vegetation growth the other is the drainage ecological groundwater volume threshold based on the principle of groundwater balance it is determined by the regional phreatic balance recharge and the captured lateral recharge as the gwl drops the evaporation rate decreases and the captured lateral recharge increases so the volume threshold is determined by the relationship between the gwl and the phreatic balance recharge from numerical simulations for the mining industry production safety and its costs are particularly important we ensure mining safety by reducing mine water inflow rate and improve drainage efficiency by reducing drilling costs and drainage volumes in summary the multi objective management technology process based on ecological water resources protection mine production safety and efficient drainage is shown in fig 2 including 1 analysis of groundwater system characteristics according to the principle of water balance and groundwater system theory when the groundwater system receives the input information the output information must be produced after conversion by the geological body ascott et al 2020 bidwell 2005 park et al 2021 the response between input and output is controlled by hydrogeological conditions padilla et al 2015 venvik and boogaard 2020 yidana et al 2014 through a comprehensive analysis of four aspects including geology seepage hydrochemistry and mine water inflow the water richness of the water filled aquifer can be evaluated the composition of mine water inflow can be qualitatively evaluated and the water inflow process can be preliminary characterized the conceptual model of mine hydrogeology is established through an in depth analysis of the characteristics of the groundwater system and it is the basis for establishing a numerical model that can represent the dynamic changes of groundwater in the mine area this determines the decision variables for the multi objective drainage model including management area management time and drainage borehole control points 2 establish distribution parameters groundwater model of the mining area most of the mines have production as the main purpose and its hydrogeological information is inadequate therefore based on the theory of multi source data fusion fully tap the mine drilling information on the partition evaluation of aquifer parameters combined with the initial gwl the boundary conditions the source and sink information and the mine water inflow rate the hydrogeological conceptual model in the mining area is established the three dimensional unsteady flow model is established based on the groundwater flow and boundary control equation eq 1 finally the model is verified according to the actual gwl monitoring data and mine water inflow rate data by establishing the numerical simulation model of groundwater flow in the mining area the actual mine water inflow process is quantitatively characterized on this basis the mathematical relationship is obtained by using the response matrix method xu and shao 1988 among the amount of drainage and gwl of the direct aquifer mine water inflow rate the leakage of indirect aquifer 1 x k 1

the boundary q is the flow of γ 2 boundary the inflow is positive the outflow is negative and the impervious boundary is 0 3 establish a multi objective groundwater management model the optimal management model is established by setting decision variables constraints and objective functions in the direct water filled aquifer that is affected by the water conducting crack zone drainage control nodes m are set at equal intervals and the dynamic change of the groundwater system is coupled into the management model as a constraint condition through the response matrix according to the changes in recharge in the management time of the groundwater system and the safety requirements of the mine production the drainage volume of each drainage node at different times is managed at the same time the drainage nodes with low drainage efficiency are eliminated by the economic constraint target and the remaining nodes are collected to form the well location distribution setting scheme in the process of solving the calculation the deviation variable is introduced and the contradiction between the subjective desire and the actual conditions is eliminated by setting the soft constraint conditions so as to achieve the optimal scheme design under the constraints of limiting the mine water inflow rate controlling the leakage of the indirect water filled aquifer and efficient drainage including ① decision variables the decision variables in this study are the borehole layout parameter x i and the water drainage q i t of different management time zone t on each drainage

inflow rate caused by the unit pulse drainage of direct water filled aquifer at the i th node in time t the management model of this study is solved by multi objective programming by adding positive and negative deviation variables to hard constraints they are transformed into soft constraints so that each solution target is close to the ideal value the objective function expresses the problem of determining the minimum value from various deviation variables shao et al 1999 objective 1 requires the working face water inflow rate to be as low as possible or even no water so as to ensure safety production of the mine the objective function is 3 m i n z 1 δ q objective 2 ecological water resources protection resource constraint 4 q k t i 1 m t 1 m γ i j t x i q i t δ v δ v q b t where q k t

at the i th node in time t to achieve this objective the regional recharge will be divided into m time zones according to the change of year in order to control the amount of drainage which will change with the change of recharge such as rainfall a hard constraint exists to ensure that the indirect aquifer gwl can meet the mining surface ecological vegetation is not destroyed 5 h j i 1 m j 1

node at the jth node in time t depending on the region the rising height of groundwater and the length of vegetation roots can be used to calculate the ecological groundwater level h 0 to ensure that the vertical leakage of the indirect water filled aquifer inspired by the drainage process is as close as possible to the regional recharge the objective function is 6 m i n z 2 δ v δ v objective 3

obtained and the multi objective management model of mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage is established 3 1 groundwater system characteristics analysis

permeability and large pores the aquifer is a direct water filled aquifer that mainly threatens the safety of mine production the third type is the bedrock fissure aquifer which is mainly composed of the yan an and zhiluo groups with dense structures and poor water yield properties the aquiclude is mainly the red clay of the neogene baode group with a maximum thickness of 134 m the thickness of red clay in the mining area gradually decreases from east to west and there is a red clay missing area in the western boundary of the mining area with a cumulative area of 1 31 km2 fig 3 2 hydrochemical characteristics through water sample testing and data collection the hydro chemical characteristics of each aquifer are analyzed zeng et al 2022b wang et al 2020 it can be found that the quaternary aquifer is dominated by ca2 and is evenly distributed in the study area with an average milligram equivalent percentage of 60 3 however the weathered bedrock aquifer is heterogeneous the ca2 in the western panel is 12 higher than that in the east in other words there is a strong hydraulic connection between the quaternary aquifer and the weathered bedrock in the western panel of the weak red clay region fig 4 the average ca2 concentration in quaternary groundwater is 44 81 mg l and the groundwater type is hco3 ca 96 00 the average ca2 concentration in weathered bedrock groundwater is 24 04 mg l and the groundwater type are hco3 ca 42 86 hco3 mg 33 33 and hco3 na 23 81 in addition the inflowing water during and after mining is tested and the source is identified by using the random forest model zhao et al 2020 the basic principle of the random forest model is that after inputting test data each decision tree is first classified separately and then the category with the most classification results is selected as the final output as shown in table 1 the inflowing water during and after mining of the 122 108 working face comes from bedrock aquifer and weathered bedrock aquifer respectively the inflowing water during and after mining of 122 107 working face comes from the weathered bedrock aquifer and the quaternary aquifer respectively the inflowing water after mining of 122 109 working face comes from the quaternary aquifer 3 mine water inflow characteristics the water inflow rate from the 122 108 working face in the 12th eastern panel fig 5 a gradually increases to 487 m3 h during the mining process multiple areas of high water richness were encountered during the period resulting in a sudden increase in water inflow rate the rate continues to fall after the working face has reached in march 2022 according to the measured data on the spot the water conducting fracture zone of the working face has developed to the weathered bedrock and the red clay aquiclude in the east wing is thick it can be seen that the water inflow process in the east wing is relatively simple that is the inflowing water during the mining process is mainly composed of the static storage of the bedrock aquifer and the weathered bedrock aquifer dynamic storage continue to intervene but in small quantities the water inflow rates from the eastern and western panels are not at the same level the 122 109 working face in the 12th western panel fig 5b was completed in july 2021 and the current water inflow rate is stable at 650 m3 h the 122 107 working face began mining in july 2021 and the rate continued to increase the maximum water inflow rate is nearly 1000 m3 h fig 5c the water inflow process in the 12th western panel is complex from the typical profile of the working face fig 4 according to the measured data on the spot the weathered bedrock aquifer is a direct water filled aquifer but the thickness of the quaternary phreatic aquifer here is large and there is a red clay missing area there is a situation where the quaternary phreatic aquifer leaks vertically to recharge the weathered bedrock aquifer 4 seepage field characteristics compared with the flow field of the weathered bedrock aquifer in 2021 12 31 and 2022 02 20 fig 6 it can be seen that two water table depression cones have been formed in the weathered bedrock aquifer among which the water table depression funnel of the 122 109 working face has been stable while the water table depression funnel range of the 122 107 working face has expanded in the direction of coal seam mining the gwl drawdown of the quaternary phreatic aquifer is relatively small and the overall flow field is basically unchanged however according to the distribution of gwl drawdown in the observation boreholes of the quaternary phreatic aquifer fig 7 it can be seen that the area with the largest drawdown in the quaternary aquifer is in the red clay weak zone of working face 122 107 and 122109 with a maximum drawdown of 0 21 m in 20 days in summary the 122 109 working face has been mined out forming a stable water inflow the source of inflow is mainly from the quaternary phreatic aquifer and the lateral recharge of the weathered bedrock aquifer the 122 107 working face is being mined the source is mainly the static storage and lateral recharge of the weathered bedrock aquifer and there is a leakage recharge of the quaternary phreatic aquifer 3 2 establishment of a water inflow model based on modflow 6 in this study modflow 6 langevin et al 2022 is used to develop a numerical model of groundwater flow the software is the latest version of modflow released by the united states geological survey usgs in 2020 in meshing unstructured discretization disu is more flexible than traditional grids the flexible encryption feature of unstructured grid can be used to achieve a refined description of the coal seam mining area grid at the same time the load on the model to calculate the flow field variation in the mining area can be greatly reduced because the number of invalid meshes generated during local encryption is smaller furthermore disu grids subdivision can accurately simulate the missing area of the red clay layer in vertical stratification thus the paths of quaternary leakage recharge to the weathered aquifer can be accurately distinguished direct recharge through the red clay missing area and indirect recharge through the red clay aquiclude based on the comprehensive analysis of the geological and hydrogeological conditions of caojiatan coal mine the model is divided into five layers in the vertical direction which are the quaternary phreatic aquifer neogene red clay aquiclude weathered bedrock confined aquifer bedrock confined aquifer and coal seam horizontally the study area is divided into 200 m 200 m grids overall encrypted into 100 m 100 m grids in the east and west of the 12th panel and further encrypted into 25 m 25 m grids at the working face the second layer of red clay aquiclude is missing in the 12th western panel and the remaining layers are distributed normally fig 8 the boundary conditions of the model are obtained according to the actual hydrogeological conditions according to the characteristics and location of the watershed it is generalized into a confining boundary since others are non natural boundaries in order to reduce the influence of boundary conditions on the model simulation results they are set as general head boundaries in the horizontal direction in the vertical direction the surface is used as the upper boundary of the system receiving rainfall recharge and evaporation discharge the monthly average rainfall and the evaporation intensity at the limiting depth are shown in supplemental fig 1 table 1 in addition the parameter zone of rainfall infiltration coefficient and evaporation intensity is set according to the distribution of the land use type with a 10 m resolution fig 9 a supplemental table 2 the bottom boundary of the model is the impermeable boundary the drain boundary is generalized in the gob of the coal seam working face and the water inflow rate is calculated by simulating the flow into this boundary the water richness of the quaternary aquifer and the weathered bedrock aquifer is determined by the water rich index method zeng et al 2018 according to the multi source information composite principle water richness zoning maps of aquifers are made using the overlapping function of the geographic information system gis for five controlling factors aquifer thickness total core recovery drilling fluid quantity permeability and thickness of brittle and plastic strata we collected 174 boreholes in the study area including 37 boreholes containing hydrogeological data this study has innovated the parameter zoning referring to the results of multi source data fusion the zoning of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield storage coefficient is carried out against the background of water rich partitioning the initial values of each parameter were set with reference to the empirical values of the region the parameter values and zoning were eventually corrected by simulation identification verification the final zoning has been shown in fig 9b c the specific values are provided in supplemental tables 3 4 the parameter sensitivity analysis of the groundwater flow model is performed to better describe the mine water inflow process this paper will use the factor transformation method in the local analysis method this method studies the influence of parameters on the simulation results by changing the fixed amplitude based on the characteristics of this flow model table 2 summarizes the selected 10 model parameters or inputs including hydrogeological parameters and key driving data we set three targets including weathered bedrock gwl quaternary leakage and mine water inflow as a measure of the sensitivity index of specific parameters the sensitivity index is determined by eq 13 13 l i k 1 m s i 1 m s y i a k where l is sensitivity index a k is target parameter m s is the number of analysis groups y i is simulation result gwl it should be noted that the gwl variation of the quaternary phreatic aquifer in the study area is much smaller than the thickness of the aquifer assuming that the saturation thickness of the aquifer remains unchanged xue 2010 the unit impulse response matrix of the control node in the groundwater system is obtained the response matrix can reflect the relationship between drainage volume and gwl quaternary leakage and mine water inflow by replacing the drainage process with the matrix the groundwater flow model and the groundwater management model are linked 3 3 multi objective management model the multi objective management model aims at optimizing the drainage water volume drainage borehole position and drainage time of the 122 107 working face limiting the mine water inflow rate to ensure production safety and controlling the leakage recharge of the quaternary phreatic aquifer to protect the ecological environment the management time is set from january 2022 to january 2023 three months is a management stage which is divided into 4 management stages in the direct water filled aquifer 20 drainage control nodes are set at equal intervals and the final number of drainage boreholes is n the design of drainage boreholes is carried out by 0 1 integer programming combined with the unit impulse response matrix the water inflow constraint and the leakage constraint are set the economic constraint is set by the cost of drainage boreholes based on the above a multi objective management model for advance drainage is constructed the mathematical model is as follows 14 obj m i n z 1 δ q m i n z 2 δ v δ v m i n z 3 δ f s t q y t i 1 20 t 1 4 α i t x i q i t δ q δ q 0 q k t i 1 20 t 1 4 γ i t x i q i t δ v δ v q b

1 20 x i n 4 results 4 1 groundwater model calibration by fitting the regional flow field and gwl long term observation data it can be found that the fitting error between the simulated gwl and the observation data is very small in both aquifers but the flow field shape is slightly different in fig 10 the observation flow field is formed by the interpolation of the gwl of observation boreholes which has the defect of having few control points in the working face area in the simulation the water in the aquifer will converge to the gob by increasing the hydraulic conductivity coefficient of the overburden to generalize the destruction of coal seam mining therefore the simulated gwl funnel center in fig 10b is located in the working face which is more in line with the actual water inrush process for this reason the simulated quaternary gwl at the working face is also lower than the observed interpolated gwl fig 10a further by identifying boundary conditions and hydrogeological parameters a numerical simulation model that can accurately describe the dynamic changes of the groundwater system in the study area is established 4 2 quantitative analysis of the mine water inflow process based on the stable water inflow of the 122 109 working face the water inflow process of the 122 107 working face is simulated through the identification and verification of the budget calculation of the 12th western panel of the model table 3 it can be found that the quaternary phreatic aquifer directly recharges the weathered bedrock aquifer 457 81 m3 h through the red soil loss area and indirectly recharges the weathered bedrock aquifer 225 18 m3 h through the red soil aquiclude quaternary phreatic aquifer weathered bedrock aquifer and bedrock aquifer account for 43 60 47 55 and 8 84 of the water inflow rate in the 12th western panel respectively by dividing the 122 107 working face into a separate balance area it can be calculated that three aquifers account for 19 16 68 45 and 12 39 of the rate according to the data presented above the static storage on 122 109 working faces has been depleted following the end of mining stable mine water inflow is mainly supplied by quaternary leakage at the 122 107 working face in the early stage of mining the mine water inflow rate is increasing at present the source of mine water is mainly the static storage of the weathered bedrock aquifer it can be expected that as the weathered bedrock static storage deplete its drawdown cone will gradually increase and the quaternary leakage will also increase 4 3 parameters sensitivity analysis each parameter is set to five levels for this sensitivity analysis the third level is the value of each parameter after identification and the other four levels are floated by the third level by 10 and 20 in the simulation the specific parameter values are changed and the model is run to obtain the amplitude of gwl mine water inflow and quaternary leakage in each case the large amplitude indicates that the parameter has a great influence on the simulation results and the sensitivity is high otherwise the sensitivity is low three observation boreholes were selected in the weathered bedrock aquifer which were fhs 1 ht02 and ddc6 from far to near the working face the model is run to stability and the gwl variation and sensitivity index of each observation borehole are obtained the variation of mine water inflow and quaternary leakage is analyzed in the equilibrium area and not at a specific location the sensitivity of 10 parameters to the gwl change of the weathered bedrock aquifer is shown in fig 11 a mine water inflow is the main driving force of the model and vk4 directly affects the gwl change of the weathered bedrock aquifer it has the greatest sensitivity simultaneously comparing the three boreholes reveals that the closer to the working face the greater the influence intensity of vk4 in addition hk3 and vk1 represent the ability of weathered bedrock aquifer to receive lateral recharge and vertical leakage respectively these two parameters are also very sensitive to gwl changes the sensitivity of the 10 parameters to the change of mine water inflow and quaternary overflow is shown in fig 11b parameter vk4 plays a leading role in mine water inrush while hk3 also has a greater impact except for hk4 and ss4 the other parameters are very sensitive to the quaternary leakage 4 4 advance drainage rule analysis a series of unit response matrices that reflect the characteristics of groundwater systems are calculated by setting the pulse drainage volume at a single node of the model each drainage node is repeated in turn to form an impulse response matrix by selecting five drainage nodes fig 13 located at the center of the red clay missing area i 1 the edge of the red clay missing area i 2 the thickness of 0 7 m red clay i 3 the thickness of 1 3 m red clay i 4 and the thickness of 2 8 m red clay i 5 the amount of water drained was set at 10 20 30 40 and 50 m3 h and the dynamic characteristics were compared to analyze the law of drainage process under the same drainage rate of 10 m3 h the drainage point located in the red clay missing area has the smallest stable decline and the fastest time to reach stability fig 12 a with the increase in red clay thickness the drawdown increases gradually and the stabilization time slows down gradually with the increase of drainage volume the final stable drawdown fig 12b the quaternary leakage increase fig 12c and the mine water inflow decrease fig 12d all increase linearly also the slope of the linear increase increases with the thickness of the red clay the linear relationship is coupled into the multi objective management model for optimization 4 5 comparative analysis of drainage schemes according to the previous drainage work of 122 109 working face the single borehole drainage volume of 122 107 working face is set to 50 m3 h 20 drainage boreholes are set at equal intervals and the common drainage is used as the traditional comparison scheme the results of the comparison between the traditional scheme and the optimized scheme are presented in table 4 it can be found that the number of drainage boreholes in the optimization scheme reduces by 50 compared with the traditional scheme and the location of the drainage boreholes is determined by 0 1 integer programming fig 13 in the optimization scheme the drainage volume in the 4 management periods from january to march april to june july to september and october to december is 388 06 622 42 1158 41 and 304 87 m3 h respectively in comparison to the traditional scheme s total annual drainage of 8 76 106 m3 the optimized scheme s total annual drainage is 5 21 106 m3 a 40 6 reduction more importantly under the condition that the decrease of mine water inflow in the two schemes is basically the same the average increase of quaternary leakage in the optimization scheme decreases by 53 36 that is in the optimization scheme when the amount of drainage boreholes and drainage volume are halved the average water inflow decrease is basically the same and the increase in leakage is greatly reduced 5 discussion 5 1 response of the groundwater system to coal mining disturbance as a violent human activity coal mining has a great influence on the groundwater system in addition to advance drainage for safe mining damage to aquifer structures caused by mining can further exacerbate the loss of water resources traditional researches have mainly focused on direct water filled aquifers within the formation of water conducting fractured zones resulting in a significant difference between prediction and actual mine water inflow ma et al 2020 in fact with the sharp decline in the gwl of the direct water filled aquifer the captured lateral recharge and vertical leakage will increase such problems can only be avoided if the aquifers of the entire mining area are systematically analyzed as a whole we further propose a new water inrush mode namely derivative dynamic water inrush its definition is that the evolution of the groundwater system caused by roof overburden failure will induce new disaster sources thus forming a multi factor water inrush mode its connotation is to change the basis for defining water inrush mode from traditional static analysis before mining to dynamic evaluation considering the change in the whole mining cycle the drainage technology proposed in this study will lay out the drilling position for the water richness area of the direct water filled aquifer and will also fully consider the recharge of the indirect aquifer to set the amount of drainage and drainage time so as to achieve the multiple objectives of efficient drainage and ensuring mine production and ecological security fig 14 5 2 analysis of advance drainage effect in the above advance drainage rule we can find that the drainage node located in the red clay missing area can better accept the leakage recharge of the quaternary aquifer therefore in the case of the same volume of drainage the drawdown will increase with the increase in red clay thickness obviously greater drawdown and funnel coverage will increase the amount of vertical leakage in fact the amount of advance drainage should be divided into two parts bevan et al 2005 one part is the static storage stored in the aquifer itself and the other part is the dynamic storage that receives lateral and vertical recharge after the formation of steady flow for static storage we should choose efficient drainage methods to reduce the gwl to a safe height as soon as possible for dynamic storage we should combine the economic benefits of water resources for sustainable utilization however this study did not adequately consider the drainage process for the complex transition from static to dynamic storage following that we will continue to optimize drainage technology taking into account the relationship between dynamic and static reserves as well as the economic benefits of water resources utilization in addition the total amount of the increase in the leakage recharge of the quaternary aquifer is composed of two parts the direct leakage through the red clay missing area and the indirect leakage through the red clay layer the increase in drainage volume does not basically affect the proportion between the two parts but the increase in red clay thickness will increase indirect leakage the proportion of increase in the indirect leakage is 7 79 8 68 13 26 26 84 and 30 67 previous research has consistently demonstrated aquiclude s confining capacity as its thickness li et al 2017 this set of ratio data shows that the confining capacity of the red clay is not linearly related to its thickness we further test the mineral composition of the red clay in the weak area and the conventional area the results show that the red clay in the weak area is at the sedimentary edge and the content of clay minerals that act as the water barrier in this position is significantly lower than that of the conventional area based on this we can further refine the confining capacity of the aquifuge to determine the hydraulic connection between the aquifers which is of great help to improve the drainage efficiency 5 3 ecological water security ecological water security is an important objective constraint of drainage technology in this study the key problem that this technology can solve is how to quantitatively express the constraints as mathematical models to protect the safety of ecological water resources we established two thresholds ecological water level and water volume to limit vertical leakage under drainage through comprehensive research and analysis of ecological vegetation in the study area ma et al 2021 chen et al 2021 the maximum threshold of ecological groundwater level depth in the quaternary aquifer is 5 m according to the current average gwl depth 3 7 m of the quaternary aquifer the allowed drawdown is 1 3 m the amount of water available for leakage to the directly water filled aquifer is abundant which is calculated by regional area and specific yield however the results of numerical simulation calculations are not optimistic in the numerical model by setting up virtual pumping wells in the management area and constantly adjusting the amount of pumping water the relationship between the stable final gwl and equilibrium terms such as rainfall evaporation and lateral inflow is analyzed the maximum allowable gwl drawdown of the quaternary aquifer in the management area is 0 73 m because of the limited rainfall recharge that can be received the early gwl decline process maintains balance by reducing the regional lateral outflow when it is greater than the maximum drawdown the impact range of the drawdown funnel and the drawdown rate are obviously accelerated when the drawdown is 0 73 m the total pump output of the virtual borehole is 600 m3 h that is to say the drainage ecological groundwater volume threshold is set to 600 m3 h the drainage ecological groundwater level threshold h 0 j obtained by subtracting the maximum gwl depth 5 m from the surface elevation 6 conclusion 1 based on the numerical simulation model that fully characterizes the dynamic changes of the groundwater system a groundwater management model is established in combination with multi objective constraints such as mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage the optimal drainage scheme for the location of the drainage boreholes the drainage volume and the time management is obtained through objective programming 2 in the process of deriving the dynamic characteristics of the groundwater system from the simulation model it is found that when there is an indirect aquifer leakage recharge condition if the recharge conditions are stronger the drainage depth at the same discharge volume is smaller the time to reach stability is faster and the increase in leakage recharge and the decrease in mine water inflow rate will be smaller at the same time the drawdown the increase of leakage recharge and the decrease of water inflow rate all increase linearly with the increase in drainage volume the weaker the recharge condition the greater the slope of the linear increase 3 according to the analysis of the geological characteristics and water inflow characteristics of the caojiatan mine it is determined that the water inflow of the 122 107 working face is composed of the quaternary aquifer the weathered bedrock aquifer and the bedrock aquifer the proportions of groundwater inflow from each layer according to numerical simulation are 19 16 68 45 and 12 39 respectively 4 compared with the traditional equidistant drainage scheme the optimization scheme takes into account the time relationship of the quaternary aquifer receiving rainfall recharge in the case of roughly halving the amount of drainage boreholes and drainage volume the average reduction of water inflow rate is basically the same and the increase in leakage is greatly reduced this method can provide a new management mode for advance drainage of roof aquifers in ecologically fragile areas these findings can provide a scientific basis for the protection of

2157,the two main factors of groundwater system disturbance in coal mines are mine water inflow caused by overburden destruction and advance drainage projects as the main means of mine water hazard control an urgent problem to be solved in the ecologically fragile area is how to minimize the impact of advance drainage on the groundwater ecological environment while reducing mine water inflow rate to ensure safe production this paper proposes an optimal advance drainage technology based on multi objective groundwater management based on the analysis of the respective relationship between the drainage groundwater level and the capture supply and mine water inflow rate the concept and mathematical expression of the drainage threshold of the mine and the ecological environment are put forward for the first time based on the numerical simulation model this technology fully describes the dynamic changes of the groundwater system and establishes a groundwater management model with multi objective constraints such as mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage the optimal drainage scheme for the boreholes location the drainage volume and the time distribution is obtained through objective programming while reducing drainage volume and ensuring mine production safety the impact on the locally important phreatic groundwater is significantly reduced effectively resolving the contradiction between ecological water resource protection and mine safety production in the example of a coal mine in northwest china by comparing the traditional equal drainage scheme the optimized advance drainage technology fully considers the water richness characteristics and the dynamic changes of the groundwater system during the drainage process the number of boreholes in the optimization scheme is reduced by 50 and the total drainage volume is reduced by 40 60 more importantly under the condition that the decrease of mine water inflow rate in the two schemes is basically the same the average increase of quaternary leakage in the optimization scheme decreases by 53 36 through this technology the ecological critical value in the study area is evaluated when the regional quaternary groundwater level decreases by more than 0 73 m the impact range of the drawdown funnel and the drawdown rate are obviously accelerated it provides a scientific foundation for groundwater resource management and low carbon mining in ecologically fragile areas keywords coal mine water hazard controlling groundwater management model coal water dual resource mining mine water inflow modflow6 data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction deep coal and groundwater resources are in the same geological structure forming a coupling system of surface ecology groundwater resources coal resources in vertical space in the process of developing coal resources groundwater systems will inevitably be affected or damaged in ecologically fragile areas the problem of groundwater and ecological environment damage is more serious song et al 2021 liu et al 2019 xie et al 2018 the protection and utilization of water resources is a major issue facing green coal mining coal mining is an important pillar of the chinese economy wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 however in china coal resources and water resources are inversely distributed according to the shaped distribution pattern in fig 1 in the central region proven coal resources account for 75 6 of the country while water resources account for only 25 5 in the jurassic coalfield of the central region the water resource content is further reduced accounting for only 3 9 of the country in these ecologically fragile areas coal mining consumes 4 3 billion m3 a of water this makes the local ecological problems more acute ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china 2021 the regions with abundant coal resources and high mining intensity are called large coal production bases western china coal bases are mainly mining jurassic coalfields and they mainly face the threat of roof water during the mining process the main means of water hazard control in mines is advance drilling and drainage of directly water filled aquifers wu 2013 the impact of coal seam mining on the groundwater system is divided into two main parts one is the advance drainage of the coal seam before coal seam mining to ensure production safety the other is that during coal seam mining the structure of the overburden aquifer is destroyed and its permeability increases exponentially groundwater flows to the mine s working face through water conducting cracks meng et al 2016 liang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 both processes occur in directly water filled aquifers that are touched by water conducting crack zones however an important thing is often ignored the aquifuge between the direct and indirect aquifers is pinched out or its confining capacity is weak when the gwl of the direct fill aquifer decreases sharply leakage from the indirect aquifer usually the quaternary aquifer also increases which often leads to an imbalance in the surface ecology yang et al 2016 in addition the current advance drainage methods are mainly intended to ensure the safety of mine production the criterion for drainage is to lower the gwl of the direct aquifer to the floor elevation qin 2019 as a result in northwest coal producing areas where water resources are scarce reckless advance drainage methods on the one hand waste and pollute water resources due to a lack of scientific management fan et al 2019 zeng et al 2022a on the other hand it will break the fragile water resources balance in the region and directly affect the sustainable development of the local economy society and ecological environment many studies have been conducted on the groundwater system in the coal seam roof the distribution of the water richness was analyzed by the variable weight theory and the multi source data fusion theory in combination with the development height of the water conducting crack zone of the overburden the method for evaluating the risk of mine water inflow was established wu et al 2011 2015 2017 zeng et al 2016 2018 zhu et al 2018 the risk zoning is very helpful to determine the location of drainage boreholes besides the basic research on hydraulic exchange between aquifer and borehole is of great significance for drainage design tu et al 2020 adequate refinement of the drainage process for laminar and turbulent flow characteristics also can allow for better parameters setting liu et al 2021 numerical simulation is the main means of analyzing changes in groundwater systems okkonen and klove 2011 and is of great help in water inflow rate prediction cheng et al 2020 inter layer hydraulic connection qu et al 2021 and drainage studies zhao et al 2020 2019 however how to fully consider the characteristics of mine water inflow and ecological water security get drainage borehole arrangement drainage volume and drainage time optimal integrated management is an unsolved problem in mine areas too many drainage boreholes undoubtedly reduce drainage efficiency ignoring the proportion of dynamic and static storage of water filled aquifers and setting the drainage target gwl too low will over drain the water volume and capture the leakage of the quaternary indirect water filled aquifer resulting in a large waste of water resources increasing the drainage burden and destroying the ecology of the mining area in fact many objectives such as mine safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage are contradictory the bottleneck of advance drainage technology in ecologically fragile areas is determining the optimal solution multi objective programming is an important branch of operational research it is a mathematical method of scientific management developed to solve multi objective decision making problems mavrotas 2009 it has many applications in groundwater resources management macewan et al 2017 usually the physical constraints of a basin s water system are constructed through groundwater numerical simulation and then combined with economic objectives optimization to drive water management decisions li et al 2013 xin et al 2021 later many scholars combined a data driven model zhao et al 2019 sun et al 2022 a multi objective evolutionary algorithm song 2020 a genetic algorithm ayvaz 2016 and other optimization processes to quickly get the optimal solution of a large scale refined multi objective management model alizadeh et al 2017 vali et al 2021 ejaz et al 2022 there are few studies on multi objective management of mine hydrology mu et al 2022 wu et al 2000 2010 put forward the optimization scheme of mine water inflow treatment in the trinity of drainage water supply and environmental protection from a macro perspective and then gradually formed the five in one optimization management mode of mine water control treatment utilization recharge and ecological protection in section 2 we introduce the whole process of advance drainage technology to achieve multiple objectives in terms of mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage we discuss the importance of groundwater protection in coal mining in ecologically fragile areas and summarize the mathematical concepts of constraints then we describe in section 3 the study region for the technology application detailing the characteristics of groundwater system changes caused by coal mining we can establish a multi objective management model based on the actual data of the study area in section 4 we apply this technology to the quantitative characterization of mine water inflow processes and the design of advance drainage schemes we conclude with a discussion of the effects and keys to implementing this technology this method can effectively solve the contradiction between ecological water resources protection and mine safety production and provide a new management technology for the realization of co mining of mine water dual resources in ecologically fragile areas 2 methods of advance drainage technology we develop an innovative advance drainage technology under multi objective management based on system engineering and multi objective management the method determines the decision variables based on the characteristic parameters of the groundwater system in the water filled aquifer of the coal seam roof sets the water inflow constraint according to mine production safety the indirect aquifer leakage recharge constraint according to ecological water security and the drilling and drainage cost constraint according to economic benefit and constructs multiple objective functions then the optimal solution set of the multi objective management model is obtained by solving the linear objective programming algorithm which can realize the integrated management of drainage borehole layout drainage volume and drainage time while reducing the cost of drainage and ensuring the continuous and efficient mining of coal resources the critical value of water control and drainage in the study area is evaluated to prevent the waste of water resources in the whole groundwater system and avoid the destruction of the ecological environment in the mining area it provides a scientific basis for the management of groundwater resources in ecologically fragile areas and the safe and low carbon mining of mines before fully introducing this optimized drainage technology some concepts and their mathematical calculations should be clarified in the traditional mine hydrogeological analysis only the water filled aquifers within the coal mining fracture zone are concerned therefore this paper refers to them as direct water filled aquifers and the aquifers outside the range of the water conducting fracture zone are called indirect water filled aquifers the influence of such aquifers has often been ignored in past studies indirect aquifers tend to be closer to the surface consist of loose sediments and contain abundant phreatic water resources they are of great significance to vegetation ecology crop irrigation and human daily life in this study two thresholds are set to achieve the protection of ecological water resources one is the drainage ecological groundwater level threshold based on surface ecology it is determined by clarifying the correlation between gwl and vegetation growth the other is the drainage ecological groundwater volume threshold based on the principle of groundwater balance it is determined by the regional phreatic balance recharge and the captured lateral recharge as the gwl drops the evaporation rate decreases and the captured lateral recharge increases so the volume threshold is determined by the relationship between the gwl and the phreatic balance recharge from numerical simulations for the mining industry production safety and its costs are particularly important we ensure mining safety by reducing mine water inflow rate and improve drainage efficiency by reducing drilling costs and drainage volumes in summary the multi objective management technology process based on ecological water resources protection mine production safety and efficient drainage is shown in fig 2 including 1 analysis of groundwater system characteristics according to the principle of water balance and groundwater system theory when the groundwater system receives the input information the output information must be produced after conversion by the geological body ascott et al 2020 bidwell 2005 park et al 2021 the response between input and output is controlled by hydrogeological conditions padilla et al 2015 venvik and boogaard 2020 yidana et al 2014 through a comprehensive analysis of four aspects including geology seepage hydrochemistry and mine water inflow the water richness of the water filled aquifer can be evaluated the composition of mine water inflow can be qualitatively evaluated and the water inflow process can be preliminary characterized the conceptual model of mine hydrogeology is established through an in depth analysis of the characteristics of the groundwater system and it is the basis for establishing a numerical model that can represent the dynamic changes of groundwater in the mine area this determines the decision variables for the multi objective drainage model including management area management time and drainage borehole control points 2 establish distribution parameters groundwater model of the mining area most of the mines have production as the main purpose and its hydrogeological information is inadequate therefore based on the theory of multi source data fusion fully tap the mine drilling information on the partition evaluation of aquifer parameters combined with the initial gwl the boundary conditions the source and sink information and the mine water inflow rate the hydrogeological conceptual model in the mining area is established the three dimensional unsteady flow model is established based on the groundwater flow and boundary control equation eq 1 finally the model is verified according to the actual gwl monitoring data and mine water inflow rate data by establishing the numerical simulation model of groundwater flow in the mining area the actual mine water inflow process is quantitatively characterized on this basis the mathematical relationship is obtained by using the response matrix method xu and shao 1988 among the amount of drainage and gwl of the direct aquifer mine water inflow rate the leakage of indirect aquifer 1 x k 1

management model is established by setting decision variables constraints and objective functions in the direct water filled aquifer that is affected by the water conducting crack zone drainage control nodes m are set at equal intervals and the dynamic change of the groundwater system is coupled into the management model as a constraint condition through the response matrix according to the changes in recharge in the management time of the groundwater system and the safety requirements of the mine production the drainage volume of each drainage node at different times is managed at the same time the drainage nodes with low drainage efficiency are eliminated by the economic constraint target and the remaining nodes are collected to form the well location distribution setting scheme in the process of solving the calculation the deviation variable is introduced and the contradiction between the subjective desire and the actual conditions is eliminated by setting the soft constraint conditions so as to achieve the optimal scheme design under the constraints of limiting the mine water inflow rate controlling the leakage of the indirect water filled aquifer and efficient drainage including ① decision variables the decision variables in this study are the borehole layout parameter x i and the water drainage q i t of different management time zone t on each drainage control node management time is divided into m time zones ② objective constraints objective 1 coal mining safety water inflow constraint 2 q y t i 1 m t 1 m α i t x i q i t δ q δ q q y t where i is

inflow rate caused by the unit pulse drainage of direct water filled aquifer at the i th node in time t the management model of this study is solved by multi objective programming by adding positive and negative deviation variables to hard constraints they are transformed into soft constraints so that each solution target is close to the ideal value the objective function expresses the problem of determining the minimum value from various deviation variables shao et al 1999 objective 1 requires the working face water inflow rate to be as low as possible or even no water so as to ensure safety production of the mine the objective function is 3 m i n z 1 δ q objective 2 ecological water resources protection resource constraint 4 q k t i 1 m t 1 m γ i j t x i q i t δ v δ v q b t where q k t

at the i th node in time t to achieve this objective the regional recharge will be divided into m time zones according to the change of year in order to control the amount of drainage which will change with the change of recharge such as rainfall a hard constraint exists to ensure that the indirect aquifer gwl can meet the mining surface ecological vegetation is not destroyed 5 h j i 1 m j 1

node at the jth node in time t depending on the region the rising height of groundwater and the length of vegetation roots can be used to calculate the ecological groundwater level h 0 to ensure that the vertical leakage of the indirect water filled aquifer inspired by the drainage process is as close as possible to the regional recharge the objective function is 6 m i n z 2 δ v δ v objective 3

the j th node in time t the multi objective management model of drainage is composed of the constraint conditions and objective functions of eqs 2 12 the optimal drainage position drainage volume and drainage time are obtained by using the objective programming solution 3 application in an ecologically fragile mining area by analyzing the characteristics of the groundwater system in the coal mine in western china a numerical simulation model of groundwater is established based on the model after identification and verification the unit impulse response matrix of the groundwater system is obtained and the multi objective management model of mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage is established 3 1 groundwater system characteristics analysis 1 geological characteristics caojiatan coal mine in shaanxi province china is located in the west central part of the phase i planning area of yulin shenmu mining area with a total area of 108 49 km2 fig 3 there are three types of aquifers above the 2 2 coal seam fig 4 the first type is the quaternary pore phreatic aquifer which is mainly composed of the salawusu group aquifer and the lishi group weak aquifer it is easy to accept rainfall recharge and lateral recharge is sufficient the second type is the weathered bedrock double porosity aquifer which has joint fissure development strong permeability and large pores the aquifer is a direct water filled aquifer that mainly threatens the safety of mine production the third type is the bedrock fissure aquifer which is mainly composed of the yan an and zhiluo groups with dense structures and poor water yield properties the aquiclude is mainly the red clay of the neogene baode group with a maximum thickness of 134 m the thickness of red clay in the mining area gradually decreases from east to west and there is a red clay missing area in the western boundary of the mining area with a cumulative area of 1 31 km2 fig 3 2 hydrochemical characteristics through water sample testing and data collection the hydro chemical characteristics of each aquifer are analyzed zeng et al 2022b wang et al 2020 it can be found that the quaternary aquifer is dominated by ca2 and is evenly distributed in the study area with an average milligram equivalent percentage of 60 3 however the weathered bedrock aquifer is heterogeneous the ca2 in the western panel is 12 higher than that in the east in other words there is a strong hydraulic connection between the quaternary aquifer and the weathered bedrock in the western panel of the weak red clay region fig 4 the average ca2 concentration in quaternary groundwater is 44 81 mg l and the groundwater type is hco3 ca 96 00 the average ca2 concentration in weathered bedrock groundwater is 24 04 mg l and the groundwater type are hco3 ca 42 86 hco3 mg 33 33 and hco3 na 23 81 in addition the inflowing water during and after mining is tested and the source is identified by using the random forest model zhao et al 2020 the basic principle of the random forest model is that after inputting test data each decision tree is first classified separately and then the category with the most classification results is selected as the final output as shown in table 1 the inflowing water during and after mining of the 122 108 working face comes from bedrock aquifer and weathered bedrock aquifer respectively the inflowing water during and after mining of 122 107 working face comes from the weathered bedrock aquifer and the quaternary aquifer respectively the inflowing water after mining of 122 109 working face comes from the quaternary aquifer 3 mine water inflow characteristics the water inflow rate from the 122 108 working face in the 12th eastern panel fig 5 a gradually increases to 487 m3 h during the mining process multiple areas of high water richness were encountered during the period resulting in a sudden increase in water inflow rate the rate continues to fall after the working face has reached in march 2022 according to the measured data on the spot the water conducting fracture zone of the working face has developed to the weathered bedrock and the red clay aquiclude in the east wing is thick it can be seen that the water inflow process in the east wing is relatively simple that is the inflowing water during the mining process is mainly composed of the static storage of the bedrock aquifer and the weathered bedrock aquifer dynamic storage continue to intervene but in small quantities the water inflow rates from the eastern and western panels are not at the same level the 122 109 working face in the 12th western panel fig 5b was completed in july 2021 and the current water inflow rate is stable at 650 m3 h the 122 107 working face began mining in july 2021 and the rate continued to increase the maximum water inflow rate is nearly 1000 m3 h fig 5c the water inflow process in the 12th western panel is complex from the typical profile of the working face fig 4 according to the measured data on the spot the weathered bedrock aquifer is a direct water filled aquifer but the thickness of the quaternary phreatic aquifer here is large and there is a red clay missing area there is a situation where the quaternary phreatic aquifer leaks vertically to recharge the weathered bedrock aquifer 4 seepage field characteristics compared with the flow field of the weathered bedrock aquifer in 2021 12 31 and 2022 02 20 fig 6 it can be seen that two water table depression cones have been formed in the weathered bedrock aquifer among which the water table depression funnel of the 122 109 working face has been stable while the water table depression funnel range of the 122 107 working face has expanded in the direction of coal seam mining the gwl drawdown of the quaternary phreatic aquifer is relatively small and the overall flow field is basically unchanged however according to the distribution of gwl drawdown in the observation boreholes of the quaternary phreatic aquifer fig 7 it can be seen that the area with the largest drawdown in the quaternary aquifer is in the red clay weak zone of working face 122 107 and 122109 with a maximum drawdown of 0 21 m in 20 days in summary the 122 109 working face has been mined out forming a stable water inflow the source of inflow is mainly from the quaternary phreatic aquifer and the lateral recharge of the weathered bedrock aquifer the 122 107 working face is being mined the source is mainly the static storage and lateral recharge of the weathered bedrock aquifer and there is a leakage recharge of the quaternary phreatic aquifer 3 2 establishment of a water inflow model based on modflow 6 in this study modflow 6 langevin et al 2022 is used to develop a numerical model of groundwater flow the software is the latest version of modflow released by the united states geological survey usgs in 2020 in meshing unstructured discretization disu is more flexible than traditional grids the flexible encryption feature of unstructured grid can be used to achieve a refined description of the coal seam mining area grid at the same time the load on the model to calculate the flow field variation in the mining area can be greatly reduced because the number of invalid meshes generated during local encryption is smaller furthermore disu grids subdivision can accurately simulate the missing area of the red clay layer in vertical stratification thus the paths of quaternary leakage recharge to the weathered aquifer can be accurately distinguished direct recharge through the red clay missing area and indirect recharge through the red clay aquiclude based on the comprehensive analysis of the geological and hydrogeological conditions of caojiatan coal mine the model is divided into five layers in the vertical direction which are the quaternary phreatic aquifer neogene red clay aquiclude weathered bedrock confined aquifer bedrock confined aquifer and coal seam horizontally the study area is divided into 200 m 200 m grids overall encrypted into 100 m 100 m grids in the east and west of the 12th panel and further encrypted into 25 m 25 m grids at the working face the second layer of red clay aquiclude is missing in the 12th western panel and the remaining layers are distributed normally fig 8 the boundary conditions of the model are obtained according to the actual hydrogeological conditions according to the characteristics and location of the watershed it is generalized into a confining boundary since others are non natural boundaries in order to reduce the influence of boundary conditions on the model simulation results they are set as general head boundaries in the horizontal direction in the vertical direction the surface is used as the upper boundary of the system receiving rainfall recharge and evaporation discharge the monthly average rainfall and the evaporation intensity at the limiting depth are shown in supplemental fig 1 table 1 in addition the parameter zone of rainfall infiltration coefficient and evaporation intensity is set according to the distribution of the land use type with a 10 m resolution fig 9 a supplemental table 2 the bottom boundary of the model is the impermeable boundary the drain boundary is generalized in the gob of the coal seam working face and the water inflow rate is calculated by simulating the flow into this boundary the water richness of the quaternary aquifer and the weathered bedrock aquifer is determined by the water rich index method zeng et al 2018 according to the multi source information composite principle water richness zoning maps of aquifers are made using the overlapping function of the geographic information system gis for five controlling factors aquifer thickness total core recovery drilling fluid quantity permeability and thickness of brittle and plastic strata we collected 174 boreholes in the study area including 37 boreholes containing hydrogeological data this study has innovated the parameter zoning referring to the results of multi source data fusion the zoning of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield storage coefficient is carried out against the background of water rich partitioning the initial values of each parameter were set with reference to the empirical values of the region the parameter values and zoning were eventually corrected by simulation identification verification the final zoning has been shown in fig 9b c the specific values are provided in supplemental tables 3 4 the parameter sensitivity analysis of the groundwater flow model is performed to better describe the mine water inflow process this paper will use the factor transformation method in the local analysis method this method studies the influence of parameters on the simulation results by changing the fixed amplitude based on the characteristics of this flow model table 2 summarizes the selected 10 model parameters or inputs including hydrogeological parameters and key driving data we set three targets including weathered bedrock gwl quaternary leakage and mine water inflow as a measure of the sensitivity index of specific parameters the sensitivity index is determined by eq 13 13 l i k 1 m s i 1 m s y i a k where l is sensitivity index a k is target parameter m s is the number of analysis groups y i is simulation result gwl it should be noted that the gwl variation of the quaternary phreatic aquifer in the study area is much smaller than the thickness of the aquifer assuming that the saturation thickness of the aquifer remains unchanged xue 2010 the unit impulse response matrix of the control node in the groundwater system is obtained the response matrix can reflect the relationship between drainage volume and gwl quaternary leakage and mine water inflow by replacing the drainage process with the matrix the groundwater flow model and the groundwater management model are linked 3 3 multi objective management model the multi objective management model aims at optimizing the drainage water volume drainage borehole position and drainage time of the 122 107 working face limiting the mine water inflow rate to ensure production safety and controlling the leakage recharge of the quaternary phreatic aquifer to protect the ecological environment the management time is set from january 2022 to january 2023 three months is a management stage which is divided into 4 management stages in the direct water filled aquifer 20 drainage control nodes are set at equal intervals and the final number of drainage boreholes is n the design of drainage boreholes is carried out by 0 1 integer programming combined with the unit impulse response matrix the water inflow constraint and the leakage constraint are set the economic constraint is set by the cost of drainage boreholes based on the above a multi objective management model for advance drainage is constructed the mathematical model is as follows 14 obj m i n z 1 δ q m i n z 2 δ v δ v m i n z 3 δ f s t q y t i 1 20 t 1 4 α i t x i q i t δ q δ q 0 q k t i 1 20 t 1 4 γ i t x i q i t δ v δ v q b

1 20 x i n 4 results 4 1 groundwater model calibration by fitting the regional flow field and gwl long term observation data it can be found that the fitting error between the simulated gwl and the observation data is very small in both aquifers but the flow field shape is slightly different in fig 10 the observation flow field is formed by the interpolation of the gwl of observation boreholes which has the defect of having few control points in the working face area in the simulation the water in the aquifer will converge to the gob by increasing the hydraulic conductivity coefficient of the overburden to generalize the destruction of coal seam mining therefore the simulated gwl funnel center in fig 10b is located in the working face which is more in line with the actual water inrush process for this reason the simulated quaternary gwl at the working face is also lower than the observed interpolated gwl fig 10a further by identifying boundary conditions and hydrogeological parameters a numerical simulation model that can accurately describe the dynamic changes of the groundwater system in the study area is established 4 2 quantitative analysis of the mine water inflow process based on the stable water inflow of the 122 109 working face the water inflow process of the 122 107 working face is simulated through the identification and verification of the budget calculation of the 12th western panel of the model table 3 it can be found that the quaternary phreatic aquifer directly recharges the weathered bedrock aquifer 457 81 m3 h through the red soil loss area and indirectly recharges the weathered bedrock aquifer 225 18 m3 h through the red soil aquiclude quaternary phreatic aquifer weathered bedrock aquifer and bedrock aquifer account for 43 60 47 55 and 8 84 of the water inflow rate in the 12th western panel respectively by dividing the 122 107 working face into a separate balance area it can be calculated that three aquifers account for 19 16 68 45 and 12 39 of the rate according to the data presented above the static storage on 122 109 working faces has been depleted following the end of mining stable mine water inflow is mainly supplied by quaternary leakage at the 122 107 working face in the early stage of mining the mine water inflow rate is increasing at present the source of mine water is mainly the static storage of the weathered bedrock aquifer it can be expected that as the weathered bedrock static storage deplete its drawdown cone will gradually increase and the quaternary leakage will also increase 4 3 parameters sensitivity analysis each parameter is set to five levels for this sensitivity analysis the third level is the value of each parameter after identification and the other four levels are floated by the third level by 10 and 20 in the simulation the specific parameter values are changed and the model is run to obtain the amplitude of gwl mine water inflow and quaternary leakage in each case the large amplitude indicates that the parameter has a great influence on the simulation results and the sensitivity is high otherwise the sensitivity is low three observation boreholes were selected in the weathered bedrock aquifer which were fhs 1 ht02 and ddc6 from far to near the working face the model is run to stability and the gwl variation and sensitivity index of each observation borehole are obtained the variation of mine water inflow and quaternary leakage is analyzed in the equilibrium area and not at a specific location the sensitivity of 10 parameters to the gwl change of the weathered bedrock aquifer is shown in fig 11 a mine water inflow is the main driving force of the model and vk4 directly affects the gwl change of the weathered bedrock aquifer it has the greatest sensitivity simultaneously comparing the three boreholes reveals that the closer to the working face the greater the influence intensity of vk4 in addition hk3 and vk1 represent the ability of weathered bedrock aquifer to receive lateral recharge and vertical leakage respectively these two parameters are also very sensitive to gwl changes the sensitivity of the 10 parameters to the change of mine water inflow and quaternary overflow is shown in fig 11b parameter vk4 plays a leading role in mine water inrush while hk3 also has a greater impact except for hk4 and ss4 the other parameters are very sensitive to the quaternary leakage 4 4 advance drainage rule analysis a series of unit response matrices that reflect the characteristics of groundwater systems are calculated by setting the pulse drainage volume at a single node of the model each drainage node is repeated in turn to form an impulse response matrix by selecting five drainage nodes fig 13 located at the center of the red clay missing area i 1 the edge of the red clay missing area i 2 the thickness of 0 7 m red clay i 3 the thickness of 1 3 m red clay i 4 and the thickness of 2 8 m red clay i 5 the amount of water drained was set at 10 20 30 40 and 50 m3 h and the dynamic characteristics were compared to analyze the law of drainage process under the same drainage rate of 10 m3 h the drainage point located in the red clay missing area has the smallest stable decline and the fastest time to reach stability fig 12 a with the increase in red clay thickness the drawdown increases gradually and the stabilization time slows down gradually with the increase of drainage volume the final stable drawdown fig 12b the quaternary leakage increase fig 12c and the mine water inflow decrease fig 12d all increase linearly also the slope of the linear increase increases with the thickness of the red clay the linear relationship is coupled into the multi objective management model for optimization 4 5 comparative analysis of drainage schemes according to the previous drainage work of 122 109 working face the single borehole drainage volume of 122 107 working face is set to 50 m3 h 20 drainage boreholes are set at equal intervals and the common drainage is used as the traditional comparison scheme the results of the comparison between the traditional scheme and the optimized scheme are presented in table 4 it can be found that the number of drainage boreholes in the optimization scheme reduces by 50 compared with the traditional scheme and the location of the drainage boreholes is determined by 0 1 integer programming fig 13 in the optimization scheme the drainage volume in the 4 management periods from january to march april to june july to september and october to december is 388 06 622 42 1158 41 and 304 87 m3 h respectively in comparison to the traditional scheme s total annual drainage of 8 76 106 m3 the optimized scheme s total annual drainage is 5 21 106 m3 a 40 6 reduction more importantly under the condition that the decrease of mine water inflow in the two schemes is basically the same the average increase of quaternary leakage in the optimization scheme decreases by 53 36 that is in the optimization scheme when the amount of drainage boreholes and drainage volume are halved the average water inflow decrease is basically the same and the increase in leakage is greatly reduced 5 discussion 5 1 response of the groundwater system to coal mining disturbance as a violent human activity coal mining has a great influence on the groundwater system in addition to advance drainage for safe mining damage to aquifer structures caused by mining can further exacerbate the loss of water resources traditional researches have mainly focused on direct water filled aquifers within the formation of water conducting fractured zones resulting in a significant difference between prediction and actual mine water inflow ma et al 2020 in fact with the sharp decline in the gwl of the direct water filled aquifer the captured lateral recharge and vertical leakage will increase such problems can only be avoided if the aquifers of the entire mining area are systematically analyzed as a whole we further propose a new water inrush mode namely derivative dynamic water inrush its definition is that the evolution of the groundwater system caused by roof overburden failure will induce new disaster sources thus forming a multi factor water inrush mode its connotation is to change the basis for defining water inrush mode from traditional static analysis before mining to dynamic evaluation considering the change in the whole mining cycle the drainage technology proposed in this study will lay out the drilling position for the water richness area of the direct water filled aquifer and will also fully consider the recharge of the indirect aquifer to set the amount of drainage and drainage time so as to achieve the multiple objectives of efficient drainage and ensuring mine production and ecological security fig 14 5 2 analysis of advance drainage effect in the above advance drainage rule we can find that the drainage node located in the red clay missing area can better accept the leakage recharge of the quaternary aquifer therefore in the case of the same volume of drainage the drawdown will increase with the increase in red clay thickness obviously greater drawdown and funnel coverage will increase the amount of vertical leakage in fact the amount of advance drainage should be divided into two parts bevan et al 2005 one part is the static storage stored in the aquifer itself and the other part is the dynamic storage that receives lateral and vertical recharge after the formation of steady flow for static storage we should choose efficient drainage methods to reduce the gwl to a safe height as soon as possible for dynamic storage we should combine the economic benefits of water resources for sustainable utilization however this study did not adequately consider the drainage process for the complex transition from static to dynamic storage following that we will continue to optimize drainage technology taking into account the relationship between dynamic and static reserves as well as the economic benefits of water resources utilization in addition the total amount of the increase in the leakage recharge of the quaternary aquifer is composed of two parts the direct leakage through the red clay missing area and the indirect leakage through the red clay layer the increase in drainage volume does not basically affect the proportion between the two parts but the increase in red clay thickness will increase indirect leakage the proportion of increase in the indirect leakage is 7 79 8 68 13 26 26 84 and 30 67 previous research has consistently demonstrated aquiclude s confining capacity as its thickness li et al 2017 this set of ratio data shows that the confining capacity of the red clay is not linearly related to its thickness we further test the mineral composition of the red clay in the weak area and the conventional area the results show that the red clay in the weak area is at the sedimentary edge and the content of clay minerals that act as the water barrier in this position is significantly lower than that of the conventional area based on this we can further refine the confining capacity of the aquifuge to determine the hydraulic connection between the aquifers which is of great help to improve the drainage efficiency 5 3 ecological water security ecological water security is an important objective constraint of drainage technology in this study the key problem that this technology can solve is how to quantitatively express the constraints as mathematical models to protect the safety of ecological water resources we established two thresholds ecological water level and water volume to limit vertical leakage under drainage through comprehensive research and analysis of ecological vegetation in the study area ma et al 2021 chen et al 2021 the maximum threshold of ecological groundwater level depth in the quaternary aquifer is 5 m according to the current average gwl depth 3 7 m of the quaternary aquifer the allowed drawdown is 1 3 m the amount of water available for leakage to the directly water filled aquifer is abundant which is calculated by regional area and specific yield however the results of numerical simulation calculations are not optimistic in the numerical model by setting up virtual pumping wells in the management area and constantly adjusting the amount of pumping water the relationship between the stable final gwl and equilibrium terms such as rainfall evaporation and lateral inflow is analyzed the maximum allowable gwl drawdown of the quaternary aquifer in the management area is 0 73 m because of the limited rainfall recharge that can be received the early gwl decline process maintains balance by reducing the regional lateral outflow when it is greater than the maximum drawdown the impact range of the drawdown funnel and the drawdown rate are obviously accelerated when the drawdown is 0 73 m the total pump output of the virtual borehole is 600 m3 h that is to say the drainage ecological groundwater volume threshold is set to 600 m3 h the drainage ecological groundwater level threshold h 0 j obtained by subtracting the maximum gwl depth 5 m from the surface elevation 6 conclusion 1 based on the numerical simulation model that fully characterizes the dynamic changes of the groundwater system a groundwater management model is established in combination with multi objective constraints such as mine production safety ecological water resources protection and efficient drainage the optimal drainage scheme for the location of the drainage boreholes the drainage volume and the time management is obtained through objective programming 2 in the process of deriving the dynamic characteristics of the groundwater system from the simulation model it is found that when there is an indirect aquifer leakage recharge condition if the recharge conditions are stronger the drainage depth at the same discharge volume is smaller the time to reach stability is faster and the increase in leakage recharge and the decrease in mine water inflow rate will be smaller at the same time the drawdown the increase of leakage recharge and the decrease of water inflow rate all increase linearly with the increase in drainage volume the weaker the recharge condition the greater the slope of the linear increase 3 according to the analysis of the geological characteristics and water inflow characteristics of the caojiatan mine it is determined that the water inflow of the 122 107 working face is composed of the quaternary aquifer the weathered bedrock aquifer and the bedrock aquifer the proportions of groundwater inflow from each layer according to numerical simulation are 19 16 68 45 and 12 39 respectively 4 compared with the traditional equidistant drainage scheme the optimization scheme takes into account the time relationship of the quaternary aquifer receiving rainfall recharge in the case of roughly halving the amount of drainage boreholes and drainage volume the average reduction of water inflow rate is basically the same and the increase in leakage is greatly reduced this method can provide a new management mode for advance drainage of roof aquifers in ecologically fragile areas these findings can provide a scientific basis for the protection of

2158,in cold and high elevation mountainous catchments climate and landscape vary with elevation which leads to elevational variability in runoff the short term variation and long term change of climate would temporally and permanently alter the conditions of frozen ground and runoff characteristics at different elevation zones in this study a conceptually hydrological model is developed to investigate the responses of soil freeze thaw and runoff processes to climate change from 1979 to 2013 in a glacierized catchment in the tibetan plateau tp results show that our model can accurately reproduce the observed daily streamflow in addition to rainfall 63 8 meltwater from glacier 22 2 and snowpack 14 0 are also key contributors to streamflow especially at high elevations as temperature declines with rising of elevation the elevation runoff relationship depicts a convex formation with a runoff peak at the elevation of 5800 m below 5800 m surface flow increases towards high elevations accompanied by the increase of glacier coverage while groundwater flow reduces because the enlarged frozen ground areas inhibit the percolation of the infiltrated water above 5800 m the runoff declines sharply as the ground changes to a perennially freezing condition the long term climate warming during 1979 2013 significantly increases annual runoff with a rate of 12 2 mm 10a the increment in streamflow is primarily attributed to an increase in surface flow in the summer season when glacier meltwater increases at high elevations whereas the permafrost degradation enhances infiltrated water percolation and hence groundwater flow in the low elevations and the low flow periods although climate warming benefits the local water resources availability during the historical periods streamflow could be substantially decreased if the glacier vanished which threatens the sustainability of the water tower over tp keywords hydrological model runoff freeze thaw processes elevational variability climate change tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is the highest and the most extensive plateau in the world the marked variability of elevation creates different climate conditions and landscapes in the high elevations ground temperature could drop below the freezing point for several years which produces perennially frozen ground and firn field the intra annual variability in air temperature characterizes the seasonal freeze thaw cycle at the low elevations in recent decades climate warming over tp has sustainably changed the ground freeze and thaw equilibrium such as accelerated permafrost thaw and glacier melt immerzeel et al 2010 wang et al 2021 and reduced the freezing depth and freeze thaw duration yang et al 2019 peng et al 2016 these changes have resulted in non stationary evolutions of streamflow in response to precipitation wang et al 2021 whereas how the seasonal freeze thaw cycle involves the long term change and how it affects hydrological processes and water budget remain unclear over the tp region the repeated freeze and thaw processes change soil water phase storage and associated hydrological components in various spatial and temporal scales according to the clapeyron equation groenevelt and kay 1974 loch 1977 the soil liquid pressure or unfrozen water content is a function of air temperature in partially frozen soils kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the soil liquid water content drops from saturation to below field capacity rapidly when the temperature is below the freezing point kurylyk and watanabe 2013 lu et al 2019 as soil frost progresses the frozen soils extend to deeper soil layers and thereby increasing the frozen volume of gravity water the frozen depth multiplying the specific yield smith et al 2019 on the other hand when the temperature rises to the thawing point the frozen soils are reactive and release gravity water the thawing of frozen soils can enlarge active soil layers promote the shallow subsurface flow xiao et al 2020 and even change the runoff generation mechanism wang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a the transition from unfrozen to frozen soils coincides with a marked reduction in hydraulic conductivity as ice accumulates in the pore space burt and willaims 1976 watanabe and flury 2008 according to burt and willaims 1976 the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is typically four to five orders of magnitude lower than that of saturated unfrozen surficial material as such the frozen soils impede the downward water infiltration and percolation yao et al 2021 and subsequently alter the water allocation among the soil surface root zone and deep aquifer dai et al 2019 climate warming has changed the seasonal freeze and thaw equilibrium and cycles for instance as a result of global warming the summer thawing depth can exceed the winter freezing depth leading to decreased seasonal frozen layer and even vanished permafrost areas such climate change impacts can substantially reduce the buffering effect of the frozen ground on the hydrological dynamics and even change the interannual hydrological variations the freeze thaw processes and their impacts can be simulated by using hydrological models the first approach is to develop physical based numerical models bense et al 2009 ge et al 2011 grenier et al 2018 with heat transfer functions such as the stefan equation stefan 1891 kurylyk et al 2014 another approach is to modify the existing hydrological models e g swat qi et al 2019 ech2o smith et al 2019 or community land model xie et al 2018 by incorporating a soil temperature module or heat transfer models these two categories of model strategies can be used to simulate complex thermal and hydrological processes particularly they can capture temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the freeze thaw processes by pixel wise information gubler et al 2013 these models contain numerous parameters to be determined prior or calibrated which is a known challenge fisher and koven 2020 in addition gridded high resolution data for capturing the spatial variability of catchment are required to setup these models to achieve high simulation accuracy in the high elevation tp however detailed observations of climate and hydrological dynamics are often absent guo and wang 2013 in the alpine regions especially in south tp the climate conditions and the frozen ground represent significant elevational variability gruber 2012 wang et al 2018 where the difference of elevation could be 2000 m at area of hundreds square kilometers in the high altitude regions air temperature declines and the frozen ground gradually changes from sporadic permafrost to discontinuous and continuous permafrost as shown in the himalayas region gruber et al 2017 and scandinavia dobinski 2011 these sharply elevational variabilities of climate and the frozen ground produce changes in runoff components such as increased glacier and snow meltwater at high altitude regions consequently hydrological response varies with elevations and presents elevation dependent characteristics li et al 2021 wainwright et al 2022 such co dependence of climate landscape and hydrological processes provides an opportunity of developing parsimonious hydrological models however up to now such parsimonious models have been seldomly reported in the cold mountainous catchments thus the objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of elevational variabilities of climate and soil freeze thaw processes on hydrological processes at daily seasonal and inter annual scales in cold mountainous region in tp we develop a conceptually hydrological model to elucidate the elevation dependent characteristics of climate frozen ground and hydrological conditions the model is calibrated and validated against observed daily streamflow and frozen ground coverage in a glacierized mountainous catchment of yangbajain in the south tp the calibrated model is subsequently used to quantify the impact of climate and soil freeze thaw processes on streamflow the contributions of water sources and the runoff components in different elevations and time scales in the cold mountainous catchment as such we seek to shed lights on climate change impacts on future streamflow and water resources sustainability of the water tower over tp 2 study area and data 2 1 study area yangbajain catchment named ybj thereafter is a typical glacierized catchment in the northern part of the yarlung tsangpo river basin over tp fig 1 a the catchment has an area of 2645 km2 located between the nyenchen tanglha mountain and the yarlung tsangpo suture the elevation ranges from 4196 to 6446 m with a mean elevation of 5116 m approximately 55 3 of the catchment is located at elevations higher than 5000 m the damxung yangjain fault causes a half graben fault depression in the low terrain of the catchment wu et al 2006 yang et al 2017 the ybj is characterized by a semiarid temperate monsoon climate the areal mean annual air temperature is approximately 2 25 c varying from 12 94 c january to 6 93 c july the mean annual precipitation is 427 mm recorded at the ybj hydrological station the summer june august monsoon provides 73 of annual precipitation and the winter season december february only contributes 1 of annual precipitation the ybj is a glacier fed headwater catchment characterized by high percentages of frozen ground and glacier areas glaciers are mostly distributed in the nyenchen tanglha mountain range climate warming has shrunken the glacier coverage the total glacier area reduced from about 280 km2 in 1976 to 260 km2 in 2009 7 14 reduction mi et al 2002 liu et al 2012 the glacier volume reduction rate was estimated to be 9 46 107 m3 a 1 over the past 50 years equivalent to about 33 8 mm a 1 loss of the meltwater in the glacier area the glacier ablates in the warmer period of june september and terminates at a higher elevation of about 5400 m liu et al 2011 the permafrost accounts for about 52 7 of the catchment area and prevails in high elevations above 5000 m in 1996 the seasonally frozen ground locates in the low valley which accounts for 47 3 of the catchment area fig 1b the permafrost has a thickness of 5 100 m zhou et al 2000 2 2 data dem with a resolution of 30 m is used to describe the spatial distribution of elevations in ybj the areal distribution of elevation with an interval of 10 m is shown in fig 2 the grid data of monthly air temperature and precipitation with a spatial resolution of 0 1 are available during 1979 to 2013 he et al 2020 https doi org 10 1038 s41597 020 0369 y additionally daily precipitation is observed at the outlet of the ybj hydrological station and daily air temperature is recorded at damxung meteorological station 91 06 e 30 29 n about 68 5 km northeast of the ybj outlet the gridded data and station based data are highly consistent for monthly precipitation the relative bias is 5 3 and root mean squared error rmse is 17 5 mm month likewise the absolute bias and rmse of the monthly mean air temperature is 0 31 c and 0 44 c respectively therefore the mean annual air temperature and mean annual precipitation at each grid and the corresponding elevation are suitable for estimating the lapse rate of air temperature and precipitation as shown in fig 3 a the fitted lapse rate of temperature l a is 5 7 c km 1 fig 3a the correlation between mean annual precipitation and elevation is significant at the significance level of p 0 10 the fitted linear equations in fig 3a are used to delineate air temperature and precipitation in each contour a meteorological observation station was set at kqgr 90 20 e 29 93 n with an elevation of 4900 m in the catchment fig 1a the station started to record climate variables in august 2019 the recorded hourly data include precipitation air temperature t a as well as soil temperature at 10 cm depth t s from aug 25 2019 to aug 21 2021 as shown in fig 3b t s and t a demonstrate a clear linear relationship which is fit by linear equation i e t s 0 81 t a 2 57 this linear equation is then used to interpolate tempo spatial variabilities of t s in ybj the spatial distributions of glacier in 1976 2001 and 2013 and seasonally frozen ground and permafrost in 1996 and 2017 is collected from the second chinese glacier inventory fig 1b the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn and literature reports li and cheng 1996 zou et al 2017 the distributions of glacier area and percentage of glacier coverage at different elevations in 2009 for ybj are shown in fig 1a and fig 2 respectively the glacier coverage areas in the three years 284 0 km2 in 1976 264 8 km2 in 2001 and 260 km2 in 2013 are linearly interpolated to obtain the annual glacier coverage area when the interpolated t s is applied permafrost coverage can be identified in the study catchment gruber 2012 the identified permafrost area shrinks from 52 7 to 43 4 of the catchment area from 1996 to 2017 which results in the low boundary of permafrost elevated from 4974 m to 5254 m 280 m upward in addition to climate frozen ground and glacier data daily streamflow discharge observed at the ybj hydrological station is available during 1979 2013 these data are used for calibration and validation of hydrological model below 3 methodology 3 1 the hydrological model 3 1 1 the spatial partitioning of catchment in the mountainous cold catchment elevational variabilities of climate landscape and hydrological processes are much more prominent compared to that in horizontal direction the model focuses on the expression of the elevational variabilities and ignore the heterogeneity of climate and landscape in horizontal direction the elevation of h i and interval of δh from contour lines is used to divide the entire catchment area a into sub areas or elevation bands ai in the model the interval of δh 10 m is used and 226 elevation bands ai are generated considering the elevation ranges from 4196 to 6446 m in the catchment runoff generation and routing processes are conducted in each elevation band and streamflow in the outlet is the sum of these from the 226 elevation bands 3 1 2 the elevational variability of temperature and permafrost extent in the alpine region near surface air temperature declines towards higher elevations which can be simply expressed as a linear function wang et al 2018 1 t a h i l a h i h ref t a h ref where t a h i and t a h ref are air temperatures at an elevation of h i and reference elevation h ref respectively l a is the lapse rate of air temperature soil surface temperature is proportional to air temperature which can be approximated as hu et al 2017 2 t s h a l t a h b l where t s h is the soil temperature at a specific depth a l and b l are correlation coefficients at each elevation band ai the estimated soil temperature t s h i is used to identify seasonally frozen areas and permafrost areas with t s h i 0 c for two or more years according to the investigated glacier distribution the elevation bands ai with glacier coverage are further grouped into the glacier area a g i h i and the left is the non glacier area a n i h i the permafrost areas in high elevations could be partly covered by glacier while the seasonally frozen areas are usually located in the low elevations without any glacier since the permafrost can be continuous discontinuous and sporadic in space depending on the elevational temperature the extent of permafrost f p can be quantified by a complementary error function gruber 2012 3 f p 1 2 e r f c t s 2 σ 2 where t s is annual mean surface temperature and σ 2 is a coefficient that describes the spread of the permafrost distribution for the normal distribution of f p σ 2 is 6 43 gruber 2012 3 1 3 water balance and runoff components in glacier and non glacier areas in the cold mountainous catchment runoff recharge comes from rainfall snowpack and glacier meltwater the liquid rain and solid snow precipitation are distinguished using air temperature kienzle 2008 with a widely used air temperature threshold of t 0 2 c liu et al 2009 the total runoff is modeled as the sum of three components including surface runoff subsurface runoff and groundwater runoff likewise streamflow discharge includes surface flow q su subsurface flow q ss and groundwater flow q g in the non glacier area a n i h i water balance in each runoff generation compartment is modeled as 4 d s su dt r s p r p m s q su 5 d s ss dt s a r ss p r p m s q ss 6 d s g dt r g p r p m s q g where s su s ss and s g are water storages of surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater flow respectively r s r ss and r g are the partitioning coefficients for surface subsurface and groundwater runoff r s r ss r g 1 respectively s a represents thawing of frozen soils or freezing of s ss p is rainfall ms is meltwater flux from snowpack p r is a discount coefficient of the estimate to the generated runoff p r p m s from rainfall and snow meltwater the snow meltwater ms is computed by the degree day approach as follows hock 2003 7 m s ddf s t a t s 0 0 f o r t a t s 0 f o r t a t s 0 where m s is meltwater flux from snowpack ddf s is the degree day factor for the snowpack melting t s 0 is the threshold temperature for snowpack melting usually 0 c wang et al 2017b if m s is larger than the snow water equivalent of snowpack swe m s is set to be swe i e m s s w e in the glacier area a g i h i subsurface runoff and groundwater can be neglected due to the perennially freezing of subsurface soils as such the water balance for glacier meltwater is 8 d s gla dt m gla q gla where s gla is the meltwater storage m gla is the meltwater flux from glacier q gla is surface flow discharge from the glacier melting if there is rainfall falling on the glacier area rainfall is added in m gla in water balance modeling where m gla is calculated as hock 2003 9 m gla ddf g t a t g 0 0 f o r t a t g 0 f o r t a t g 0 where ddf g is the degree day factor for glacier melting t g 0 is the threshold temperature for ice the storage discharge relationship for runoff components is applied as the follows 10 s i k i q i d where si is water storage ki is a coefficient for the storage discharge relationship d is an exponential coefficient in the non glacier area the subscript i refers to su ss and g representing the surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater flow respectively d 1 for surface flow and 0 5 for subsurface flow and groundwater flow in this study in the glacier area the subscript i refers to gla and sr representing meltwater flux from glacier and surface flow from direct rainfall d is equal to 1 the total streamflow q at the catchment outlet is the sum of streamflow components in all sub areas 11 q i 1 n a n i h i q su i q ss i q g i a g i h i q gla i q sr i where q su q ss and q g are surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater flow discharge in the non glacier area respectively q gla and q sr are surface flow discharge contributed by glacier meltwater and rainfall respectively in the glacier area 3 1 4 the freeze thaw processes and impacts on runoff partition the soil frost thickness d f increases as daily temperature drops below the freezing temperature t f according to the stefan equation jumikis 1977 kurylyk et al 2014 d f increments noted as z f as a function of soil temperature can be expressed as 12 z f c f t df 1 2 where t df is a surface freezing index calculated as the difference in soil surface temperature t s and t f i e t df t s t f c f 2 k f λ f θ 1 2 is a lumped scaling parameter which is a function of thermal conductivity of the frozen soil kf wm 1 c the latent heat of freezing λf j m 3 and liquid soil moisture content θ analogously the soil thawing thickness active layer increases with decreased frost thickness d f when daily temperature rises above the thawing temperature t t during the thawing period a decrease of d f z t is calculated by 13 z t c t t dt 1 2 where t dt is surface thawing index defined by the difference between soil surface temperature t s and t t i e t dt t s t t c t 2 k t λ t θ 1 2 is a lumped scaling parameter related to the thermal conductivity of the unfrozen soil kt wm 1 c the latent heat of thawing λt j m 3 and the liquid soil moisture θ then the thawing and freezing amount of subsurface water s a in eq 5 can be estimated by a linear relation with s ss z f or s f z

this study we assume a f c f and a t c t are identical denoted as α ft soil freezing and thawing affect the permafrost distribution f p in eq 3 and frozen thickness d f and thereby the partitioning of groundwater and runoff smith et al 2019 hence considering the time variability of f p the partitioning coefficients of groundwater r g and subsurface flow r ss in eqs 5 and 6 are modified as 16 r gr 1 f p 1 d f d ss r g 17 r ssr r g r gr r ss where r gr and r ssr are the variable coefficients of groundwater and subsurface flow respectively dss is the subsurface thickness of soil eqs 16 reflects that no subsurface flow could percolate into the groundwater aquifer if the sub area is frozen i e d f d ss 1 3 2 assessment criteria for the model performance the model is mainly calibrated by the observed streamflow during 1979 1997 and validated by the data during 1998 2013 additionally field investigations of frozen ground distribution and mass balance of glacier are used to optimal model parameters the relative error re the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and nse with a logarithmic value of streamflow n s e l o g are used to evaluate the model performance re is the relative difference

model parameters and calibration procedures the model contains fifteen parameters table 1 two of them la and ls are determined using remote sensing and in situ observations and one rg is determined from other calibrated parameters rs and rss the remaining twelve free parameters are calibrated and validated against daily streamflow observations mass balance of glacier and the distribution of frozen ground the prior ranges of the key parameters are set referred to catchment properties and studies in literature among them the range of soil freeze thaw factor cf is set according to the soil physical properties and recommended values in tibetan plateau xu et al 2017 the degree day factors for glacier and snow ddfg and ddfs are referred to the modelling research in the in south tp tian et al 2020 xu 2019 further the ranges of parameters are constrained based on implicit measurement data the mass balance of glacier in sec 2 2 and water balance is used to constrain the range of ddfg and precipitation discount coefficient p r table 1 the partitioning coefficient of net precipitation into surface flow reservoir r s could be constrained by the ratio of fast flow from recursive digital filter for baseflow separation nathan and mcmahon 1990 section 1 in supplement to reduce the uncertainties and equifinality of model parameters a stepwise method based on hydrograph partitioning curve he et al 2015 and xu 2019 is used in recognition of the sensitivity of model parameters and calibration of these parameters section 2 in supplement specifically it partitions the year round hydrograph into four periods table 2 based on the regional sensitivity analysis method freer et al 1996 zhang et al 2019 we identify the sensitive parameters controlling the streamflow for each period table 2 only sensitive parameters in each period are calibrated to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem section 2 in supplement 4 results 4 1 characteristics of spatial and temporal variations in climate and streamflow fig 4 shows the mean monthly precipitation air temperature and streamflow in ybj during 1979 2013 the seasonal variability of climate and hydrological variables is distinct in winter december february of the following year when the mean temperature is low below 5 c streamflow is steady and insensitive to climate forcing e g temperature and precipitation it suggests that the whole catchment ground remains a frozen state in early spring april may when the lower atmosphere is still cold mean temperature below 0 c streamflow increases slightly although air temperature and precipitation rise significantly from early may to july streamflow increases sharply corresponding to the significantly increased air temperature and precipitation after august streamflow recesses following the sharply declined temperature e g from over 5 c in august to 5 c in october and the significantly decreased precipitation after october when the mean daily temperature drops below 5 c streamflow recesses much slower than precipitation declines it indicates that the dominant runoff processes changes seasonally which makes the sensitivity of model parameters varies temporally tested by the mann kendall test kendall and charles 1975 annual streamflow from 1979 to 2013 increases significantly meanwhile the annual mean air temperature rises significantly and annual precipitation increases insignificantly fig 4 these temporal trends indicate that the annual streamflow increase is primarily attributed to climate warming 4 2 evaluation of the model performances the model inputs daily precipitation mean air temperature and glacier coverage at each elevation band the model outputs are the daily freeze and thaw processes water release fixation and storage streamflow and its compositions to reduce the uncertainties in the model the stepwise calibration method is used to calibrate the model parameters against the daily streamflow discharge in the period 1979 1997 the estimated nse and nselog are 0 885 and 0 930 respectively and the absolute relative error re between the simulated and observed streamflow is 3 6 in the calibration period the calibrated parameters are listed in table 1 the model is then validated in the period 1998 2013 the nse and nselog are 0 873 and 0 902 respectively and re is 6 7 the simulated discharge can well capture the observed discharge with high accuracy fig 5 the estimated ratio of permafrost of 51 2 in 1996 is close to the estimate of 52 7 in the same year by zou et al 2017 4 3 the contribution sources and components of runoff 4 3 1 seasonal variability according to eqs 4 6 the total runoff in ybj is contributed by net rainfall 63 8 for pe snow meltwater 14 0 for ms and glacier meltwater 22 2 for mgla the ratios of water sources in ybj are comparable to that in the upper yarlung tsangpo river basin where rainfall glacier and snow meltwater accounts for 66 0 14 0 20 0 of total runoff xu 2019 tian et al 2020 meanwhile the calibrated degree day factors for glacier and snow ddfg 2 9 mm c d and ddfs 1 0 mm c d approximate that in upper yarlung tsangpo river basin with values of ddfg 2 6 mm c d and ddfs 1 2 mm c d xu 2019 tian et al 2020 rainfall in summer is a primary source of annual runoff in ybj the snow and glacier meltwater can considerably change hydrographs and the trend of annual runoff in the period 1979 2013 fig 6 a shows that the snowpack melting runoff occurs a month earlier than that of glacier melting and rainfall which determines the initial streamflow increase before early may fig 3 from early may to july and august the abundant rainfall recharge and substantial glacier meltwater cause a rapid rise in streamflow after august the fast decline of rainfall recharge and glacier meltwater results in a rapid recession of streamflow specifically after september the streamflow decrease is primarily caused by rainfall recharge reduction since soil has been frozen as to the runoff components the surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater flow account for 40 8 35 8 and 23 4 of the total runoff respectively seasonally as shown in fig 6b surface and subsurface flow discharge varies significantly while groundwater flow is relatively stable as the portions of surface and subsurface flow in the total streamflow rise the portion of groundwater flow drops consequently fig 6b in the summer season the surface and subsurface flow contribute to over 90 of streamflow and 60 9 of the surface flow comes from the glacier meltwater in contrast the groundwater maintains low streamflow in the dry period from november to april 4 3 2 elevational variability the simulated runoff and its components vary with elevation which is evident in fig 7 over regions below 5000 m rainfall contributed runoff decreases with increased elevation fig 7a however such runoff reduction is compensated by increased snowmelt water as a result the total runoff shows limited elevational sensitivity for elevations below 5000 m fig 7a at the elevations of 5500 5800 m runoff increases markedly corresponding to a substantial increase in glacier and snowpack meltwater the decrease of runoff above 5800 m follows a reduction of glacier meltwater because of the extremely cold climate in the high elevations fig 7a the elevation dependent runoff components are shown in fig 7b the surface flow is small and remains steady at low elevations below 5500 m and then rapidly increases and drops at the elevations of 5500 6450 m this elevation dependent variability of surface flow is similar to that of glacier meltwater groundwater flow decreases with elevation as the enlarged frozen ground impeds percolation of the subsurface flow towards high elevation the subsurface flow increases earlier than that of surface flow primarily due to the gain of snowmelt and rainfall recharge 4 4 the effects of soil freeze thaw processes on water storage and runoff fig 8 a shows the seasonal variations of the frozen storage sf and the water release and fixation fluxes sa in eqs 14 and 15 when air temperature rises from march to august the thawing flux sa 0 gradually increases to the highest at a rate of 0 25 mm d in june and then decreases to around zero in september consequently the frozen storage sf decreases from the largest 18 0 mm in march to the smallest in july and august the opposite variations of sa and sf can be found during the freezing period september the following february thus an increase in the thawing flux in spring and summer augments streamflow while the rising of the freezing flux in autumn reduces streamflow the seasonal variability of free water storage vft is measured in terms of the difference between the maximum and minimum frozen storage in the subsurface soils sf in eq 15 within a year during the period 1979 2013 the mean annual value of vft is 18 0 mm the mean annual values of vft and sf in relation to elevation are shown in fig 8b the frozen storage sf increases consistently at higher elevations fig 8b in contrast the free water storage vft shows a convex shape which rises gradually with elevation and then drops sharply for elevations above 5600 m it suggests that the regulation capacity of the frozen ground is enhanced and then weakened below and above the critical elevation of 5600 m respectively the largest storage vft at the critical elevation of 5600 m allows for the production of the highest subsurface flow see the maximum subsurface flow in fig 7b 4 5 inter annual variations of water storage and runoff the continuous rise of temperature has led to permafrost degradation and thereby the permafrost area shrinkage according to the simulated distribution of soil temperature the lower boundary of permafrost during the study period is identified and shown in fig 9 the lower boundary moves up to a higher elevation from 4870 m to 5195 m during 1979 2013 consequently the ratio of permafrost area to the total catchment area declines significantly from 0 606 to 0 459 the reduced permafrost area f p and the frozen thickness df significantly decrease the annual frozen storage sf and the free water storage capacity v ft p 0 05 fig 9 this could substantially weaken the buffering effect of the frozen ground on streamflow as shown in fig 10 annual surface flow and groundwater flow increase significantly p 0 001 at a high rate 13 0 and 6 5 mm 10a respectively during 1979 2013 whereas annual subsurface flow increases insignificantly p 0 05 even though annual rainfall and glacier meltwater increase in the study period considering streamflow is mainly contributed by surface flow in summer and maintained by delayed groundwater in winter fig 6 the more rapid increase in surface flow would lead to a more non stationary hydrograph 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in the model we acknowledge that parameter uncertainties may affect our analysis here we investigate the robustness of our results based on monte carlo tests specifically a 5000 member monte carlo simulation is used with parameter combinations sampled from the entire parameter space the parameter sets with top 1 performances in streamflow simulation are considered as the optimal parameters and the associated hydrological estimates are shown in fig 11 generally the simulated hydrological processes from the selected top 1 behavioral parameter sets vary in a narrow range fig 11 the ratios of rainfall glacier and snow contributed to streamflow are 64 0 2 5 22 3 3 0 and 13 7 1 1 respectively likewise the ratios of surface subsurface and groundwater flow to streamflow are 39 5 3 5 35 5 3 5 25 2 2 3 respectively as to the soil freeze thaw processes the frozen water storage sf is 11 2 4 3 mm and free water storage capacity vft is 21 2 7 9 mm our simulation from stepwise calibration approach is consistent with the monte carlo selected optimal simulations therefore these analyses suggest that the stepwise calibration robustly captures the optimal parameters more importantly the key findings related to the attribution of streamflow are robust to a range of model parameters therefore parameter equifinality and uncertainty impacts on our analysis are expected to be limited 5 2 the elevational variabilities of climate and runoff in cold mountainous regions in our study catchment air temperature declines and precipitation rises towards high elevation regions these climate variabilities along elevation gradient are ubiquitous in many other mountain regions over tp cuo and zhang 2017 wang et al 2018 additionally in the glacierized mountains the climate variabilities along elevation gradient control the glacier and permafrost distributions and the degree of the seasonal freeze thaw processes therefore there are elevational belts of runoff or zonal runoff high mountain areas are frequently labeled as water towers for the lowlands identification of the zonal runoff is essential in the context of possible changes in climate and land use for effective water resource management ashraf 2020 winiger et al 2005 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 the elevational belts of runoff in this study area are nonlinearly related to elevation due to the contrasting lapse rates of air temperature precipitation and frozen state of ground the convex form of runoff elevation relationship was also found in other high glacierized mountains such as the tien shan pamir karakorum mountains in central asia shafeeque et al 2020 the formation of zonal runoff peak depends on water sources and available energy in different locations lutz et al 2014 suggested that the zonal runoff peak is produced by glacier melt and snowmelt superimposed on rainfall in summer bolgov and trubetskova 2014 demonstrated that the zonal runoff peak is located at the zone between the equilibrium line and the glacier tongues which have the optimal balance of heat and moisture for high mountains in this study the zonal runoff peak corresponds to the maximum glacier melt runoff from 5700 to 6000 m 14 5 catchment area which contributes to 24 3 of the total runoff in other regions the maximum glacier melting runoff and its contribution to the total runoff could be different for example in the hindu kush karakoram and himalaya hkh region ashraf 2020 estimated that the maximum ice melt runoff was from 4500 to 5000 m in seven basins and from 5000 to 5500 m in two basins of the hkh region about 28 3 of the glacier melt was generated from 5000 to 5500 m and 27 8 from 4500 to 5000 m elevation range in the hkh region ashraf 2020 in the snow fed river basin the high flow usually occurs in the low elevations as shown in this study according to the elevational variabilities of 0 c isotherm qin et al 2020 estimated the high flow in the snow fed river basin of upper burqin river ubr of northwest china and found the seasonal snowmelt flood occurred at lower elevations 3000 m and glacier snow melt flood occurred at higher elevations 3000 4296 m moreover the groundwater component is highly related to the frozen ground gruber 2012 sun et al 2020 wang 2019 at lower elevations where air temperature is relatively high the spatial extent of frozen soil is limited therefore the runoff is dominated by rainfall and maintains high groundwater flow as air temperature declines towards high elevations the permafrost area expands cao et al 2017 2021 the enlarged frozen ground areas inhibit the percolation of the infiltrated water and thus reduce groundwater component above 5800 m the runoff declines sharply as the ground shifts to a state of perennially freezing in our study catchment 5 3 the effect of climate change on streamflow variation in cold mountainous regions the cryosphere is sensitive to air temperature variations the long term climate warming has accelerated glacier melting and led to substantial glacier retreat and permafrost degradation the acceleration of glacier melting produces more runoff in this glacierized catchment annual runoff increases significantly at a rate of 12 2 mm 10a during 1979 2013 fig 4 the climate warming induced runoff increase has been reported in other glacierized catchments prasch et al 2013 gao et al 2012 gao et al 2020 gao et al 2021 li et al 2020 meanwhile the permafrost degradation enlarges the thickness of the active soil layer wang et al 2017a and the proportion of groundwater baseflow component more groundwater remaining in the soil layer would improve low flow stability for example in the upper heihe basin of northwest china the increased low streamflow enhances the stability of the hydrograph gao et al 2018 evans et al 2015 this phenomenon was also found in other headwater catchments of the yellow and yangtze rivers and sub arctic regions hinzman et al 2020 ploum et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 where the streamflow recession rates slow down during autumn and winter with increases of low flow and aquifer storage capacity tashie et al 2020 lin et al 2020 meanwhile in the glacier runoff regime high discharge in summer produced by large glacier melt could enhance flush flow and thus reduce hydrograph stability as shown in figs 6 and 10 the sharp rise and decline of high streamflow in summer are also found in other catchments in the himalayan region thayyen and gergan 2010 and glacierized areas escher vetter and reinwarth 1994 reported that the rise in the total runoff was accompanied by increasing diurnal variations from 1 m3 s to almost 5 m3 s in august from 1974 to 1992 for a catchment with 81 of glacierized area global warming will lead to reduced glacier mass and this will eventually reach a tipping point that the meltwater amount could not provide enough water immerzeel et al 2013 with continuously shirked glacier areas late spring and summer discharges could reduce considerably for the indus and brahmaputra basins immerzeel et al 2010 moreover persistent warming promotes evaporation and reduces the soil water content it may reduce the recharge rate although the obstruction of frozen ground attenuates gao et al 2018 these interactions between climate and hydrology will lead to substantial changes in water resources stability for rivers originating from glacierized mountainous regions matthias et al 2008 5 4 limitations mountain catchments in cold regions have complex terrain and climate feature however observations over these regions are usually sparse in addition to the elevational variability of surface temperature controlling the hydrological processes hillslope aspect and shadows cast by surrounding topography could alter the solar radiation incident and thus the surface temperature robledano et al 2022 sunlit aspects are warmer and drier than shaded ones leading to systematic differences in the extent of permafrost and soil water content between sunlit and shaded aspects zhang et al 2018 including such topographical function in our model would enhance our modeling skills of the freeze thaw of permafrost and melting of glacier and snow the elevation dependent climate and landscape lead to different evaporation effects on runoff at different elevation parts of a mountain basin shi et al 2014 for example the rising air temperature may increase evapotranspiration and reduce runoff in lower parts of a catchment bolgov and trubetskova 2014 a constant discount coefficient of precipitation for estimation of net precipitation in our model could overestimate runoff volume in low elevation zones and underestimate runoff volume in high elevation zones for a long term simulation the temperature rising may increase the potential evapotranspiration and thus actual evaporation the constant discount coefficient may overpredict the future runoff change trend to make more accurate prediction of runoff it is necessary to take into account all the detailed processes with an increase of observation data in space and time we acknowledge that including additional data sources such as remotely sensed snow cover snow water equivalents and stable isotopic tracer of streamflow may further strengthen our analysis dong 2018 griessinger et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 li et al 2022 however this will require sophisticated considerations in remote sensing errors or intensive field samplings which is beyond our scope nonetheless the monte carlo experiments demonstrate that our analysis is robust and parameter uncertainties have limited impacts on our key findings 6 conclusions in this study we focuse on the seasonal variation long term change and elevational variability of runoff in high elevation mountainous areas we propose a parsimonious hydrological model which can accurately simulate runoff responses to the variabilities of climate and frozen ground along the elevation gradients the simulated daily streamflow well captures the observed streamflow during 1979 2013 in the tibetan plateau glacierized basin of ybj based on the newly proposed model we show that rainfall glacier melt and snowfall contribute 63 8 22 2 and 14 0 of the ybj streamflow respectively the streamflow consists of 40 8 of surface flow 35 8 of subsurface flow and 23 4 of groundwater flow the surface flow is primarily formed by glacier melt at high elevations while groundwater flow mostly comes from precipitation recharge at the low valleys the elevational belts of surface flow and subsurface flow represent a convex functional shape due to the combined effects of glacier and snow melting maximum runoff is observed at elevations of 5700 6000 m where glacier meltwater peaks the freeze thaw cycling of frozen ground regulates streamflow the maximum soil free water release is 18 0 mm on average which accounts for 6 6 of the catchment runoff this soil freeze thaw capacity could alter the zonal runoff partition and thus hydrograph variability under global warming in this study the strongest freeze thaw process is located at an elevation of around 5600 m above the elevation the permanently frozen soil in a cold environment impedes infiltration leading to rapid subsurface storage reduction the soil freeze thaw cycle benefits subsurface flow indicated by the zonal subsurface flow peak occurring nearby the maximum soil thawing area the climate warming during 1979 2013 caused significant permafrost degradation with the lower boundary of permafrost moving from 4870 to 5195 m the reduced permafrost area enhances water infiltration and groundwater percolation which eventually enhances baseflow and low flow in the winter season in the meantime the acceleration of glacier melting could also promote surface runoff and the high flow in the summer season this indicates that the hydrological processes evolve towards non stationarity and the increased high flow would bring more flood risks in the study region in addition if the glacier continues to shrink in the future available water resources for the rivers and downstream regions could be substantially decreased therefore our results suggest that climate warming would threaten the sustainability of the water tower

2158,in cold and high elevation mountainous catchments climate and landscape vary with elevation which leads to elevational variability in runoff the short term variation and long term change of climate would temporally and permanently alter the conditions of frozen ground and runoff characteristics at different elevation zones in this study a conceptually hydrological model is developed to investigate the responses of soil freeze thaw and runoff processes to climate change from 1979 to 2013 in a glacierized catchment in the tibetan plateau tp results show that our model can accurately reproduce the observed daily streamflow in addition to rainfall 63 8 meltwater from glacier 22 2 and snowpack 14 0 are also key contributors to streamflow especially at high elevations as temperature declines with rising of elevation the elevation runoff relationship depicts a convex formation with a runoff peak at the elevation of 5800 m below 5800 m surface flow increases towards high elevations accompanied by the increase of glacier coverage while groundwater flow reduces because the enlarged frozen ground areas inhibit the percolation of the infiltrated water above 5800 m the runoff declines sharply as the ground changes to a perennially freezing condition the long term climate warming during 1979 2013 significantly increases annual runoff with a rate of 12 2 mm 10a the increment in streamflow is primarily attributed to an increase in surface flow in the summer season when glacier meltwater increases at high elevations whereas the permafrost degradation enhances infiltrated water percolation and hence groundwater flow in the low elevations and the low flow periods although climate warming benefits the local water resources availability during the historical periods streamflow could be substantially decreased if the glacier vanished which threatens the sustainability of the water tower over tp keywords hydrological model runoff freeze thaw processes elevational variability climate change tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is the highest and the most extensive plateau in the world the marked variability of elevation creates different climate conditions and landscapes in the high elevations ground temperature could drop below the freezing point for several years which produces perennially frozen ground and firn field the intra annual variability in air temperature characterizes the seasonal freeze thaw cycle at the low elevations in recent decades climate warming over tp has sustainably changed the ground freeze and thaw equilibrium such as accelerated permafrost thaw and glacier melt immerzeel et al 2010 wang et al 2021 and reduced the freezing depth and freeze thaw duration yang et al 2019 peng et al 2016 these changes have resulted in non stationary evolutions of streamflow in response to precipitation wang et al 2021 whereas how the seasonal freeze thaw cycle involves the long term change and how it affects hydrological processes and water budget remain unclear over the tp region the repeated freeze and thaw processes change soil water phase storage and associated hydrological components in various spatial and temporal scales according to the clapeyron equation groenevelt and kay 1974 loch 1977 the soil liquid pressure or unfrozen water content is a function of air temperature in partially frozen soils kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the soil liquid water content drops from saturation to below field capacity rapidly when the temperature is below the freezing point kurylyk and watanabe 2013 lu et al 2019 as soil frost progresses the frozen soils extend to deeper soil layers and thereby increasing the frozen volume of gravity water the frozen depth multiplying the specific yield smith et al 2019 on the other hand when the temperature rises to the thawing point the frozen soils are reactive and release gravity water the thawing of frozen soils can enlarge active soil layers promote the shallow subsurface flow xiao et al 2020 and even change the runoff generation mechanism wang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a the transition from unfrozen to frozen soils coincides with a marked reduction in hydraulic conductivity as ice accumulates in the pore space burt and willaims 1976 watanabe and flury 2008 according to burt and willaims 1976 the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is typically four to five orders of magnitude lower than that of saturated unfrozen surficial material as such the frozen soils impede the downward water infiltration and percolation yao et al 2021 and subsequently alter the water allocation among the soil surface root zone and deep aquifer dai et al 2019 climate warming has changed the seasonal freeze and thaw equilibrium and cycles for instance as a result of global warming the summer thawing depth can exceed the winter freezing depth leading to decreased seasonal frozen layer and even vanished permafrost areas such climate change impacts can substantially reduce the buffering effect of the frozen ground on the hydrological dynamics and even change the interannual hydrological variations the freeze thaw processes and their impacts can be simulated by using hydrological models the first approach is to develop physical based numerical models bense et al 2009 ge et al 2011 grenier et al 2018 with heat transfer functions such as the stefan equation stefan 1891 kurylyk et al 2014 another approach is to modify the existing hydrological models e g swat qi et al 2019 ech2o smith et al 2019 or community land model xie et al 2018 by incorporating a soil temperature module or heat transfer models these two categories of model strategies can be used to simulate complex thermal and hydrological processes particularly they can capture temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the freeze thaw processes by pixel wise information gubler et al 2013 these models contain numerous parameters to be determined prior or calibrated which is a known challenge fisher and koven 2020 in addition gridded high resolution data for capturing the spatial variability of catchment are required to setup these models to achieve high simulation accuracy in the high elevation tp however detailed observations of climate and hydrological dynamics are often absent guo and wang 2013 in the alpine regions especially in south tp the climate conditions and the frozen ground represent significant elevational variability gruber 2012 wang et al 2018 where the difference of elevation could be 2000 m at area of hundreds square kilometers in the high altitude regions air temperature declines and the frozen ground gradually changes from sporadic permafrost to discontinuous and continuous permafrost as shown in the himalayas region gruber et al 2017 and scandinavia dobinski 2011 these sharply elevational variabilities of climate and the frozen ground produce changes in runoff components such as increased glacier and snow meltwater at high altitude regions consequently hydrological response varies with elevations and presents elevation dependent characteristics li et al 2021 wainwright et al 2022 such co dependence of climate landscape and hydrological processes provides an opportunity of developing parsimonious hydrological models however up to now such parsimonious models have been seldomly reported in the cold mountainous catchments thus the objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of elevational variabilities of climate and soil freeze thaw processes on hydrological processes at daily seasonal and inter annual scales in cold mountainous region in tp we develop a conceptually hydrological model to elucidate the elevation dependent characteristics of climate frozen ground and hydrological conditions the model is calibrated and validated against observed daily streamflow and frozen ground coverage in a glacierized mountainous catchment of yangbajain in the south tp the calibrated model is subsequently used to quantify the impact of climate and soil freeze thaw processes on streamflow the contributions of water sources and the runoff components in different elevations and time scales in the cold mountainous catchment as such we seek to shed lights on climate change impacts on future streamflow and water resources sustainability of the water tower over tp 2 study area and data 2 1 study area yangbajain catchment named ybj thereafter is a typical glacierized catchment in the northern part of the yarlung tsangpo river basin over tp fig 1 a the catchment has an area of 2645 km2 located between the nyenchen tanglha mountain and the yarlung tsangpo suture the elevation ranges from 4196 to 6446 m with a mean elevation of 5116 m approximately 55 3 of the catchment is located at elevations higher than 5000 m the damxung yangjain fault causes a half graben fault depression in the low terrain of the catchment wu et al 2006 yang et al 2017 the ybj is characterized by a semiarid temperate monsoon climate the areal mean annual air temperature is approximately 2 25 c varying from 12 94 c january to 6 93 c july the mean annual precipitation is 427 mm recorded at the ybj hydrological station the summer june august monsoon provides 73 of annual precipitation and the winter season december february only contributes 1 of annual precipitation the ybj is a glacier fed headwater catchment characterized by high percentages of frozen ground and glacier areas glaciers are mostly distributed in the nyenchen tanglha mountain range climate warming has shrunken the glacier coverage the total glacier area reduced from about 280 km2 in 1976 to 260 km2 in 2009 7 14 reduction mi et al 2002 liu et al 2012 the glacier volume reduction rate was estimated to be 9 46 107 m3 a 1 over the past 50 years equivalent to about 33 8 mm a 1 loss of the meltwater in the glacier area the glacier ablates in the warmer period of june september and terminates at a higher elevation of about 5400 m liu et al 2011 the permafrost accounts for about 52 7 of the catchment area and prevails in high elevations above 5000 m in 1996 the seasonally frozen ground locates in the low valley which accounts for 47 3 of the catchment area fig 1b the permafrost has a thickness of 5 100 m zhou et al 2000 2 2 data dem with a resolution of 30 m is used to describe the spatial distribution of elevations in ybj the areal distribution of elevation with an interval of 10 m is shown in fig 2 the grid data of monthly air temperature and precipitation with a spatial resolution of 0 1 are available during 1979 to 2013 he et al 2020 https doi org 10 1038 s41597 020 0369 y additionally daily precipitation is observed at the outlet of the ybj hydrological station and daily air temperature is recorded at damxung meteorological station 91 06 e 30 29 n about 68 5 km northeast of the ybj outlet the gridded data and station based data are highly consistent for monthly precipitation the relative bias is 5 3 and root mean squared error rmse is 17 5 mm month likewise the absolute bias and rmse of the monthly mean air temperature is 0 31 c and 0 44 c respectively therefore the mean annual air temperature and mean annual precipitation at each grid and the corresponding elevation are suitable for estimating the lapse rate of air temperature and precipitation as shown in fig 3 a the fitted lapse rate of temperature l a is 5 7 c km 1 fig 3a the correlation between mean annual precipitation and elevation is significant at the significance level of p 0 10 the fitted linear equations in fig 3a are used to delineate air temperature and precipitation in each contour a meteorological observation station was set at kqgr 90 20 e 29 93 n with an elevation of 4900 m in the catchment fig 1a the station started to record climate variables in august 2019 the recorded hourly data include precipitation air temperature t a as well as soil temperature at 10 cm depth t s from aug 25 2019 to aug 21 2021 as shown in fig 3b t s and t a demonstrate a clear linear relationship which is fit by linear equation i e t s 0 81 t a 2 57 this linear equation is then used to interpolate tempo spatial variabilities of t s in ybj the spatial distributions of glacier in 1976 2001 and 2013 and seasonally frozen ground and permafrost in 1996 and 2017 is collected from the second chinese glacier inventory fig 1b the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn and literature reports li and cheng 1996 zou et al 2017 the distributions of glacier area and percentage of glacier coverage at different elevations in 2009 for ybj are shown in fig 1a and fig 2 respectively the glacier coverage areas in the three years 284 0 km2 in 1976 264 8 km2 in 2001 and 260 km2 in 2013 are linearly interpolated to obtain the annual glacier coverage area when the interpolated t s is applied permafrost coverage can be identified in the study catchment gruber 2012 the identified permafrost area shrinks from 52 7 to 43 4 of the catchment area from 1996 to 2017 which results in the low boundary of permafrost elevated from 4974 m to 5254 m 280 m upward in addition to climate frozen ground and glacier data daily streamflow discharge observed at the ybj hydrological station is available during 1979 2013 these data are used for calibration and validation of hydrological model below 3 methodology 3 1 the hydrological model 3 1 1 the spatial partitioning of catchment in the mountainous cold catchment elevational variabilities of climate landscape and hydrological processes are much more prominent compared to that in horizontal direction the model focuses on the expression of the elevational variabilities and ignore the heterogeneity of climate and landscape in horizontal direction the elevation of h i and interval of δh from contour lines is used to divide the entire catchment area a into sub areas or elevation bands ai in the model the interval of δh 10 m is used and 226 elevation bands ai are generated considering the elevation ranges from 4196 to 6446 m in the catchment runoff generation and routing processes are conducted in each elevation band and streamflow in the outlet is the sum of these from the 226 elevation bands 3 1 2 the elevational variability of temperature and permafrost extent in the alpine region near surface air temperature declines towards higher elevations which can be simply expressed as a linear function wang et al 2018 1 t a h i l a h i h ref t a h ref where t a h i and t a h ref are air temperatures at an elevation of h i and reference elevation h ref respectively l a is the lapse rate of air temperature soil surface temperature is proportional to air temperature which can be approximated as hu et al 2017 2 t s h a l t a h b l where t s h is the soil temperature at a specific depth a l and b l are correlation coefficients at each elevation band ai the estimated soil temperature t s h i is used to identify seasonally frozen areas and permafrost areas with t s h i 0 c for two or more years according to the investigated glacier distribution the elevation bands ai with glacier coverage are further grouped into the glacier area a g i h i and the left is the non glacier area a n i h i the permafrost areas in high elevations could be partly covered by glacier while the seasonally frozen areas are usually located in the low elevations without any glacier since the permafrost can be continuous discontinuous and sporadic in space depending on the elevational temperature the extent of permafrost f p can be quantified by a complementary error function gruber 2012 3 f p 1 2 e r f c t s 2 σ 2 where t s is annual mean surface temperature and σ 2 is a coefficient that describes the spread of the permafrost distribution for the normal distribution of f p σ 2 is 6 43 gruber 2012 3 1 3 water balance and runoff components in glacier and non glacier areas in the cold mountainous catchment runoff recharge comes from rainfall snowpack and glacier meltwater the liquid rain and solid snow precipitation are distinguished using air temperature kienzle 2008 with a widely used air temperature threshold of t 0 2 c liu et al 2009 the total runoff is modeled as the sum of three components including surface runoff subsurface runoff and groundwater runoff likewise streamflow discharge includes surface flow q su subsurface flow q ss and groundwater flow q g in the non glacier area a n i h i water balance in each runoff generation compartment is modeled as 4 d s su dt r s p

flux from snowpack p r is a discount coefficient of the estimate to the generated runoff p r p m s from rainfall and snow meltwater the snow meltwater ms is computed by the degree day approach as

temperature for snowpack melting usually 0 c wang et al 2017b if m s is larger than the snow water equivalent of snowpack swe m s is set to be swe i e m s s w e in the glacier area a g i h i subsurface runoff and groundwater can be neglected due to the perennially freezing of subsurface soils as such the water balance for glacier meltwater is 8 d s gla dt m gla q gla where s gla is the meltwater storage m gla is the meltwater flux from glacier q gla is surface flow discharge from the glacier melting if there is rainfall falling on the glacier area rainfall is added in m gla in water

surface flow and 0 5 for subsurface flow and groundwater flow in this study in the glacier area the subscript i refers to gla and sr representing meltwater flux from glacier and surface flow from direct rainfall d is equal to 1 the total streamflow q at the catchment outlet is the sum of streamflow components in all sub areas 11 q i 1 n a n i h i q su i q ss i q g i a g i h i q gla i q sr i where q su q ss and q g are surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater flow discharge in the non glacier area respectively q gla and q sr are surface flow discharge contributed by glacier meltwater and rainfall respectively in the glacier area 3 1 4 the freeze thaw processes and impacts on runoff partition the soil frost thickness d f increases as daily temperature drops below the freezing temperature t f according to the stefan equation jumikis 1977 kurylyk et al 2014 d f increments noted as z f as a function of soil temperature can be expressed as 12 z f c f t df 1 2 where t df is a surface freezing index calculated as the difference in soil surface temperature t s and t f i e t df t s t f c f 2 k f λ f θ 1 2 is a lumped scaling parameter which is a function of thermal

this study we assume a f c f and a t c t are identical denoted as α ft soil freezing and thawing affect the permafrost distribution f p in eq 3 and frozen thickness d f and thereby the partitioning of groundwater and runoff smith et al 2019 hence considering the time variability of f p the partitioning coefficients of groundwater r g and subsurface flow r ss in eqs 5 and 6 are modified as 16 r gr 1

that no subsurface flow could percolate into the groundwater aquifer if the sub area is frozen i e d f d ss 1 3 2 assessment criteria for the model performance the model is mainly calibrated by the observed streamflow during 1979 1997 and validated by the data during 1998 2013 additionally field investigations of frozen ground distribution and mass balance of glacier are used to optimal model

only sensitive parameters in each period are calibrated to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem section 2 in supplement 4 results 4 1 characteristics of spatial and temporal variations in climate and streamflow fig 4 shows the mean monthly precipitation air temperature and streamflow in ybj during 1979 2013 the seasonal variability of climate and hydrological variables is distinct in winter december february of the following year when the mean temperature is low below 5 c streamflow is steady and insensitive to climate forcing e g temperature and precipitation it suggests that the whole catchment ground remains a frozen state in early spring april may when the lower atmosphere is still cold mean temperature below 0 c streamflow increases slightly although air temperature and precipitation rise significantly from early may to july streamflow increases sharply corresponding to the significantly increased air temperature and precipitation after august streamflow recesses following the sharply declined temperature e g from over 5 c in august to 5 c in october and the significantly decreased precipitation after october when the mean daily temperature drops below 5 c streamflow recesses much slower than precipitation declines it indicates that the dominant runoff processes changes seasonally which makes the sensitivity of model parameters varies temporally tested by the mann kendall test kendall and charles 1975 annual streamflow from 1979 to 2013 increases significantly meanwhile the annual mean air temperature rises significantly and annual precipitation increases insignificantly fig 4 these temporal trends indicate that the annual streamflow increase is primarily attributed to climate warming 4 2 evaluation of the model performances the model inputs daily precipitation mean air temperature and glacier coverage at each elevation band the model outputs are the daily freeze and thaw processes water release fixation and storage streamflow and its compositions to reduce the uncertainties in the model the stepwise calibration method is used to calibrate the model parameters against the daily streamflow discharge in the period 1979 1997 the estimated nse and nselog are 0 885 and 0 930 respectively and the absolute relative error re between the simulated and observed streamflow is 3 6 in the calibration period the calibrated parameters are listed in table 1 the model is then validated in the period 1998 2013 the nse and nselog are 0 873 and 0 902 respectively and re is 6 7 the simulated discharge can well capture the observed discharge with high accuracy fig 5 the estimated ratio of permafrost of 51 2 in 1996 is close to the estimate of 52 7 in the same year by zou et al 2017 4 3 the contribution sources and components of runoff 4 3 1 seasonal variability according to eqs 4 6 the total runoff in ybj is contributed by net rainfall 63 8 for pe snow meltwater 14 0 for ms and glacier meltwater 22 2 for mgla the ratios of water sources in ybj are comparable to that in the upper yarlung tsangpo river basin where rainfall glacier and snow meltwater accounts for 66 0 14 0 20 0 of total runoff xu 2019 tian et al 2020 meanwhile the calibrated degree day factors for glacier and snow ddfg 2 9 mm c d and ddfs 1 0 mm c d approximate that in upper yarlung tsangpo river basin with values of ddfg 2 6 mm c d and ddfs 1 2 mm c d xu 2019 tian et al 2020 rainfall in summer is a primary source of annual runoff in ybj the snow and glacier meltwater can considerably change hydrographs and the trend of annual runoff in the period 1979 2013 fig 6 a shows that the snowpack melting runoff occurs a month earlier than that of glacier melting and rainfall which determines the initial streamflow increase before early may fig 3 from early may to july and august the abundant rainfall recharge and substantial glacier meltwater cause a rapid rise in streamflow after august the fast decline of rainfall recharge and glacier meltwater results in a rapid recession of streamflow specifically after september the streamflow decrease is primarily caused by rainfall recharge reduction since soil has been frozen as to the runoff components the surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater flow account for 40 8 35 8 and 23 4 of the total runoff respectively seasonally as shown in fig 6b surface and subsurface flow discharge varies significantly while groundwater flow is relatively stable as the portions of surface and subsurface flow in the total streamflow rise the portion of groundwater flow drops consequently fig 6b in the summer season the surface and subsurface flow contribute to over 90 of streamflow and 60 9 of the surface flow comes from the glacier meltwater in contrast the groundwater maintains low streamflow in the dry period from november to april 4 3 2 elevational variability the simulated runoff and its components vary with elevation which is evident in fig 7 over regions below 5000 m rainfall contributed runoff decreases with increased elevation fig 7a however such runoff reduction is compensated by increased snowmelt water as a result the total runoff shows limited elevational sensitivity for elevations below 5000 m fig 7a at the elevations of 5500 5800 m runoff increases markedly corresponding to a substantial increase in glacier and snowpack meltwater the decrease of runoff above 5800 m follows a reduction of glacier meltwater because of the extremely cold climate in the high elevations fig 7a the elevation dependent runoff components are shown in fig 7b the surface flow is small and remains steady at low elevations below 5500 m and then rapidly increases and drops at the elevations of 5500 6450 m this elevation dependent variability of surface flow is similar to that of glacier meltwater groundwater flow decreases with elevation as the enlarged frozen ground impeds percolation of the subsurface flow towards high elevation the subsurface flow increases earlier than that of surface flow primarily due to the gain of snowmelt and rainfall recharge 4 4 the effects of soil freeze thaw processes on water storage and runoff fig 8 a shows the seasonal variations of the frozen storage sf and the water release and fixation fluxes sa in eqs 14 and 15 when air temperature rises from march to august the thawing flux sa 0 gradually increases to the highest at a rate of 0 25 mm d in june and then decreases to around zero in september consequently the frozen storage sf decreases from the largest 18 0 mm in march to the smallest in july and august the opposite variations of sa and sf can be found during the freezing period september the following february thus an increase in the thawing flux in spring and summer augments streamflow while the rising of the freezing flux in autumn reduces streamflow the seasonal variability of free water storage vft is measured in terms of the difference between the maximum and minimum frozen storage in the subsurface soils sf in eq 15 within a year during the period 1979 2013 the mean annual value of vft is 18 0 mm the mean annual values of vft and sf in relation to elevation are shown in fig 8b the frozen storage sf increases consistently at higher elevations fig 8b in contrast the free water storage vft shows a convex shape which rises gradually with elevation and then drops sharply for elevations above 5600 m it suggests that the regulation capacity of the frozen ground is enhanced and then weakened below and above the critical elevation of 5600 m respectively the largest storage vft at the critical elevation of 5600 m allows for the production of the highest subsurface flow see the maximum subsurface flow in fig 7b 4 5 inter annual variations of water storage and runoff the continuous rise of temperature has led to permafrost degradation and thereby the permafrost area shrinkage according to the simulated distribution of soil temperature the lower boundary of permafrost during the study period is identified and shown in fig 9 the lower boundary moves up to a higher elevation from 4870 m to 5195 m during 1979 2013 consequently the ratio of permafrost area to the total catchment area declines significantly from 0 606 to 0 459 the reduced permafrost area f p and the frozen thickness df significantly decrease the annual frozen storage sf and the free water storage capacity v ft p 0 05 fig 9 this could substantially weaken the buffering effect of the frozen ground on streamflow as shown in fig 10 annual surface flow and groundwater flow increase significantly p 0 001 at a high rate 13 0 and 6 5 mm 10a respectively during 1979 2013 whereas annual subsurface flow increases insignificantly p 0 05 even though annual rainfall and glacier meltwater increase in the study period considering streamflow is mainly contributed by surface flow in summer and maintained by delayed groundwater in winter fig 6 the more rapid increase in surface flow would lead to a more non stationary hydrograph 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in the model we acknowledge that parameter uncertainties may affect our analysis here we investigate the robustness of our results based on monte carlo tests specifically a 5000 member monte carlo simulation is used with parameter combinations sampled from the entire parameter space the parameter sets with top 1 performances in streamflow simulation are considered as the optimal parameters and the associated hydrological estimates are shown in fig 11 generally the simulated hydrological processes from the selected top 1 behavioral parameter sets vary in a narrow range fig 11 the ratios of rainfall glacier and snow contributed to streamflow are 64 0 2 5 22 3 3 0 and 13 7 1 1 respectively likewise the ratios of surface subsurface and groundwater flow to streamflow are 39 5 3 5 35 5 3 5 25 2 2 3 respectively as to the soil freeze thaw processes the frozen water storage sf is 11 2 4 3 mm and free water storage capacity vft is 21 2 7 9 mm our simulation from stepwise calibration approach is consistent with the monte carlo selected optimal simulations therefore these analyses suggest that the stepwise calibration robustly captures the optimal parameters more importantly the key findings related to the attribution of streamflow are robust to a range of model parameters therefore parameter equifinality and uncertainty impacts on our analysis are expected to be limited 5 2 the elevational variabilities of climate and runoff in cold mountainous regions in our study catchment air temperature declines and precipitation rises towards high elevation regions these climate variabilities along elevation gradient are ubiquitous in many other mountain regions over tp cuo and zhang 2017 wang et al 2018 additionally in the glacierized mountains the climate variabilities along elevation gradient control the glacier and permafrost distributions and the degree of the seasonal freeze thaw processes therefore there are elevational belts of runoff or zonal runoff high mountain areas are frequently labeled as water towers for the lowlands identification of the zonal runoff is essential in the context of possible changes in climate and land use for effective water resource management ashraf 2020 winiger et al 2005 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 the elevational belts of runoff in this study area are nonlinearly related to elevation due to the contrasting lapse rates of air temperature precipitation and frozen state of ground the convex form of runoff elevation relationship was also found in other high glacierized mountains such as the tien shan pamir karakorum mountains in central asia shafeeque et al 2020 the formation of zonal runoff peak depends on water sources and available energy in different locations lutz et al 2014 suggested that the zonal runoff peak is produced by glacier melt and snowmelt superimposed on rainfall in summer bolgov and trubetskova 2014 demonstrated that the zonal runoff peak is located at the zone between the equilibrium line and the glacier tongues which have the optimal balance of heat and moisture for high mountains in this study the zonal runoff peak corresponds to the maximum glacier melt runoff from 5700 to 6000 m 14 5 catchment area which contributes to 24 3 of the total runoff in other regions the maximum glacier melting runoff and its contribution to the total runoff could be different for example in the hindu kush karakoram and himalaya hkh region ashraf 2020 estimated that the maximum ice melt runoff was from 4500 to 5000 m in seven basins and from 5000 to 5500 m in two basins of the hkh region about 28 3 of the glacier melt was generated from 5000 to 5500 m and 27 8 from 4500 to 5000 m elevation range in the hkh region ashraf 2020 in the snow fed river basin the high flow usually occurs in the low elevations as shown in this study according to the elevational variabilities of 0 c isotherm qin et al 2020 estimated the high flow in the snow fed river basin of upper burqin river ubr of northwest china and found the seasonal snowmelt flood occurred at lower elevations 3000 m and glacier snow melt flood occurred at higher elevations 3000 4296 m moreover the groundwater component is highly related to the frozen ground gruber 2012 sun et al 2020 wang 2019 at lower elevations where air temperature is relatively high the spatial extent of frozen soil is limited therefore the runoff is dominated by rainfall and maintains high groundwater flow as air temperature declines towards high elevations the permafrost area expands cao et al 2017 2021 the enlarged frozen ground areas inhibit the percolation of the infiltrated water and thus reduce groundwater component above 5800 m the runoff declines sharply as the ground shifts to a state of perennially freezing in our study catchment 5 3 the effect of climate change on streamflow variation in cold mountainous regions the cryosphere is sensitive to air temperature variations the long term climate warming has accelerated glacier melting and led to substantial glacier retreat and permafrost degradation the acceleration of glacier melting produces more runoff in this glacierized catchment annual runoff increases significantly at a rate of 12 2 mm 10a during 1979 2013 fig 4 the climate warming induced runoff increase has been reported in other glacierized catchments prasch et al 2013 gao et al 2012 gao et al 2020 gao et al 2021 li et al 2020 meanwhile the permafrost degradation enlarges the thickness of the active soil layer wang et al 2017a and the proportion of groundwater baseflow component more groundwater remaining in the soil layer would improve low flow stability for example in the upper heihe basin of northwest china the increased low streamflow enhances the stability of the hydrograph gao et al 2018 evans et al 2015 this phenomenon was also found in other headwater catchments of the yellow and yangtze rivers and sub arctic regions hinzman et al 2020 ploum et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 where the streamflow recession rates slow down during autumn and winter with increases of low flow and aquifer storage capacity tashie et al 2020 lin et al 2020 meanwhile in the glacier runoff regime high discharge in summer produced by large glacier melt could enhance flush flow and thus reduce hydrograph stability as shown in figs 6 and 10 the sharp rise and decline of high streamflow in summer are also found in other catchments in the himalayan region thayyen and gergan 2010 and glacierized areas escher vetter and reinwarth 1994 reported that the rise in the total runoff was accompanied by increasing diurnal variations from 1 m3 s to almost 5 m3 s in august from 1974 to 1992 for a catchment with 81 of glacierized area global warming will lead to reduced glacier mass and this will eventually reach a tipping point that the meltwater amount could not provide enough water immerzeel et al 2013 with continuously shirked glacier areas late spring and summer discharges could reduce considerably for the indus and brahmaputra basins immerzeel et al 2010 moreover persistent warming promotes evaporation and reduces the soil water content it may reduce the recharge rate although the obstruction of frozen ground attenuates gao et al 2018 these interactions between climate and hydrology will lead to substantial changes in water resources stability for rivers originating from glacierized mountainous regions matthias et al 2008 5 4 limitations mountain catchments in cold regions have complex terrain and climate feature however observations over these regions are usually sparse in addition to the elevational variability of surface temperature controlling the hydrological processes hillslope aspect and shadows cast by surrounding topography could alter the solar radiation incident and thus the surface temperature robledano et al 2022 sunlit aspects are warmer and drier than shaded ones leading to systematic differences in the extent of permafrost and soil water content between sunlit and shaded aspects zhang et al 2018 including such topographical function in our model would enhance our modeling skills of the freeze thaw of permafrost and melting of glacier and snow the elevation dependent climate and landscape lead to different evaporation effects on runoff at different elevation parts of a mountain basin shi et al 2014 for example the rising air temperature may increase evapotranspiration and reduce runoff in lower parts of a catchment bolgov and trubetskova 2014 a constant discount coefficient of precipitation for estimation of net precipitation in our model could overestimate runoff volume in low elevation zones and underestimate runoff volume in high elevation zones for a long term simulation the temperature rising may increase the potential evapotranspiration and thus actual evaporation the constant discount coefficient may overpredict the future runoff change trend to make more accurate prediction of runoff it is necessary to take into account all the detailed processes with an increase of observation data in space and time we acknowledge that including additional data sources such as remotely sensed snow cover snow water equivalents and stable isotopic tracer of streamflow may further strengthen our analysis dong 2018 griessinger et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 li et al 2022 however this will require sophisticated considerations in remote sensing errors or intensive field samplings which is beyond our scope nonetheless the monte carlo experiments demonstrate that our analysis is robust and parameter uncertainties have limited impacts on our key findings 6 conclusions in this study we focuse on the seasonal variation long term change and elevational variability of runoff in high elevation mountainous areas we propose a parsimonious hydrological model which can accurately simulate runoff responses to the variabilities of climate and frozen ground along the elevation gradients the simulated daily streamflow well captures the observed streamflow during 1979 2013 in the tibetan plateau glacierized basin of ybj based on the newly proposed model we show that rainfall glacier melt and snowfall contribute 63 8 22 2 and 14 0 of the ybj streamflow respectively the streamflow consists of 40 8 of surface flow 35 8 of subsurface flow and 23 4 of groundwater flow the surface flow is primarily formed by glacier melt at high elevations while groundwater flow mostly comes from precipitation recharge at the low valleys the elevational belts of surface flow and subsurface flow represent a convex functional shape due to the combined effects of glacier and snow melting maximum runoff is observed at elevations of 5700 6000 m where glacier meltwater peaks the freeze thaw cycling of frozen ground regulates streamflow the maximum soil free water release is 18 0 mm on average which accounts for 6 6 of the catchment runoff this soil freeze thaw capacity could alter the zonal runoff partition and thus hydrograph variability under global warming in this study the strongest freeze thaw process is located at an elevation of around 5600 m above the elevation the permanently frozen soil in a cold environment impedes infiltration leading to rapid subsurface storage reduction the soil freeze thaw cycle benefits subsurface flow indicated by the zonal subsurface flow peak occurring nearby the maximum soil thawing area the climate warming during 1979 2013 caused significant permafrost degradation with the lower boundary of permafrost moving from 4870 to 5195 m the reduced permafrost area enhances water infiltration and groundwater percolation which eventually enhances baseflow and low flow in the winter season in the meantime the acceleration of glacier melting could also promote surface runoff and the high flow in the summer season this indicates that the hydrological processes evolve towards non stationarity and the increased high flow would bring more flood risks in the study region in addition if the glacier continues to shrink in the future available water resources for the rivers and downstream regions could be substantially decreased therefore our results suggest that climate warming would threaten the sustainability of the water tower

2159,hydrometeorological characteristics can influence stream chemistry variability and the identification of their dominant drivers provides much needed insight into catchment functioning in the tropics particularly the rainfall runoff processes that determine catchment capacity to retain and deliver solutes in this context concentration discharge c q relationships allow assessing solute delivery mechanisms to streams here we used a high frequency 5 minute multi solute data set al cu doc tnb ba ca mg na sr k si rb to derive hysteresis indicators direction magnitude and area in relation to hydrometeorological variables for a high elevation tropical experimental catchment we found geogenic solutes na sr k si and rb were mostly defined by clockwise hysteresis loops and dilution patterns conversely biogenic solutes influenced by soil processes al cu doc and tnb resulted in anti clockwise hysteresis behaviors and mobilization with streamflow the hysteresis indicators were most strongly influenced by discharge magnitude and the solute concentration itself as the discharge and the concentration increases 90th of the flow duration curve the loop area and the hysteresis index turned to cero showing a direct linear response of the solute to discharge dynamics additionally increasing discharge drives greater dilution or mobilization patterns for the geogenic and biogenic solutes higher discharge increases water volume to dilute geogenic solutes and is related to more water passing through shallow soils leaching biogenic solutes this study contributes to

intensity characteristics daley et al 2009 ibarra et al 2016 pesántez et al 2018 winnick et al 2017 one of the main factors controlling stream solute dynamics is catchment hydrological behavior due to the interaction between hydrological and biogeochemical processes butturini et al 2008 mcclain et al 2003 recent studies point to that projections of global climate change will enhance water scarcity and floods that directly affects hydrological processes aggravating extreme events therefore future investigations where streamflow plays an essential role in describing chemical catchment behaviors are vital molina et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 the hydrological biogeochemical interaction can be assessed for individual hydrological events that mobilize solutes originating from different catchment compartments e g vegetation soil groundwater etc to the stream biron et al 1999 such a solute delivery mechanism can be described using concentration discharge c q relations walling 1974 williams 1989 the concentration discharge relation often exhibits a hysteretic behavior in which the same discharge volume is associated to different solute concentrations on the rising and falling limbs of the stormflow event hydrograph o kane 2005 phillips 2003 analysis of hysteresis can help to identify the origin and fate of solutes delivered to streams and to learn about catchment biogeochemical functioning chanat et al 2002 evans and davies 1998 jiang et al 2010 murphy et al 2014 qualitative and quantitative approaches have been developed to characterize the hysteretic behavior of stream solute dynamics williams 1989 quantitative approaches are based on the shape magnitude and direction of solute hysteresis loops known as hysteresis indices butturini et al 2008 such indices can be computed as ratios langlois et al 2005 lawler et al 2006 or differences lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 between solute concentration values on the rising and falling limbs of stormflow hydrographs high frequency sub hourly streamflow and stream chemistry data should be ideally used to compute hysteresis indices evans and davies 1998 lloyd et al 2016b high resolution stream water quality data can be obtained using in situ sensors e g based on spectrometry techniques such sensors allow obtaining a detailed description of hydrochemical behavior jones et al 2011 kirchner et al 2004 pesántez et al 2021 which is usually ignored at lower weekly or monthly sampling resolutions bowes et al 2009 2015 kirchner et al 2004 madrid and zayas 2007 robson et al 1991 the combined analysis of hysteretic behavior and c q relations allows exploring ecohydrological processes related to solute dynamics zuecco et al 2016 such c q relations can be classified into chemostasis mobilization and dilution basu et al 2011 chanat et al 2002 godsey et al 2009 herndon et al 2015 maher 2011 a chemostatic behavior occurs when solute delivery to streams depends on physical factors rather than discharge variation godsey et al 2009 when discharge dominates the chemical status may be mobilization or dilution of solutes mobilization implies increasing solute concentrations as discharge increases whereas dilution resembles the opposite i e decreasing solute concentrations with increasing discharge chanat et al 2002 maher 2011 recent studies showed that solute chemical status is strongly influenced by climate and catchment size moatar et al 2017 nicolau et al 2006 rainfall patterns hornberger et al 2001 tardy et al 2004 lithology and land cover godsey et al 2019 anthropogenic and biological activities creed et al 2015 water table variations daley et al 2009 ibarra et al 2016 winnick et al 2017 and streamflow hale and godsey 2019 for instance it has been shown that water stored in organic rich soils such as histosols and andosols constitutes the main contributor to the stream chemistry of high flow periods due to the generation of continuous solute pulses as a result of its activation from shallow subsurface pathways birkel et al 2017 correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2015 tunaley et al 2018 therefore hysteresis analysis can reveal valuable information about biogeochemical cycles runoff generation mechanisms effects of antecedent moisture conditions on chemical stream variability and connectivity of solute sources to streams murphy et al 2014 shanley et

rodríguez blanco et al 2018 stallard and murphy 2014 despite the advantages investigating the hysteretic behavior and c q relations of stream water solutes knowledge about association between hydrological variables and this phenomenon is still scarce limitations arise mainly due to the scarcity of data as a result of financial and logistical constraints our aim is to fill this knowledge

resolution during the period march 2018 august 2018 2 2 3 selection and classification of stormflow events fig 2 provides a simple graphical scheme to illustrate the methodology of this study we used the peak over threshold pot method to identify individual stormflow events during the study period this method consists of retaining all peak discharge values exceeding a certain discharge threshold lang et al 1999 to select an independent discharge event the 30th percentile of the historical discharge values considered as baseflow correa et al 2016 recorded since 2010 in the study zone was set as threshold this procedure was carried out using the r package pot ribatet and dutang 2018 the beginning and the end of the discharge events were set to the mentioned pot threshold however precipitation dynamics during the wet season march 2018 august 2018 resulted in discharge events presenting multiple discharge peaks in such cases we considered each peak as a separate event to quantify the solute response following the methodology presented by lloyd et al 2016a we manually set the beginning and the end of the event where they exactly match by visual inspections carried out among the clusters produced by the pot r package seasonal hydrological behavior was assessed by grouping streamflow into three categories high mid and low flows based on the flow duration curve fdc of the experimental catchment following mosquera et al 2015 high flows are defined as those exceeding the 90th percentile q90 mid flows are between the 30th and 90th percentile q30 q90 and low flows are those below the 30th percentile of the fdc q30 2 3 chemical status of the events we classified each stormflow event according to its chemical status using concentration discharge relations c q as follows chemostasis mobilization or dilution basu et al 2010 clow and mast 2010 godsey et al 2009 chemostatic status implies that the slope of the linear regression between the log solute concentration log c and log discharge log q is close to zero a positive slope of the log c vs log q regression line points towards mobilization enrichment and a negative slope indicates dilution this framework was applied to classify the biogeochemical behavior of the experimental catchment in response to discharge dynamics for each monitored event 2 4 hysteresis index calculation concentration discharge loops were developed for each selected stormflow event and solute these were classified by shape into 5 types table 1 williams 1989 the above explained hysteresis classification is prone to subjective interpretations particularly for complex hysteresis loops such as classes ii iii and v bowes et al 2015 butturini et al 2008 evans and davies 1998 to cope with this methodological constraint we additionally evaluated the hysteresis index hi proposed by lloyd et al 2016b this index considers the range of solute concentrations between the rising and falling limbs of the hysteresis loop at multiple discharge percentiles throughout the event stepwise each 5th percentile in the hi calculation process the first step is to normalize the discharge and solute concentration information 2 norm q i q i q min q max q min 3 norm c i c i c min c max c min where qi ci is the discharge solute concentration at timestep i qmin cmin is the minimum discharge solute concentration value and qmax cmax is the maximum discharge solute concentration value during a given stormflow event hi is then calculated as follows 4 hi q i norm c r l q i norm c f l q i where hiqi is the hysteresis index at percentile i of discharge norm crl qi is the normalized solute concentration of the rising limb at percentile i of discharge and norm cfl qi is the normalized solute concentration at the equivalent point in discharge on the falling limb the percentiles of discharge qi are calculated as 5 q i k q max q min q max where qmax is the peak discharge qmin is the discharge at the start of the event and k is the point along the loop at which the hi is calculated in our specific case hi was calculated every 5th percentile of discharge that is k 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 95 the dimensionless resulting hi index varies between 1 and 1 and is easy to interpret the larger the hi value the flatter the loop with hi values close to 0 indicating the shape of the loop resembles a shape of 8 loop the sign of the hi indicates the direction of the loop positive values reflect a clockwise loop and negative values indicate an anti clockwise loop additionally we calculated the loop area for each hysteresis loop which varies between 0 and 1 the larger the area of the loop the greater the time lag between peak discharge and peak concentration in combination with the hi the loop area helps to interpret the amplitude and strength of the hysteresis loop 2 5 factors controlling the hysteresis of solutes we assessed the influence of stormflow characteristics on solute concentration dynamics calculating precipitation discharge and solute concentration metrics these metrics were considered as potential predictor variables and are hereafter referred to as stormflow metrics for each variable we computed average mean maximum max and minimum min values as well as the range max min during the events it should be noted that the vegetation cover affects the hydrological response of the catchment through interception infiltration and evapotranspiration processes consequently the runoff coefficient might represent an important factor of the c q response patterns and constitute a key comparison between catchments with similar organic matter production and different vegetation cover distributions accordingly we also computed the runoff coefficient for each identified event and considered it as a stormflow metric with the aim of evaluating the effects of subsurface baseflow contribution to the stream chemistry we computed a baseflow index bfi as discharge metric using the lynne hollick baseflow filter lyne and hollick 1979 to account for the potential influence of antecedent conditions on the hysteric behavior of the actual event the average of these variables mean max min range for periods of 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the start of the events was also estimated and are referred to as mean24 mean48 etc respectively in addition the volume amount of antecedent rainfall was also characterized and hereafter we refer to it simply as accumulated the length of time for each discharge event is referred to as duration first we carried out a spearman correlation analysis between stormflow metrics and hysteresis indices hi and loop area we reduced the dimensionality and selected the most important metrics of the correlation matrix using the classification and regression trees cart method breiman et al 1984 implemented in the r package rpart therneau and atkinson 2019 we ranked the stormflow metrics according to their impact on hi and loop area variability with a random forest rf analysis using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 increased mean square error incmse and increased impurity index incnodepurity were applied to define the hierarchical importance of stormflow variables the higher the incmse and incnodepurity the higher the influence of the stormflow metric on the hysteresis indices 3 results 3 1 selection and characterization of stormflow events during the study period march 2018 august 2018 we identified 85 stormflow events fig 3 these events were monitored during low 20 events 23 5 mid 36 events 42 4 and high 29 events 34 1 flow conditions all events were characterized according to their hydrological i e antecedent precipitation and discharge dynamics fig 4 a complete description of the hydrological and chemical characterization of the stormflow events can be found in appendix a the study interval was an average period in terms of 676 86 mm precipitation and 382 31 mm discharge compared to the annual average value of 1345 mm for precipitation and 786 mm for discharge the maximum event 51 recorded a peak flow of 1952 18 and the minimum event 85 only 19 90 l s 1 event peak average discharge was 259 63 l s 1 fig 4b clearly reflects the homogeneous distribution of rainfall throughout the year with almost identical antecedent conditions whereas the streamflow response is directly driven by rainfall fig 3 3 2 characterization of the hysteresis loops after computing the hysteresis metrics hi and loop area for each individual hydrological event and each solute we conducted a visual inspection of the results generated by the lloyd methodology to confirm that hysteric patterns are in accordance with the shape classification of loops proposed by williams 1989 most solutes were grouped see fig 5 for the classification into three main categories according to the dominant hysteresis types at least 60 of the time anti clockwise al cu doc and tnb clockwise na sr k si and rb and a mixed group presenting four hysteresis types ba ca and mg regardless of this general classification all solutes displayed some shape of 8 hysteresis loops from 19 48 for al to the highest proportion for ba 42 86 and ca 46 75 of the mixed group some solutes belonging to the anti clockwise dominated group cu doc and tnb showed few clockwise hysteresis events 1 30 3 13 and 3 13 respectively whereas no anti clockwise events were identified for the clockwise dominated group the highest proportion of direct events class i from table 1 was found for the mixed group with only a few events of this type observed for the other two groups no events showing a single line plus loop c q relation were identified for visualization purposes we present one representative solute for each of the dominant groups doc for anti clockwise dominance na for clockwise dominance and ca for the mixed group during different stormflow events fig 6 events 68 11 and 72 exhibited a shape of 8 hysteresis loop for doc na and ca respectively first row in the figure doc and na hysteresis loops had similar shapes and areas but opposite loop directions events 46 24 and 21 displayed the typical response for each group doc anti clockwise na clockwise and ca direct respectively second in the figure 3 3 chemical status of the monitored events the 85 stormflow events were classified according to the chemical status of each of the analyzed solutes fig 7 shows the classification for representative elements dominated by anti clockwise doc and clockwise na hysteretic behavior during the study period mobilization was predominant for doc fig 7a ba cu ca mg al and tnb 83 5 95 3 of all events to the contrary most events showed a tendency towards dilution for na fig 7b sr k si and rb 60 0 83 5 chemostatic behavior was rarely observed and was only found for a small proportion of events for the following solutes sr 3 5 na 7 1 ca 3 5 and mg 4 7 3 4 factors controlling the hysteresis of solutes spearman correlation and random forest analyses were carried out to identify variables potentially controlling the hysteresis of solutes table 2 and table 3 the most important variable driving hi variability was discharge according to the spearman correlation coefficient 0 235 r 0 498 from nine of the twelve solutes analyzed and the importance of variables resulting from the random forest analysis hereafter referred to as random forest importance rfi table 2 the range maximum and mean discharge metrics presented the highest values of r and rfi and the relative importance of these variables usually coincided for most solutes table 2 event duration presented a moderate impact on si and rb based on r values 0 246 and 0 247 respectively the clockwise dominated group na sr k si rb was generally negatively correlated with discharge variables solutes in this group were also influenced by concentration table 2 typically solutes belonging to the clockwise dominated group al cu doc tnb had high r values when correlated with max concentration whereas solutes having a mixed behavior ba ca mg presented a strong correlation with concentration range table 2 however rfi ranking showed that only a few solutes exhibited concentration variables as the most important ones in hi variability precipitation and the bfi exhibited little to no effect on hi variability for all solutes table 2 the runoff coefficient rc is directly related to interception infiltration and evapotranspiration processes which have a uniform distribution in our experimental catchment due to the presence of tussock grasses and cushion plants as expected rc is less relevant 0 03 r squared 0 24 0 03 p value 0 68 in the identification of hysteresis controls in our system and did not reveal any tendency or remarkable relationship despite this lack of relevance of rc on both hi and area metrics we would not discard the rc potential as a hysteresis driver in other catchments with different hydrological regimes similar to hi discharge variables were more influential on loop area variability than concentration and precipitation variables table 3 correlation values between loop area and discharge and concentration variables were similar to those identified for hi the main difference between both indices was that mean antecedent precipitation variables specifically mean72 mean96 and mean120 were more influential for the loop area of ba and ca than for the hi table 2 in general discharge is clearly the most important variable controlling the temporal dynamics of solutes during the 85 monitored events followed by concentration variables surprisingly the influence of precipitation is statistically close to null we analyzed the relation between discharge variables and hysteresis indicators to further examine links between hydrological behavior and hysteresis response variability fig 8 and fig 9 the range of discharge qrange metric was selected for this analysis because it yielded high r and rfi values in relation to other analyzed variables fig 7 shows the variability of qrange and hi for each solute considered in this study it is generally observed that hi tends to zero as qrange increases for high flows meaning that the loop shape tends to a low area shape of 8 or a direct response there is no clear trend between qrange and hi for low and mid flow rates as hi is highly variable at those conditions all solutes belonging to the anti clockwise dominant al cu doc and tnb and mixed groups ba ca and mg were dominated by a dilution chemical status at low flows except for a few events displaying a mobilization status fig 8 for mid and high flows the mobilization chemical status was dominant for those solutes on the contrary solutes of the clockwise dominant group na sr k si and rb had an opposite chemical status i e mobilization at low flow rates and dilution at mid and high flow rates for most events fig 8 chemostatic status was rarely observed except for a few events for na at high flows and for na ca and mg at low flows when analyzing the relation between qrange and loop area we observed that the area of the loops tended to zero as qrange increased at high flow rates fig 9 for solutes in the anti clockwise al cu doc and tnb and clockwise dominant na sr k si and rb groups this behavior denotes that the loop shape inclines to a low area shape of 8 or a direct hysteresis response for these solutes nevertheless solutes of the mixed group did not display a clear tendency at high flows as their loop areas presented an ample variability regardless of the qrange no clear relation between qrange and loop area was observed due to the large variability of loop area at low and mid flow rates for all solutes fig 9 anti clockwise dominant and mixed groups showed a dominance of dilution at low flow rates with only a few events point out to mobilization mobilization was dominant at mid and high flows for these groups clockwise dominant solutes had an opposite trend mobilization at low flow rates and dilution at mid and high flows with only a few exceptions fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 temporal characterization of multi solute hysteresis generally hysteresis loop shapes are associated with the distance between the solute source and the measurement location or the difference between the water and solute travel times hughes et al 2012 smith and dragovich 2009 williams 1989 the latter is related to morphological characteristics of the catchment such as geology and topography brasington and richards 2000 previous studies indicated that the catchment chemical behavior is sensible to its morphometry reduced dilution patterns of solutes can be linked to small water volumes and catchment area moatar et al 2017 nicolau et al 2006 however catchment area might not define the concentration discharge relationships due to diffuse water sources related for example to percentage land use change or cover with an increase in catchment area williams et al 2016 on the other hand terrain characteristics such as slope roughness relief and compactness are prone to impact the solute transport capacity and consequently the solute mobilization response magalhães et al 2022 milliman and syvitski 1992 tanaka et al 2016 simulations carried out by han et al 2018 and hu et al 2020 show that surface roughness influences significantly the transportation of solutes within the naturally fractured walls of materials and bed compounds concluding that solute transfer characteristics are mainly defined by water depth friction velocity and bed permeability due to these factors the roughness coefficient becomes a metric highly variable through the catchment and most importantly this even depends on the streamflow and velocity in the river cedillo et al 2021 yochum et al 2014 particularly in páramo catchments where this value ranges between 0 508 and 0 934 poulenard et al 2001 an investigation conducted in a headwater tropical catchment identified certain morphological indicators such as area slope gravelius compactness coefficient and form factor as strong predictors of the stream water quality nevertheless stream solutes variability also depends on chemical biological and anthropogenic processes which cause non conservative behaviors in the main channel for the monitored parameters magalhães et al 2022 the well known hydrological pedological and geological features of our study area allow to discern the key factors causing different c q dynamics for the analyzed solutes the anti clockwise c q relations identified for solutes of biogenic nature al cu doc and tnb fig 5 show larger extreme hi values compared to those presented by lloyd et al 2016a where the anti clockwise pattern ranges between 0 65 and 0 21 with a mean of 0 24 this particular c q response is mainly caused by two factors the first factor relates to the shallow subsurface location of solute sources histosols which are preferentially activated during rainstorm events storm events generate continuous al cu doc and tnb pulses in the stream chemical signature due to high contents of organometallic compounds in the histosols organic matter al fe castañeda martín and montes pulido 2017 mosquera et al 2015 pesántez et al 2018 quichimbo 2012 a similar behaviour for doc was found in other temperate organic rich soil experimental catchments such as in upland scotland tunaley et al 2018 and the german harz mountains birkel et al 2017 the second factor reflects the effect of the temporal variability in hydrometeorological conditions on solute production across the experimental catchment during high flow periods water stored in the organic rich soils from the wetlands connected to the stream network histosols is the main contributor to stream chemistry correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2015 histosols also cause a faster increase of solute concentrations than discharge growth during transition periods from low flow to high flow conditions correa et al 2017 these effects cause a delay between solute concentration peaks and discharge peaks during stormflow events thus explaining the anti clockwise behavior of al cu doc and tnb a similar behavior was observed by shi et al 1985 and williams 1989 in typical monsoonal regime catchments who also reported lagged interactions between stream water concentrations and discharge during storm events conversely in two tropical watersheds wymore et al 2019 linked clockwise hysteric response to solute sources near the monitoring point and consequently limitation of the solute concentration solutes associated to a clockwise c q behavior in our study also revealed different ranges of hi values fig 5 in comparison to those reported by lloyd et al 2016a they calculated values between 0 09 and 0 47 with a mean value of 0 24 these solutes are mainly of geogenic nature i e na sr k si and rb fig 5 these solutes represent one of the most important contributors to stream chemistry during low flow conditions when deeper subsurface flow paths i e water stemming from the shallow fractured bedrock spring water or mineral soil horizons are activated during rainstorm events correa et al 2017 2019 after relatively dry periods the first rainfalls infiltrate quickly producing a fast water table rising which facilitates the mobilization of geogenic solutes to the stream correa et al 2019 the relevance of subsurface water flow paths in stream solutes production in tropical and temperate catchments and continuous permafrost zones has been reported in several studies arnborg et al 1967 baumgartner et al 2022 guo et al 2022 walling 1974 williams 1989 wood 1977 which identified below ground solute sources and distributions of vegetation cover as the main drivers of early depletion of concentration when discharge reaches its peak during rainstorm events this was evidenced in the solute export amount that was approximately 68 for a forested woodland catchment and 30 for a typical lowland tropical forest baumgartner et al 2022 regardless of the dominant hysteretic behavior of the analyzed solutes during the monitored events i e clockwise or anti clockwise all solutes presented shape of 8 hysteretic loops for at least 20 of the events fig 5 solutes belonging to the clockwise dominant na sr k si and rb and mixed ba ca and mg groups are sourced from deeper flow paths across the experimental catchment correa et al 2017 hinting to a production of clockwise hysteresis responses at early stages of the dry season rainstorm hydrograph as discharge increases during the events the concentration of these solutes is diluted and increases at lower rates than stormflow this interaction likely explains the anti clockwise loop observed at the falling limb of the hydrograph generating a shape of 8 hysteresis response for solutes of geogenic nature solutes from the anti clockwise dominated group al cu doc and tnb showed an inverse shape of 8 hysteresis dynamic first an anti clockwise loop is observed followed by a clockwise response at high flow rates the former results from the initially delayed transport of biogenic solutes in relation to stormflow rates this until shallow subsurface flow paths in the organic horizon of the wetland soils histosols are activated favoring a fast mobilization of these solutes at high flows our findings are supported by those reported by williams 1989 in a catchment subject to arctic climatic conditions highlighting the importance of shape of 8 hysteresis loops in stream solute dynamics direct hysteresis loops were mainly observed for solutes of the mixed group ba ca and mg for a limited number of events 14 17 with very few exceptions for the rest of the solutes 4 of the events fig 5 this rather atypical hysteretic behavior in the study site occurs during stormflow events presenting extremely high flow rates those events can trigger a continuous solute supply especially at wet antecedent conditions when a very fast hydrologic response is favored the uninterrupted supply of solutes derives in a synchronized response of concentration and discharge which in turn leads to a direct hysteresis response as has been previously reported by williams 1989 and wood 1977 4 2 factors controlling solute hysteresis in the tropical páramo both the random forest and spearman correlation analyses indicated that discharge is the most important factor influencing the hysteretic response of solutes dominated by an anti clockwise behavior table 2 table 3 as discharge increases shallow subsurface flow paths in the organic rich horizon of the wetland soils connected to the streams histosols activate during storm events resulting in a higher contribution of biogenic solutes al cu doc and tnb to stream water these findings are in line with prior studies developed in the study area showing high contents of organometallic compounds in the chemical signature of histosols castañeda martín and montes pulido 2017 correa et al 2017 2019 mosquera et al 2015 quichimbo 2012 the richness of these solutes in histosols leads to an accelerated increase in solute concentrations evidenced by the influence of concentration variables on hi for organic solutes doc and tnb table 2 and the dominance of mobilization during mid and high flows fig 7a fig 8 fig 9 these findings agree with the observation that water stemming from the shallow organic horizon of páramo soils andosols and histosols is the main contributor to discharge in the study catchment correa et al 2017 and the increase in doc concentrations as discharge increases facilitated by a dominance of mobilization in a tropical montane forested catchment in puerto rico wymore et al 2017 reviewing the literature revealed little information on the association between hydrological variables and anti clockwise hysteretic behavior nevertheless lloyd et al 2016a and rodríguez blanco et al 2018 reported similar findings they found discharge variables and antecedent rainfall conditions as triggering factors of anti clockwise hysteresis response concerning mobilization chemical states hunsaker and johnson 2017 stated that the c q relationships analyzed in a headwater catchment in the sierra nevada are prone to exhibit nutrient enrichment triggered by soil chemistry and vegetation cover instead of discharge factors that show a weak relationship with concentration rates the main drivers of the hysteretic behavior of solutes dominated by a clockwise behavior can be divided into two groups the first group shows the influence of discharge and solute concentration on the variability of hi and loop area for na sr and k table 2 table 3 the relatively high r values between hysteresis indices and solute concentration denote the influence of solute availability on their decrease as discharge increases i e dilution chemical state fig 7 fig 8 fig 9 similar dilution patterns have been reported by stallard and murphy 2014 and wymore et al 2017 on solutes originated from bedrock weathering processes si and mg on catchments with volcaniclastic lithology despite this subsurface solute origin surprisingly the baseflow index had no remarkable effects on the hysteretic behavior of the solutes in the stream table 2 table 3 this outcome is contrary to that of guo et al 2022 who found that mobilization patterns are prone to higher values of bfi across catchments with different climate in australia the second group presents an exclusive influence of discharge on hysteresis indices table 2 table 3 negative r values between discharge variables and hysteresis indices for si and rb suggest a relatively high probability to find a clockwise response at low flow condition due to the deep ground solutes origin they are mobilized to the stream at early stages of the event this finding is further supported by the moderate impact of event duration on these solutes which further suggests a preferential development of clockwise hysteresis particularly for short duration events we can conclude that clockwise hysteresis behavior is more likely to occur in short duration events with low flow rates after dry periods similar findings were reported by bieroza and heathwaite 2015 knapp et al 2020 tardy et al 2004 particularly regarding the main controls on clockwise hysteresis response and its consequential interactions between groundwater and surface water high flow conditions result in shape of 8 and direct hysteresis responses for all solutes analyzed this behavior is partly reflected in the hi tendency to zero as discharge increases fig 8 fig 9 in addition the fact that discharge variables have higher r values than precipitation and concentration variables table 2 further corroborates that discharge is a key variable influencing the occurrence of shape of 8 and direct hysteresis loops these findings agree with those of stallard and murphy 2014 who also found that runoff generation processes are closely linked to solute chemical status dilution of non bioactive solutes ca mg na is related to bedrock weathering and atmospheric deposition mobilization on the contrary is usually associated to shallow soil sources of bioactive solutes e g doc godsey et al 2019 stallard and murphy 2014 this behavior is clearly depicted in our experimental catchment by the dominance of mobilization for solutes stemming from the shallow organic rich horizon of the riparian soils histosols and dilution for solutes originated from deeper subsurface flow paths i e the mineral horizon of the soil and or permeable strata in the shallow bedrock fig 8 fig 9 previous studies have suggested that the variability in hysteresis responses among different hydrologic events and solutes is associated to antecedent rainfall conditions bieroza and heathwaite 2015 knapp et al 2020 however this is not the case for most solutes in our study except for ba and ca whose loop areas are influenced by antecedent precipitation table 3 we attribute the influence of antecedent precipitation to atmospheric solute deposition and resuspension processes of solutes accumulated on the stream bed particularly during low flow conditions as previously reported by d j evans et al 2004 and stallard and murphy 2014 finally future work will analyze the relationships between morphometric catchment characteristics and possible stream chemistry response in a comparative multi catchment study 5 conclusions this study focused on the identification of the main variables influencing the hysteretic behavior of 12 solutes al cu doc tnb ba ca mg na sr k si rb during 85 rainstorm events monitored in a small tropical alpine páramo experimental catchment in order to perform a temporal characterization of multi solute hysteresis loops we employed the methodology proposed by lloyd which allowed us to classify these loops through a quantitative index hi into anti clockwise clockwise shape of 8 and direct responses this is a key factor for comparative purposes with other ecosystems our experimental catchment revealed highly variable hi values making this task even more complex to identify the main hydrometeorological controls on the hysteric response of the solutes we conducted both spearman correlation and classification and regression trees cart techniques between stormflow metrics from precipitation discharge and concentration and hysteresis indices hi and loop area results depicted that solutes can be classified into three different groups according to their main hysteresis response as follows anti clockwise dominated al cu doc and tnb clockwise dominated na sr k si and rb and mixed ba ca and mg groups the anti clockwise response is caused by the shallow subsurface location of solute sources histosols which are activated quickly during rainstorm events and the hydrometeorological seasonality characteristics on solute production clockwise relationships are responsible for the mobilization of geogenic solutes to the stream due to subsurface preferential flow paths when water from the shallow fractured bedrock and mineral soil horizons are activated during rainstorm events after dry periods shape of 8 and direct hysteretic loops hint continuous solute production either by the interaction between rainfall soil and wetlands during dry and wet seasons or the synchronized response of concentration and discharge due to an uninterrupted solute supply correlation and random forest analyses revealed that discharge is the most influential variable on hysteresis indices i e hysteresis index hi and loop area for most solutes except for the loop area of ba and ca for the latter antecedent precipitation up to five days before the start of the events was closely linked to the solute hysteretic behavior overall this study supports the perception that solutes originated from deeper weathering bedrock na sr k si and rb tend to exhibit clockwise hysteresis responses these solutes are therefore dominated by dilution as flow rates increase conversely solutes originating from shallow soil layers al cu doc and tnb such as organic rich riparian soils histosols preferentially exhibit an anti clockwise hysteresis behavior thus mobilization predominates during rainstorm events as their concentrations increases with flow rates we were not able to include important physical factors as influencing characteristics of the stream chemistry hence a quantitative analysis of such relationships was not possible due to the lack of other catchments to demonstrate how these morphological parameters control the hysteresis response of the catchment the latter in addition would imply the need for catchments with very high resolution multi element data a rather scarce data source therefore a natural progression of this work is to analyze such effects of catchment biophysical characteristics together with the c q relationships among catchments in different ecosystems the main concern of this work was to identify the hydrological drivers that influence the hysteresis response in a representative páramo catchment in the high elevation tropical andes this is of vital importance for andean communities as our water quality depends on the future and or actual climate and land use change effects which could completely modify these dynamics our findings contribute to a more robust understanding of the processes governing stream chemistry response in high elevation tropical experimental catchments in addition to a quantitative evaluation of hysteretic solute behaviour that could be easily replicated in other study catchments credit authorship contribution statement pablo peña conceptualization methodology

2159,hydrometeorological characteristics can influence stream chemistry variability and the identification of their dominant drivers provides much needed insight into catchment functioning in the tropics particularly the rainfall runoff processes that determine catchment capacity to retain and deliver solutes in this context concentration discharge c q relationships allow assessing solute delivery mechanisms to streams here we used a high frequency 5 minute multi solute data set al cu doc tnb ba ca mg na sr k si rb to derive hysteresis indicators direction magnitude and area in relation to hydrometeorological variables for a high elevation tropical experimental catchment we found geogenic solutes na sr k si and rb were mostly defined by clockwise hysteresis loops and dilution patterns conversely biogenic solutes influenced by soil processes al cu doc and tnb resulted in anti clockwise hysteresis behaviors and mobilization with streamflow the hysteresis indicators were most strongly influenced by discharge magnitude and the solute concentration itself as the discharge and the concentration increases 90th of the flow duration curve the loop area and the hysteresis index turned to cero showing a direct linear response of the solute to discharge dynamics additionally increasing discharge drives greater dilution or mobilization patterns for the geogenic and biogenic solutes higher discharge increases water volume to dilute geogenic solutes and is related to more water passing through shallow soils leaching biogenic solutes this study contributes to our understanding of how páramo catchments store and release solutes for a more adequate water resource management keywords hysteresis tracers concentration discharge solutes tropics páramo data

intensity characteristics daley et al 2009 ibarra et al 2016 pesántez et al 2018 winnick et al 2017 one of the main factors controlling stream solute dynamics is catchment hydrological behavior due to the interaction between hydrological and biogeochemical processes butturini et al 2008 mcclain et al 2003 recent studies point to that projections of global climate change will enhance water scarcity and floods that directly affects hydrological processes aggravating extreme events therefore future investigations where streamflow plays an essential role in describing chemical catchment behaviors are vital molina et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 the hydrological biogeochemical interaction can be assessed for individual hydrological events that mobilize solutes originating from different catchment compartments e g vegetation soil groundwater etc to the stream biron et al 1999 such a solute delivery mechanism can be described using concentration discharge c q relations walling 1974 williams 1989 the concentration discharge relation often exhibits a hysteretic behavior in which the same discharge volume is associated to different solute concentrations on the rising and falling limbs of the stormflow event hydrograph o kane 2005 phillips 2003 analysis of hysteresis can help to identify the origin and fate of solutes delivered to streams and to learn about catchment biogeochemical functioning chanat et al 2002 evans and davies 1998 jiang et al 2010 murphy et al 2014 qualitative and quantitative approaches have been developed to characterize the hysteretic behavior of stream solute dynamics williams 1989 quantitative approaches are based on the shape magnitude and direction of solute hysteresis loops known as hysteresis indices butturini et al 2008 such indices can be computed as ratios langlois et al 2005 lawler et al 2006 or differences lloyd et al 2016b zuecco et al 2016 between solute concentration values on the rising and falling limbs of stormflow hydrographs high frequency sub hourly streamflow and stream chemistry data should be ideally used to compute hysteresis indices evans and davies 1998 lloyd et al 2016b high resolution stream water quality data can be obtained using in situ sensors e g based on spectrometry techniques such sensors allow obtaining a detailed description of hydrochemical behavior jones et al 2011 kirchner et al 2004 pesántez et al 2021 which is usually ignored at lower weekly or monthly sampling resolutions bowes et al 2009 2015 kirchner et al 2004 madrid and zayas 2007 robson et al 1991 the combined analysis of hysteretic behavior and c q relations allows exploring ecohydrological processes related to solute dynamics zuecco et al 2016 such c q relations can be classified into chemostasis mobilization and dilution basu et al 2011 chanat et al 2002 godsey et al 2009 herndon et al 2015 maher 2011 a chemostatic behavior occurs when solute delivery to streams depends on physical factors rather than discharge variation godsey et al 2009 when discharge dominates the chemical status may be mobilization or dilution of solutes mobilization implies increasing solute concentrations as discharge increases whereas dilution resembles the opposite i e decreasing solute concentrations with increasing discharge chanat et al 2002 maher 2011 recent studies showed that solute chemical status is strongly influenced by climate and catchment size moatar et al 2017 nicolau et al 2006 rainfall patterns hornberger et al 2001 tardy et al 2004 lithology and land cover godsey et al 2019 anthropogenic and biological activities creed et al 2015 water table variations daley et al 2009 ibarra et al 2016 winnick et al 2017 and streamflow hale and godsey 2019 for instance it has been shown that water stored in organic rich soils such as histosols and andosols constitutes the main contributor to the stream chemistry of high flow periods due to the generation of continuous solute pulses as a result of its activation from shallow subsurface pathways birkel et al 2017 correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2015 tunaley et al 2018 therefore hysteresis analysis can reveal valuable information about biogeochemical cycles runoff generation mechanisms effects of antecedent moisture conditions on chemical stream variability and connectivity of solute sources to streams murphy et al 2014 shanley et al 2015 spence 2010 wymore et al 2017 there is a lack of information relating hydrological processes to hysteretic behavior baumgartner et al 2022 nevertheless few studies managed to identify runoff variables soil chemistry morphometric properties and antecedent rainfall conditions as triggers of clockwise and anti clockwise hysteretic responses e g baumgartner et al 2022 lloyd et al 2016a rodríguez blanco et al 2018 stallard and murphy 2014 despite the advantages investigating the hysteretic behavior and c q relations of stream water solutes knowledge about association between hydrological variables and this phenomenon is still scarce limitations arise mainly due to the scarcity of data as a result of financial and logistical constraints our aim is to fill this knowledge gap by taking advantage of a unique hydrometeorological and stream water chemistry dataset for a range of solutes al cu doc tnb ba ca mg na sr k si rb collected at high temporal frequency every 5 minutes in a tropical alpine páramo experimental catchment located in the highlands of southern ecuador using this rich dataset we seek to accomplish the following specific objectives i to characterize c q dynamics during stormflow events using hysteresis indicators ii to determine the chemical status of the analyzed solutes for individual hydrological events based on objective i iii to identify the environmental factors controlling the dynamics of stream water solutes if any 2 materials methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in a small pristine tropical montane headwater

is mainly influenced by air masses originating from the atlantic ocean through the amazon forest esquivel hernández et al 2019 zhiña et al 2022 mean annual precipitation and mean annual discharge during the period march 2018 march 2019 was 1245 mm at 3765 m a s l and 582 mm respectively resulting in an average runoff coefficient of 0 47 and a concentration time of 8 h precipitation is

and horizontal stratified sands formations from the late miocene pratt et al 1997 these quaternary formations are the result of the volcanic and glacial activity that occurred during the last ice age coltorti and ollier 2000 hungerbühler et al 2002 the zeo presents two main soil types known as histosols and andosols according to the fao soil classification system histosols and andosols cover 22 and 78 of the catchment area respectively crespo et al 2011 mosquera et al 2015 these black soils are strongly acidic ph 4 8 rich in organic matter content and highly porous conferring them a high water retention capacity mosquera et al 2020 histosols are mainly located at valley bottoms reaching depths up to 70 cm mosquera et al 2015 quichimbo 2012 and they are usually overlain by cushion plant vegetation plantago rigida xenophyllum humile azorella spp mosses and lichens ramsay and oxley 1997 sklenar and jorgensen 1999 the presence of andean wetlands at zeo is caused by the strong correlation that exists between histosol soils and cushion plants r2 0 74 these wetlands play an important role in the runoff generation process mosquera et al 2015 andosols are preferentially located

resolution during the period march 2018 august 2018 2 2 3 selection and classification of stormflow events fig 2 provides a simple graphical scheme to illustrate the methodology of this study we used the peak over threshold pot method to identify individual stormflow events during the study period this method consists of retaining all peak discharge values exceeding a certain discharge threshold lang et al 1999 to select an independent discharge event the 30th percentile of the historical discharge values considered as baseflow correa et al 2016 recorded since 2010 in the study zone was set as threshold this procedure was carried out using the r package pot ribatet and dutang 2018 the beginning and the end of the discharge events were set to the mentioned pot threshold however precipitation dynamics during the wet season march 2018 august 2018 resulted in discharge events presenting multiple discharge peaks in such cases we considered each peak as a separate event to quantify the solute response following the methodology presented by lloyd et al 2016a we manually set the beginning and the end of the event where they exactly match by visual inspections carried out among the clusters produced by the pot r package seasonal hydrological behavior was assessed by grouping streamflow into three categories high mid and low flows based on the flow duration curve fdc of the experimental catchment following mosquera et al 2015 high flows are defined as those exceeding the 90th percentile q90 mid flows are between the 30th and 90th percentile q30 q90 and low flows are those below the 30th percentile of the fdc q30 2 3 chemical status of the events we classified each stormflow event according to its chemical status using concentration discharge relations c q as follows chemostasis mobilization or dilution basu et al 2010 clow and mast 2010 godsey et al 2009 chemostatic status implies that the slope of the linear regression between the log solute concentration log c and log discharge log q is close to zero a positive slope of the log c vs log q regression line points towards mobilization enrichment and a negative slope indicates dilution this framework was applied to classify the biogeochemical behavior of the experimental catchment in response to discharge dynamics for each monitored event 2 4 hysteresis index calculation concentration discharge loops were developed for each selected stormflow event and solute these were classified by shape into 5 types table 1 williams 1989 the above explained hysteresis classification is prone to subjective interpretations particularly for complex hysteresis loops such as classes ii iii and v bowes et al 2015 butturini et al 2008 evans and davies 1998 to cope with this methodological constraint we additionally evaluated the hysteresis index hi proposed by lloyd et al 2016b this index considers the range of solute concentrations between the rising and falling limbs of the hysteresis loop at multiple discharge percentiles throughout the event stepwise each 5th percentile in the hi calculation process the first step is to normalize the discharge and solute concentration information 2 norm q i q i q min q max q min 3 norm c i c i c min c max c min where qi ci is the discharge solute concentration at timestep i qmin cmin is the minimum discharge solute concentration value and qmax cmax is the maximum discharge solute concentration value during a given stormflow event hi is then calculated as follows 4 hi q i norm c r l q i norm c f l q i where hiqi is the hysteresis index at percentile i of discharge norm crl qi is the normalized solute concentration of the rising limb at percentile i of discharge and norm cfl qi is the normalized solute concentration at the equivalent point in discharge on the falling limb the percentiles of discharge qi are calculated as 5 q i k q max q min q max where qmax is the peak discharge qmin is the discharge at the start of the event and k is the point along the loop at which the hi is calculated in our specific case hi was calculated every 5th percentile of discharge that is k 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 95 the dimensionless resulting hi index varies between 1 and 1 and is easy to interpret the larger the hi value the flatter the loop with hi values close to 0 indicating the shape of the loop resembles a shape of 8 loop the sign of the hi indicates the direction of the loop positive values reflect a clockwise loop and negative values indicate an anti clockwise loop additionally we calculated the loop area for each hysteresis loop which varies between 0 and 1 the larger the area of the loop the greater the time lag between peak discharge and peak concentration in combination with the hi the loop area helps to interpret the amplitude and strength of the hysteresis loop 2 5 factors controlling the hysteresis of solutes we assessed the influence of stormflow characteristics on solute concentration dynamics calculating precipitation discharge and solute concentration metrics these metrics were considered as potential predictor variables and are hereafter referred to as stormflow metrics for each variable we computed average mean maximum max and minimum min values as well as the range max min during the events it should be noted that the vegetation cover affects the hydrological response of the catchment through interception infiltration and evapotranspiration processes consequently the runoff coefficient might represent an important factor of the c q response patterns and constitute a key comparison between catchments with similar organic matter production and different vegetation cover distributions accordingly we also computed the runoff coefficient for each identified event and considered it as a stormflow metric with the aim of evaluating the effects of subsurface baseflow contribution to the stream chemistry we computed a baseflow index bfi as discharge metric using the lynne hollick baseflow filter lyne and hollick 1979 to account for the potential influence of antecedent conditions on the hysteric behavior of the actual event the average of these variables mean max min range for periods of 24 48 72 96 and 120 h before the start of the events was also estimated and are referred to as mean24 mean48 etc respectively in addition the volume amount of antecedent rainfall was also characterized and hereafter we refer to it simply as accumulated the length of time for each discharge event is referred to as duration first we carried out a spearman correlation analysis between stormflow metrics and hysteresis indices hi and loop area we reduced the dimensionality and selected the most important metrics of the correlation matrix using the classification and regression trees cart method breiman et al 1984 implemented in the r package rpart therneau and atkinson 2019 we ranked the stormflow metrics according to their impact on hi and loop area variability with a random forest rf analysis using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 increased mean square error incmse and increased impurity index incnodepurity were applied to define the hierarchical importance of stormflow variables the higher the incmse and incnodepurity the higher the influence of the stormflow metric on the hysteresis indices 3 results 3 1 selection and characterization of stormflow events during the study period march 2018 august 2018 we identified 85 stormflow events fig 3 these events were monitored during low 20 events 23 5 mid 36 events 42 4 and high 29 events 34 1 flow conditions all events were characterized according to their hydrological i e antecedent precipitation and discharge dynamics fig 4 a complete description of the hydrological and chemical characterization of the stormflow events can be found in appendix a the study interval was an average period in terms of 676 86 mm precipitation and 382 31 mm discharge compared to the annual average value of 1345 mm for precipitation and 786 mm for discharge the maximum event 51 recorded a peak flow of 1952 18 and the minimum event 85 only 19 90 l s 1 event peak average discharge was 259 63 l s 1 fig 4b clearly reflects the homogeneous distribution of rainfall throughout the year with almost identical antecedent conditions whereas the streamflow response is directly driven by rainfall fig 3 3 2 characterization of the hysteresis loops after computing the hysteresis metrics hi and loop area for each individual hydrological event and each solute we conducted a visual inspection of the results generated by the lloyd methodology to confirm that hysteric patterns are in accordance with the shape classification of loops proposed by williams 1989 most solutes were grouped see fig 5 for the classification into three main categories according to the dominant hysteresis types at least 60 of the time anti clockwise al cu doc and tnb clockwise na sr k si and rb and a mixed group presenting four hysteresis types ba ca and mg regardless of this general classification all solutes displayed some shape of 8 hysteresis loops from 19 48 for al to the highest proportion for ba 42 86 and ca 46 75 of the mixed group some solutes belonging to the anti clockwise dominated group cu doc and tnb showed few clockwise hysteresis events 1 30 3 13 and 3 13 respectively whereas no anti clockwise events were identified for the clockwise dominated group the highest proportion of direct events class i from table 1 was found for the mixed group with only a few events of this type observed for the other two groups no events showing a single line plus loop c q relation were identified for visualization purposes we present one representative solute for each of the dominant groups doc for anti clockwise dominance na for clockwise dominance and ca for the mixed group during different stormflow events fig 6 events 68 11 and 72 exhibited a shape of 8 hysteresis loop for doc na and ca respectively first row in the figure doc and na hysteresis loops had similar shapes and areas but opposite loop directions events 46 24 and 21 displayed the typical response for each group doc anti clockwise na clockwise and ca direct respectively second in the figure 3 3 chemical status of the monitored events the 85 stormflow events were classified according to the chemical status of each of the analyzed solutes fig 7 shows the classification for representative elements dominated by anti clockwise doc and clockwise na hysteretic behavior during the study period mobilization was predominant for doc fig 7a ba cu ca mg al and tnb 83 5 95 3 of all events to the contrary most events showed a tendency towards dilution for na fig 7b sr k si and rb 60 0 83 5 chemostatic behavior was rarely observed and was only found for a small proportion of events for the following solutes sr 3 5 na 7 1 ca 3 5 and mg 4 7 3 4 factors controlling the hysteresis of solutes spearman correlation and random forest analyses were carried out to identify variables potentially controlling the hysteresis of solutes table 2 and table 3 the most important variable driving hi variability was discharge according to the spearman correlation coefficient 0 235 r 0 498 from nine of the twelve solutes analyzed and the importance of variables resulting from the random forest analysis hereafter referred to as random forest importance rfi table 2 the range maximum and mean discharge metrics presented the highest values of r and rfi and the relative importance of these variables usually coincided for most solutes table 2 event duration presented a moderate impact on si and rb based on r values 0 246 and 0 247 respectively the clockwise dominated group na sr k si rb was generally negatively correlated with discharge variables solutes in this group were also influenced by concentration table 2 typically solutes belonging to the clockwise dominated group al cu doc tnb had high r values when correlated with max concentration whereas solutes having a mixed behavior ba ca mg presented a strong correlation with concentration range table 2 however rfi ranking showed that only a few solutes exhibited concentration variables as the most important ones in hi variability precipitation and the bfi exhibited little to no effect on hi variability for all solutes table 2 the runoff coefficient rc is directly related to interception infiltration and evapotranspiration processes which have a uniform distribution in our experimental catchment due to the presence of tussock grasses and cushion plants as expected rc is less relevant 0 03 r squared 0 24 0 03 p value 0 68 in the identification of hysteresis controls in our system and did not reveal any tendency or remarkable relationship despite this lack of relevance of rc on both hi and area metrics we would not discard the rc potential as a hysteresis driver in other catchments with different hydrological regimes similar to hi discharge variables were more influential on loop area variability than concentration and precipitation variables table 3 correlation values between loop area and discharge and concentration variables were similar to those identified for hi the main difference between both indices was that mean antecedent precipitation variables specifically mean72 mean96 and mean120 were more influential for the loop area of ba and ca than for the hi table 2 in general discharge is clearly the most important variable controlling the temporal dynamics of solutes during the 85 monitored events followed by concentration variables surprisingly the influence of precipitation is statistically close to null we analyzed the relation between discharge variables and hysteresis indicators to further examine links between hydrological behavior and hysteresis response variability fig 8 and fig 9 the range of discharge qrange metric was selected for this analysis because it yielded high r and rfi values in relation to other analyzed variables fig 7 shows the variability of qrange and hi for each solute considered in this study it is generally observed that hi tends to zero as qrange increases for high flows meaning that the loop shape tends to a low area shape of 8 or a direct response there is no clear trend between qrange and hi for low and mid flow rates as hi is highly variable at those conditions all solutes belonging to the anti clockwise dominant al cu doc and tnb and mixed groups ba ca and mg were dominated by a dilution chemical status at low flows except for a few events displaying a mobilization status fig 8 for mid and high flows the mobilization chemical status was dominant for those solutes on the contrary solutes of the clockwise dominant group na sr k si and rb had an opposite chemical status i e mobilization at low flow rates and dilution at mid and high flow rates for most events fig 8 chemostatic status was rarely observed except for a few events for na at high flows and for na ca and mg at low flows when analyzing the relation between qrange and loop area we observed that the area of the loops tended to zero as qrange increased at high flow rates fig 9 for solutes in the anti clockwise al cu doc and tnb and clockwise dominant na sr k si and rb groups this behavior denotes that the loop shape inclines to a low area shape of 8 or a direct hysteresis response for these solutes nevertheless solutes of the mixed group did not display a clear tendency at high flows as their loop areas presented an ample variability regardless of the qrange no clear relation between qrange and loop area was observed due to the large variability of loop area at low and mid flow rates for all solutes fig 9 anti clockwise dominant and mixed groups showed a dominance of dilution at low flow rates with only a few events point out to mobilization mobilization was dominant at mid and high flows for these groups clockwise dominant solutes had an opposite trend mobilization at low flow rates and dilution at mid and high flows with only a few exceptions fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 temporal characterization of multi solute hysteresis generally hysteresis loop shapes are associated with the distance between the solute source and the measurement location or the difference between the water and solute travel times hughes et al 2012 smith and dragovich 2009 williams 1989 the latter is related to morphological characteristics of the catchment such as geology and topography brasington and richards 2000 previous studies indicated that the catchment chemical behavior is sensible to its morphometry reduced dilution patterns of solutes can be linked to small water volumes and catchment area moatar et al 2017 nicolau et al 2006 however catchment area might not define the concentration discharge relationships due to diffuse water sources related for example to percentage land use change or cover with an increase in catchment area williams et al 2016 on the other hand terrain characteristics such as slope roughness relief and compactness are prone to impact the solute transport capacity and consequently the solute mobilization response magalhães et al 2022 milliman and syvitski 1992 tanaka et al 2016 simulations carried out by han et al 2018 and hu et al 2020 show that surface roughness influences significantly the transportation of solutes within the naturally fractured walls of materials and bed compounds concluding that solute transfer characteristics are mainly defined by water depth friction velocity and bed permeability due to these factors the roughness coefficient becomes a metric highly variable through the catchment and most importantly this even depends on the streamflow and velocity in the river cedillo et al 2021 yochum et al 2014 particularly in páramo catchments where this value ranges between 0 508 and 0 934 poulenard et al 2001 an investigation conducted in a headwater tropical catchment identified certain morphological indicators such as area slope gravelius compactness coefficient and form factor as strong predictors of the stream water quality nevertheless stream solutes variability also depends on chemical biological and anthropogenic processes which cause non conservative behaviors in the main channel for the monitored parameters magalhães et al 2022 the well known hydrological pedological and geological features of our study area allow to discern the key factors causing different c q dynamics for the analyzed solutes the anti clockwise c q relations identified for solutes of biogenic nature al cu doc and tnb fig 5 show larger extreme hi values compared to those presented by lloyd et al 2016a where the anti clockwise pattern ranges between 0 65 and 0 21 with a mean of 0 24 this particular c q response is mainly caused by two factors the first factor relates to the shallow subsurface location of solute sources histosols which are preferentially activated during rainstorm events storm events generate continuous al cu doc and tnb pulses in the stream chemical signature due to high contents of organometallic compounds in the histosols organic matter al fe castañeda martín and montes pulido 2017 mosquera et al 2015 pesántez et al 2018 quichimbo 2012 a similar behaviour for doc was found in other temperate organic rich soil experimental catchments such as in upland scotland tunaley et al 2018 and the german harz mountains birkel et al 2017 the second factor reflects the effect of the temporal variability in hydrometeorological conditions on solute production across the experimental catchment during high flow periods water stored in the organic rich soils from the wetlands connected to the stream network histosols is the main contributor to stream chemistry correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2015 histosols also cause a faster increase of solute concentrations than discharge growth during transition periods from low flow to high flow conditions correa et al 2017 these effects cause a delay between solute concentration peaks and discharge peaks during stormflow events thus explaining the anti clockwise behavior of al cu doc and tnb a similar behavior was observed by shi et al 1985 and williams 1989 in typical monsoonal regime catchments who also reported lagged interactions between stream water concentrations and discharge during storm events conversely in two tropical watersheds wymore et al 2019 linked clockwise hysteric response to solute sources near the monitoring point and consequently limitation of the solute concentration solutes associated to a clockwise c q behavior in our study also revealed different ranges of hi values fig 5 in comparison to those reported by lloyd et al 2016a they calculated values between 0 09 and 0 47 with a mean value of 0 24 these solutes are mainly of geogenic nature i e na sr k si and rb fig 5 these solutes represent one of the most important contributors to stream chemistry during low flow conditions when deeper subsurface flow paths i e water stemming from the shallow fractured bedrock spring water or mineral soil horizons are activated during rainstorm events correa et al 2017 2019 after relatively dry periods the first rainfalls infiltrate quickly producing a fast water table rising which facilitates the mobilization of geogenic solutes to the stream correa et al 2019 the relevance of subsurface water flow paths in stream solutes production in tropical and temperate catchments and continuous permafrost zones has been reported in several studies arnborg et al 1967 baumgartner et al 2022 guo et al 2022 walling 1974 williams 1989 wood 1977 which identified below ground solute sources and distributions of vegetation cover as the main drivers of early depletion of concentration when discharge reaches its peak during rainstorm events this was evidenced in the solute export amount that was approximately 68 for a forested woodland catchment and 30 for a typical lowland tropical forest baumgartner et al 2022 regardless of the dominant hysteretic behavior of the analyzed solutes during the monitored events i e clockwise or anti clockwise all solutes presented shape of 8 hysteretic loops for at least 20 of the events fig 5 solutes belonging to the clockwise dominant na sr k si and rb and mixed ba ca and mg groups are sourced from deeper flow paths across the experimental catchment correa et al 2017 hinting to a production of clockwise hysteresis responses at early stages of the dry season rainstorm hydrograph as discharge increases during the events the concentration of these solutes is diluted and increases at lower rates than stormflow this interaction likely explains the anti clockwise loop observed at the falling limb of the hydrograph generating a shape of 8 hysteresis response for solutes of geogenic nature solutes from the anti clockwise dominated group al cu doc and tnb showed an inverse shape of 8 hysteresis dynamic first an anti clockwise loop is observed followed by a clockwise response at high flow rates the former results from the initially delayed transport of biogenic solutes in relation to stormflow rates this until shallow subsurface flow paths in the organic horizon of the wetland soils histosols are activated favoring a fast mobilization of these solutes at high flows our findings are supported by those reported by williams 1989 in a catchment subject to arctic climatic conditions highlighting the importance of shape of 8 hysteresis loops in stream solute dynamics direct hysteresis loops were mainly observed for solutes of the mixed group ba ca and mg for a limited number of events 14 17 with very few exceptions for the rest of the solutes 4 of the events fig 5 this rather atypical hysteretic behavior in the study site occurs during stormflow events presenting extremely high flow rates those events can trigger a continuous solute supply especially at wet antecedent conditions when a very fast hydrologic response is favored the uninterrupted supply of solutes derives in a synchronized response of concentration and discharge which in turn leads to a direct hysteresis response as has been previously reported by williams 1989 and wood 1977 4 2 factors controlling solute hysteresis in the tropical páramo both the random forest and spearman correlation analyses indicated that discharge is the most important factor influencing the hysteretic response of solutes dominated by an anti clockwise behavior table 2 table 3 as discharge increases shallow subsurface flow paths in the organic rich horizon of the wetland soils connected to the streams histosols activate during storm events resulting in a higher contribution of biogenic solutes al cu doc and tnb to stream water these findings are in line with prior studies developed in the study area showing high contents of organometallic compounds in the chemical signature of histosols castañeda martín and montes pulido 2017 correa et al 2017 2019 mosquera et al 2015 quichimbo 2012 the richness of these solutes in histosols leads to an accelerated increase in solute concentrations evidenced by the influence of concentration variables on hi for organic solutes doc and tnb table 2 and the dominance of mobilization during mid and high flows fig 7a fig 8 fig 9 these findings agree with the observation that water stemming from the shallow organic horizon of páramo soils andosols and histosols is the main contributor to discharge in the study catchment correa et al 2017 and the increase in doc concentrations as discharge increases facilitated by a dominance of mobilization in a tropical montane forested catchment in puerto rico wymore et al 2017 reviewing the literature revealed little information on the association between hydrological variables and anti clockwise hysteretic behavior nevertheless lloyd et al 2016a and rodríguez blanco et al 2018 reported similar findings they found discharge variables and antecedent rainfall conditions as triggering factors of anti clockwise hysteresis response concerning mobilization chemical states hunsaker and johnson 2017 stated that the c q relationships analyzed in a headwater catchment in the sierra nevada are prone to exhibit nutrient enrichment triggered by soil chemistry and vegetation cover instead of discharge factors that show a weak relationship with concentration rates the main drivers of the hysteretic behavior of solutes dominated by a clockwise behavior can be divided into two groups the first group shows the influence of discharge and solute concentration on the variability of hi and loop area for na sr and k table 2 table 3 the relatively high r values between hysteresis indices and solute concentration denote the influence of solute availability on their decrease as discharge increases i e dilution chemical state fig 7 fig 8 fig 9 similar dilution patterns have been reported by stallard and murphy 2014 and wymore et al 2017 on solutes originated from bedrock weathering processes si and mg on catchments with volcaniclastic lithology despite this subsurface solute origin surprisingly the baseflow index had no remarkable effects on the hysteretic behavior of the solutes in the stream table 2 table 3 this outcome is contrary to that of guo et al 2022 who found that mobilization patterns are prone to higher values of bfi across catchments with different climate in australia the second group presents an exclusive influence of discharge on hysteresis indices table 2 table 3 negative r values between discharge variables and hysteresis indices for si and rb suggest a relatively high probability to find a clockwise response at low flow condition due to the deep ground solutes origin they are mobilized to the stream at early stages of the event this finding is further supported by the moderate impact of event duration on these solutes which further suggests a preferential development of clockwise hysteresis particularly for short duration events we can conclude that clockwise hysteresis behavior is more likely to occur in short duration events with low flow rates after dry periods similar findings were reported by bieroza and heathwaite 2015 knapp et al 2020 tardy et al 2004 particularly regarding the main controls on clockwise hysteresis response and its consequential interactions between groundwater and surface water high flow conditions result in shape of 8 and direct hysteresis responses for all solutes analyzed this behavior is partly reflected in the hi tendency to zero as discharge increases fig 8 fig 9 in addition the fact that discharge variables have higher r values than precipitation and concentration variables table 2 further corroborates that discharge is a key variable influencing the occurrence of shape of 8 and direct hysteresis loops these findings agree with those of stallard and murphy 2014 who also found that runoff generation processes are closely linked to solute chemical status dilution of non bioactive solutes ca mg na is related to bedrock weathering and atmospheric deposition mobilization on the contrary is usually associated to shallow soil sources of bioactive solutes e g doc godsey et al 2019 stallard and murphy 2014 this behavior is clearly depicted in our experimental catchment by the dominance of mobilization for solutes stemming from the shallow organic rich horizon of the riparian soils histosols and dilution for solutes originated from deeper subsurface flow paths i e the mineral horizon of the soil and or permeable strata in the shallow bedrock fig 8 fig 9 previous studies have suggested that the variability in hysteresis responses among different hydrologic events and solutes is associated to antecedent rainfall conditions bieroza and heathwaite 2015 knapp et al 2020 however this is not the case for most solutes in our study except for ba and ca whose loop areas are influenced by antecedent precipitation table 3 we attribute the influence of antecedent precipitation to atmospheric solute deposition and resuspension processes of solutes accumulated on the stream bed particularly during low flow conditions as previously reported by d j evans et al 2004 and stallard and murphy 2014 finally future work will analyze the relationships between morphometric catchment characteristics and possible stream chemistry response in a comparative multi catchment study 5 conclusions this study focused on the identification of the main variables influencing the hysteretic behavior of 12 solutes al cu doc tnb ba ca mg na sr k si rb during 85 rainstorm events monitored in a small tropical alpine páramo experimental catchment in order to perform a temporal characterization of multi solute hysteresis loops we employed the methodology proposed by lloyd which allowed us to classify these loops through a quantitative index hi into anti clockwise clockwise shape of 8 and direct responses this is a key factor for comparative purposes with other ecosystems our experimental catchment revealed highly variable hi values making this task even more complex to identify the main hydrometeorological controls on the hysteric response of the solutes we conducted both spearman correlation and classification and regression trees cart techniques between stormflow metrics from precipitation discharge and concentration and hysteresis indices hi and loop area results depicted that solutes can be classified into three different groups according to their main hysteresis response as follows anti clockwise dominated al cu doc and tnb clockwise dominated na sr k si and rb and mixed ba ca and mg groups the anti clockwise response is caused by the shallow subsurface location of solute sources histosols which are activated quickly during rainstorm events and the hydrometeorological seasonality characteristics on solute production clockwise relationships are responsible for the mobilization of geogenic solutes to the stream due to subsurface preferential flow paths when water from the shallow fractured bedrock and mineral soil horizons are activated during rainstorm events after dry periods shape of 8 and direct hysteretic loops hint continuous solute production either by the interaction between rainfall soil and wetlands during dry and wet seasons or the synchronized response of concentration and discharge due to an uninterrupted solute supply correlation and random forest analyses revealed that discharge is the most influential variable on hysteresis indices i e hysteresis index hi and loop area for most solutes except for the loop area of ba and ca for the latter antecedent precipitation up to five days before the start of the events was closely linked to the solute hysteretic behavior overall this study supports the perception that solutes originated from deeper weathering bedrock na sr k si and rb tend to exhibit clockwise hysteresis responses these solutes are therefore dominated by dilution as flow rates increase conversely solutes originating from shallow soil layers al cu doc and tnb such as organic rich riparian soils histosols preferentially exhibit an anti clockwise hysteresis behavior thus mobilization predominates during rainstorm events as their concentrations increases with flow rates we were not able to include important physical factors as influencing characteristics of the stream chemistry hence a quantitative analysis of such relationships was not possible due to the lack of other catchments to demonstrate how these morphological parameters control the hysteresis response of the catchment the latter in addition would imply the need for catchments with very high resolution multi element data a rather scarce data source therefore a natural progression of this work is to analyze such effects of catchment biophysical characteristics together with the c q relationships among catchments in different ecosystems the main concern of this work was to identify the hydrological drivers that influence the hysteresis response in a representative páramo catchment in the high elevation tropical andes this is of vital importance for andean communities as our water quality depends on the future and or actual climate and land use change effects which could completely modify these dynamics our findings contribute to a more robust understanding of the processes governing stream chemistry response in high elevation tropical experimental catchments in addition to a quantitative evaluation of hysteretic solute behaviour that could be easily replicated in other study catchments credit authorship contribution statement pablo peña conceptualization methodology
