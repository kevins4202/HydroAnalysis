19690,iron redox cycle plays a primary role in controlling the mobility of p in sediments it is crucial to better understand how lanthanum la modified bentonite lmb phoslock an increasingly employed capping agent immobilizes p from sediments by altering fe redox coupled p cycling batch adsorption experiments found that lmb effectively adsorbed fe ii with a capacity of 8 51 mg g 1 fe ii preloaded lmb effectively retained p during a 518 hour equilibration while up to 16 7 of adsorbed p was release sensitive in lmb without fe ii preloading a 60 day incubation experiment was performed using sediment cores with an lmb amendment dosage of up to 200 lmb pmob w w pmob denotes the amount of mobile p in the surface 40 mm sediment layer the concentrations of pore water soluble reactive p srp and labile p were measured by high resolution dialysis hr peeper and by diffusive gradient in thin films dgt respectively at a vertical millimeter scale they stratified into static layers with extremely low concentration distribution in the top 16 22 mm sediments mean srp 0 28 mg l 1 and mean dgt labile p 0 051 mg l 1 and active layers with decreased upward diffusion potential 5 85 for srp and 12 7 for dgt labile p below the static layer when the applied dosage reached 60 lmb pmob the lmb amendment reduced the pore water fe and dgt labile fe in sediments while considerable amounts of fe and fe bound p existed in the lmb binding layer 25 of the total p in 200 lmb pmob treatment these findings show that the adsorption of fe by lmb plays a significant role in the stabilization of lmb bound p possibly by adsorbing release sensitive p initially bound to the rhabdophane surface lmb adsorbed fe and p were not released until the redox potential decreased to extremely reductive conditions 150 mv to 300 mv possibly due to the re adsorption of fe and p by lmb this study reveals synergistic effects of fe adsorption and provides new insight into the immobilization mechanisms of p by lmb application graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediment phosphorous lanthanum modified bentonite phoslock iron redox diffusive gradients in thin films capping 1 introduction processes involved in the release of internally loaded phosphorus p from sediments has gained much research attention due to its usefulness in determining the trophic stage of an aquatic system wu et al 2017 the application of capping agents to form an active barrier layer covering the sediment water interface swi improves the p binding capacity of sediments by allowing the association of agents with release sensitive p pmob therefore minimizing the release of p into the water column meis et al 2012 to date a range of capping agents have been developed and are widely applied in lakes as geoengineering tools typically composed of high levels of aluminum calcium iron and other metal compounds in the form of oxides or hydroxides douglas et al 2016 fan et al 2017 li and pan 2015 wang et al 2017a a lanthanum modified bentonite clay lmb commercially known as phoslock was developed by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro of australia us patent no 6350383 robb et al 2003 and has shown promise for the deliberate manipulation of internal p processes in the natural environment douglas et al 2016 spears et al 2016 dithmer et al 2016a the lmb has to date been reported to be applied to more than 200 water bodies across a wide geographic distribution copetti et al 2016 immobilization efficiency of lmb can be sustained with time through the formation of rhabdophane and monazite which have low solubility and high stability dithmer et al 2015 the efficiency is less ph dependent with a maximum efficiency within a ph range of 5 7 and a decreasing trend in efficiency above ph 9 and the adsorbed p does not release under anoxic condition ross et al 2008 the number and taxa of macroinvertebrate fauna can recover from the lmb amendment after one year application due to the shift in trophic state of the lake waajen et al 2017 iron fe is a redox sensitive element and its redox cycle has a primary role in the control of p mobility in sediments ding et al 2016a previous studies have mostly focused on the interactions between p and lmb while the effects of fe redox cycle on lmb immobilization as yet remain unclear it is well recognized that the immobilization of p by lmb occurs mainly by a shift of p partition in sediments from fe bound p i e bicarbonate dithionite bd extracted p to la bound p i e hcl extracted p reitzel et al 2013a meis et al 2013 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 bishop et al 2014 however previous studies confirmed that not all lmb loaded p is stabilized by la binding for instance meis et al 2012 reported that 21 of srp in lmb could be extracted by bd confirming that a significant portion of lmb bound p is in the form of fe or mn bound p reitzel et al 2013a found that a high amount of fe can be extracted from pure lmb by bd which may infer that the accumulated fe in the lmb possibly benefits the immobilization of additional p besides the lmb binding under oxic condition conversely dithmer et al 2016b argued that bd extracted p was not bound to fe or mn oxides and is instead adsorbed to the surface of rhabdophane as no fe or mn oxides were observed in lmb using 31p nmr spectroscopy as fe oxyhydroxides are strong absorbents for p kumar et al 2014 it is imperative to scrutinise the roles of fe loading in immobilization of p by lmb this will significantly promote our understanding of the mechanisms behind the p immobilization by lmb in the redox sensitive sediment condition the purpose of this study is to establish the adsorption characteristics of fe by lmb and its effects on p immobilization batch adsorption experiments were performed to investigate the kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of fe in addition the adsorption characteristics of p by lmb were compared in the presence and absence of fe pre loading sediment core incubation experiments were performed to reveal the effects of fe adsorption on p immobilization by lmb using high resolution dialysis hr peeper and diffusive gradients in thin films zro chelex dgt sampling techniques to simultaneously measure soluble fe and p in pore waters and labile fe and p in sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1

principles and analyses are shown in supplementary materials with preparation performed according to xu et al 2012 and ding et al 2016b respectively hr peeper and dgt probes were soaked in 0 01 m nacl and deoxygenated using nitrogen for 16 h prior to deployment in the sediment 2 2 batch adsorption experiment set up the kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of fe2 by lmb was performed by combining 0 5 mg lmb dry weight with 40 ml of fe2 solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tube the mixture was shaking for 12 h at 25 c in the kinetic experiment the initial concentration of fe2 was set at 100 mg l 1 and the sampling time ranged from 0 6 to 240 min in the equilibrium experiment for detection of the adsorption capacity of lmb for fe2 the initial concentrations of fe2 ranged from 0 to 500 mg l 1 and the shaking time was 24 h the supernatants were separated after centrifugation of the mixture at 4000 rpm the concentrations of fe2 in the supernatants were determined and the adsorption amount of fe2 was calculated the kinetic adsorption of p by lmb was also investigated for comparison in which the initial concentration of p in solution was set at 100 mg l 1 to avoid fe2 oxygenation all the solutions were prepared using deionized water deoxygenated with nitrogen for 16 h and the operations were conducted in the nitrogen purged environment to investigate the effects of fe loading by lmb on the immobilization efficiency of p 5 0 g lmb dry weight was transferred into 50 ml centrifuge containing 40 ml deionized water and were deoxygenated with nitrogen for 16 h the mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and supernatants removed deoxygenated lmb 1 0 g wet weight was transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 40 ml of either deionized water or 100 mg l 1 fe2 solution the tubes were agitated on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm 25 c for 12 h supernatants were removed and 40 ml of 100 mg p l 1 was added to each tube and tubes were continuously agitated for 518 h after removal of the supernatant the exchangeable p and reducible p were extracted from the solid fraction using nh4cl and bd solutions respectively 2 3 experimental core microcosm set up sediment cores and overlying water were collected together from the nanfei river inlet to lake chaohu 117 401 n 31 717 e the fifth largest freshwater lake in china sediments were sieved through a 0 6 mm pore size mesh to remove macrofauna and larger particles and then placed in a perspex tube following homogenization forming a 15 cm length sediment core once filtered the overlying water was siphoned into the sediment containing tube to produce a 12 cm deep water layer the microcosm tubes were then pre incubated in a water bath at 25 c for two months the application dose range was established as a ratio of the amount of lmb to that of mobile p lmb pmob and was set to be 20 60 100 150 or 200 w w the concentration of pmob was defined as the sum of all pmob in the upper 40 mm of surface sediments for lmb amendment lmb was combined with 500 ml of overlying water extracted from the microcosm tube with the mixture then siphoned back into the microcosm tube to produce an even distribution of lmb on the surface of the sediment microcosm tubes were incubated in the water bath at 25 c for a further two month period with the water layer replenished every 2 3 days to maintain a depth of 12 cm following incubation the releases of fe and p from the lmb binding layer were assessed under different redox conditions lmb in the binding layer from the 200 lmb pmob treatment was collected and 0 5 g of lmb was added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube with the redox potential eh conditioned at 275 125 0 150 or 325 mv using na2s solution mcqueen et al 2016 the mixture was gently agitated at ambient temperature for 3 d during which time the eh of each treatment stabilized within 30 mv of the defined values following the agitation period the solutions were collected for analysis of srp and soluble fe concentrations 2 4 sampling and analysis on the 60th day of sediment core incubation an hr peeper probe was inserted into each core for a 48h period after 24 h the zro chelex dgt probes were also inserted into the same core and left for a further 24 h both the hr peeper and zro chelex dgt probes were retrieved simultaneously with the methods of analyses of the hr peeper and zro chelex dgt samples outlined in the supplementary materials the speciation of p in sediments and the lmb layer was analyzed using the scheme developed by rydin and welch 1998 six p species were obtained using a fractionation process providing 1 m nh4cl extracted p nh4cl p 0 11 m na2s2o4 nahco3 extracted p bd p 0 1 m naoh extracted reactive p naoh rp 0 1 m naoh extracted non reactive p naoh nrp 0 5 m hcl extracted p hcl p and residual p res p the pmob in the surface 40 mm of sediments was calculated as the sum of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp the concentrations of srp in pore water supernatants dgt eluent and sediment p fractionated samples were determined using the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 the concentration of fe in samples was analyzed using the phenanthroline colorimetric method tamura et al 1974 2 5 modeling and calculations the langmuir model eq 1 and freundlich model eq 2 were used to characterize the adsorption of fe by lmb 1 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e 2 q e k f c e n

and m is the corresponding accumulated mass over the deployment time μg 2 6 definition of the static layer and active layer in the stratification mode the stratification mode for pore water srp and dgt labile p has been recently established by wang et al 2017b in this mode a static layer with extremely low srp and dgt labile p concentration distributions will form in the top sediment layer in contact with the lmb amended layer due to increased adsorption by lmb this effect is coupled with relaxed upward diffusion gradients in the active layer immediately below the static layer it has been established that the formation of a static layer is key to efficiently sustain the immobilization efficiency of lmb wang et al 2017b the static layer is further defined as the layer from the swi to a specific sediment depth where the variation rsd of the srp dgt labile p concentrations is within 30 and their mean concentrations c s l are not greater than 50 of the reference concentrations in the static layer c s l r e f the c s l r e f is the lowest mean concentration of srp dgt labile p observed in the static layer without considerable change in concentration over application period or with capping agent dosage during the amendment period the active layer is defined as the layer directly below the static layer which has a distribution of srp dgt labile p with an upward diffusion gradient to the static layer the potential release of p r al from the active to static layer is determined using equation 4 wang et al 2017b 4 r al c a l c s l δ a l c s l δ s l where c a l represents the mean concentration of pore water srp or dgt labile p in the active layer and δ a l and δ s l represent the thickness of the active layer and static layer respectively the total thickness of δ a l and δ s l is 40 mm 3 results 3 1 adsorption characteristics of fe ii by lmb the isothermal adsorption characteristics of fe by lmb are presented in fig 1 and table 1 showing the fe2 adsorption by lmb increased according to higher initial p concentrations fig 1a both the langmuir and freundlich models were found to fit well to fe2 adsorption data r 2 0 94 while the correlation coefficient for the langmuir model r 2 0 948 was lower than the freundlich model r 2 0 964 the maximum fe2 adsorption capacity of lmb as modeled by the langmuir equation is 8 51 mg g 1 as shown in fig 1b the uptake of fe2 by lmb showed a sustained increase over 250 min the uptake amounts were 6 23 and 6 72 mg g 1 at 120 and 240 min respectively the uptake of p by lmb took place more quickly and almost reached saturation at 60 min after which the uptake amount of p was stabilized at 7 5 mg g 1 fig s1 the adsorption of p by lmb with and without fe loading is shown in fig 2 the concentration of srp adsorbed by lmb without fe loading was highest 3 96 mg g 1 in the first 6 h and a decreasing trend was apparent following this with large fluctuations fig 2a the adsorption of p by fe loaded lmb showed a sharp increase up to 3 89 mg g 1 at 48 h following oscillation and after that the adsorption level remained relatively constant with only slight fluctuations reaching a maximum of 3 93 mg g 1 by 230 h the maximum amount of p released from lmb without fe loading was 0 66 mg g 1 p at 422 h fig 2b accounts for 16 7 of the maximal adsorbed p in lmb in the absence of fe in contrast only a maximum of 0 09 mg g 1 p was released by fe loaded lmb at 470 h accounting for 2 3 of the maximum adsorbed p at 230 h the concentrations of nh4cl p and bd p in lmb without fe loading 0 005 and 0 089 mg g 1 p respectively were lower than those in the fe loaded lmb 0 007 and 0 131 mg g 1 p respectively fig 2c 3 2 change in concentration of p in core sediments and surface waters the change in srp concentrations in the water column following different treatments are shown in fig 3 the concentrations of srp were on average 0 25 0 03 mg l 1 prior to amendment with lmb after lmb amendment srp concentrations showed a decreasing trend according to increased lmb amendment dosage for the lmb pmob 200 treatment the concentration of srp was below 0 01 mg l 1 with a removal rate of 98 8 relative to starting concentrations prior to lmb amendment the variation in p speciation in the surface 40 mm sediments of the core microcosms are shown in fig 4 for the control exposure the concentration of pmob ranged from 0 24 to 2 00 mg g 1 accounting for 53 24 of the total p concentration following incubation with the lmb the mean concentration of the pmob fraction consistently decreased to 34 of the total p for the 200 lmb pmob treatment table s2 the proportions of nh4cl p and bd p also consistently decreased from 1 5 and 47 respectively in the control treatment to 0 5 and 28 for the 200 lmb pmob treatment respectively in contrast the proportion of hcl p increased from 4 0 in the control treatment to 19 of total p in the 200 lmb pmob treatment the vertical changes in pore water srp and dgt labile p concentrations from core microcosms are shown in fig 5 for control treatments both srp and dgt labile p showed an increasing trend with decreasing depth from the overlying water to a sediment depth of 40 mm below the swi followed by a steady phase and then by a decreasing trend to the bottom of the core profile fig 5a and b following application of lmb for 60 days the concentrations of both srp and dgt labile p showed a distinct decreasing trend across the entire microcosm core profile with increased lmb dosage the average concentration of pore water srp decreased from 1 36 3 39 and 4 79 mg l 1 in surface top 20 mm middle 20 to 40 mm and bottom 40 to 60 mm sediment layers in the control treatment respectively to 0 17 0 54 and 0 95 mg l 1 in the 200 lmb pmob treatment respectively the average concentration of dgt labile p decreased from 0 30 1 03 and 1 05 mg l 1 in the surface middle and bottom layers of control treatments respectively to 0 04 0 25 and 0 66 mg l 1 in the 200 lmb pmob treatment respectively table s3 furthermore upward diffusion gradients of srp and dgt labile p concentrations were apparent from the lmb binding layer to the water column above for 100 150 and 200 lmb pmob treatments fig 5c and d the final concentration of srp decreased from an average of 0 32 0 32 and 0 13 mg l 1 in the binding layer to 0 10 0 08 and 0 02 mg l 1 at a depth of 20 mm above the sediment lmb binding layer interface for 100 150 and 200 lmb pmob treatments respectively the final concentration of dgt labile p decreased from an average of 0 052 0 061 and 0 026 mg l 1 in the binding layer to 0 022 0 017 and 0 009 mg l 1 at the depth of 20 mm for 100 150 and 200 lmb pmob treatments respectively stratification characteristics of pore water srp and dgt labile p are presented in table 2 both pore water srp and dgt labile p manifested the formation of a static layer when lmb dosage reached 60 lmb pmob static layer thickness δ s l was found to increase according to increased lmb dosage from 16 mm at 60 lmb pmob to 22 mm in the 200 lmb pmob for pore water srp and from 16 mm at 60 lmb pmob to 21 mm in the 200 lmb pmob for dgt labile p with mean concentrations c s l ranging from 0 15 to 0 28 mg l 1 for pore water srp and 0 028 to 0 051 mg l 1 for dgt labile p the active layer appeared below the static layer with a relaxed diffusion gradient reflected by the decrease in diffusion potential r al observed from 7 22 to 3 14 for pore water srp and from 15 1 to 5 37 for dgt labile p respectively 3 3 change in fe concentrations in core sediments the vertical changes in concentration of pore water soluble and dgt labile fe are shown in fig 6 for the control treatment there was a localized maximum concentration of soluble fe observed at a depth of 4 mm while the concentration of dgt labile fe approached zero by a depth of 12 mm below a depth of 12 mm both soluble and dgt labile fe exhibited an increasing trend towards the bottom of the microcosm core profile the application of lmb sharply reduced soluble fe concentrations to almost zero in the top sediment layer the average concentration of pore water soluble fe and dgt labile fe in the surface 20 mm sediment layer decreased from 0 34 and 0 18 mg l 1 respectively in the control treatment to zero and 0 009 mg l 1 respectively in the 200 lmb pmob treatment the average concentration of pore water soluble fe fluctuated with no obvious trends observable in the middle and bottom sediment layers dgt labile fe decreased from 1 32 and 1 63 mg l 1 in the middle and bottom layer respectively in the control treatment to 0 68 and 1 07 mg l 1 respectively in the 200 lmb pmob treatment table s3 3 4 change in p and fe concentrations in the lmb binding layer the lmb binding layer in the 200 lmb pmob treatment was selected for analysis of p speciation as well as fe content during each fractionation step fig 7 ca p was found to be the major p species in the binding layer accounting for 54 total p concentrations fig 7a fe p was the second abundant species accounting for 25 of total p concentration while the other four p species investigated collectively contributed 21 of total p concentration the release potentials of fe and p under varying redox conditions were also investigated fig 7b showing considerable levels of release of fe and p occurred when the redox potential eh decreased to 150 mv and 300 mv respectively 4 discussion 4 1 lmb immobilization efficiency for sediment p the efficiency of lmb reduction of water column p content has been confirmed through laboratory analysis mesocosm trials and field application copetti et al 2016 generally the removal efficiency reaches over 80 depending on the lmb dosage applied the duration of application and the degree of interference to p binding by lmb copetti et al 2016 dithmer et al 2016b lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013b in the present study the remaining concentration of srp in the water column was 38 μg l 1 and 2 7 μg l 1 for 100 lmb pmob and 200 lmb pmob treatments respectively showing removal efficiencies of 84 and 99 respectively fig 3 which are consistent with previous reports accordingly a shift in p speciation occurred from labile and release sensitive forms bd p to less bioavailable and possibly permanently bound forms hcl p and naoh rp fig 4 overall an eventual 40 reduction of pmob concentrations was observed in the 200 lmb pmob treatment an alternative method for assessment of lmb immobilization efficiency is based on the stratification mode of pore water srp and dgt labile p wang et al 2017b this analysis found that the 200 lmb pmob treatment achieved the greatest immobilization efficiency for sediment p with a greater δ s l and smaller c s l and r al confirming improved immobilization of p in sediments treated with lmb table 2 these findings are supported by the highest level of srp removal being observed in overlying water for the 200 lmb pmob treatment fig 3 it is interesting to note that the 60 lmb pmob treatment is sufficient to effectively immobilize p in sediments with a high static layer δ s l 15 mm and low c s l formed at this dosage table 2 which is lower than the manufacturer recommended dosage of 100 lmb pmob based on a theoretical la pmob binding ratio of 1 1 a reason for this may be that doc and carbonate induced minor interference with the formation of rhabdophane dithmer et al 2016b lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013b additionally it may be that increased contact time is required to complete binding of lmb with all pmob fractions as only 40 of pmob in sediments was immobilized during the 2 month period for the 200 lmb pmob treatment furthermore an upward decreasing gradient of srp concentration was apparent from the lmb binding layer to the water column above with treatment of 60 200 lmb pmob fig 5c and d these findings suggest that besides direct immobilization of sediment p by lmb the concentration of srp in the water column is also determined by interactions between p in the lmb layer and the water column above although further studies are required to investigate this aspect 4 2 adsorption of fe by lmb and its effects on fe distribution in lmb amended sediments the batch adsorption results showed that the lmb can rapidly adsorb fe2 ions in solution fig 1 in freundlich model the parameter n was lower than 1 suggesting that the adsorption affinity of fe2 by lmb would decrease with increasing fe2 concentration the maximum fe2 adsorption capacities of lmb modeled by langmuir equation 8 51 mg g 1 was a little lower than the mean capacity of 8 8 mg g 1 for p detected in both lake water and pore water matrices dithmer et al 2016a comparison of the uptake amounts of fe and p with time indicates that the adsorption rate for fe was slower than that for p fig 1b and fig s1 this is probably because that the adsorption of fe2 by bentonite clay through electrostatic attraction and surface complexation would be limited by mass transfer kinetics in contrast the adsorption of p may proceed via homogeneous precipitation reactions e g formation of rhabdophane and monazite dithmer et al 2015 sheta et al 2003 reported that natural bentonite mainly montmorillonite mineral had a sorption capacity of 4 1 mg g 1 for fe2 the adsorption isotherm followed an s type isotherm and could be described by a freundlich or langmuir adsorption model for the concentration range used in this study table s1 qin et al 2015 confirmed that the adsorption process fitted with pseudo second order well and the montmorillonites in the presence of fe2 had good affinity for phosphate in sediment core incubation experiments significantly positive correlations p 0 01 were observed between the pore water srp and soluble fe concentrations as well as between the dgt labile p and fe concentrations in sediments before lmb amendment fig 8 these findings demonstrate that the remobilization of p from sediment was largely caused by the reductive dissolution of p bearing fe oxyhydroxides with this effect having been verified previously in sediments using dgt methods ding et al 2016a the application of lmb decreased both pore water soluble fe concentrations in the top sediment layer and dgt labile fe concentrations across the whole sediment profile fig 6 indicating that lmb effectively adsorbed mobile fe from core sediments these results are further supported by the findings of the batch adsorption experiments fig 1 table 1 reitzel et al 2013a found that the bd extracted fe concentrations increased by 22 in the top 10 mm sediment layer following lmb application at a dosage of 100 lmb pmob with the ratio of bd fe to bd p increasing from 2 2 to 10 2 also suggesting fe adsorption by lmb the concentration of soluble fe in pore water remained steady in the deeper sediment layer which differs from the change in dgt labile fe concentrations fig 6 potentially due to variation in the ability of labile solid fe to resupply soluble fe in pore waters at different sediment depths the concentration ratio r of dgt labile fe to pore water soluble fe can be used to reflect the resupply ability of the sediment solids harper et al 2000 in the present study r values were relatively low 0 2 with minor variations in the 15 25 mm sediment layer increasing up to 0 6 in deeper sediment layers fig 9 the low resupply ability of the top layer sediment solids may be due to the dominance of fe iii oxyhydroxides under oxic conditions which has low solubility the resupply ability increases with the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides in deeper sediment layers resulting in the increased r values observed this is supported by the observed increase in p resupply ability in deeper sediment layers chen et al 2016 it is of note that the resupply ability for fe in deeper sediment layers showed a decreasing trend with increased lmb dosage it reflects that the increase of lmb dosage induced more solid labile fe to move to the lmb binding layer and further limited its resupply ability 4 3 effects of fe adsorption on lmb immobilization of p lmb in the absence of fe loading showed complete adsorption of srp within 6 h following a decreasing trend with a large fluctuation fig 2a this demonstrates that a fraction of adsorbed p up to 16 7 was loosely bound to lmb and therefore is release sensitive fig 2b which may represent p bound to the surface of rhabdophane dithmer et al 2016b observed the attachment of protonated forms of p ions on the surface of rhabdophane using 31p mas nmr spectroscopy with this loosely surface bound p potentially eluted by bd solution and accounting for 26 of the total adsorbed p concentration pre loading of lmb with fe resulted in a slowing of the p adsorption rate contributing significantly to the stabilization of p adsorption fig 2a although the maximum level of p adsorption by fe loaded lmb 3 93 mg g 1 was similar to the concentration adsorbed by lmb without fe loading 3 96 mg g 1 the proportion of the release sensitive p significantly reduced from 16 7 to 2 3 fig 2b this demonstrates that release sensitive p initially bound on the surface of rhabdophane was immobilized by fe loaded in lmb lower concentrations of nh4cl p and bd p were observed in the lmb in the absence of fe loading which reflects a greater release of mobile p in comparison with fe loaded lmb fig 2c in the lmb binding layer following capping for two months a large amount of fe was eluted using bd solution fig 5a while fe bound p bd p was found in the binding layer accounting for 25 of total p concentrations in the 200 lmb pmob treatment fig 5a it is of note that this proportion falls in the range of 21 26 of the reported fractions in previous literature meis et al 2012 reitzel et al 2013a dithmer et al 2016b indicating that lmb adsorbed a considerable concentration of fe and that loaded fe contributed to p immobilization in sediments as the bottom water was under oxic condition during the sediment core incubation period 5 mg l 1 fe bound to lmb will be oxygenated as fe iii oxyhydroxides e g ferrihydrite which has strong phosphate binding capabilities kumar et al 2014 in combination with batch experimental results figs 1 and 2 table 1 it can be inferred that the adsorption of fe in sediments by amended lmb should play a significant role in the stabilization of lmb bound p likely by adsorbing release sensitive p that was initially bound to the surface of rhabdophane as a part of p is bound by fe simultaneously loaded in the lmb it is important to know whether fe bound p can be released under anoxic condition these results show that fe and p are not released until that eh values decreased to the range of extremely reductive conditions 150 mv to 300 mv fig 7b these eh values are much lower than 200 mv at which point insoluble oxidized fe iii oxides and hydroxides begin to be reduced releasing fe bound p christophoridis and fytianos 2006 in fact the true eh threshold value for p release should be lower than detected as the redox potential was adjusted using na2s solution the addition of na2s could precipitate fe2 liberated from reductive redissolution of fe oxyhydroxides as a result this treatment can promote the release of p by avoiding the precipitation of fe2 with p ions rothe et al 2014 it demonstrates that the release of fe bound p from lmb is significantly delayed under anoxic condition as newly formed fe oxides and hydroxides are sensitive to anoxic condition cornell and schwertmann 2003 a reasonable assumption is that the reduction of fe oxides or hydroxides in lmb should occur under eh 200 mv and the released fe ii and p ions will be rapidly re adsorbed by lmb 4 4 implications it should be recognized from these findings that the fe and lmb have synergistic effects on immobilization p in sediments i e one can act as a sink for p released from another side when the conditions become unfavorable for p adsorption a schematic interpretation of this synergistic effect is shown in fig 10 with the major processes occurring in the lmb layer including 1 fe ii adsorption by bentonite 2 oxygenation of adsorbed fe ii under oxic condition 3 adsorption of release sensitive p bound onto the rhabdophane surface i e rhabdophane p in fig 10 and the formation of fe iii p 4 reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides and the release of fe ii and p under anoxic condition 5 re adsorption of released fe ii and p by lmb it should be noted that some of the processes remained to be verified by future studies this new observation of the synergistic effects of fe adsorption provides new insights into the immobilization mechanisms of lmb for sediment p it can address several concerns bewildering the researchers before firstly the observed adsorption of fe can explain why fe was found in the lmb reitzel et al 2013a secondly the simultaneous adsorption of fe and p by lmb can explain why fe bound p i e bd p exists in lmb besides la bound p rhabdophane and monazite meis et al 2012 reitzel et al 2013a thirdly the role of adsorbed fe in the stabilization of release sensitive p in lmb can partly explain why the immobilization efficiency of lmb is high and stable besides the formation of la bound p copetti et al 2016 dithmer et al 2015 finally the re adsorption of fe and p by lmb under anoxic condition can explain why the immobilization efficiency of lmb for p is not affected by redox state ross et al 2008 in combination with fe p coupling in sediments and lmb fe interaction a holistic understanding of lmb immobilization of p can be significantly promoted 5 conclusions the adsorption of fe by lmb can be well described by the freundlich isotherm the maximum fe adsorption capacity of lmb was 8 51 mg g 1 the maximum adsorbed concentrations of p showed little variation between lmb in the presence or absence of fe loading however a maximum level of 16 7 of p was adsorbed by lmb without fe loading with only 2 3 of the total p concentration being loosely bound and release sensitive both pore water srp and dgt labile p decreased in lmb amended sediments stratification was observed with a static layer in the top 16 22 mm of sediment being followed by active layers with relaxed upward diffusion gradients apparent when the amendment dosage reached 60 lmb pmob lmb amendments simultaneously reduced pore water fe and dgt labile fe in sediments resulting in the enrichment of bd fe and bd p in the lmb binding layer the adsorbed fe plays a significant role in the stabilization of release sensitive p that was initially bound onto the surface of rhabdophane in lmb the lmb adsorbed fe and p was not released until the redox potential decreased to extremely reductive conditions 150 mv to 300 mv implying that re adsorption of fe and p by lmb likely occurs preventing their release under anoxic conditions acknowledgements this study was jointly

19690,iron redox cycle plays a primary role in controlling the mobility of p in sediments it is crucial to better understand how lanthanum la modified bentonite lmb phoslock an increasingly employed capping agent immobilizes p from sediments by altering fe redox coupled p cycling batch adsorption experiments found that lmb effectively adsorbed fe ii with a capacity of 8 51 mg g 1 fe ii preloaded lmb effectively retained p during a 518 hour equilibration while up to 16 7 of adsorbed p was release sensitive in lmb without fe ii preloading a 60 day incubation experiment was performed using sediment cores with an lmb amendment dosage of up to 200 lmb pmob w w pmob denotes the amount of mobile p in the surface 40 mm sediment layer the concentrations of pore water soluble reactive p srp and labile p were measured by high resolution dialysis hr peeper and by diffusive gradient in thin films dgt respectively at a vertical millimeter scale they stratified into static layers with extremely low concentration distribution in the top 16 22 mm sediments mean srp 0 28 mg l 1 and mean dgt labile p 0 051 mg l 1 and active layers with decreased upward diffusion potential 5 85 for srp and 12 7 for dgt labile p below the static layer when the applied dosage reached 60 lmb pmob the lmb amendment reduced the pore water fe and dgt labile fe in sediments while considerable amounts of fe and fe bound p existed in the lmb binding layer 25 of the total p in 200 lmb pmob treatment these findings show that the adsorption of fe by lmb plays a significant role in the stabilization of lmb bound p possibly by adsorbing release sensitive p initially bound to the rhabdophane surface lmb adsorbed fe and p were not released until the redox potential decreased to extremely reductive conditions 150 mv to 300 mv possibly due to the re adsorption of fe and p by lmb this study reveals synergistic effects of fe adsorption and provides new insight into the immobilization mechanisms of p by lmb application graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediment phosphorous lanthanum modified bentonite phoslock iron redox diffusive gradients in thin films capping 1 introduction processes involved in the release of internally loaded phosphorus p from sediments has gained much research attention due to its usefulness in determining the trophic stage of an aquatic system wu et al 2017 the application of capping agents to form an active barrier layer covering the sediment water interface swi improves the p binding capacity of sediments by allowing the association of agents with release sensitive p pmob therefore minimizing the release of p into the water column meis et al 2012 to date a range of capping agents have been developed and are widely applied in lakes as geoengineering tools typically composed of high levels of aluminum calcium iron and other metal compounds in the form of oxides or hydroxides douglas et al 2016 fan et al 2017 li and pan 2015 wang et al 2017a a lanthanum modified bentonite clay lmb commercially known as phoslock was developed by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro of australia us patent no 6350383 robb et al 2003 and has shown promise for the deliberate manipulation of internal p processes in the natural environment douglas et al 2016 spears et al 2016 dithmer et al 2016a the lmb has to date been reported to be applied to more than 200 water bodies across a wide geographic distribution copetti et al 2016 immobilization efficiency of lmb can be sustained with time through the formation of rhabdophane and monazite which have low solubility and high stability dithmer et al 2015 the efficiency is less ph dependent with a maximum efficiency within a ph range of 5 7 and a decreasing trend in efficiency above ph 9 and the adsorbed p does not release under anoxic condition ross et al 2008 the number and taxa of macroinvertebrate fauna can recover from the lmb amendment after one year application due to the shift in trophic state of the lake waajen et al 2017 iron fe is a redox sensitive element and its redox cycle has a primary role in the control of p mobility in sediments ding et al 2016a previous studies have mostly focused on the interactions between p and lmb while the effects of fe redox cycle on lmb immobilization as yet remain unclear it is well recognized that the immobilization of p by lmb occurs mainly by a shift of p partition in sediments from fe bound p i e bicarbonate dithionite bd extracted p to la bound p i e hcl extracted p reitzel et al 2013a meis et al 2013 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 bishop et al 2014 however previous studies confirmed that not all lmb loaded p is stabilized by la binding for instance meis et al 2012 reported that 21 of srp in lmb could be extracted by bd confirming that a significant portion of lmb bound p is in the form of fe or mn bound p reitzel et al 2013a found that a high amount of fe can be extracted from pure lmb by bd which may infer that the accumulated fe in the lmb possibly benefits the immobilization of additional p besides the lmb binding under oxic condition conversely dithmer et al 2016b argued that bd extracted p was not bound to fe or mn oxides and is instead adsorbed to the surface of rhabdophane as no fe or mn oxides were observed in lmb using 31p nmr spectroscopy as fe oxyhydroxides are strong absorbents for p kumar et al 2014 it is imperative to scrutinise the roles of fe loading in immobilization of p by lmb this will significantly promote our understanding of the mechanisms behind the p immobilization by lmb in the redox sensitive sediment condition the purpose of this study is to establish the adsorption characteristics of fe by lmb and its effects on p immobilization batch adsorption experiments were performed to investigate the kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of fe in addition the adsorption characteristics of p by lmb were compared in the presence and absence of fe pre loading sediment core incubation experiments were performed to reveal the effects of fe adsorption on p immobilization by lmb using high resolution dialysis hr peeper

principles and analyses are shown in supplementary materials with preparation performed according to xu et al 2012 and ding et al 2016b respectively hr peeper and dgt probes were soaked in 0 01 m nacl and deoxygenated using nitrogen for 16 h prior to deployment in the sediment 2 2 batch adsorption experiment set up the kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of fe2 by lmb was performed by combining 0 5 mg lmb dry weight with 40 ml of fe2 solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tube the mixture was shaking for 12 h at 25 c in the kinetic experiment the initial concentration of fe2 was set at 100 mg l 1 and the sampling time ranged from 0 6 to 240 min in the equilibrium experiment for detection of the adsorption capacity of lmb for fe2 the initial concentrations of fe2 ranged from 0 to 500 mg l 1 and the shaking time was 24 h the supernatants were separated after centrifugation of the mixture at 4000 rpm the concentrations of fe2 in the supernatants were determined and the adsorption amount of fe2 was calculated the kinetic adsorption of p by lmb was also investigated for comparison in which the initial concentration of p in solution was set at 100 mg l 1 to avoid fe2 oxygenation all the solutions were prepared using deionized water deoxygenated with nitrogen for 16 h and the operations were conducted in the nitrogen purged environment to investigate the effects of fe loading by lmb on the immobilization efficiency of p 5 0 g lmb dry weight was transferred into 50 ml centrifuge containing 40 ml deionized water and were deoxygenated with nitrogen for 16 h the mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and supernatants removed deoxygenated lmb 1 0 g wet weight was transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 40 ml of either deionized water or 100 mg l 1 fe2 solution the tubes were agitated on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm 25 c for 12 h supernatants were removed and 40 ml of 100 mg p l 1 was added to each tube and tubes were continuously agitated for 518 h after removal of the supernatant the exchangeable p and reducible p were extracted from the solid fraction using nh4cl and bd solutions respectively 2 3 experimental core microcosm set up sediment cores and overlying water were collected together from the nanfei river inlet to lake chaohu 117 401 n 31 717 e the fifth largest freshwater lake in china sediments were sieved through a 0 6 mm pore size mesh to remove macrofauna and larger particles and then placed in a perspex tube following homogenization forming a 15 cm length sediment core once filtered the overlying water was siphoned into the sediment containing tube to produce a 12 cm deep water layer the microcosm tubes were then pre incubated in a water bath at 25 c for two months the application dose range was established as a ratio of the amount of lmb to that of mobile p lmb pmob and was set to be 20 60 100 150 or 200 w w the concentration of pmob was defined as the sum of all pmob in the upper 40 mm of surface sediments for lmb amendment lmb was combined with 500 ml of overlying water extracted from the microcosm tube with the mixture then siphoned back into the microcosm tube to produce an even distribution of lmb on the surface of the sediment microcosm tubes were incubated in the water bath at 25 c for a further two month period with the water layer replenished every 2 3 days to maintain a depth of 12 cm following incubation the releases of fe and p from the lmb binding layer were assessed under different redox conditions lmb in the binding layer from the 200 lmb pmob treatment was collected and 0 5 g of lmb was added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube with the redox potential eh conditioned at 275 125 0 150 or 325 mv using na2s solution mcqueen et al 2016 the mixture was gently agitated at ambient temperature for 3 d during which time the eh of each treatment stabilized within 30 mv of the defined values following the agitation period the solutions were collected for analysis of srp and soluble fe concentrations 2 4 sampling and analysis on the 60th day of sediment core incubation an hr peeper probe was inserted into each core for a 48h period after 24 h the zro chelex dgt probes were also inserted into the same core and left for a further 24 h both the hr peeper and zro chelex dgt probes were retrieved simultaneously with the methods of analyses of the hr peeper and zro chelex dgt samples outlined in the supplementary materials the speciation of p in sediments and the lmb layer was analyzed using the scheme developed by rydin and welch 1998 six p species were obtained using a fractionation process providing 1 m nh4cl extracted p nh4cl p 0 11 m na2s2o4 nahco3 extracted p bd p 0 1 m naoh extracted reactive p naoh rp 0 1 m naoh extracted non reactive p naoh nrp 0 5 m hcl

and m is the corresponding accumulated mass over the deployment time μg 2 6 definition of the static layer and active layer in the stratification mode the stratification mode for pore water srp and dgt labile p has been recently established by wang et al 2017b in this mode a static layer with extremely low srp and dgt labile p concentration distributions will form in the top sediment layer in contact with the lmb amended layer due to increased adsorption by lmb this effect is coupled with relaxed upward diffusion gradients in the active layer immediately below the static layer it has been established that the formation of a static layer is key to efficiently sustain the immobilization efficiency of lmb wang et al 2017b the static layer is further defined as the layer from the swi to a specific sediment depth where the variation rsd of the srp dgt labile p concentrations is within 30 and their mean concentrations c s l are not greater than 50 of the reference concentrations in the static layer c s l r e f the c s l r e f is the lowest mean concentration of srp dgt labile p observed in the static layer without considerable change in concentration over application period or with capping agent dosage during the amendment period the active layer is defined as the layer directly below the static layer which has a distribution of srp dgt labile p with an upward diffusion gradient to the static layer the potential release of p r al from the active to static layer is determined using equation 4 wang et al 2017b 4 r al c a l c s l δ a l c s l δ s l where c a l represents the mean concentration of pore water srp or dgt labile p in the active layer and δ a l and δ s l represent the thickness of the active layer and static layer respectively the total thickness of δ a l and δ s l is 40 mm 3 results 3 1 adsorption characteristics of fe ii by lmb the isothermal adsorption characteristics of fe by lmb are presented in fig 1 and table 1 showing the fe2 adsorption by lmb increased according to higher initial p concentrations fig 1a both the langmuir and freundlich models were found to fit well to fe2 adsorption data r 2 0 94 while the correlation coefficient for the langmuir model r 2 0 948 was lower than the freundlich model r 2 0 964 the maximum fe2 adsorption capacity of lmb as modeled by the langmuir equation is 8 51 mg g 1 as shown in fig 1b the uptake of fe2 by lmb showed a sustained increase over 250 min the uptake amounts were 6 23 and 6 72 mg g 1 at 120 and 240 min respectively the uptake of p by lmb took place more quickly and almost reached saturation at 60 min after which the uptake amount of p was stabilized at 7 5 mg g 1 fig s1 the adsorption of p by lmb with and without fe loading is shown in fig 2 the concentration of srp adsorbed by lmb without fe loading was highest 3 96 mg g 1 in the first 6 h and a decreasing trend was apparent following this with large fluctuations fig 2a the adsorption of p by fe loaded lmb showed a sharp increase up to 3 89 mg g 1 at 48 h following oscillation and after that the adsorption level remained relatively constant with only slight fluctuations reaching a maximum of 3 93 mg g 1 by 230 h the maximum amount of p released from lmb without fe loading was 0 66 mg g 1 p at 422 h fig 2b accounts for 16 7 of the maximal adsorbed p in lmb in the absence of fe in contrast only a maximum of 0 09 mg g 1 p was released by fe loaded lmb at 470 h accounting for 2 3 of the maximum adsorbed p at 230 h the concentrations of nh4cl p and bd p in lmb without fe loading 0 005 and 0 089 mg g 1 p respectively were lower than those in the fe loaded lmb 0 007 and 0 131 mg g 1 p respectively fig 2c 3 2 change in concentration of p in core sediments and surface waters the change in srp concentrations in the water column following different treatments are shown in fig 3 the concentrations of srp were on average 0 25 0 03 mg l 1 prior to amendment with lmb after lmb amendment srp concentrations showed a decreasing trend according to increased lmb amendment dosage for the lmb pmob 200 treatment the concentration of srp was below 0 01 mg l 1 with a removal rate of 98 8 relative to starting concentrations prior to lmb amendment the variation in p speciation in the surface 40 mm sediments of the core microcosms are shown in fig 4 for the control exposure the concentration of pmob ranged from 0 24 to 2 00 mg g 1 accounting for 53 24 of the total p concentration following incubation with the lmb the mean concentration of the pmob fraction consistently decreased to 34 of the total p for the 200 lmb pmob treatment table s2 the proportions of nh4cl p and bd p also consistently decreased from 1 5 and 47 respectively in the control treatment to 0 5 and 28 for the 200 lmb pmob treatment respectively in contrast the proportion of hcl p increased from 4 0 in the control treatment to 19 of total p in the 200 lmb pmob treatment the vertical changes in pore water srp and dgt labile p concentrations from core microcosms are shown in fig 5 for control treatments both srp and dgt labile p showed an increasing trend with decreasing depth from the overlying water to a sediment depth of 40 mm below the swi followed by a steady phase and then by a decreasing trend to the bottom of the core profile fig 5a and b following application of lmb for 60 days the concentrations of both srp and dgt labile p showed a distinct decreasing trend across the entire microcosm core profile with increased lmb dosage the average concentration of pore water srp decreased from 1 36 3 39 and 4 79 mg l 1 in surface top 20 mm middle 20 to 40 mm and bottom 40 to 60 mm sediment layers in the control treatment respectively to 0 17 0 54 and 0 95 mg l 1 in the 200 lmb pmob treatment respectively the average concentration of dgt labile p decreased from 0 30 1 03 and 1 05 mg l 1 in the surface middle and bottom layers of control treatments respectively to 0 04 0 25 and 0 66 mg l 1 in the 200 lmb pmob treatment respectively table s3 furthermore upward diffusion gradients of srp and dgt labile p concentrations were apparent from the lmb binding layer to the water column above for 100 150 and 200 lmb pmob treatments fig 5c and d the final concentration of srp decreased from an average of 0 32 0 32 and 0 13 mg l 1 in the binding layer to 0 10 0 08 and 0 02 mg l 1 at a depth of 20 mm above the sediment lmb binding layer interface for 100 150 and 200 lmb pmob treatments respectively the final concentration of dgt labile p decreased from an average of 0 052 0 061 and 0 026 mg l 1 in the binding layer to 0 022 0 017 and 0 009 mg l 1 at the depth of 20 mm for 100 150 and 200 lmb pmob treatments respectively stratification characteristics of pore water srp and dgt labile p are presented in table 2 both pore water srp and dgt labile p manifested the formation of a static layer when lmb dosage reached 60 lmb pmob static layer thickness δ s l was found to increase according to increased lmb dosage from 16 mm at 60 lmb pmob to 22 mm in the 200 lmb pmob for pore water srp and from 16 mm at 60 lmb pmob to 21 mm in the 200 lmb pmob for dgt labile p with mean concentrations c s l ranging from 0 15 to 0 28 mg l 1 for pore water srp and 0 028 to 0 051 mg l 1 for dgt labile p the active layer appeared below the static layer with a relaxed diffusion gradient reflected by the decrease in diffusion potential r al observed from 7 22 to 3 14 for pore water srp and from 15 1 to 5 37 for dgt labile p respectively 3 3 change in fe concentrations in core sediments the vertical changes in concentration of pore water soluble and dgt labile fe are shown in fig 6 for the control treatment there was a localized maximum concentration of soluble fe observed at a depth of 4 mm while the concentration of dgt labile fe approached zero by a depth of 12 mm below a depth of 12 mm both soluble and dgt labile fe exhibited an increasing trend towards the bottom of the microcosm core profile the application of lmb sharply reduced soluble fe concentrations to almost zero in the top sediment layer the average concentration of pore water soluble fe and dgt labile fe in the surface 20 mm sediment layer decreased from 0 34 and 0 18 mg l 1 respectively in the control treatment to zero and 0 009 mg l 1 respectively in the 200 lmb pmob treatment the average concentration of pore water soluble fe fluctuated with no obvious trends observable in the middle and bottom sediment layers dgt labile fe decreased from 1 32 and 1 63 mg l 1 in the middle and bottom layer respectively in the control treatment to 0 68 and 1 07 mg l 1 respectively in the 200 lmb pmob treatment table s3 3 4 change in p and fe concentrations in the lmb binding layer the lmb binding layer in the 200 lmb pmob treatment was selected for analysis of p speciation as well as fe content during each fractionation step fig 7 ca p was found to be the major p species in the binding layer accounting for 54 total p concentrations fig 7a fe p was the second abundant species accounting for 25 of total p concentration while the other four p species investigated collectively contributed 21 of total p concentration the release potentials of fe and p under varying redox conditions were also investigated fig 7b showing considerable levels of release of fe and p occurred when the redox potential eh decreased to 150 mv and 300 mv respectively 4 discussion 4 1 lmb immobilization efficiency for sediment p the efficiency of lmb reduction of water column p content has been confirmed through laboratory analysis mesocosm trials and field application copetti et al 2016 generally the removal efficiency reaches over 80 depending on the lmb dosage applied the duration of application and the degree of interference to p binding by lmb copetti et al 2016 dithmer et al 2016b lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013b in the present study the remaining concentration of srp in the water column was 38 μg l 1 and 2 7 μg l 1 for 100 lmb pmob and 200 lmb pmob treatments respectively showing removal efficiencies of 84 and 99 respectively fig 3 which are consistent with previous reports accordingly a shift in p speciation occurred from labile and release sensitive forms bd p to less bioavailable and possibly permanently bound forms hcl p and naoh rp fig 4 overall an eventual 40 reduction of pmob concentrations was observed in the 200 lmb pmob treatment an alternative method for assessment of lmb immobilization efficiency is based on the stratification mode of pore water srp and dgt labile p wang et al 2017b this analysis found that the 200 lmb pmob treatment achieved the greatest immobilization efficiency for sediment p with a greater δ s l and smaller c s l and r al confirming improved immobilization of p in sediments treated with lmb table 2 these findings are supported by the highest level of srp removal being observed in overlying water for the 200 lmb pmob treatment fig 3 it is interesting to note that the 60 lmb pmob treatment is sufficient to effectively immobilize p in sediments with a high static layer δ s l 15 mm and low c s l formed at this dosage table 2 which is lower than the manufacturer recommended dosage of 100 lmb pmob based on a theoretical la pmob binding ratio of 1 1 a reason for this may be that doc and carbonate induced minor interference with the formation of rhabdophane dithmer et al 2016b lürling et al 2014 reitzel et al 2013b additionally it may be that increased contact time is required to complete binding of lmb with all pmob fractions as only 40 of pmob in sediments was immobilized during the 2 month period for the 200 lmb pmob treatment furthermore an upward decreasing gradient of srp concentration was apparent from the lmb binding layer to the water column above with treatment of 60 200 lmb pmob fig 5c and d these findings suggest that besides direct immobilization of sediment p by lmb the concentration of srp in the water column is also determined by interactions between p in the lmb layer and the water column above although further studies are required to investigate this aspect 4 2 adsorption of fe by lmb and its effects on fe distribution in lmb amended sediments the batch adsorption results showed that the lmb can rapidly adsorb fe2 ions in solution fig 1 in freundlich model the parameter n was lower than 1 suggesting that the adsorption affinity of fe2 by lmb would decrease with increasing fe2 concentration the maximum fe2 adsorption capacities of lmb modeled by langmuir equation 8 51 mg g 1 was a little lower than the mean capacity of 8 8 mg g 1 for p detected in both lake water and pore water matrices dithmer et al 2016a comparison of the uptake amounts of fe and p with time indicates that the adsorption rate for fe was slower than that for p fig 1b and fig s1 this is probably because that the adsorption of fe2 by bentonite clay through electrostatic attraction and surface complexation would be limited by mass transfer kinetics in contrast the adsorption of p may proceed via homogeneous precipitation reactions e g formation of rhabdophane and monazite dithmer et al 2015 sheta et al 2003 reported that natural bentonite mainly montmorillonite mineral had a sorption capacity of 4 1 mg g 1 for fe2 the adsorption isotherm followed an s type isotherm and could be described by a freundlich or langmuir adsorption model for the concentration range used in this study table s1 qin et al 2015 confirmed that the adsorption process fitted with pseudo second order well and the montmorillonites in the presence of fe2 had good affinity for phosphate in sediment core incubation experiments significantly positive correlations p 0 01 were observed between the pore water srp and soluble fe concentrations as well as between the dgt labile p and fe concentrations in sediments before lmb amendment fig 8 these findings demonstrate that the remobilization of p from sediment was largely caused by the reductive dissolution of p bearing fe oxyhydroxides with this effect having been verified previously in sediments using dgt methods ding et al 2016a the application of lmb decreased both pore water soluble fe concentrations in the top sediment layer and dgt labile fe concentrations across the whole sediment profile fig 6 indicating that lmb effectively adsorbed mobile fe from core sediments these results are further supported by the findings of the batch adsorption experiments fig 1 table 1 reitzel et al 2013a found that the bd extracted fe concentrations increased by 22 in the top 10 mm sediment layer following lmb application at a dosage of 100 lmb pmob with the ratio of bd fe to bd p increasing from 2 2 to 10 2 also suggesting fe adsorption by lmb the concentration of soluble fe in pore water remained steady in the deeper sediment layer which differs from the change in dgt labile fe concentrations fig 6 potentially due to variation in the ability of labile solid fe to resupply soluble fe in pore waters at different sediment depths the concentration ratio r of dgt labile fe to pore water soluble fe can be used to reflect the resupply ability of the sediment solids harper et al 2000 in the present study r values were relatively low 0 2 with minor variations in the 15 25 mm sediment layer increasing up to 0 6 in deeper sediment layers fig 9 the low resupply ability of the top layer sediment solids may be due to the dominance of fe iii oxyhydroxides under oxic conditions which has low solubility the resupply ability increases with the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides in deeper sediment layers resulting in the increased r values observed this is supported by the observed increase in p resupply ability in deeper sediment layers chen et al 2016 it is of note that the resupply ability for fe in deeper sediment layers showed a decreasing trend with increased lmb dosage it reflects that the increase of lmb dosage induced more solid labile fe to move to the lmb binding layer and further limited its resupply ability 4 3 effects of fe adsorption on lmb immobilization of p lmb in the absence of fe loading showed complete adsorption of srp within 6 h following a decreasing trend with a large fluctuation fig 2a this demonstrates that a fraction of adsorbed p up to 16 7 was loosely bound to lmb and therefore is release sensitive fig 2b which may represent p bound to the surface of rhabdophane dithmer et al 2016b observed the attachment of protonated forms of p ions on the surface of rhabdophane using 31p mas nmr spectroscopy with this loosely surface bound p potentially eluted by bd solution and accounting for 26 of the total adsorbed p concentration pre loading of lmb with fe resulted in a slowing of the p adsorption rate contributing significantly to the stabilization of p adsorption fig 2a although the maximum level of p adsorption by fe loaded lmb 3 93 mg g 1 was similar to the concentration adsorbed by lmb without fe loading 3 96 mg g 1 the proportion of the release sensitive p significantly reduced from 16 7 to 2 3 fig 2b this demonstrates that release sensitive p initially bound on the surface of rhabdophane was immobilized by fe loaded in lmb lower concentrations of nh4cl p and bd p were observed in the lmb in the absence of fe loading which reflects a greater release of mobile p in comparison with fe loaded lmb fig 2c in the lmb binding layer following capping for two months a large amount of fe was eluted using bd solution fig 5a while fe bound p bd p was found in the binding layer accounting for 25 of total p concentrations in the 200 lmb pmob treatment fig 5a it is of note that this proportion falls in the range of 21 26 of the reported fractions in previous literature meis et al 2012 reitzel et al 2013a dithmer et al 2016b indicating that lmb adsorbed a considerable concentration of fe and that loaded fe contributed to p immobilization in sediments as the bottom water was under oxic condition during the sediment core incubation period 5 mg l 1 fe bound to lmb will be oxygenated as fe iii oxyhydroxides e g ferrihydrite which has strong phosphate binding capabilities kumar et al 2014 in combination with batch experimental results figs 1 and 2 table 1 it can be inferred that the adsorption of fe in sediments by amended lmb should play a significant role in the stabilization of lmb bound p likely by adsorbing release sensitive p that was initially bound to the surface of rhabdophane as a part of p is bound by fe simultaneously loaded in the lmb it is important to know whether fe bound p can be released under anoxic condition these results show that fe and p are not released until that eh values decreased to the range of extremely reductive conditions 150 mv to 300 mv fig 7b these eh values are much lower than 200 mv at which point insoluble oxidized fe iii oxides and hydroxides begin to be reduced releasing fe bound p christophoridis and fytianos 2006 in fact the true eh threshold value for p release should be lower than detected as the redox potential was adjusted using na2s solution the addition of na2s could precipitate fe2 liberated from reductive redissolution of fe oxyhydroxides as a result this treatment can promote the release of p by avoiding the precipitation of fe2 with p ions rothe et al 2014 it demonstrates that the release of fe bound p from lmb is significantly delayed under anoxic condition as newly formed fe oxides and hydroxides are sensitive to anoxic condition cornell and schwertmann 2003 a reasonable assumption is that the reduction of fe oxides or hydroxides in lmb should occur under eh 200 mv and the released fe ii and p ions will be rapidly re adsorbed by lmb 4 4 implications it should be recognized from these findings that the fe and lmb have synergistic effects on immobilization p in sediments i e one can act as a sink for p released from another side when the conditions become unfavorable for p adsorption a schematic interpretation of this synergistic effect is shown in fig 10 with the major processes occurring in the lmb layer including 1 fe ii adsorption by bentonite 2 oxygenation of adsorbed fe ii under oxic condition 3 adsorption of release sensitive p bound onto the rhabdophane surface i e rhabdophane p in fig 10 and the formation of fe iii p 4 reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides and the release of fe ii and p under anoxic condition 5 re adsorption of released fe ii and p by lmb it should be noted that some of the processes remained to be verified by future studies this new observation of the synergistic effects of fe adsorption provides new insights into the immobilization mechanisms of lmb for sediment p it can address several concerns bewildering the researchers before firstly the observed adsorption of fe can explain why fe was found in the lmb reitzel et al 2013a secondly the simultaneous adsorption of fe and p by lmb can explain why fe bound p i e bd p exists in lmb besides la bound p rhabdophane and monazite meis et al 2012 reitzel et al 2013a thirdly the role of adsorbed fe in the stabilization of release sensitive p in lmb can partly explain why the immobilization efficiency of lmb is high and stable besides the formation of la bound p copetti et al 2016 dithmer et al 2015 finally the re adsorption of fe and p by lmb under anoxic condition can explain why the immobilization efficiency of lmb for p is not affected by redox state ross et al 2008 in combination with fe p coupling in sediments and lmb fe interaction a holistic understanding of lmb immobilization of p can be significantly promoted 5 conclusions the adsorption of fe by lmb can be well described by the freundlich isotherm the maximum fe adsorption capacity of lmb was 8 51 mg g 1 the maximum adsorbed concentrations of p showed little variation between lmb in the presence or absence of fe loading however a maximum level of 16 7 of p was adsorbed by lmb without fe loading with only 2 3 of the total p concentration being loosely bound and release sensitive both pore water srp and dgt labile p decreased in lmb amended sediments stratification was observed with a static layer in the top 16 22 mm of sediment being followed by active layers with relaxed upward diffusion gradients apparent when the amendment dosage reached 60 lmb pmob lmb amendments simultaneously reduced pore water fe and dgt labile fe in sediments resulting in the enrichment of bd fe and bd p in the lmb binding layer the adsorbed fe plays a significant role in the stabilization of release sensitive p that was initially bound onto the surface of rhabdophane in lmb the lmb adsorbed fe and p was not released until the redox potential decreased to extremely reductive conditions 150 mv to 300 mv implying that re adsorption of fe and p by lmb likely occurs preventing their release under anoxic conditions acknowledgements this study was jointly

19691,the corrosion of zero valent iron zvi by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 generates hydroxyl oh and other radical oxygen species ros that degrade organic materials to better understand the factors that govern the ros formation during the h2o2 induced corrosion we investigated the degradation of an organic probe compound acesulfame ace in slurries of zvi powder in unbuffered laboratory water at ph 6 5 0 5 chloride ions accelerated the corrosion of zvi by h2o2 and the formation ros and therefore the degradation of organic materials conversely slowing corrosion by phosphate buffer inhibited ros formation and the degradation of organic compounds the rate of h2o2 decomposition was correlated with the liberation of fe2 aq and the ace degradation rate the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition was pseudo first order and zero order at low 0 04 mm mg and high h2o2 zvi initial ratios respectively and was consistent with langmuir kinetics the h2o2 decomposition rate was proportional to the zvi reactive surface area sa and nearly independent of the extent of zvi oxidation the presence of a fe2 aq chelating agent and oh quenchers methanol and tert butanol kinetic data suggest a mechanism involving rapid cathodic reduction of h2o2 at the metallic zvi surface which causes the liberation of fe2 aq that generate oh via the homogeneous fenton reaction the stoichiometric efficiency se of organics degradation ranged from 0 0008 to 0 014 and increased with decreasing h2o2 decomposition rate keywords zero valent iron hydrogen peroxide fenton reaction corrosion hydroxyl radical 1 introduction hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is an environmentally friendly oxidant widely used for disinfection biofouling control and as a bulk oxidant in industrial medical and environmental applications h2o2 and other peroxides are evaluated as a replacement for chlorine based disinfectants to avoid pollution with toxic chlorination byproducts for instance in membrane based water treatment systems ling et al 2017 ling et al 2018 and as a bleaching agent in the paper production rotash et al 2014 in the presence of iron and other transition metal compounds h2o2 generates transient reactive oxygen

landolt 2007 and reviews neyens and baeyens 2003 pignatello et al 2006 in the presence of zvi h2o2 decomposition can occur via four pathways bergendahl and thies 2004 1 cathodic oxidation of fe0 s and reduction of h2o2 r 1 4 by two electron transfer 2 the classical fenton r 2 1 reaction 3 the fenton like reaction which is initiated by r 2 2 and 4 reaction with oh r 2 5 corrosion of fe0 s is coupled to the generation of solid fe ii rust and soluble fe2 aq r 1 1 the spatial separation of cathodic and the anodic processes lead to the formation of cavities pitting landolt 2007 the fenton reaction is affected by numerous factors most importantly by the fe2 aq concentration the ph and the presence of complexing agents as indicated in table s1 fe2 aq is the key reactant involved in the formation of oh it can be formed by the oxidation of fe0 s r 1 1 the reduction of fe iii by h2o2 r 2 2 and o2h r 2 3 fe2 aq is consumed by the homogeneous fenton reaction r 2 1 the precipitation and co precipitation as oxyhydroxide r 3 1 3 4 and by reacting with oh r 2 4 oxidation reactions of zvi by h fe3 and oh are indicated in r 1 7 to 1 9 previous studies reported that the rate of ros production is accelerated by h and inhibited by various ligands such as phosphate and natural organic matter nom de laat and le 2006 pignatello et al 2006 sun et al 2016 increasing ph to 3 5 causes fe iii to form solid ferric oxyhydroxides the latter are weaker activating agents than fe2 aq studies with selective organic probes indicated that the yield of oh yield decreased with increasing ph while that of the less reactive fe iv ferryl and fe v species increased e g by r 2 10 keenan and sedlak 2008 pignatello et al 2006 increasing h2o2 at constant solution conditions increases the rate of corrosion and the rate of ros generation kwan and voelker 2003 in the presence of an excess of o2 the dominant cathodic process is r 1 2 reduction of o2 to h2o while a small fraction is converted to h2o2 r 1 3 h2o2 so formed can form ros and degrade organic materials keenan and sedlak 2008 the stoichiometric efficiency se indicates the molar ratio of degraded probe p to h2o2 consumed during exposure to zvi h2o2 eq 1 1 s e t p 0 p t h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 t where p 0 p t h2o2 0 and h2o2 t are the molar concentrations of probe compound p and h2o2 at time 0 and t respectively se depends on the structure of p and reaction conditions and time it is lower if the products formed consume additional h2o2 published se data are scarce and difficult to compare a correction is needed if p is removed due to adsorption to the iron surface huang et al 2001 namkung et al 2005 se was determined for the decolorization of rhodamine b in h2o2 fe ii iii oxide systems and was found to depend on the type of oxide xue et al 2009 depending on the oxide se decreased with increasing surface area sa from a maximum of approximately 14 to less than 2 the decrease was attributed to the quenching of oh by surface reactions in a nano zvi h2o2 system the rate of organics oxidation increased as the ph decreased li and zhu 2014 wang et al 2016 methyl t butyl ether mtbe was transformed more efficiently at ph 4 than at ph 7 and 3 in a zvi h2o2 system bergendahl and thies 2004 the kinetic model suggested that fe2 aq was formed by the oxidation of fe0 s and fed into the fenton reaction cycle because the decomposition of h2o2 by zvi and the release of fe2 aq are accelerated by corrosion promoters i e h3o cl o2 h2o2 corrosion promoters are accelerating the fenton reaction and thus the degradation of organics bergendahl and thies 2004 studies with trichloroethylene tce as the electron acceptor indicated that pretreatment of zvi with chloride ions accelerated electrochemical processes by increasing surface roughness via pitting corrosion dissolving the passivation layer and generating reactive sites gotpagar et al 1999 by contrast corrosion is suppressed by phosphate ions binding strongly to the iron species formed during the zvi oxidation which occurs even in the presence of chloride ions de laat and le 2006 refaey et al 2000 reffass et al 2009 assessing the degradation of organic materials during zvi corrosion by h2o2 in a variety of matrices requires detailed data that document the effects of chloride and phosphate ions on ros formation this laboratory study quantified the effect of chloride and phosphate ions on the degradation of organic compounds by ros formed during the corrosion of zvi and aimed to gain mechanistic insight into the process acesulfame ace was used as the probe compound because it occurs ubiquitously in the environment lange et al 2012 is poorly sorbing tran et al 2015 and its reaction rate with oh was determined previously toth et al 2012 urban 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1

glass bottles wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light initial concentrations of zvi powder h2o2 chloride and phosphate were adjusted by amending appropriate aliquots of concentrated standard stock solutions aliquots of artificial sweeteners were added to obtain an initial concentration of 100 μg l each zvi powder was kept in suspension by rotary shaking the flasks at 150 rpm samples were collected at predetermined time intervals with a 5 ml syringe and filtered immediately by a 0 22 μm nylon syringe filter to study the effect of fe2 aq on ace degradation experiments were conducted in the presence of 5 mm of bpy a complexing agent that selectively inhibits r 2 1 katsoyiannis et al 2008 meoh and tbuoh were added 20 mm to quench ros including feo2 and oh lee et al 2014 respectively

the specific mesopore sized 2 50 nm sa of the zvi particles was determined using the brunauer emmett teller bet test autosorb 6b quantachrome fl usa by n2 adsorption desorption 2 4 kinetic modeling the observed rate of h2o2 removal was expressed as eq 2 2 d h 2 o 2 d t k o b s h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 where k obs h2o2 represents the observed pseudo first order rate constant of h2o2 removal four parallel h2o2 first order degradation reactions were considered significant cathodic reduction at the metallic fe0 s surface r 1 4 surface r 4 1 r 4 3 catalysis by iron oxides and the homogeneous classical fenton r 2 1 and the fenton like reaction r 2 2 bergendahl and thies 2004 at low h2o2 concentrations the reaction between h2o2 and oh r 2 5 were considered negligible accordingly the h2o2 removal rate was expressed as eq 3 3 d h 2 o 2 d t k c a t h f e 0 h 2 o 2 k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 k h o m o f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 k h o m o f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 3 where k cath k hetero k homo fe2 k homo fe3 represented the second order rate constants for the four processes the term k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 accounted for the reaction at the surface sites of fe oxide because h2o2 adsorbed only weakly to the surfaces of fe oxide rate limitation due to the saturation of reactive sites at high h2o2 was not expected kwan and voelker 2003 oh ss was quantified indirectly by measuring the decomposition reaction of ace assuming that oh was the only reactive specie reacting with ace eq 4 4 d a c e d t k o b s a c e a c e k a c e o h s s a c e where k obs ace is the observed first order rate constant for ace degradation and k ace oh is the bi molecular rate constant between ace and the oh radical which was determined at 4 1 0 7 109 m 1 s 1 in separate experiments the measured value compared favorably with values measured by others toth et al 2012 urban 2015 oh ss is the result of heterogeneous and homogeneous formation reactions and the sum of the scavenging reactions obtained by evaluating eq 5 watts et al 1999 5 o h s s k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 k h o m o f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 k o h i s i the term σ k oh i s i is the rate at which oh is consumed by the different scavengers and k oh i is the second order rate constant m 1s 1 for the reaction between oh and scavenger i si if h2o2 is present at relatively high concentrations oh scavenging by h2o2 r 2 5 can become the dominant scavenger limiting oh production and therefore the fenton reaction r 2 1 if fe2 generated by anodic corrosion of zvi r 1 1 is much faster than the reduction of fe3 by h2o2 r 2 2 oxidation of the organic is directly coupled to the cathodic decomposition of h2o2 bergendahl and thies 2004 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of chloride methanol and t butanol on h2o2 and organics degradation the removals of h2o2 and organics were determined as functions of the chloride ion ace sac and cyc concentrations a buffer was omitted to avoid interferences with the corrosion chemistry and degradation reactions the degradation of h2o2 and ace at ph 6 5 0 5 unbuffered fig s2 was studied in the presence of 500 mg l zvi 10 mm initial h2o2 and cl concentrations ranging from 0 mm to 10 mm the normalized concentration profiles c co of h2o2 and ace are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively only ace data are discussed because ace sac and cyc behaved nearly identically fig s3 in the absence of cl the degradation of both h2o2 and ace was too slow to be quantified less than 2 removal in 90 min indicating that an electrolyte was required for zvi corrosion r 1 5 and h2o2 activation via r 2 1 to reach an observable level increasing cl up to approximately 1 2 mm increased the removal rates of h2o2 and ace to a saturation level fig 1c and d respectively the correlation between the h2o2 and ace degradation up to the cl saturation level is shown in fig s4 the close correlation is consistent with a mechanism by which the corrosion of zvi by h2o2 generates fe2 aq which in turn stimulates ace degradation via the fenton reaction chloride ions were previously demonstrated to accelerate cathodic reductive transformation of organic electron acceptors by zvi gotpagar et al 1999 hernandez et al 2004 the lag in the decay of h2o2 could have been caused by slow removal of the passivizing oxide layer and the formation of pits a process that can be suppressed by the addition of phosphate ions refaey et al 2000 the kinetics data are summarized in table s3 the hypothesis that ace reacted with oh was supported by the observation that both tbuoh and meoh completely blocked the transformation of ace fig s5b based on the observation that tbuoh selectively quenches oh and meoh quenches both oh and the less reactive ferryl fe iv keenan and sedlak 2008 the observation that radical scavengers did not affect h2o2 decomposition fig s5a suggested that quenching of oh r 2 5 did not significantly contribute to h2o2 removal 3 2 evidence for pitting corrosion and rust formation sem images of zvi before 0 min and after 90 min treatment with h2o2 and 1 mm cl fig s6 demonstrate pitting and increased specific sa fig s6b the increased sa explains the increased h2o2 and organics decomposition rates xrd spectra were acquired to identify the predominant rust components formed via r 3 1 to 3 5 the only two peaks detected in spectra obtained before and after 90 min reaction time were 2θ 44 7 and 65 0 fig s7a indicating that fe0 was the major solid component detectable quantities of rust were formed in a 24 h oxidation experiment whereby 10 mm hydrogen peroxide was re spiked 4 times to a reaction mixture containing 10 mm cl the characteristic peaks detected after the extended treatment were 2θ 30 3 35 4 57 2 and 62 7 fig s7b which were consistent with the formation of magnetite fe3o4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh huang and zhang 2006 kanel et al 2005 wu et al 2015 3 3 mechanism of h2o2 and organic compound degradation to examine whether ace was degraded by ros produced by the fenton reaction r 2 1 fe2 aq was complexed by amending the reaction mixture with 2 2 bipyridine bpy bpy blocked the fenton reaction without interfering with the corrosion chemistry of zvi katsoyiannis et al 2008 fig 2 a and b shows respectively the degradation of h2o2 and ace in reaction mixtures containing 500 mg l and 5000 mg l zvi without and with the presence of 5 mm of bpy the h2o2 degradation rates were not significantly affected by bpy suggesting that h2o2 decomposition occurred primarily via reduction by zvi r 1 5 yoshino and kawase 2013 who studied contaminant degradation at ph 3 attributed h2o2 decomposition to the homogeneous fenton reaction perhaps this discrepancy is due to the fact that at ph 3 fe2 aq is more present at higher concentrations than in our experiment ph 6 5 0 5 the measured soluble iron concentrations during the reactions ranged from 0 to 0 4 mg l by contrast the fe2 aq concentration reported by yoshino and kawase during the reaction ranged from 0 to 320 mg l and was similar to that of h2o2 yoshino and kawase 2013 in the presence of 5 mm bpy the degradation of ace in the presence of bpy was almost completely inhibited ace degradation did not occur within 90 min whereas approximately 50 was degraded in the absence of bpy consistent with bpy blocking the homogeneous fenton process r 2 1 and indicating that ace was degraded by fenton generated oh r 2 1 the potential importance of the heterogeneous fenton reaction on the h2o2 decomposition was assessed by evaluating the reactivity of pre oxidized zvi pre oxidized zvi was prepared by treating zvi in 10 mm h2o2 and 1 mm cl for 90 min the treatment formed pits and generated iron oxides h2o2 decomposition was determined in the presence of 500 mg l pre oxidized zvi with and without 1 mm cl the pre oxidized zvi without cl present decomposed only 19 of the initial h2o2 within 90 min compared to nearly 0 in metallic zvi fig 3 this result suggests that pre oxidized zvi was more active than untreated zvi which was practically non reactive in the absence of chloride the degradation of 19 h2o2 by pre oxidized zvi was attributed to the heterogeneous fenton reaction at the iron oxyhydroxide surfaces r 4 1 4 4 huang et al 2001 kwan and voelker 2002 lin and gurol 1998 and cathodic decomposition r 1 5 in the pits created during pretreatment in the presence of 1 mm cl both pre oxidized zvi and untreated zvi transformed approximately 80 of h2o2 indicating that 1 mm cl was sufficient to dissolve the inhibitory deactivation layer on the bare zvi surface apparently in the presence of cl the heterogeneous fenton reaction term k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 in eq 3 contributed negligibly to the h2o2 decomposition the effect of iron oxide accumulation and the change in the surface activity of the zvi was studied by measuring the rates of h2o2 and ace removal during three sequential additions of h2o2 and ace removals were almost identical fig 4 except that there appeared to be a lag phase during the first 20 min during the first experiment the initial lag may have been due to the slow zvi activation thereafter the decomposition rates of h2o2 and ace remained constant table s4 the close correlation between the h2o2 and ace decomposition rates is consistent with a mechanism whereby the degradation of h2o2 and formation of fe2 aq r 1 1 control the homogeneous fenton reaction r 2 1 the fact that the ace degradation remained constant excluding initial lag phase in the 1st spike despite the accumulation of rust indicated that the heterogeneous fenton reaction term k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 in eq 5 contributed negligibly to ace degradation moreover the rates of h2o2 degradation by aged 2nd and 3rd spike were nearly equal to fresh 1st spike zvi suggesting that zvi passivation due to coating by iron oxide was prevented at the zvi cl ratio employed in this experiment 500 mg mm and cl can possibly be used for reactivating aged oxide coated zvi liu et al 2013 bet data indicated that during the first 20 min fig 5 zvi exposed to 10 mm h2o2 and cl rapidly increased the mesoporous 2 50 nm sa from 0 to 5 05 m2 g this observation indicates the generation of pits and surface roughness sa formation continued and after 22 h reached 16 01 m2 g fig 5 insert this observation is consistent with a two stage rate law of h2o2 decomposition first an initial lag followed by pseudo first order by contrast for the degradation of 4 chlorophenol by zvi h2o2 at ph 4 two sequential first order processes were reported zhou et al 2008 these authors attributed the slow initial phase to zvi surface reactions and the faster second stage to homogeneous solution reactions in summary in the presence of sufficient chloride the dominant decomposition mechanism of h2o2 is proposed to be via cathodic reduction eq 3 according to 6 d h 2 o 2 d t k c a t h f e 0 h 2 o 2 where f e 0 represents the reactive sa reactive sa are generated by chloride through pitting after the lag phase the number of f e 0 sites gradually stabilize and the decomposition follows pseudo first order kinetics the finding that ace degradation is dominated by classical fenton reaction allows us to simplify eq 5 as eq 7 7 o h s s k h o m o f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 k o h i s i which indicates that oh ss and the rate of ace degradation are controlled by h2o2 fe2 and si 3 4 the effect of the initial h2o2 and zvi concentrations on h2o2 and ace degradation experiments were carried out to evaluate h2o2 and ace degradation as a function of the h2o2 and zvi concentrations in the presence of 10 mm cl the cl concentration was approximately 50 times above the catalytic saturation concentration fig 1 results are presented intable s5 s6 and figs 6 7 over h2o2 0 ranging from 2 to 10 mm the pseudo first order rate constants varied narrowly 0 0211 0 0237 min 1 at h2o2 0 ranging from 15 mm to 50 mm a lag phase was noted that increased to 30 min and the ace degradation rate k obs increased from 0 007 to 0 0121 min 1 as the initial h2o2 concentration increased from 2 to 15 mm fig 6 b and c at approximately 15 mm h2o2 a saturation point was reached perhaps due to oh quenching by h2o2 li and zhu 2014 wang et al 2016 fig 7a and b shows the effect of the zvi concentration on the decomposition of h2o2 and ace respectively at varying zvi 0 5000 mg l ph 6 5 0 5 10 mm cl and 10 mm h2o2 0 at low zvi concentrations 250 500 and 1000 mg l degradation of h2o2 approximated zero order kinetics after short lag phases most distinct for 250 mg l zvi at 2000 and 5000 mg l zvi concentrations h2o2 degradation approximated first order kinetics the transition from zero to first order kinetics is consistent with langmuir kinetics whereby at high h2o2 zvi all reactive sa are occupied by h2o2 under these conditions the h2o2 transformation rate represents the intrinsic reaction rate i e the rate with which the surface complex f e 0 h 2 o 2 reacts to fe2 r 1 5 at high h2o2 zvi the rate is limited by the total number of reactive sa f e 0 available for binding of h2o2 resulting in zero order kinetics at low h2o2 zvi the number of sites occupied by h2o2 is proportional h2o2 resulting in first order kinetics the degradation of ace fig 6b generally was pseudo first order perhaps because ace interacted only weakly with the zvi surface 3 5 the competing effects of phosphate and chloride ions the opposing effects of cl and phosphate ions on the h2o2 and ace decomposition were studied by quantifying decomposition as a function of the total phosphate ion concentration po4 tot at fixed cl 10 mm fig 8 and as a function of the cl ion concentration in the absence and presence of 1 mm phosphate fig 9 results indicating the inhibitory effect of phosphate ions are shown in fig 8a b fig s8 a b and table s7 without the presence of chloride degradation of h2o2 and ace was not observed as indicated in fig 8a and b k obs h2o2 and k obs ace exponentially decreased with increasing po4 tot similar results were previously reported for the removal of as v and as iii by zvi su and puls 2001 and explained with strong inner sphere surface complexes that sorb to mineral surface fig 9a and b fig s9 a b and table s7 show the results of h2o2 and ace degradation at constant po4 tot 0 1 mm and 1 0 mm h2o2 0 10 mm and cl varying from 0 to 50 mm increasing cl from 0 1 mm to approximately 4 mm increased k obs h2o2 from 0 0002 to a plateau at 0 004 min 1 in the absence of phosphate k obs h2o2 was approximately 6 times higher ace degradation increased gradually up to approximately 20 mm cl plateauing at 0 0102 min 1 approximately the same level as without phosphate this result suggested that the chloride ions were not able to displace phosphate from the zvi surface and to promote corrosion even at high cl concentrations by contrast sufficiently high chloride concentration fully restored the rate of oh formation even in the presence of phosphate 3 6 the stoichiometric efficiency as a function of reaction conditions the se eq 1 was evaluated as a function of cl zvi h2o2 0 and po4 tot after 90 min exposure fig 10 a c se decreased with increasing cl zvi and h2o2 0 fig 10a b and c respectively to a constant value whereas se increased exponentially with increasing po4 tot fig 10d the highest se values were observed at low cl and h2o2 fig 10 a and c respectively and high po4 tot fig 10 d concentrations and ranged from 0 0008 to 0 014 under these conditions the number of reactive sa and the corrosion rate of zvi were relatively small apparently accelerating corrosion accelerated h2o2 decomposition to a greater extent than ace decomposition perhaps h2o2 was consumed rapidly in non radical forming reactions or oh scavenging was more significant at the higher corrosion rate fe2 aq required to form oh via r 2 1 is also presumably low because it is consumed by rust forming reactions r 3 1 3 5 previous studies also reported that se decreased with the increased sa with iron oxide as the catalyst huang et al 2001 valentine and ann wang 1998 3 7 reactions in surface water and sea water and environmental implications to evaluate the implications of this zvi h2o2 reactions in the environmental relevant conditions the degradation of h2o2 and ace by the zvi was studied in filtered 0 45 μm and unfiltered urban surface water samples collected from a catchment cm a main water body mw and coastal seawater of singapore an experiment in di water was included as a control the water quality data of the three water samples are shown in table s8 and the h2o2 and ace degradation data are shown is fig s10a b because reactions in the surface water samples were too slow to be observed samples were augmented with 10 mm cl phosphate was not detected or extremely low 2 8 μg l in cw in all cases and significant inhibition by phosphate was not expected doc concentrations ranged from 1 0 mg l for seawater to 2 9 mg l for mw and exceeded the initial ace concentration 100 μg l the degradation rates of h2o2 in mw cw and seawater were similar with the exception of the filtered seawater which was slightly faster and approximately as fast as di water these results suggest that the rate of h2o2 decomposition was largely controlled by the catalytic effect of chloride ions across all environmental water samples although seawater contained 555 mm cl the h2o2 decomposition rate of filtered seawater did not differ markedly from augmented di water since cl was at saturation level fig s10 the h2o2 decomposition rate was slightly higher in the filtered seawater as compared to unfiltered suggesting that seawater particles and dissolved organic carbon doc may have some inhibition effect on cathodic reduction of h2o2 in contrast to the h2o2 decomposition the ace decomposition was significantly slower in mw cm and seawater than in in the di water indicating oh quenching in unfiltered and filtered seawater ace was degraded by 16 and 23 respectively significantly lower than in the freshwater samples 30 37 the slower degradation observed in seawater may have been caused by chloride and bromide ions scavenging oh de laat and le 2006 which is noticeable above 10 mm at ph 2 8 pignatello et al 2006 or due to the complexation of fe2 aq with chelating agents such as marine siderophores van den berg 1995 the slower degradation of ace in mw and cm compared to di could stem from doc quenching oh or complexing fe2 aq pignatello et al 2006 comparing the data in di water and the surface water samples suggested that concentrations of 1 3 mg l of doc were sufficient to inhibit the decomposition of ace and the inhibition effect was more significant on ace than h2o2 decomposition in seawater which contains abundant cl the h2o2 decomposition was approximately as rapid as in 10 mm di water suggesting the saturation effect of cl may also apply to environmental water bodies in spite of the fast corrosion rate organic compound degradation was slower likely due to oh quenching by environmental scavengers or iron complexation 4 summary and conclusions the reactions considered potentially significant during the corrosion of zvi by h2o2 and the reactions identified to contribute most to the degradation of h2o2 and the formation of oh are indicated in fig 11 kinetic data indicated that the principal decomposition reaction of h2o2 during the early stages of zvi corrosion at neutral ph 6 5 0 5 was the cathodic reduction at the metallic zvi surface r 1 4 coupled to anodic oxidation of fe 0 r 1 1 anodic oxidation of zvi consumes h2o2 and generates fe2 aq the latter activates h2o2 via the fenton reaction and forms oh which is the principal agent degrading organic compounds r 2 1 chloride ions accelerated the decomposition of h2o2 by inducing pitting corrosion and accelerating the anodic dissolution of fe0 s after an initial lag phase h2o2 decomposition followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics at low h2o2 zvi ratio 0 04 mm mg and zero order reaction kinetics at high h2o2 zvi ratio 0 04 mm mg phosphate ions inhibited h2o2 degradation even in the presence of cl ions inhibition by phosphate ions was attributed to their strong interactions with the reactive surface sites of zvi f e 0 presumably an insoluble iron phosphate layer or strongly adsorbed phosphate ions blocked the reactive sites on the zvi surface and prevented the generation of fe2 aq therefore inhibiting ace degradation by the fenton reaction the two mechanisms are difficult to discern without further analyses both phosphate inhibition and cl catalysis exhibited saturation effects the se of ace degradation ranged from 0 0008 to 0 014 and was inversely correlated with the h2o2 decomposition rate additional studies are required to generalize the findings

19691,the corrosion of zero valent iron zvi by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 generates hydroxyl oh and other radical oxygen species ros that degrade organic materials to better understand the factors that govern the ros formation during the h2o2 induced corrosion we investigated the degradation of an organic probe compound acesulfame ace in slurries of zvi powder in unbuffered laboratory water at ph 6 5 0 5 chloride ions accelerated the corrosion of zvi by h2o2 and the formation ros and therefore the degradation of organic materials conversely slowing corrosion by phosphate buffer inhibited ros formation and the degradation of organic compounds the rate of h2o2 decomposition was correlated with the liberation of fe2 aq and the ace degradation rate the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition was pseudo first order and zero order at low 0 04 mm mg and high h2o2 zvi initial ratios respectively and was consistent with langmuir kinetics the h2o2 decomposition rate was proportional to the zvi reactive surface area sa and nearly independent of the extent of zvi oxidation the presence of a fe2 aq chelating agent and oh quenchers methanol and tert butanol kinetic data suggest a mechanism involving rapid cathodic reduction of h2o2 at the metallic zvi surface which causes the liberation of fe2 aq that generate oh via the homogeneous fenton reaction the stoichiometric efficiency se of organics degradation ranged from 0 0008 to 0 014 and increased with decreasing h2o2 decomposition rate keywords zero valent iron hydrogen peroxide fenton reaction corrosion hydroxyl radical 1 introduction hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is an environmentally friendly oxidant widely used for disinfection biofouling control and as a bulk oxidant in industrial medical and environmental applications h2o2 and other peroxides are evaluated as a replacement for chlorine based disinfectants to avoid pollution with toxic chlorination byproducts for instance in membrane based water treatment systems

landolt 2007 and reviews neyens and baeyens 2003 pignatello et al 2006 in the presence of zvi h2o2 decomposition can occur via four pathways bergendahl and thies 2004 1 cathodic oxidation of fe0 s and reduction of h2o2 r 1 4 by two electron transfer 2 the classical fenton r 2 1 reaction 3 the fenton like reaction which is initiated by r 2 2 and 4 reaction with oh r 2 5 corrosion of fe0 s is coupled to the generation of solid fe ii rust and soluble fe2 aq r 1 1 the spatial separation of cathodic and the anodic processes lead to the formation of cavities pitting landolt 2007 the fenton reaction is affected by numerous factors most importantly by the fe2 aq concentration the ph and the presence of complexing agents as indicated in table s1 fe2 aq is the key reactant involved in the formation of oh it can be formed by the oxidation of fe0 s r 1 1 the reduction of fe iii by h2o2 r 2 2 and o2h r 2 3 fe2 aq is consumed by the homogeneous fenton reaction r 2 1 the precipitation and co precipitation as oxyhydroxide r 3 1 3 4 and by reacting with oh r 2 4 oxidation reactions of zvi by h fe3 and oh are indicated in r 1 7 to 1 9 previous studies reported that the rate of ros production is accelerated by h and inhibited by various ligands such as phosphate and natural organic matter nom de laat and le 2006 pignatello et al 2006 sun et al 2016 increasing ph to 3 5 causes fe iii to form solid ferric oxyhydroxides the latter are weaker activating agents than fe2 aq studies with selective organic probes indicated that the yield of oh yield decreased with increasing ph while that of the less reactive fe iv ferryl and fe v species increased e g by r 2 10 keenan and sedlak 2008 pignatello et al 2006 increasing h2o2 at constant solution conditions increases the rate of corrosion and the rate of ros generation kwan and voelker 2003 in the presence of an excess of o2 the dominant cathodic process is r 1 2 reduction of o2 to h2o while a small fraction is converted to h2o2 r 1 3 h2o2 so formed can form ros and degrade organic materials keenan and sedlak 2008 the stoichiometric efficiency se indicates the molar ratio of degraded probe p to h2o2 consumed during exposure to zvi h2o2 eq 1 1 s e t p 0 p t h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 t where p 0 p t h2o2 0 and h2o2 t are the molar concentrations of probe compound p and h2o2 at time 0 and t respectively se depends on the structure of p and reaction conditions and time it is lower if the products formed consume additional h2o2 published se data are scarce and difficult to compare a correction is needed if p is removed due to adsorption to the iron surface huang et al 2001 namkung et al 2005 se was determined for the decolorization of rhodamine b in h2o2 fe ii iii oxide systems and was found to depend on the type of oxide xue et al 2009 depending on the oxide se decreased with increasing surface area sa from a maximum of approximately 14 to less than 2 the decrease was attributed to the quenching of oh by surface reactions in a nano zvi h2o2 system the rate of organics oxidation increased as the ph decreased li and zhu 2014 wang et al 2016 methyl t butyl ether mtbe was transformed more efficiently at ph 4 than at ph 7 and 3 in a zvi h2o2 system bergendahl and thies 2004 the kinetic model suggested that fe2 aq was formed by the oxidation of fe0 s and fed into the fenton reaction cycle because the decomposition of h2o2 by zvi and the release of fe2 aq are accelerated by corrosion promoters i e h3o cl o2 h2o2 corrosion promoters are accelerating the fenton reaction and thus the degradation of organics bergendahl and thies 2004 studies with trichloroethylene tce as the electron acceptor indicated that pretreatment of zvi with chloride ions accelerated electrochemical processes by increasing surface roughness via pitting corrosion dissolving the passivation layer and generating reactive sites gotpagar et al 1999 by contrast corrosion is suppressed by phosphate ions binding strongly to the iron species formed during the zvi oxidation which occurs even in the presence of chloride ions de laat and le 2006 refaey et al 2000 reffass et al 2009 assessing the degradation of organic materials during zvi corrosion by h2o2 in a variety of matrices requires detailed data that document the effects of chloride and phosphate ions on ros formation this laboratory study quantified the effect of chloride and phosphate ions on the degradation of organic compounds by ros formed during the corrosion of zvi and aimed to gain mechanistic insight into the process acesulfame ace was used as the probe compound because it occurs ubiquitously in the environment lange et al 2012 is poorly sorbing tran et al 2015 and its reaction rate with oh was determined previously toth et al 2012 urban 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1

bipyridine bpy tertiary butanol tbuoh were purchased from sigma aldrich pte ltd singapore 2 2 experimental set up all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 1 c in 100 ml acid washed glass bottles wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light initial concentrations of zvi powder h2o2 chloride and phosphate were adjusted by amending appropriate aliquots of concentrated standard stock solutions aliquots of artificial sweeteners were added to obtain an initial concentration of 100 μg l each zvi powder was kept in suspension by rotary shaking the flasks at 150 rpm samples were collected at predetermined time intervals with a 5 ml syringe and filtered immediately by a 0 22 μm nylon syringe filter to study the effect of fe2 aq on ace degradation experiments were conducted in the presence of 5 mm of bpy a complexing agent that selectively inhibits r 2 1 katsoyiannis et al 2008 meoh and tbuoh were added 20 mm to quench ros including feo2 and oh lee et al 2014 respectively

the specific mesopore sized 2 50 nm sa of the zvi particles was determined using the brunauer emmett teller bet test autosorb 6b quantachrome fl usa by n2 adsorption desorption 2 4 kinetic modeling the observed rate of h2o2 removal was expressed as eq 2 2 d h 2 o 2 d t k o b s h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 where k obs h2o2 represents the observed pseudo first order rate constant of h2o2 removal four parallel h2o2 first order degradation reactions were considered significant cathodic reduction at the metallic fe0 s surface r 1 4 surface r 4 1 r 4 3 catalysis by iron oxides and the homogeneous classical fenton r 2 1 and the fenton like reaction r 2 2 bergendahl and thies 2004 at low h2o2 concentrations the reaction between h2o2 and oh r 2 5 were considered negligible accordingly the h2o2 removal rate was expressed as eq 3 3 d h 2 o 2 d t k c a t h f e 0 h 2 o 2 k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 k h o m o f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 k h o m o f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 3 where k cath k hetero k homo fe2 k homo fe3 represented the second order rate constants for the four processes the term k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 accounted for the reaction at the surface sites of fe oxide because h2o2 adsorbed only weakly to the surfaces of fe oxide rate limitation due to the saturation of reactive sites at high h2o2 was not expected kwan and voelker 2003 oh ss was quantified indirectly by measuring the decomposition reaction of ace assuming that oh was the only reactive specie reacting with ace eq 4 4 d a c e d t k o b s a c e a c e k a c e o h s s a c e where k obs ace is the observed first order rate constant for ace degradation and k ace oh is the bi molecular rate constant between ace and the oh radical which was determined at 4 1 0 7 109 m 1 s 1 in separate experiments the measured value compared favorably with values measured by others toth et al 2012 urban 2015 oh ss is the result of heterogeneous and homogeneous formation reactions and the sum of the scavenging reactions obtained by evaluating eq 5 watts et al 1999 5 o h s s k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 k h o m o f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 k o h i s i the term σ k oh i s i is the rate at which oh is consumed by the different scavengers and k oh i is the second order rate constant m 1s 1 for the reaction between oh and scavenger i si if h2o2 is present at relatively high concentrations oh scavenging by h2o2 r 2 5 can become the dominant scavenger limiting oh production and therefore the fenton reaction r 2 1 if fe2 generated by anodic corrosion of zvi r 1 1 is much faster than the reduction of fe3 by h2o2 r 2 2 oxidation of the organic is directly coupled to the cathodic decomposition of h2o2 bergendahl and thies 2004 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of chloride methanol and t butanol on h2o2 and organics degradation the removals of h2o2 and organics were determined as functions of the chloride ion ace sac and cyc concentrations a buffer was omitted to avoid interferences with the corrosion chemistry and degradation reactions the degradation of h2o2 and ace at ph 6 5 0 5 unbuffered fig s2 was studied in the presence of 500 mg l zvi 10 mm initial h2o2 and cl concentrations ranging from 0 mm to 10 mm the normalized concentration profiles c co of h2o2 and ace are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively only ace data are discussed because ace sac and cyc behaved nearly identically fig s3 in the absence of cl the degradation of both h2o2 and ace was too slow to be quantified less than 2 removal in 90 min indicating that an electrolyte was required for zvi corrosion r 1 5 and h2o2 activation via r 2 1 to reach an observable level increasing cl up to approximately 1 2 mm increased the removal rates of h2o2 and ace to a saturation level fig 1c and d respectively the correlation between the h2o2 and ace degradation up to the cl saturation level is shown in fig s4 the close correlation is consistent with a mechanism by which the corrosion of zvi by h2o2 generates fe2 aq which in turn stimulates ace degradation via the fenton reaction chloride ions were previously demonstrated to accelerate cathodic reductive transformation of organic electron acceptors by zvi gotpagar et al 1999 hernandez et al 2004 the lag in the decay of h2o2 could have been caused by slow removal of the passivizing oxide layer and the formation of pits a process that can be suppressed by the addition of phosphate ions refaey et al 2000 the kinetics data are summarized in table s3 the hypothesis that ace reacted with oh was supported by the observation that both tbuoh and meoh completely blocked the transformation of ace fig s5b based on the observation that tbuoh selectively quenches oh and meoh quenches both oh and the less reactive ferryl fe iv keenan and sedlak 2008 the observation that radical scavengers did not affect h2o2 decomposition fig s5a suggested that quenching of oh r 2 5 did not significantly contribute to h2o2 removal 3 2 evidence for pitting corrosion and rust formation sem images of zvi before 0 min and after 90 min treatment with h2o2 and 1 mm cl fig s6 demonstrate pitting and increased specific sa fig s6b the increased sa explains the increased h2o2 and organics decomposition rates xrd spectra were acquired to identify the predominant rust components formed via r 3 1 to 3 5 the only two peaks detected in spectra obtained before and after 90 min reaction time were 2θ 44 7 and 65 0 fig s7a indicating that fe0 was the major solid component detectable quantities of rust were formed in a 24 h oxidation experiment whereby 10 mm hydrogen peroxide was re spiked 4 times to a reaction mixture containing 10 mm cl the characteristic peaks detected after the extended treatment were 2θ 30 3 35 4 57 2 and 62 7 fig s7b which were consistent with the formation of magnetite fe3o4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh huang and zhang 2006 kanel et al 2005 wu et al 2015 3 3 mechanism of h2o2 and organic compound degradation to examine whether ace was degraded by ros produced by the fenton reaction r 2 1 fe2 aq was complexed by amending the reaction mixture with 2 2 bipyridine bpy bpy blocked the fenton reaction without interfering with the corrosion chemistry of zvi katsoyiannis et al 2008 fig 2 a and b shows respectively the degradation of h2o2 and ace in reaction mixtures containing 500 mg l and 5000 mg l zvi without and with the presence of 5 mm of bpy the h2o2 degradation rates were not significantly affected by bpy suggesting that h2o2 decomposition occurred primarily via reduction by zvi r 1 5 yoshino and kawase 2013 who studied contaminant degradation at ph 3 attributed h2o2 decomposition to the homogeneous fenton reaction perhaps this discrepancy is due to the fact that at ph 3 fe2 aq is more present at higher concentrations than in our experiment ph 6 5 0 5 the measured soluble iron concentrations during the reactions ranged from 0 to 0 4 mg l by contrast the fe2 aq concentration reported by yoshino and kawase during the reaction ranged from 0 to 320 mg l and was similar to that of h2o2 yoshino and kawase 2013 in the presence of 5 mm bpy the degradation of ace in the presence of bpy was almost completely inhibited ace degradation did not occur within 90 min whereas approximately 50 was degraded in the absence of bpy consistent with bpy blocking the homogeneous fenton process r 2 1 and indicating that ace was degraded by fenton generated oh r 2 1 the potential importance of the heterogeneous fenton reaction on the h2o2 decomposition was assessed by evaluating the reactivity of pre oxidized zvi pre oxidized zvi was prepared by treating zvi in 10 mm h2o2 and 1 mm cl for 90 min the treatment formed pits and generated iron oxides h2o2 decomposition was determined in the presence of 500 mg l pre oxidized zvi with and without 1 mm cl the pre oxidized zvi without cl present decomposed only 19 of the initial h2o2 within 90 min compared to nearly 0 in metallic zvi fig 3 this result suggests that pre oxidized zvi was more active than untreated zvi which was practically non reactive in the absence of chloride the degradation of 19 h2o2 by pre oxidized zvi was attributed to the heterogeneous fenton reaction at the iron oxyhydroxide surfaces r 4 1 4 4 huang et al 2001 kwan and voelker 2002 lin and gurol 1998 and cathodic decomposition r 1 5 in the pits created during pretreatment in the presence of 1 mm cl both pre oxidized zvi and untreated zvi transformed approximately 80 of h2o2 indicating that 1 mm cl was sufficient to dissolve the inhibitory deactivation layer on the bare zvi surface apparently in the presence of cl the heterogeneous fenton reaction term k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 in eq 3 contributed negligibly to the h2o2 decomposition the effect of iron oxide accumulation and the change in the surface activity of the zvi was studied by measuring the rates of h2o2 and ace removal during three sequential additions of h2o2 and ace removals were almost identical fig 4 except that there appeared to be a lag phase during the first 20 min during the first experiment the initial lag may have been due to the slow zvi activation thereafter the decomposition rates of h2o2 and ace remained constant table s4 the close correlation between the h2o2 and ace decomposition rates is consistent with a mechanism whereby the degradation of h2o2 and formation of fe2 aq r 1 1 control the homogeneous fenton reaction r 2 1 the fact that the ace degradation remained constant excluding initial lag phase in the 1st spike despite the accumulation of rust indicated that the heterogeneous fenton reaction term k h e t e r o f e o h h 2 o 2 in eq 5 contributed negligibly to ace degradation moreover the rates of h2o2 degradation by aged 2nd and 3rd spike were nearly equal to fresh 1st spike zvi suggesting that zvi passivation due to coating by iron oxide was prevented at the zvi cl ratio employed in this experiment 500 mg mm and cl can possibly be used for reactivating aged oxide coated zvi liu et al 2013 bet data indicated that during the first 20 min fig 5 zvi exposed to 10 mm h2o2 and cl rapidly increased the mesoporous 2 50 nm sa from 0 to 5 05 m2 g this observation indicates the generation of pits and surface roughness sa formation continued and after 22 h reached 16 01 m2 g fig 5 insert this observation is consistent with a two stage rate law of h2o2 decomposition first an initial lag followed by pseudo first order by contrast for the degradation of 4 chlorophenol by zvi h2o2 at ph 4 two sequential first order processes were reported zhou et al 2008 these authors attributed the slow initial phase to zvi surface reactions and the faster second stage to homogeneous solution reactions in summary in the presence of sufficient chloride the dominant decomposition mechanism of h2o2 is proposed to be via cathodic reduction eq 3 according to 6 d h 2 o 2 d t k c a t h f e 0 h 2 o 2 where f e 0 represents the reactive sa reactive sa are generated by chloride through pitting after the lag phase the number of f e 0 sites gradually stabilize and the decomposition follows pseudo first order kinetics the finding that ace degradation is dominated by classical fenton reaction allows us to simplify eq 5 as eq 7 7 o h s s k h o m o f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 k o h i s i which indicates that oh ss and the rate of ace degradation are controlled by h2o2 fe2 and si 3 4 the effect of the initial h2o2 and zvi concentrations on h2o2 and ace degradation experiments were carried out to evaluate h2o2 and ace degradation as a function of the h2o2 and zvi concentrations in the presence of 10 mm cl the cl concentration was approximately 50 times above the catalytic saturation concentration fig 1 results are presented intable s5 s6 and figs 6 7 over h2o2 0 ranging from 2 to 10 mm the pseudo first order rate constants varied narrowly 0 0211 0 0237 min 1 at h2o2 0 ranging from 15 mm to 50 mm a lag phase was noted that increased to 30 min and the ace degradation rate k obs increased from 0 007 to 0 0121 min 1 as the initial h2o2 concentration increased from 2 to 15 mm fig 6 b and c at approximately 15 mm h2o2 a saturation point was reached perhaps due to oh quenching by h2o2 li and zhu 2014 wang et al 2016 fig 7a and b shows the effect of the zvi concentration on the decomposition of h2o2 and ace respectively at varying zvi 0 5000 mg l ph 6 5 0 5 10 mm cl and 10 mm h2o2 0 at low zvi concentrations 250 500 and 1000 mg l degradation of h2o2 approximated zero order kinetics after short lag phases most distinct for 250 mg l zvi at 2000 and 5000 mg l zvi concentrations h2o2 degradation approximated first order kinetics the transition from zero to first order kinetics is consistent with langmuir kinetics whereby at high h2o2 zvi all reactive sa are occupied by h2o2 under these conditions the h2o2 transformation rate represents the intrinsic reaction rate i e the rate with which the surface complex f e 0 h 2 o 2 reacts to fe2 r 1 5 at high h2o2 zvi the rate is limited by the total number of reactive sa f e 0 available for binding of h2o2 resulting in zero order kinetics at low h2o2 zvi the number of sites occupied by h2o2 is proportional h2o2 resulting in first order kinetics the degradation of ace fig 6b generally was pseudo first order perhaps because ace interacted only weakly with the zvi surface 3 5 the competing effects of phosphate and chloride ions the opposing effects of cl and phosphate ions on the h2o2 and ace decomposition were studied by quantifying decomposition as a function of the total phosphate ion concentration po4 tot at fixed cl 10 mm fig 8 and as a function of the cl ion concentration in the absence and presence of 1 mm phosphate fig 9 results indicating the inhibitory effect of phosphate ions are shown in fig 8a b fig s8 a b and table s7 without the presence of chloride degradation of h2o2 and ace was not observed as indicated in fig 8a and b k obs h2o2 and k obs ace exponentially decreased with increasing po4 tot similar results were previously reported for the removal of as v and as iii by zvi su and puls 2001 and explained with strong inner sphere surface complexes that sorb to mineral surface fig 9a and b fig s9 a b and table s7 show the results of h2o2 and ace degradation at constant po4 tot 0 1 mm and 1 0 mm h2o2 0 10 mm and cl varying from 0 to 50 mm increasing cl from 0 1 mm to approximately 4 mm increased k obs h2o2 from 0 0002 to a plateau at 0 004 min 1 in the absence of phosphate k obs h2o2 was approximately 6 times higher ace degradation increased gradually up to approximately 20 mm cl plateauing at 0 0102 min 1 approximately the same level as without phosphate this result suggested that the chloride ions were not able to displace phosphate from the zvi surface and to promote corrosion even at high cl concentrations by contrast sufficiently high chloride concentration fully restored the rate of oh formation even in the presence of phosphate 3 6 the stoichiometric efficiency as a function of reaction conditions the se eq 1 was evaluated as a function of cl zvi h2o2 0 and po4 tot after 90 min exposure fig 10 a c se decreased with increasing cl zvi and h2o2 0 fig 10a b and c respectively to a constant value whereas se increased exponentially with increasing po4 tot fig 10d the highest se values were observed at low cl and h2o2 fig 10 a and c respectively and high po4 tot fig 10 d concentrations and ranged from 0 0008 to 0 014 under these conditions the number of reactive sa and the corrosion rate of zvi were relatively small apparently accelerating corrosion accelerated h2o2 decomposition to a greater extent than ace decomposition perhaps h2o2 was consumed rapidly in non radical forming reactions or oh scavenging was more significant at the higher corrosion rate fe2 aq required to form oh via r 2 1 is also presumably low because it is consumed by rust forming reactions r 3 1 3 5 previous studies also reported that se decreased with the increased sa with iron oxide as the catalyst huang et al 2001 valentine and ann wang 1998 3 7 reactions in surface water and sea water and environmental implications to evaluate the implications of this zvi h2o2 reactions in the environmental relevant conditions the degradation of h2o2 and ace by the zvi was studied in filtered 0 45 μm and unfiltered urban surface water samples collected from a catchment cm a main water body mw and coastal seawater of singapore an experiment in di water was included as a control the water quality data of the three water samples are shown in table s8 and the h2o2 and ace degradation data are shown is fig s10a b because reactions in the surface water samples were too slow to be observed samples were augmented with 10 mm cl phosphate was not detected or extremely low 2 8 μg l in cw in all cases and significant inhibition by phosphate was not expected doc concentrations ranged from 1 0 mg l for seawater to 2 9 mg l for mw and exceeded the initial ace concentration 100 μg l the degradation rates of h2o2 in mw cw and seawater were similar with the exception of the filtered seawater which was slightly faster and approximately as fast as di water these results suggest that the rate of h2o2 decomposition was largely controlled by the catalytic effect of chloride ions across all environmental water samples although seawater contained 555 mm cl the h2o2 decomposition rate of filtered seawater did not differ markedly from augmented di water since cl was at saturation level fig s10 the h2o2 decomposition rate was slightly higher in the filtered seawater as compared to unfiltered suggesting that seawater particles and dissolved organic carbon doc may have some inhibition effect on cathodic reduction of h2o2 in contrast to the h2o2 decomposition the ace decomposition was significantly slower in mw cm and seawater than in in the di water indicating oh quenching in unfiltered and filtered seawater ace was degraded by 16 and 23 respectively significantly lower than in the freshwater samples 30 37 the slower degradation observed in seawater may have been caused by chloride and bromide ions scavenging oh de laat and le 2006 which is noticeable above 10 mm at ph 2 8 pignatello et al 2006 or due to the complexation of fe2 aq with chelating agents such as marine siderophores van den berg 1995 the slower degradation of ace in mw and cm compared to di could stem from doc quenching oh or complexing fe2 aq pignatello et al 2006 comparing the data in di water and the surface water samples suggested that concentrations of 1 3 mg l of doc were sufficient to inhibit the decomposition of ace and the inhibition effect was more significant on ace than h2o2 decomposition in seawater which contains abundant cl the h2o2 decomposition was approximately as rapid as in 10 mm di water suggesting the saturation effect of cl may also apply to environmental water bodies in spite of the fast corrosion rate organic compound degradation was slower likely due to oh quenching by environmental scavengers or iron complexation 4 summary and conclusions the reactions considered potentially significant during the corrosion of zvi by h2o2 and the reactions identified to contribute most to the degradation of h2o2 and the formation of oh are indicated in fig 11 kinetic data indicated that the principal decomposition reaction of h2o2 during the early stages of zvi corrosion at neutral ph 6 5 0 5 was the cathodic reduction at the metallic zvi surface r 1 4 coupled to anodic oxidation of fe 0 r 1 1 anodic oxidation of zvi consumes h2o2 and generates fe2 aq the latter activates h2o2 via the fenton reaction and forms oh which is the principal agent degrading organic compounds r 2 1 chloride ions accelerated the decomposition of h2o2 by inducing pitting corrosion and accelerating the anodic dissolution of fe0 s after an initial lag phase h2o2 decomposition followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics at low h2o2 zvi ratio 0 04 mm mg and zero order reaction kinetics at high h2o2 zvi ratio 0 04 mm mg phosphate ions inhibited h2o2 degradation even in the presence of cl ions inhibition by phosphate ions was attributed to their strong interactions with the reactive surface sites of zvi f e 0 presumably an insoluble iron phosphate layer or strongly adsorbed phosphate ions blocked the reactive sites on the zvi surface and prevented the generation of fe2 aq therefore inhibiting ace degradation by the fenton reaction the two mechanisms are difficult to discern without further analyses both phosphate inhibition and cl catalysis exhibited saturation effects the se of ace degradation ranged from 0 0008 to 0 014 and was inversely correlated with the h2o2 decomposition rate additional studies are required to generalize the findings

19692,different conductive materials have been employed to stimulate direct interspecies electron transfer diet during methanogenesis but few studies have been concerned with the interaction between conductive materials and extracellular polymeric substances eps such as the effect on sludge aggregation and redox activity of eps this study aims to systematically investigate the role of red mud with 45 46 wt hematite on methanogenesis during the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge the results showed that the multivalent cations from hematite effectively promoted the formation of large and compact aggregates which might contribute to the rapid direct electron exchange during the diet process meanwhile more redox active mediators including c type cytochromes c cyts and humic substances particularly in tight bound eps tb eps and more redox active metals such as fe introduced by red mud could take part in the interspecies electron transfer process between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which also promoted methane production 35 52 2 64 increase compared with the control this study provided initial scientific evidence to comprehensively assess the role of conductive materials during methanogenesis with important implications for the biogeochemical redox processes of conductive minerals in natural and engineered environments graphical abstract

diet has biogeochemical significance and practical applications with unique advantages such as high electron transfer efficiency and energy utilization efficiency smith et al 2015 extracellular polymeric substances eps could store electrochemically active substances such as c type cytochromes c cyts xiao et al 2017 which has been reported to be able to improve the diet process zhang et al 2017b eps are natural high molecular weight polymers excreted by microorganisms accounting for 80 of the mass of activated sludge sheng et al 2010 because of the functional groups such as carboxyl phosphoric and hydroxyl groups eps can promote the formation of microbial aggregates which is beneficial to cooperative actions such as diet involved in the syntrophic anaerobic metabolism mostafa 2012 morita et al 2011 in a complex environment such as an anaerobic sludge treatment system the excretion of eps could be influenced by the external conditions badireddy et al 2008 priester et al 2006 in recent years conductive materials have been demonstrated to act as the solid conduits for stimulating direct electron transfer and methane production zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2012a however most studies focused mainly on improving the conductivity of anaerobic systems and the effects of conductive materials on the excretion of eps in the complex matrix remain unclear furthermore little is known about the interactions between conductive materials and eps such as the effects of conductive materials on the redox activity of eps and sludge aggregation better understanding of these interactions will help with comprehensive assessment of the role of conductive materials during methanogenesis a representative conductive material of interest to diet is iron based material such as hematite fe2o3 which is a major constituent in red mud with a content ranging from 7 wt to 65 wt freire et al 2012 red mud is a by product generated from the alumina refining of bauxite ore ye et al 2014 2015 the annual worldwide growth rate of red mud has significantly increased leading to severe environmental disasters such as river pollution haze generation and land contamination hua et al 2017 the reuse of red mud has drawn considerable research attention liu et al 2012b smičiklas et al 2014 our previous study demonstrated that methanogenesis was enhanced by red mud with the simultaneous improvement of hydrolysis acidification and electron transfer processes furthermore the micro and macronutrients in red mud such as manganese and sodium were beneficial for the growth of microorganisms the relatively abundances of geobacter methanosaeta and methanosarcina increased after the addition of red mud ye et al 2018 previous researches demonstrated the occurrence of diet process during the growth of syntrophic bacteria geobacter and methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina rotaru et al 2014a b tang et al 2016 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2015 therefore diet process might also exist in the reactor with red mud this study aimed to further systematically explore the role of red mud in methanogenesis such as the formation of bioaggregates and the composition and redox properties of eps the critical roles of different components of eps and red mud in the interspecies electron transfer and methane production were explored this work is expected to provide a new insight into the functions of eps in anaerobic digestion and the possible application of red mud to improve sludge digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bayer red mud with a hematite content of 45 46 wt table s1 was obtained from shandong aluminum industry corporation in shandong china the primary particles of red mud ranged from 50 to 300 μm with a d50 value of 123 2 4 5 μm fig s1a the inoculum sludge was collected from a laboratory scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor in our laboratory waste activated sludge was obtained from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant fuzhou china as substrate fresh waste activated sludge was thickened by gravity settling and then stored at 4 c for later use the characteristics of waste activated sludge were as follows total

conducted in 250 ml anaerobic serum bottles that contained 10 ml sludge inocula and 90 ml substrate red mud was dosed into the bottles in different amounts 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g the bottles were kept at 35 c for 32 days in a constant temperature incubator to maintain strict anaerobic conditions all bottles were sealed with teflon coated rubber and aluminum crimp caps after being bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 min at a rate of 5 ml min to remove oxygen zhuang et al 2015 the control reactors without the addition of red mud were operated under the same condition the samples for eps analysis were obtained on day 0 day 7 day 14 day 21 and day 28 from the selected reactors and the methods for eps extraction including soluble eps seps loose bound eps lb eps and tight bound eps tb eps followed the method reported previously zhang et al 2016 all experiments were conducted in biological triplicate differences were evaluated using student s t test and a p value 0 01 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of red mud and sludge samples were detected using an x ray diffractometer xrd 6000 shimadzu japan with cu kα radiation at 40 kv

concentrations of tcod scod ts and volatile suspended solids vss of sludge were measured following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha et al 2005 the methane content in biogas was determined using an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the size distribution of bioaggregates was measured by a laser particle size analysis system and analyzed with the volume curve mastersizer 3000 malvern uk multiple fluorescent staining and imaging of the samples followed the method described by chen et al 2007 with a zeiss lsm 880 confocal microscope carl zeiss jena germany contributions of different components of eps to the sludge aggregation were evaluated with the flocculation experiments according to hou et al 2015 the zeta potentials of red mud and eps were measured using a nanobrook omni analyzer nano brook omni brookhaven us polysaccharide and protein concentrations were measured using the anthrone method loewus 1952 and bca protein assay kit thermo scientific pierce respectively the concentration of total organic carbon toc was quantified with a toc analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the concentration of humic substances was measured using the method reported by frølund et al 1995 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3 deem spectra were obtained using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer g9800a agilent technologies usa with an excitation range from 210 to 400 nm in 10 nm sampling increments and an emission range from 290 to 550 nm in 10 nm sampling intervals the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 1200 nm min the spectra were then analyzed using the parallel factor analysis parafac algorithm to quantitatively determine the components of fluorophores the scores from the first loading of parafac model were also obtained these scores were based on the signal intensities of components presented in each sample and were expressed as fmax values eps was electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry cv at a scan rate of 0 1 v s yang et al 2017 a chronoamperometry measurement was performed to quantify the electron accepting capacity qeac and electron donating capacity qedc of eps according to yu et al 2015 an improved staining procedure was utilized to detect the cytochrome content in different eps fractions thomas et al 1976 uv vis spectroscopy uv 2600 shimadzu japan in a diffuse transmission mode was employed to measure the electronic absorption spectra of the multi heme c cyts in different eps fractions nakamura et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 red mud increased the methane production the effect of red mud on methane production during the sludge anaerobic digestion was investigated and it was observed that methane production increased with the increase of red mud dosage fig 1 after a period of 32 days the maximum methane accumulation of 1 41 0 02 mmol g vss was obtained in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l which was 35 52 2 64 higher than that in the control reactor the higher methane accumulation in the red mud reactor could be attributed to the improved hydrolysis acidification process by red mud ye et al 2018 in the control reactor tcod decreased from 30 15 0 55 to 19 49 0 48 g l after 32 days digestion in contrast tcod in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l reached 14 35 0 32 g l indicating that the addition of red mud could enhance the solubilization of organic matters for methanogenesis in the initial incubation period of methanogenic culture the methane accumulation in the control reactor was slightly higher than that in the red mud reactor it was probably partly because that the microorganisms needed a certain time to adapt the environmental change caused by external substances lópez maury et al 2008 more importantly fe iii reduction by fe iii reducing microorganisms was a more favorable electron sink for the acetate oxidation at the initial stage of anaerobic digestion in the red mud reactor which diverted the electron flow from methane production compared with the control reactor hori et al 2010 however it was found that only a small amount of hematite took part in the fe iii reduction according to the increase of fe ii concentration in the solution fig s2 this may be because that the hematite had high crystallinity and low solubility lovley and phillips 1988 so methanogens became the predominant electron accepting organisms after the fe iii reduction the existence of conductive hematite might have promoted the diet between the syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which improved the methane production rate 3 2 red mud promoted the formation of bioaggregates because red mud had larger size than the sludge its addition changed the size distribution of bioaggregates in the anaerobic digestion system after the addition of red mud with a dosage of 20 g l the percentage of bioaggregates that smaller than 100 0 μm was statistically lower than that in the control reactor while the percentage of bioaggregates larger than 100 0 μm increased the d50 value of bioaggregates in the red mud reactor reached 106 2 3 8 μm which was higher than that of raw sludge 85 3 1 3 μm fig s1a the size of bioaggregates first increased with the prolonging of anaerobic digestion the percentage of bioaggregates larger than 100 0 μm increased from 43 6 1 6 to 69 6 1 2 in the control reactor and from 53 2 2 9 to 74 1 1 7 in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l after 14 days of anaerobic digestion fig s1 as shown in fig 2 a the formation of bioaggregates was promoted by red mud the diameter d50 of bioaggregates in the red mud reactor 169 5 1 3 μm was higher than that in the control reactor 139 1 0 9 μm on day 14 however the diameter d50 of bioaggregates decreased to 125 4 3 1 and 118 5 5 3 μm in the control reactor and red mud reactor on day 28 respectively this decrease might be caused by the degradation of eps as energy sources under the conditions of nutrient shortage thereby resulting in the disassembly of bioaggregates particularly it could be found that the decrease of the particle size was more pronounced in the red mud reactor than that in the control reactor which might be the reason why more methane was produced after the addition of red mud confocal laser scanning microscope clsm microscopy was employed together with multiple fluorescent staining to investigate the role of red mud in the formation of bioaggregates as shown in fig 2c protein b d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids were uniformly distributed in the control bioaggregates and an interwoven meshwork in the matrix was constructed supporting the bioaggregates architecture in contrast the bioaggregates with red mud had a more compact structure proteins b d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids in the bioaggregates with red mud accumulated at the outer layer of granules which could act as a protective barrier for the agglomerated microorganisms against the harsh environment induced by the red mud similar phenomena were also reported by li et al 2015 where single wall carbon nanotube was utilized to promote the anaerobic digestion process and more epss were produced to reduce the cytotoxicity of single wall carbon nanotube by preventing these nanoparticles from piercing into cells eps can play an important role in maintaining the stability of bioaggregates liu et al 2010 after the addition of red mud the zeta potential of eps changed from 21 11 0 35 mv to 13 85 0 56 mv the decreased negative charge would weaken the electrical repulsion compress the double electrode layer and then promote the cell to cell interaction and granulation si et al 2014 zhang and angelidaki 2015 the isoelectric point iep of red mud is crucial which indicates the surface charges on the red mud particles the iep of red mud reached 7 32 from the zeta potential curve fig s3 on day 14 the ph value of red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l 7 14 was lower than the iep suggesting that the red mud was positively charged the positive charges reacted with the eps components through chelation and ionic bonds which might significantly affect sludge morphology and structure yan et al 2015 fe was the main element on the surface of red mud 30 98 fig s4 indicating that fe iii and fe ii contributed the most to the great bioaggregates stability due to its high charge valence li et al 2012 also demonstrated that multivalent especially trivalent cations possessed a high binding affinity for activated sludge and resulted in strong activated sludge flocs and large sludge particle sizes because the rapid direct electron exchange is the primary mechanism for electron exchange in the bioaggregates the accelerated formation of microbial bioaggregates with red mud would contribute to the high electron transfer efficiency and then improve the performance of anaerobic digestion lovley 2017 the effects of eps main compositions on the flocculation efficiency of sludge were also investigated as shown in fig 2b after the extraction of polysaccharides polysaccharides group the flocculation efficiency of bioaggregates did not change significantly it demonstrated that polysaccharides might did not play an important role on the stability of bioaggregates in contrast after the extraction of proteins proteins group the flocculation efficiency of bioaggregates decreased from 79 10 2 65 to 49 31 3 04 and from 81 20 3 11 to 47 56 3 87 in the control reactor and red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l respectively meanwhile compared with adding the eps with polysaccharides back adding the eps with proteins back effectively recovered the flocculation efficiency in both reactors indicating the crucial role of proteins on the flocculation process it was possibly because that the amino group of proteins contained the positive charge which could neutralize the negative charged functional groups in sludge and improve the aggregation process hou et al 2015 li et al 2012 3 3 red mud enhanced the excretion of eps as shown in fig 3 the addition of red mud 20 g l significantly promoted the excretion of eps in the first 14 days the maximum concentrations of polysaccharides proteins humic substances and toc in the red mud reactor reached 21 68 2 28 103 45 5 52 62 92 2 67 and 81 50 3 46 mg g vss respectively and were higher than that in the control reactor particularly the change in tb eps was more significant than the change in seps and lb eps the increase in polysaccharides humic substances and protein in tb eps reached 51 71 3 61 49 42 1 39 and 80 01 0 94 respectively these results were consistent with the results reported by wang et al 2014 in which the increase of tb eps was more than the increase in lb eps when hexavalent chromium was added into an aerobic granular sequencing batch reactor you et al 2015 also found that the production of tb eps increased by 38 98 when the biofilm was exposed to ceo2 at a dosage of 50 mg l higher than the production of lb eps 27 67 the eps concentrations decreased as the anaerobic digestion proceeded in both reactors fig 3 because the major components of eps i e proteins and polysaccharides could be biodegraded as a promising carbon and energy source for cell growth during the nutrient shortage zhang and bishop 2003 similarly jia et al 1996 found that the eps content increased during the exponential phase of bacterial growth and decreased during the stationary phase strikingly the concentration of humic substances also decreased in this research the humic substances are normally considered as the recalcitrant components that cannot be effectively degraded by microorganisms hayakawa and nonomura 1987 hertkorn et al 2002 indicated that the microbial degradation of humic substances was determined by the combination of microbial population the structure of humic substances and the composition of culture medium three dimensional eem spectroscopy showed three peaks located at ex em of 280 285 300 360 nm soluble microbial byproduct like substances 220 225 300 350 nm protein like substances and 220 240 370 420 nm fulvic acid like substances in the eps samples extracted from both reactors fig s5 the intensities of these peaks increased first and then decreased as the anaerobic digestion proceeded then parafac analysis was employed to obtain more information about the photochemical characterization three components were identified including the tyrosine like component component i ex em 220 280 300 li et al 2016 xu et al 2016 the tryptophan like and soluble microbial by product like component component ii ex em 220 280 350 yu et al 2010 chen et al 2003 and the humic like component component iii ex em 235 320 415 fig s6 jiang et al 2008 zhang et al 2017a the mean concentration scores for component i and component ii in both reactors increased first and then decreased meanwhile the component i and component ii in the eps extracted from the red mud reactor had higher mean concentration scores than that in the control reactor which was in agreement with the conclusions from fig 3 in addition the decrease in mean concentration scores for component iii in tb eps was more significant than that in seps and lb eps suggesting that the humic like component in tb eps was more susceptible to the microbial utilization 3 4 red mud improved the redox property of eps as shown in fig 4 both eac and edc of eps increased first and then decreased as the anaerobic digestion proceeded compared with the control reactor the electron exchange capacity of eps was higher in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l the highest eac and edc of eps in the red mud reactor reached 0 27 0 01 μmol e g vss and 0 36 0 01 μmol e g vss on day 14 respectively much higher than those values in the control reactor in addition the contribution of tb eps to the electron exchange capacity was more than the contribution of lb eps and seps in both reactors particularly in the red mud reactor the contribution of tb eps to the electron exchange capacity reached 36 24 45 14 the cv experiments were conducted to further characterize the redox reaction in tb eps it has been reported that the more rectangular the cv shape the better the capacitive behavior of samples was liu et al 2006 as shown in fig 4c and d the capacitances of tb eps increased first and then decreased with the prolonging of anaerobic digestion process in both reactors meanwhile the red mud effectively promoted the increase in tb eps this finding was in line with the analysis of electron exchange capacity of tb eps in addition both reactors showed the major redox system with formal potentials of 0 25 v e 1 and 0 80 v e 2 fig s7 these peaks were assigned to the c cyts which are important for interspecies electron transfer jain et al 2011 meanwhile the occurrence of new minor redox peak at 0 45 v e 3 in the red mud reactor which was speculated to the oxidation of phenol group in aromatic compounds sousa et al 2004 was earlier than that in the control reactor the results also demonstrated that the red mud accelerated the hydrolysis acidification process 3 5 eps components linked to redox activity and methanogenic performance both edc and eac had a good linear correlation with the concentration of proteins r2 0 75 as supported by the correlations between the content and electron exchange capacity eac and edc of different fractions of eps in both reactors fig s8 various c cyts are important components of microbial activity during the anaerobic respiration which take part in the electron transfer reaction shi et al 2016 the eps with the highest edc and eac extracted from both reactors on day 14 was selected to investigate the abundance of c cyts in different eps fractions the prominent bands of cytochromes in tb eps were much higher than those in the lb eps and seps fig 5 a suggesting its higher abundance although the exact kinds of c cyts are difficult to be distinguished because of the complex anaerobic sludge digestion it is universally acknowledged that a higher concentration of c cyts is beneficial to the electron transfer okamoto et al 2014 the high abundance of c cyts in tb eps was confirmed by the application of uv vis spectroscopy the spectra in fig 5b show that the tb eps had a stronger adsorption peak at 419 nm than seps and lb eps in both reactors which was attributed to the reduced hemes in c cyts nakamura et al 2009 furthermore a higher peak intensity of tb eps at 419 nm was found in the red mud reactor than that in the control reactor the results indicated that the red mud could promote the production of c cyts and the higher concentration of c cyts in tb eps might have contributed to its higher electron exchange capacity in contrast zhang et al 2017b showed a different conclusion that c cyts concentration was about 40 lower in the medium supplemented with granular activated carbon gac than that in the control medium it should be pointed out that the proteins extracted for c cyts analysis in both studies were different total protein was extracted by zhang et al 2017b with the cell disruption method while in this study only the protein in tb eps was selected for the c cyts analysis in addition the opposite conclusion may be due to the effect of different conductive materials on the microbial growth compared with gac the micro and macronutrients in red mud such as manganese and sodium might be beneficial for the growth of microorganisms which led to more c cyts production in eps the exact reason should be investigated in the further research edc and eac were also positively correlated with the concentration of humic substances r2 0 75 fig s8 possibly related to the concentration of redox active groups of quinones in humic substances as effective electron exchanging moieties aeschbacher et al 2009 jiang and kappler 2008 demonstrated that humic acids in sludge significantly influenced the redox transformation of arsenic in wastewater a similar conclusion was reported that the addition of humic acid improved both the reduction of total volatile fatty acids and the production of methane during thermophilic anaerobic treatment of piggery wastewater ho and ho 2012 fe is very redox active and can form an outer sphere complex with humic substances an insoluble fe humic acid complex was demonstrated to function as a solid phase electron mediator zhang et al 2014 therefore the high concentration of fe on the surface of red mud might have allowed fe to participate in electron transfer and produce additional redox active sites in humic substances thereby enhancing the role of humic substances as electron shuttles the sum of eac and edc values which is defined as the electron exchange capacity eec indicates the total number of redox active mediators rams in a sample a linear correlation was observed between the change in eec and the change in methane accumulation r 2 0 7053 p 0 0056 fig s9 in addition to c cyts and quinones in humic substances redox active metals on the surface of red mud e g fe are also redox active moieties responsible for the methane production the fe ii concentration in the red mud reactor first increased and then decreased indicating the occurrence of secondary mineralization fig s2 specifically fe ii concentration reached the highest value at day 14 1 51 0 02 mmol which then reduced to about 0 80 0 04 mmol at day 28 compared with the fe iii content in hematite it was found that only 6 24 of hematite took part in the secondary mineralization process the xrd patterns confirmed the formation of conductive magnetite during the anaerobic digestion although the relative intensities of the main mineral compositions of bayer red mud such as hematite aluminum oxide quartz rutile and gibbsite almost kept unchanged fig s10 these results were in accordance with the results reported by a previous study jiang et al 2013 which showed that the transformation of fe iii fe ii during anaerobic digestion affected the methanogenesis in conclusion the methane production rate was positively correlated with the eps contents in both reactors with and without red mud this is because the eps contained the c cyts and rams that influenced the interspecies electron transfer pathway after the addition of red mud the increased c cyts concentration and the formation of large and compact bioaggregates might have promoted the rapid direct electron exchange between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea through the diet process in addition more rams in eps such as humic substances and redox active fe induced by red mud addition could also take part in the interspecies electron transfer process through the mediator pathway therefore the red mud was considered to be able to affect the interspecies electron transfer process through eps by two pathways during the methanogenesis see fig 6 however it should be pointed out that the existence of hematite resulted in a fe iii reduction process which would competed for the electron from the acetate oxidation the increased eps with high eec after the addition of red mud was served as the mediators for fe iii reducing microorganisms at the initial incubation stage of methanogenic culture therefore although a higher amount of eps was found in the red mud reactor the methane accumulation was lower than that in the control reactor at the initial 10 days 4 conclusion this study offered initial scientific evidence to comprehensively assess the role of conductive materials during methanogenesis the application of red mud as conductive solid conduits effectively promoted methane production with a 35 52 2 64 increase compared with the control suggesting a promising approach to effectively use red mud for anaerobic digestion of sludge in addition the results also provided valuable insights into the interaction between conductive materials and eps conductive materials such as hematite promoted the sludge granulation improved the redox property of eps and thus increased the electron transfer efficiency these results have important implications for the biogeochemical redox processes of conductive minerals in natural and engineered environments such as

19692,different conductive materials have been employed to stimulate direct interspecies electron transfer diet during methanogenesis but few studies have been concerned with the interaction between conductive materials and extracellular polymeric substances eps such as the effect on sludge aggregation and redox activity of eps this study aims to systematically investigate the role of red mud with 45 46 wt hematite on methanogenesis during the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge the results showed that the multivalent cations from hematite effectively promoted the formation of large and compact aggregates which might contribute to the rapid direct electron exchange during the diet process meanwhile more redox active mediators including c type cytochromes c cyts and humic substances particularly in tight bound eps tb eps and more redox active metals such as fe introduced by red mud could take part in the interspecies electron transfer process between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which also promoted methane production 35 52 2 64 increase compared with the control this study provided initial scientific evidence to comprehensively assess the role of conductive materials during methanogenesis with important implications for the biogeochemical redox processes of conductive minerals in natural and engineered environments graphical abstract

biological electrical contacts with partners and act as the foundation for the development of novel biotechnologies summers et al 2010 compared with the best known interspecies h2 formate transfer diet has biogeochemical significance and practical applications with unique advantages such as high electron transfer efficiency and energy utilization efficiency smith et al 2015 extracellular polymeric substances eps could store electrochemically active substances such as c type cytochromes c cyts xiao et al 2017 which has been reported to be able to improve the diet process zhang et al 2017b eps are natural high molecular weight polymers excreted by microorganisms accounting for 80 of the mass of activated sludge sheng et al 2010 because of the functional groups such as carboxyl phosphoric and hydroxyl groups eps can promote the formation of microbial aggregates which is beneficial to cooperative actions such as diet involved in the syntrophic anaerobic metabolism mostafa 2012 morita et al 2011 in a complex environment such as an anaerobic sludge treatment system the excretion of eps could be influenced by the external conditions badireddy et al 2008 priester et al 2006 in recent years conductive materials have been demonstrated to act as the solid conduits for stimulating direct electron transfer and methane production zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2012a however most studies focused mainly on improving the conductivity of anaerobic systems and the effects of conductive materials on the excretion of eps in the complex matrix remain unclear furthermore little is known about the interactions between conductive materials and eps such as the effects of conductive materials on the redox activity of eps and sludge aggregation better understanding of these interactions will help with comprehensive assessment of the role of conductive materials during methanogenesis a representative conductive material of interest to diet is iron based material such as hematite fe2o3 which is a major constituent in red mud with a content ranging from 7 wt to 65 wt freire et al 2012 red mud is a by product generated from the alumina refining of bauxite ore ye et al 2014 2015 the annual worldwide growth rate of red mud has significantly increased leading to severe environmental disasters such as river pollution haze generation and land contamination hua et al 2017 the reuse of red mud has drawn considerable research attention liu et al 2012b smičiklas et al 2014 our previous study demonstrated that methanogenesis was enhanced by red mud with the simultaneous improvement of hydrolysis acidification and electron transfer processes furthermore the micro and macronutrients in red mud such as manganese and sodium were beneficial for the growth of microorganisms the relatively abundances of geobacter methanosaeta and methanosarcina increased after the addition of red mud ye et al 2018 previous researches demonstrated the occurrence of diet process during the growth of syntrophic bacteria geobacter and methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina rotaru et al 2014a b tang et al 2016 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2015 therefore diet process might also exist in the reactor with red mud this study aimed to further systematically explore the role of red mud in methanogenesis such as the formation of bioaggregates and the composition and redox properties of eps the critical roles of different components of eps and red mud in the interspecies electron transfer and methane production were explored this work is expected to provide a new insight into the functions of eps in anaerobic digestion and the possible application of red mud to improve sludge digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bayer red mud with a hematite content of 45 46 wt table s1 was obtained from shandong aluminum industry corporation in shandong china the primary particles of red mud ranged from 50 to 300 μm with a d50 value of 123 2 4 5 μm fig s1a the inoculum sludge was collected from a laboratory scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor in our laboratory waste activated sludge was obtained from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant fuzhou china as substrate fresh waste activated sludge was thickened by gravity settling and then stored at 4 c for later use the characteristics of waste activated sludge were as follows total

conducted in 250 ml anaerobic serum bottles that contained 10 ml sludge inocula and 90 ml substrate red mud was dosed into the bottles in different amounts 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g the bottles were kept at 35 c for 32 days in a constant temperature incubator to maintain strict anaerobic conditions all bottles were sealed with teflon coated rubber and aluminum crimp caps after being bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 min at a rate of 5 ml min to remove oxygen zhuang et al 2015 the control reactors without the addition of red mud were operated under the same condition the samples for eps analysis were obtained on day 0 day 7 day 14 day 21 and day 28 from the selected reactors and the methods for eps extraction including soluble eps seps loose bound eps lb eps and tight bound eps tb eps followed the method reported previously zhang et al 2016 all experiments were conducted in biological triplicate differences were evaluated using student s t test and a p value 0 01 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of red mud and sludge samples were detected using an x ray diffractometer xrd 6000 shimadzu japan with cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 30 ma and recorded in a 2θ range of 5 70 at a scan speed range of 0 02 s the quantification of different minerals was obtained by a relative intensity ratio method the surface of red mud was imaged by the scanning electron microscopy sem phenom world bv eindhoven the netherlands and then mapped by energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edx 3600b skyray instrument inc braintree ma usa the concentrations of tcod scod ts and volatile suspended solids vss of sludge were measured following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha et al 2005 the methane content in biogas was determined using an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the size distribution of bioaggregates was measured by a laser particle size analysis system and analyzed with the volume curve mastersizer 3000 malvern uk multiple fluorescent staining and imaging of the samples followed the method described by chen et al 2007 with a zeiss lsm 880 confocal microscope carl zeiss jena germany contributions of different components of eps to the sludge aggregation were evaluated with the flocculation experiments according to hou et al 2015 the zeta potentials of red mud and eps were measured using a nanobrook omni analyzer nano brook omni brookhaven us polysaccharide and protein concentrations were measured using the anthrone method loewus 1952 and bca protein assay kit thermo scientific pierce respectively the concentration of total organic carbon toc was quantified with a toc analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the concentration of humic substances was measured using the method reported by frølund et al 1995 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3 deem spectra were obtained using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer g9800a agilent technologies usa with an excitation range from 210 to 400 nm in 10 nm sampling increments and an emission range from 290 to 550 nm in 10 nm sampling intervals the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 1200 nm min the spectra were then analyzed using the parallel factor analysis parafac algorithm to quantitatively determine the components of fluorophores the scores from the first loading of parafac model were also obtained these scores were based on the signal intensities of components presented in each sample and were expressed as fmax values eps was electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry cv at a scan rate of 0 1 v s yang et al 2017 a chronoamperometry measurement was performed to quantify the electron accepting capacity qeac and electron donating capacity qedc of eps according to yu et al 2015 an improved staining procedure was utilized to detect the cytochrome content in different eps fractions thomas et al 1976 uv vis spectroscopy uv 2600 shimadzu japan in a diffuse transmission mode was employed to measure the electronic absorption spectra of the multi heme c cyts in different eps fractions nakamura et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 red mud increased the methane production the effect of red mud on methane production during the sludge anaerobic digestion was investigated and it was observed that methane production increased with the increase of red mud dosage fig 1 after a period of 32 days the maximum methane accumulation of 1 41 0 02 mmol g vss was obtained in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l which was 35 52 2 64 higher than that in the control reactor the higher methane accumulation in the red mud reactor could be attributed to the improved hydrolysis acidification process by red mud ye et al 2018 in the control reactor tcod decreased from 30 15 0 55 to 19 49 0 48 g l after 32 days digestion in contrast tcod in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l reached 14 35 0 32 g l indicating that the addition of red mud could enhance the solubilization of organic matters for methanogenesis in the initial incubation period of methanogenic culture the methane accumulation in the control reactor was slightly higher than that in the red mud reactor it was probably partly because that the microorganisms needed a certain time to adapt the environmental change caused by external substances lópez maury et al 2008 more importantly fe iii reduction by fe iii reducing microorganisms was a more favorable electron sink for the acetate oxidation at the initial stage of anaerobic digestion in the red mud reactor which diverted the electron flow from methane production compared with the control reactor hori et al 2010 however it was found that only a small amount of hematite took part in the fe iii reduction according to the increase of fe ii concentration in the solution fig s2 this may be because that the hematite had high crystallinity and low solubility lovley and phillips 1988 so methanogens became the predominant electron accepting organisms after the fe iii reduction the existence of conductive hematite might have promoted the diet between the syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which improved the methane production rate 3 2 red mud promoted the formation of bioaggregates because red mud had larger size than the sludge its addition changed the size distribution of bioaggregates in the anaerobic digestion system after the addition of red mud with a dosage of 20 g l the percentage of bioaggregates that smaller than 100 0 μm was statistically lower than that in the control reactor while the percentage of bioaggregates larger than 100 0 μm increased the d50 value of bioaggregates in the red mud reactor reached 106 2 3 8 μm which was higher than that of raw sludge 85 3 1 3 μm fig s1a the size of bioaggregates first increased with the prolonging of anaerobic digestion the percentage of bioaggregates larger than 100 0 μm increased from 43 6 1 6 to 69 6 1 2 in the control reactor and from 53 2 2 9 to 74 1 1 7 in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l after 14 days of anaerobic digestion fig s1 as shown in fig 2 a the formation of bioaggregates was promoted by red mud the diameter d50 of bioaggregates in the red mud reactor 169 5 1 3 μm was higher than that in the control reactor 139 1 0 9 μm on day 14 however the diameter d50 of bioaggregates decreased to 125 4 3 1 and 118 5 5 3 μm in the control reactor and red mud reactor on day 28 respectively this decrease might be caused by the degradation of eps as energy sources under the conditions of nutrient shortage thereby resulting in the disassembly of bioaggregates particularly it could be found that the decrease of the particle size was more pronounced in the red mud reactor than that in the control reactor which might be the reason why more methane was produced after the addition of red mud confocal laser scanning microscope clsm microscopy was employed together with multiple fluorescent staining to investigate the role of red mud in the formation of bioaggregates as shown in fig 2c protein b d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids were uniformly distributed in the control bioaggregates and an interwoven meshwork in the matrix was constructed supporting the bioaggregates architecture in contrast the bioaggregates with red mud had a more compact structure proteins b d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids in the bioaggregates with red mud accumulated at the outer layer of granules which could act as a protective barrier for the agglomerated microorganisms against the harsh environment induced by the red mud similar phenomena were also reported by li et al 2015 where single wall carbon nanotube was utilized to promote the anaerobic digestion process and more epss were produced to reduce the cytotoxicity of single wall carbon nanotube by preventing these nanoparticles from piercing into cells eps can play an important role in maintaining the stability of bioaggregates liu et al 2010 after the addition of red mud the zeta potential of eps changed from 21 11 0 35 mv to 13 85 0 56 mv the decreased negative charge would weaken the electrical repulsion compress the double electrode layer and then promote the cell to cell interaction and granulation si et al 2014 zhang and angelidaki 2015 the isoelectric point iep of red mud is crucial which indicates the surface charges on the red mud particles the iep of red mud reached 7 32 from the zeta potential curve fig s3 on day 14 the ph value of red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l 7 14 was lower than the iep suggesting that the red mud was positively charged the positive charges reacted with the eps components through chelation and ionic bonds which might significantly affect sludge morphology and structure yan et al 2015 fe was the main element on the surface of red mud 30 98 fig s4 indicating that fe iii and fe ii contributed the most to the great bioaggregates stability due to its high charge valence li et al 2012 also demonstrated that multivalent especially trivalent cations possessed a high binding affinity for activated sludge and resulted in strong activated sludge flocs and large sludge particle sizes because the rapid direct electron exchange is the primary mechanism for electron exchange in the bioaggregates the accelerated formation of microbial bioaggregates with red mud would contribute to the high electron transfer efficiency and then improve the performance of anaerobic digestion lovley 2017 the effects of eps main compositions on the flocculation efficiency of sludge were also investigated as shown in fig 2b after the extraction of polysaccharides polysaccharides group the flocculation efficiency of bioaggregates did not change significantly it demonstrated that polysaccharides might did not play an important role on the stability of bioaggregates in contrast after the extraction of proteins proteins group the flocculation efficiency of bioaggregates decreased from 79 10 2 65 to 49 31 3 04 and from 81 20 3 11 to 47 56 3 87 in the control reactor and red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l respectively meanwhile compared with adding the eps with polysaccharides back adding the eps with proteins back effectively recovered the flocculation efficiency in both reactors indicating the crucial role of proteins on the flocculation process it was possibly because that the amino group of proteins contained the positive charge which could neutralize the negative charged functional groups in sludge and improve the aggregation process hou et al 2015 li et al 2012 3 3 red mud enhanced the excretion of eps as shown in fig 3 the addition of red mud 20 g l significantly promoted the excretion of eps in the first 14 days the maximum concentrations of polysaccharides proteins humic substances and toc in the red mud reactor reached 21 68 2 28 103 45 5 52 62 92 2 67 and 81 50 3 46 mg g vss respectively and were higher than that in the control reactor particularly the change in tb eps was more significant than the change in seps and lb eps the increase in polysaccharides humic substances and protein in tb eps reached 51 71 3 61 49 42 1 39 and 80 01 0 94 respectively these results were consistent with the results reported by wang et al 2014 in which the increase of tb eps was more than the increase in lb eps when hexavalent chromium was added into an aerobic granular sequencing batch reactor you et al 2015 also found that the production of tb eps increased by 38 98 when the biofilm was exposed to ceo2 at a dosage of 50 mg l higher than the production of lb eps 27 67 the eps concentrations decreased as the anaerobic digestion proceeded in both reactors fig 3 because the major components of eps i e proteins and polysaccharides could be biodegraded as a promising carbon and energy source for cell growth during the nutrient shortage zhang and bishop 2003 similarly jia et al 1996 found that the eps content increased during the exponential phase of bacterial growth and decreased during the stationary phase strikingly the concentration of humic substances also decreased in this research the humic substances are normally considered as the recalcitrant components that cannot be effectively degraded by microorganisms hayakawa and nonomura 1987 hertkorn et al 2002 indicated that the microbial degradation of humic substances was determined by the combination of microbial population the structure of humic substances and the composition of culture medium three dimensional eem spectroscopy showed three peaks located at ex em of 280 285 300 360 nm soluble microbial byproduct like substances 220 225 300 350 nm protein like substances and 220 240 370 420 nm fulvic acid like substances in the eps samples extracted from both reactors fig s5 the intensities of these peaks increased first and then decreased as the anaerobic digestion proceeded then parafac analysis was employed to obtain more information about the photochemical characterization three components were identified including the tyrosine like component component i ex em 220 280 300 li et al 2016 xu et al 2016 the tryptophan like and soluble microbial by product like component component ii ex em 220 280 350 yu et al 2010 chen et al 2003 and the humic like component component iii ex em 235 320 415 fig s6 jiang et al 2008 zhang et al 2017a the mean concentration scores for component i and component ii in both reactors increased first and then decreased meanwhile the component i and component ii in the eps extracted from the red mud reactor had higher mean concentration scores than that in the control reactor which was in agreement with the conclusions from fig 3 in addition the decrease in mean concentration scores for component iii in tb eps was more significant than that in seps and lb eps suggesting that the humic like component in tb eps was more susceptible to the microbial utilization 3 4 red mud improved the redox property of eps as shown in fig 4 both eac and edc of eps increased first and then decreased as the anaerobic digestion proceeded compared with the control reactor the electron exchange capacity of eps was higher in the red mud reactor with a dosage of 20 g l the highest eac and edc of eps in the red mud reactor reached 0 27 0 01 μmol e g vss and 0 36 0 01 μmol e g vss on day 14 respectively much higher than those values in the control reactor in addition the contribution of tb eps to the electron exchange capacity was more than the contribution of lb eps and seps in both reactors particularly in the red mud reactor the contribution of tb eps to the electron exchange capacity reached 36 24 45 14 the cv experiments were conducted to further characterize the redox reaction in tb eps it has been reported that the more rectangular the cv shape the better the capacitive behavior of samples was liu et al 2006 as shown in fig 4c and d the capacitances of tb eps increased first and then decreased with the prolonging of anaerobic digestion process in both reactors meanwhile the red mud effectively promoted the increase in tb eps this finding was in line with the analysis of electron exchange capacity of tb eps in addition both reactors showed the major redox system with formal potentials of 0 25 v e 1 and 0 80 v e 2 fig s7 these peaks were assigned to the c cyts which are important for interspecies electron transfer jain et al 2011 meanwhile the occurrence of new minor redox peak at 0 45 v e 3 in the red mud reactor which was speculated to the oxidation of phenol group in aromatic compounds sousa et al 2004 was earlier than that in the control reactor the results also demonstrated that the red mud accelerated the hydrolysis acidification process 3 5 eps components linked to redox activity and methanogenic performance both edc and eac had a good linear correlation with the concentration of proteins r2 0 75 as supported by the correlations between the content and electron exchange capacity eac and edc of different fractions of eps in both reactors fig s8 various c cyts are important components of microbial activity during the anaerobic respiration which take part in the electron transfer reaction shi et al 2016 the eps with the highest edc and eac extracted from both reactors on day 14 was selected to investigate the abundance of c cyts in different eps fractions the prominent bands of cytochromes in tb eps were much higher than those in the lb eps and seps fig 5 a suggesting its higher abundance although the exact kinds of c cyts are difficult to be distinguished because of the complex anaerobic sludge digestion it is universally acknowledged that a higher concentration of c cyts is beneficial to the electron transfer okamoto et al 2014 the high abundance of c cyts in tb eps was confirmed by the application of uv vis spectroscopy the spectra in fig 5b show that the tb eps had a stronger adsorption peak at 419 nm than seps and lb eps in both reactors which was attributed to the reduced hemes in c cyts nakamura et al 2009 furthermore a higher peak intensity of tb eps at 419 nm was found in the red mud reactor than that in the control reactor the results indicated that the red mud could promote the production of c cyts and the higher concentration of c cyts in tb eps might have contributed to its higher electron exchange capacity in contrast zhang et al 2017b showed a different conclusion that c cyts concentration was about 40 lower in the medium supplemented with granular activated carbon gac than that in the control medium it should be pointed out that the proteins extracted for c cyts analysis in both studies were different total protein was extracted by zhang et al 2017b with the cell disruption method while in this study only the protein in tb eps was selected for the c cyts analysis in addition the opposite conclusion may be due to the effect of different conductive materials on the microbial growth compared with gac the micro and macronutrients in red mud such as manganese and sodium might be beneficial for the growth of microorganisms which led to more c cyts production in eps the exact reason should be investigated in the further research edc and eac were also positively correlated with the concentration of humic substances r2 0 75 fig s8 possibly related to the concentration of redox active groups of quinones in humic substances as effective electron exchanging moieties aeschbacher et al 2009 jiang and kappler 2008 demonstrated that humic acids in sludge significantly influenced the redox transformation of arsenic in wastewater a similar conclusion was reported that the addition of humic acid improved both the reduction of total volatile fatty acids and the production of methane during thermophilic anaerobic treatment of piggery wastewater ho and ho 2012 fe is very redox active and can form an outer sphere complex with humic substances an insoluble fe humic acid complex was demonstrated to function as a solid phase electron mediator zhang et al 2014 therefore the high concentration of fe on the surface of red mud might have allowed fe to participate in electron transfer and produce additional redox active sites in humic substances thereby enhancing the role of humic substances as electron shuttles the sum of eac and edc values which is defined as the electron exchange capacity eec indicates the total number of redox active mediators rams in a sample a linear correlation was observed between the change in eec and the change in methane accumulation r 2 0 7053 p 0 0056 fig s9 in addition to c cyts and quinones in humic substances redox active metals on the surface of red mud e g fe are also redox active moieties responsible for the methane production the fe ii concentration in the red mud reactor first increased and then decreased indicating the occurrence of secondary mineralization fig s2 specifically fe ii concentration reached the highest value at day 14 1 51 0 02 mmol which then reduced to about 0 80 0 04 mmol at day 28 compared with the fe iii content in hematite it was found that only 6 24 of hematite took part in the secondary mineralization process the xrd patterns confirmed the formation of conductive magnetite during the anaerobic digestion although the relative intensities of the main mineral compositions of bayer red mud such as hematite aluminum oxide quartz rutile and gibbsite almost kept unchanged fig s10 these results were in accordance with the results reported by a previous study jiang et al 2013 which showed that the transformation of fe iii fe ii during anaerobic digestion affected the methanogenesis in conclusion the methane production rate was positively correlated with the eps contents in both reactors with and without red mud this is because the eps contained the c cyts and rams that influenced the interspecies electron transfer pathway after the addition of red mud the increased c cyts concentration and the formation of large and compact bioaggregates might have promoted the rapid direct electron exchange between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea through the diet process in addition more rams in eps such as humic substances and redox active fe induced by red mud addition could also take part in the interspecies electron transfer process through the mediator pathway therefore the red mud was considered to be able to affect the interspecies electron transfer process through eps by two pathways during the methanogenesis see fig 6 however it should be pointed out that the existence of hematite resulted in a fe iii reduction process which would competed for the electron from the acetate oxidation the increased eps with high eec after the addition of red mud was served as the mediators for fe iii reducing microorganisms at the initial incubation stage of methanogenic culture therefore although a higher amount of eps was found in the red mud reactor the methane accumulation was lower than that in the control reactor at the initial 10 days 4 conclusion this study offered initial scientific evidence to comprehensively assess the role of conductive materials during methanogenesis the application of red mud as conductive solid conduits effectively promoted methane production with a 35 52 2 64 increase compared with the control suggesting a promising approach to effectively use red mud for anaerobic digestion of sludge in addition the results also provided valuable insights into the interaction between conductive materials and eps conductive materials such as hematite promoted the sludge granulation improved the redox property of eps and thus increased the electron transfer efficiency these results have important implications for the biogeochemical redox processes of conductive minerals in natural and engineered environments such as

does not yield oh moreover go fe3o4 suspension along with natural organic matter nom was proven to be helpful in degrading ibuprofen in ozonation process but the effect was minimal when compared to o3

the way in which fish spawn andini et al 2012 fent et al 2006 stumpf et al 1998 winkler et al 2001 the removal of ibp has been studied in different stages of drinking water treatment it has been found that microbial biodegradation and activated carbon adsorption do not eliminate pharmaceuticals due to the presence of organic matter which competes in the removal processes therefore advanced treatment technology is required in order to enhance ibp removal from water ozonation based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely applied for water treatment in which ozone molecules break down recalcitrant and toxic organic compounds into smaller molecules andreozzi et al 1999 rosal et al 2009 gottschalk et al 2009 huber et al 2003 reported that ibp was highly reactive towards oh but was unreactive with o3 k oh p 7 4 109 m 1s 1 ko3 p 9 6 m 1s 1 so it is important to enhance the oh formation to improve the ibp degradation yang et al 2009 recently several studies have explored activated carbon ac and carbon nanotubes cnts as efficient catalysts for ozonation demonstrating that they can in fact initiate and promote the oh formation li et al 2015 yang et al 2009 relative to ac and cnts graphene oxide go also possesses significantly high external surface area and their surfaces can be chemically functionalized to potentially optimize the density of surface sites responsible for oh formation graphene oxide go is an oxidized form of graphene with carboxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and epoxy functional groups on its carbon lattice until recently most researches based on go have used o3 as the oxidizing agent to enhance the degree of organic oxidation however little works have been carried out to detail the behavior of ozone and the kinetics of ozone graphene perreault et al 2015 lee et al 2009 gao et al 2014 used ozone to chemically modify go to ozonized graphene oxide as the proton exchange membrane yang et al 2014 proposed the mechanism of a go surface when reacting with o3 suggesting that go undergoes two stages of reaction including ozone oxidation to introduce the ozone containing group to the surface and ozone decomposition to release co2 co a recent study conducted by liu et al 2016 demonstrated that the degradation of deet increased in the presence of o3 go due to the abundant generation of oh the above literature reviews evidenced o3 go process as a potential aop for the degradation of micropollutants nevertheless there are questions challenging the viability of graphene in combination with o3 as a next generation aop aside from isolated comparisons to ac and cnts it is not yet understood how ozonation of graphene compares to more traditional aops such as the o3 h2o2 process it is therefore important to address these knowledge gaps in relation to the use of graphene to enhance oh exposure during ozonation elovitz and von gunten 1999 proposed the experimental rct concept eq 1 using a probe compound ρ chlorobenzoic

ozone decomposition and oh exposure pcba decay yoon et al 2014 rosal et al 2011 qi et al 2014 oulton et al 2015 oulton et al 2015 studied the o3 multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt for pcba and pharmaceutical degradation their study utilized the rct concept to understand the role of mwcnt as promoter and inhibitor in the ozonation process likewise yoon et al 2014 evaluated the catalytic effect of the ozone carbon nanotube using pcba decay they found the oh exposure was higher in the presence of carbon nanotubes therefore the effect of heterogeneous catalyst on the production of hydroxyl radicals from ozone can be investigated based on the rct concept the experimental rct model is completely empirical and individual effect of initiators promoters and inhibitors cannot be determined recently yong and lin 2012 developed a simulated model of rct concept to determine the effects and rate constants of initiators promoters and inhibitors of nom which is defined as the ratio between total initiation capacities to total inhibition capacity as shown in eq 2 yong and lin 2012 2 r ct 2 k 1 oh k i i m i i k s i m s i where k 1 represents the adjusted rate constant between o3 and oh to account for a lower inhibition capacity k o 3 oh 160 m 1 s 1 k i i and k s i represents the rate constant of initiator and inhibitor m i i and m s i represent the of initiator and inhibitor concentrations nonetheless the applicability of this model on the catalytic ozonation process is still lacking this modified rct model can be adapted for the catalytic ozonation process in order to understand the influence of catalyst as initiator promoter and inhibitor in ozonation process thus the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the kinetic performance of surface modified go catalyst using the new rct modelling concept and to analyze the catalytic activity of go on degradation of ibp in addition the influence of nom along with go on the degradation of ibp was evaluated and compared with the traditional o3 h2o2 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sample preparation all the reagents used for the experiments were of analytical or reagent grade potassium

feed ozone saturated water 60 mg l was prepared by sparging gaseous ozone through a gas washing bottle cooled in an ice bath 2 2 preparation of catalyst go fe3o4 nanocomposites were prepared following the procedure in the literature zubir et al 2014 approximately 50 mg of go was added to 100 ml of distilled water and then ultrasonicated for two hours ultrasonication was used to exfoliate the go and to transform the carboxylic acid groups to carboxylate anions 0 05 m of fecl3 6h2o and 0 025 m of fecl2 4h2o was dissolved in 250 ml of distilled water the dissolved iron solution was then slowly added to the exfoliated go mixture the initial ph of the suspended mixture of exfoliated go and iron was in a range of 1 5 1 6 and 2 m of naoh was added dropwise until the ph reached a level of 10 the final mixture was matured by continuous stirring followed by filtering and washing with dissolved water and was then dried at 60 c for a period of 48 h go tio2 nanocomposites catalyst were prepared using a microwave hydrothermal synthesis method mhs appavoo et al 2014 in the synthesis process 5 mg of go was dissolved in 50 of ethanol 30 ml by ultrasonication for one hour 0 2 g of tio2 was added to this suspended mixture and continuously stirred for another one hour the final homogenous mixture of go tio2 catalyst was then transferred to the autoclave and placed in the mhs system the go reduction rgo and tio2 deposition onto the carbon substrate was obtained by maintaining the mhs system at 180 c for another one hour the resulting go tio2 composite was washed thoroughly with distilled water and ethanol finally the nanocomposites were oven dried at 80 c for a period of six hours the go tio2 fe3o4 catalyst was prepared by combining the preparation procedures of go tio2 and go fe3o4 1 g of go tio2 nano composites were mixed with the 250 ml of solution containing 0 05 m of fecl3 6h2o and 0 025 m of fecl2 4h2o the resulting solution was then aged by constant stirring filtered washed with distilled water and oven dried at 60 c for 2 days 2 3 experimental procedures experiments were conducted in the batch mode system using 1 l glass cylinder reactor in an attempt to understand the kinetic performances of go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 tert butanol was used as an external inhibitor in order to determine the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constant of different go suspensions experiments were carried out using pure water with the addition of a phosphate buffer 1 0 mm and pcba 0 5 μm for the ibp degradation experiments an initial ibp concentration of approximately 0 5 μm was used following the addition of ibp and ph value adjustment an ozone stock solution was added to achieve the desired initial ozone concentration 4 mg l to initiate the ozone radical chain reaction samples were withdrawn after 20 s for the measurement of dissolved ozone concentration pcba and ibp sodium thiosulfate was used to quench ozone prior to the measurement of pcba and ibp 2 4 analytical method the samples were filtered before all measurement through 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filters that were purchased from agilent part number 5190 5262 and the influence of pharmaceutical adsorption on ptfe was tested and identified negligible with 2 adsorption fig s1 results indicated that for all the conditions ibuprofen adsorption on ptfe filters was very minimal or almost negligible 2 figure and explanations included in the supplementary information fig s1 ozone stock solution concentration was measured using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 ε 3100 m 1cm 1 at 258 nm the ozone concentration in the experimental solution was determined using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 federation and association 2005 the concentrations of pcba and ibp were measured using the shimadzu lcms 8030 triple quadrupole liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lcms 8030 shimadzu japan a zorbax sb c18 150 2 1 mm hplc column was used to measure pcba and ibp analytes were eluted by ultrapure water as the aquatic phase and methanol 100 as the solvent phase with a flow rate of 0 25 ml min 1 the temperature of the column for pcba measurement was maintained at 25 c and for ibp measurement was maintained at 40 c the detailed analyses of humic substance hydrophilic doc and hydrophobic doc were conducted by liquid size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd ond doc labor huber germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of surface modified go catalysts the xrd patterns of different go suspension were shown in fig 1 the xrd pattern of go shows a characteristics 2θ peak at 10 9 corresponding to the reflection of go for go fe3o4 samples a well resolved diffraction peak was observed at 35 1 with no go diffraction peaks indicating the absence of layer stacking after fe3o4 deposition detailed description in supplementary information text s1 for the xrd pattern of go tio2 fe3o4 the appearance of both the peaks of tio2 and fe3o4 mainly at 25 1 and 35 3 indicates the successful deposition fe3o4 tio2 on graphene oxide mondal et al 2014 raghu et al 2017 fig 2 showed the sem images of different go suspensions and its corresponding edx spectrum the sem results indicate that the go possessed the flaky appearance without any crystallized phase particles over the go surface fig 2a the sem image results of go fe3o4 indicates the agglomeration of fe3o4 particles on the go surface which were predominantly hexagonal shape with sharp edges fig 2b in case of go tio2 nanoparticles fig 2c it can be seen that tio2 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed on to the go flake surface the sem images of go tio2 fe3o4 fig 2d clearly shows deposition of many inhomogeneous size particles on the go surface caused due the agglomeration of fe3o4 and tio2 the edx pattern results confirm the presence of fe and c in go fe3o4 catalyst that revealed the existence of fe3o4 and go in the nanocomposites likewise the edx pattern of go tio2 fe3o4 evidence the presence of fe ti and c elements in the go this indicates the effective formation of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 fig 2 3 2 quantification of ozone decay and hydroxyl radical formation for graphene based heterogeneous catalysis experimental conditions were chosen to mimic those used in previous catalytic ozonation studies with carbon nanotubes mwcnt and granular activated carbon gac to enable an easier comparison of our results with graphene based catalysts to those earlier studies sánchez polo et al 2005 2006 oulton et al 2015 kinetic performances of graphene oxide go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 in the ozonation process were analyzed using the simulated rct model and validated using the experimental rct concept additionally the performance evaluation of o3 go as an alternative aop were conducted and compared with traditional aops such as o3 h2o2 process experiments were conducted at 25 c and ph 7 in various go suspensions that were completely dispersed in the reactor through constant mixing with a magnetic stirrer figs 3 and 4 show the ozone decomposition and pcba decay for different suspensions of go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 with an initial concentration of ozone at 4 mg l results of control experiments indicated that pcba decay was negligible due to the adsorption in all the go suspensions fig s2 and the decay of pcba was solely due to ozone oxidation reactions on the catalytic surface furthermore the ozonation control experiments of fe3o4 and tio2 powders without go fig s3 text s2 revealed that ozone decomposition and pcba decay was slower when compared to go suspensions in all cases go suspensions go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 enhanced o3 decay when compared to the systems without go which exhibits an essentially identical reactivity toward o3 in a clear view the decomposition of ozone was found to be higher with o3 go suspensions than o3 alone process in fig 3 fig 4 also showed that the pcba decay was considerably faster for go suspensions i e o3 decomposition is accompanied by oh formation for all go suspensions than for ozone alone process as the go suspensions were thoroughly dispersed in the reactant water pure water this indicates that surface functionalized go go fe3o4 go tio2 fe3o4 was significantly more reactive per unit mass than as received go nearly completely consuming o3 over 3 min this observation was found to be in accordance with a study by oulton et al 2015 about mwcnts performance in ozonation they found that surface functionalized mwcnt effectively promoted the formation of oh during ozonation it is also noted from figs 3 and 4 that for the go alone suspension the o3 decomposition was much higher with much lower pcba decay when compared to other go suspensions this observation suggests that o3 decomposes on non functionalized go without surface modification through a mechanism that does not induce oh formation or that go acts as a better oh scavenger limiting the reaction of oh toward pcba oulton et al 2015 made similar observations with regard to mwcnt suggesting that a mwcnt without surface modification may enhance o3 decay without oh formation the experimental results also showed that the decomposition of o3 and pcba decay were the highest for go fe3o4 tio2 due to the fastest initiation reaction contributed by fe3o4 and tio2 in the suspension table 1 compares rct values for different go suspensions o3 in the absence of gos a combination of o3 and go suspensions go 30 mg l and other go nanocomposite suspensions 20 mg l each and a combination of o3 4 mg l and h2o2 0 01 mm in comparison to o3 alone the go tio2 fe3o4 suspension provided a relatively higher rct value followed by go tio2 go fe3o4 and go alone the rct values for suspensions of go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 were almost 20 to 30 folds greater than o3 alone with an order of magnitude greater than that observed for o3 gac oulton et al 2015 go suspensions such as go tio2 go fe3o4 and go fe3o4 tio2 also produced oh nearly equivalent to or slightly lower than o3 h2o2 exhibiting that substrate modified go suspensions can be utilized as future alternative aops however many future studies needs to be done based on the go catalyst life time process cost and engineering design so as to adopt go as future aops fig 5 shows the plot of pcba decay vs time in go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions as a function of initial concentrations of ozone and go tio2 fe3o4 it was noted from the results that the pcba decay increased with the increase in both initial ozone concentration and go tio2 fe3o4 the increase in pcba decay with an increased concentration in go suspension is due to the surface mediated process of a catalyst enhancing oh formation in the case of ozone at a lower concentration 2 mg l almost all ozone was quickly consumed over the time leaving no oxidizing reactants available to further decay the remaining pcba fig s4 this limitation of oxidizing reactants is reconciled at higher concentration 4 mg l of ozone providing a more efficient removal of pcba 3 3 total organic carbon toc removal and stability test for go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 for catalytic ozonation in general o3 only breaks the large organic molecules into smaller organic molecules which could be further decomposed easily thus the toc reduction was always thought to be mainly affected by oh experiments were carried out in an attempt to understand the toc reduction in different go suspensions under three different conditions 1 adsorption of toc control on different go suspensions 2 ozonation only 3 catalytic ozonation using different go substrate as can be seen from fig 6 the reduction of toc through adsorption condition 1 was found to be minimal 5 for all go suspensions from the aspect of ozone alone and catalytic ozonation using different go suspensions the degradation of toc was in the sequence of go fe3o4 51 go tio2 fe3o4 49 go tio2 32 go alone 24 o3 alone 17 the higher toc reduction in go fe3o4 indicated the predominance of catalytic reaction in ozonation process when compared with ozone oxidation alone the toc results also indicates that the surface modified go suspension can enhance the mineralization of organics due to yield of excess oh several studies have explored mwcnt fe3o4 as efficient catalysts for ozonation to improve the mineralization of organics bai et al 2017a b bai et al 2017b demonstrated fe3o4 mwcnts performance in ozonation process they found the toc removal efficiency in presence of fe3o4 mwcnts was much higher than the single ozone alone process they found the toc removal efficiency in presence of fe3o4 mwcnts was much higher than the single ozone alone process another study by yin et al 2016 demonstrated the higher degree of mineralization of antibiotics sulfamethoxazole in presence of o3 fe3o4 when compared to ozonation process alone the catalytic activity on the degradation of pcba was investigated to evaluate the stability of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 fig 7 shows the degradation of pcba through three consecutive runs using go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 and with an initial ozone concentration of 4 mg l as shown in fig 7 during the 2nd run the degradation of pcba decreased to 10 and 14 for the go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 when compared with the 1st run fresh catalyst this might be due to the surface oxidation of the catalyst through ozone leaching of metal ions and adsorption of intermediate organics formed during the ozonation process wang et al 2016 found the similar observation with regard to rgo 300 catalyst stability and mentioned the deactivation of catalyst might be due to the oxidation and adsorption of organic intermediates fig 7 also shows the regenerated catalytic activity after thermal treatment for pcba degradation the deactivated go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 catalysts after the 1st run was regenerated by washing with di water followed by the thermal treatment at 300 c for 2 h after the thermal treatment the deactivated catalyst was recovered leading to enhanced pcba degradation closer to 1st run 3 4 determination of initiation inhibition and promotion rate constants of go based heterogeneous catalysts using the modified rct concept using the known external inhibitor tert butanol concentrations the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants of go suspensions were determined to clearly understand the kinetic effects of go suspensions experiments were carried out at different tert butanol concentrations 0 01 0 2 mm go suspensions 30 mg l each at ph 7 and with 4 mg l initial o3 concentration table 2 shows the experimental rct values for all the go suspensions with different tert butanol concentrations with an increase in concentration of tert butanol the rct value decreased for all types of go suspensions as the reaction between tert butanol and oh leads to a decrease in both ozone decomposition and pcba decay which terminates the ozone radical chain reaction using the obtained experimental rct values the ki kp and ks values of different go suspensions were determined in the ozonation process go might act as the initiator inhibitor and promoter in the ozone chain reaction by considering go to be the ozone radical chain foreign constituents initiator inhibitor and promoter it is incorporated in both the denominator and numerator of eq 2 by consolidating eq 2 leads to eq 3 detailed derivation in supplementary information text s3 3 r ct 2 k 1 oh k i go k oh t buoh t buoh k s go initiation and inhibition rate constants were determined by the reciprocal of eq 3 4 1 r ct k t buoh t buoh k s go 2 k 1 oh k i go the plot of 1 rct vs k t buoh t buoh yields a straight line with an intercept of k s go 2 k 1 oh k i go and a slope of 1 2 k 1 oh k i go fig 8 the promotion rate constants were determined using a pseudo first order reaction eq 5 involving go suspensions detailed derivation in supplementary information text s4 5 d o 3 dt 1 o 3 k obs 3 k 1 oh k d go k p go r ct the plot between kobs and rct fig 9 provides the determination of promotion rate constant from the slope the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants obtained from the different go suspensions at various concentrations of tert butanol are presented in table 3 the simulated initiation and promotion rate constants ki kp for go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions were found to be one order higher than for go alone suspensions on the other hand the inhibition rate constant values determined for go suspensions had wider variations i e 0 09 103 1 76 103 and 1 85 103 for go alone go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions as explained in figs 3 and 4 the go alone suspensions leads to very high o3 decomposition and very low pcba degradation due to the mechanism of go that does not yield oh thus the non participation of go alone suspensions in oh formation leads to lower initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants when compared with those of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions since go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 had almost similar initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants further experiments on testing nom effect and ibp degradation was carried out using go fe3o4 catalyst 3 5 influence of go on pcba decay in the presence of nom srfa to determine the applicability of the combination of o3 go in the presence of nom ozonation experiments were conducted with pure water containing nom srfa fig 10 shows the pcba decay as a function of ozone decomposition time in the presence absence of go fe3o4 many literature clearly illustrated that dissolved organic carbon doc was highly reactive toward o3 and initiated promoted its decomposition while simultaneously increasing pcba decay yong and lin 2012 the presence of go fe3o4 along with srfa noticeably increased pcba decay in more detail the decay of pcba was greater than 90 for go suspensions along with srfa and only 60 with srfa alone suspension at 1 min generally in an ozonation based aop process doc plays an essential role in affecting pcba decay as it highly promotes ozone decomposition and scavenges the oh to further investigate the role of nom in the o3 go suspension experiments were carried out with various srfa concentrations the results are shown in fig 10 and it indicated that pcba decay was found to have less obvious variations with the increase in srfa concentration in presence of go the reason might be the adsorption or faster degradation of humic substance in o3 go fe3o4 based catalytic ozonation process to get the clearer view lc ocd analysis was performed to test the humic acid concentration with and without ozonation in presence of go fe3o4 suspensions table 4 shows the lc ocd data which evidences the effect go fe3o4 on adsorption and oxidation of humic substances the reduction of humic substances was found to be 17 through adsorption in go fe3o4 53 in ozone alone and 90 in o3 go fe3o4 respectively moreover humic substance reduction was evidenced by the formation of more hydrophilic organic matter fewer molecular weight neutrals and lower doc content in the hydrophobic fraction higher reduction of humic substance in o3 go fe3o4 process might be due to the reaction between oh and humic substance this observation indicated that the increase in doc on the surface of go did not affect the initiating and promoting activity a study by ikhlaq et al 2015 demonstrated the effect of ha in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ibuprofen and cumene they demonstrated that if the catalyst showed a low adsorption capacity towards ha the catalytic activity was not influenced by ha whereas ha could inhibit the catalyst generating hydroxyl radicals therefore this might be the reason for slight variations of pcba decay with increase in srha concentration oulton et al 2015 observed a similar effect of nom when using o3 mwcnt for pcba and pharmaceutical degradation their study found that the increase in ha concentration slightly impacted the organic degradation in o3 mwcnt process this is also evidenced in a study by liu et al 2016 indicating the less participation of nom in deet degradation during the o3 go process the study also explained that the presence of ha could slightly inhibit the go generating oh in real water condition such as natural water and wastewater the effect of doc in ozonation becomes more critical to understand due to the presence of other scavenging parameters such as alkalinity ph etc so it becomes practically important to analyze the o3 go system for the real water system which will be conducted in our future studies 3 6 degradation of ibuprofen in the presence of go suspension catalytic activity studies of modified go were conducted with an ozone recalcitrant organic micropollutant ibuprofen degradation of ibp was studied using different ozonation based aops including o3 alone o3 h2o2 and catalytic ozonation o3 go o3 go fe3o4 the pharmaceutical compound degradation can be modeled using the ozone decomposition and pcba decay if the rct value in the go suspension system was determined the degradation of a pharmaceutical compound denoted as p is given by eq 6 elovitz and von gunten 1999 6 ln p p o o 3 d t k oh p r ct k o 3 p where p o and p represent the initial and final concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds k oh p and k o 3 p represent the second order reaction rate constants of pharmaceutical compounds with oh and ozone respectively using the determined initiation inhibition and promotion rate constants of different go suspensions table 3 the degradation of ibuprofen was modeled using eq 6 the srfa rate constants ki 3 9 10 4 l mg 1s 1 ks 4 4 103 l mg 1s 1 kp 7 5 104 l mg 1s 1 was adapted from yong and lin 2012 for predicting ibuprofen degradation control experimental data suggested that the adsorption of ibuprofen was negligible or very minimal 3 for all go suspensions fig s5 in comparing among all the different go suspensions the ibp degradation was found to be 85 for the o3 go fe3o4 suspensions followed by o3 go 76 and o3 alone 55 indicating that surface modified go enhances the yield of excess oh fig 11 these results were in line with a study by liu et al 2016 demonstrating the enhanced deet degradation in the presence of o3 go suspensions and also indicating the promotional effect of oh formation in the presence of go the obtained simulated values were in good accordance with the experimental values for ibuprofen degradation the degree of ibp degradation in the presence of srfa and go was also evaluated fig 12 showed that with an increase in srfa concentration from 0 to 2 mg l the degradation of ibuprofen increased although with small differences for o3 go fe3o4 suspensions in a clear view the influence of nom in the presence of go catalyst was however very little it is also evidenced from table 5 that both ozone exposure and oh exposure increased with an increase in srfa concentration however small difference in rct value to a slight variation in the degradation of ibuprofen for ozonation in the presence of go this is in agreement with a study by ikhlaq et al 2015 where they demonstrated the non participation of ha in the ibuprofen degradation in the catalytic ozonation process moreover it was noted that the degradation of ibuprofen in the presence of go catalysts was very similar to that in the o3 h2o2 process indicating that the surface modified go can be used as an alternative aop process in the future 4 conclusion this work for the first time demonstrated the kinetic role of o3 go catalytic process and its findings may assist future studies in predicting pharmaceutical decomposition in the presence of go the applicability of the modified rct concept was demonstrated using different go suspensions in the ozonation process the results revealed that the surface modified go suspensions go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 enhanced the o3 exposure and oh formation and were almost equivalent to traditional o3 h2o2 process contrastingly the go catalyst without any surface modification acted as oh scavenger which limits the reactivity of oh with organics additionally the initiation and promotion rate constants ki kp of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspension were found to be one order higher than those of go alone suspension on the other hand the inhibition rate constants determined for go suspensions had a wider variation for go alone and surface modified go suspensions therefore the lower participation of go alone suspension in oh formation to the lower initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants when compared with go fe3o4 suspension it was also found that the presence of srfa along with a go fe3o4 suspension induced more organic degradation but the effect was minimal compared to o3 h2o2 process these results suggest that a substrate modified go suspension can be utilized as a future alternative aop more in depth knowledge is required on the applicability of go in the real water situation such as in wastewater and natural water the stability of go catalysts requires testing in the ozonation process which may provide the necessary information for designing the experimental setup and operational parameters for water and wastewater treatment plants appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article supplementary information supplementary information appendix a supplementary data

ozone exposure and oh exposure were found to be higher for go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 compared to other go suspensions which was almost equivalent to o3 h2o2 process the determined initiation and inhibition rate constants of go alone were 1 fold higher than go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 since the go alone suspension possesses higher o3 decomposition but lower organic degradation because that go

break down recalcitrant and toxic organic compounds into smaller molecules andreozzi et al 1999 rosal et al 2009 gottschalk et al 2009 huber et al 2003 reported that ibp was highly reactive towards oh but was unreactive with o3 k oh p 7 4 109 m 1s 1 ko3 p 9 6 m 1s 1 so it is important to enhance the oh formation to improve the ibp degradation yang et al 2009 recently several studies have explored activated carbon ac and carbon nanotubes cnts as efficient catalysts for ozonation demonstrating that they can in fact initiate and promote the oh formation li et al 2015 yang et al 2009 relative to ac and cnts graphene oxide go also possesses significantly high external surface area and their surfaces can be chemically functionalized to potentially optimize the density of surface sites responsible for oh formation graphene oxide go is an oxidized form of graphene with carboxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and epoxy functional groups on its carbon lattice until recently most researches based on go have used o3 as the oxidizing agent to enhance the degree of organic oxidation however little works have been carried out to detail the behavior of ozone and the kinetics of ozone graphene perreault et al 2015 lee et al 2009 gao et al 2014 used ozone to chemically modify go to ozonized graphene oxide as the proton exchange membrane yang et al 2014 proposed the mechanism of a go surface when reacting with o3 suggesting that go undergoes two stages of reaction including ozone oxidation to introduce the ozone containing group to the surface and ozone decomposition to release co2 co a recent study conducted by liu et al 2016 demonstrated that the degradation of deet increased in the presence of o3 go due to the abundant generation of oh the above literature reviews evidenced o3 go process as a potential aop for the degradation of micropollutants nevertheless there are questions challenging the viability of graphene in combination with o3 as a next generation aop aside from isolated comparisons to ac and cnts it is not yet understood how ozonation of graphene compares to more traditional aops such as the o3 h2o2 process it is therefore important to address these knowledge gaps in relation to the use of graphene to enhance oh exposure during ozonation elovitz and von gunten 1999 proposed the experimental rct concept eq 1 using a probe compound ρ chlorobenzoic acid pcba to indirectly determine the oh concentration elovitz and von gunten 1999 1 r ct oh dt o 3 dt pcba is highly reactive towards oh k oh pcba 5 109 m 1s 1 and non reactive with ozone ko3 pcba 0 15 m 1s 1 buffle et al 2006 hoigne and bader 1979 several studies based on heterogeneous catalyst had adapted the rct concept to evaluate the effectiveness of catalyst to form oh using ozone exposure ozone decomposition and oh exposure pcba decay yoon et al 2014 rosal et al 2011 qi et al 2014 oulton et al 2015 oulton et al 2015 studied the o3 multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt for pcba and pharmaceutical degradation their study utilized the rct concept to understand the role of mwcnt as promoter and inhibitor in the ozonation process likewise yoon et al 2014 evaluated the catalytic effect of the ozone carbon nanotube using pcba decay they found the oh exposure was higher in the presence of carbon nanotubes therefore the effect of heterogeneous catalyst on the production of hydroxyl radicals from ozone can be investigated based on the rct concept the experimental rct model is completely empirical and individual effect of initiators promoters and inhibitors cannot be determined recently yong and lin 2012 developed a simulated model of rct concept to determine the effects and rate constants of initiators promoters and inhibitors of nom which is defined as the ratio between total initiation capacities to total inhibition capacity as shown in eq 2 yong and lin 2012 2 r ct 2 k 1 oh k i i m i i k s i m s i where k 1 represents the adjusted rate constant between o3 and oh to account for a lower inhibition capacity k o 3 oh 160 m 1 s 1 k i i and k s i represents the rate constant of initiator and inhibitor m i i and m s i represent the of initiator and inhibitor concentrations nonetheless the applicability of this model on the catalytic ozonation process is still lacking this modified rct model can be adapted for the catalytic ozonation process in order to understand the influence of catalyst as initiator promoter and inhibitor in ozonation process thus the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the kinetic performance of surface modified go catalyst using the new rct modelling concept and to analyze the catalytic activity of go on degradation of ibp in addition the influence of nom along with go on the degradation of ibp was evaluated and compared with the traditional o3 h2o2 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sample preparation all the reagents used for the experiments were of analytical or reagent grade potassium

feed ozone saturated water 60 mg l was prepared by sparging gaseous ozone through a gas washing bottle cooled in an ice bath 2 2 preparation of catalyst go fe3o4 nanocomposites were prepared following the procedure in the literature zubir et al 2014 approximately 50 mg of go was added to 100 ml of distilled water and then ultrasonicated for two hours ultrasonication was used to exfoliate the go and to transform the carboxylic acid groups to carboxylate anions 0 05 m of fecl3 6h2o and 0 025 m of fecl2 4h2o was dissolved in 250 ml of distilled water the dissolved iron solution was then slowly added to the exfoliated go mixture the initial ph of the suspended mixture of exfoliated go and iron was in a range of 1 5 1 6 and 2 m of naoh was added dropwise until the ph reached a level of 10 the final mixture was matured by continuous stirring followed by filtering and washing with dissolved water and was then dried at 60 c for a period of 48 h go tio2 nanocomposites catalyst were prepared using a microwave hydrothermal synthesis method mhs appavoo et al 2014 in the synthesis process 5 mg of go was dissolved in 50 of ethanol 30 ml by ultrasonication for one hour 0 2 g of tio2 was added to this suspended mixture and continuously stirred for another one hour the final homogenous mixture of go tio2 catalyst was then transferred to the autoclave and placed in the mhs system the go reduction rgo and tio2 deposition onto the carbon substrate was obtained by maintaining the mhs system at 180 c for another one hour the resulting go tio2 composite was washed thoroughly with distilled water and ethanol finally the nanocomposites were oven dried at 80 c for a period of six hours the go tio2 fe3o4 catalyst was prepared by combining the preparation procedures of go tio2 and go fe3o4 1 g of go tio2 nano composites were mixed with the 250 ml of solution containing 0 05 m of fecl3 6h2o and 0 025 m of fecl2 4h2o the resulting solution was then aged by constant stirring filtered washed with distilled water and oven dried at 60 c for 2 days 2 3 experimental procedures experiments were conducted in the batch mode system using 1 l glass cylinder reactor in an attempt to understand the kinetic performances of go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 tert butanol was used as an external inhibitor in order to determine the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constant of different go suspensions experiments were carried out using pure water with the addition of a phosphate buffer 1 0 mm and pcba 0 5 μm for the ibp degradation experiments an initial ibp concentration of approximately 0 5 μm was used following the addition of ibp and ph value adjustment an ozone stock solution was added to achieve the desired initial ozone concentration 4 mg l to initiate the ozone radical chain reaction samples were withdrawn after 20 s for the measurement of dissolved ozone concentration pcba and ibp sodium thiosulfate was used to quench ozone prior to the measurement of pcba and ibp 2 4 analytical method the samples were filtered before all measurement through 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filters that were purchased from agilent part number 5190 5262 and the influence of pharmaceutical adsorption on ptfe was tested and identified negligible with 2 adsorption fig s1 results indicated that for all the conditions ibuprofen adsorption on ptfe filters was very minimal or almost negligible 2 figure and explanations included in the supplementary information fig s1 ozone stock solution concentration was measured using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 ε 3100 m 1cm 1 at 258 nm the ozone concentration in the experimental solution was determined using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 federation and association 2005 the concentrations of pcba and ibp were measured using the shimadzu lcms 8030 triple quadrupole liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lcms 8030 shimadzu japan a zorbax sb c18 150 2 1 mm hplc column was used to measure pcba and ibp analytes were eluted by ultrapure water as the aquatic phase and methanol 100 as the solvent phase with a flow rate of 0 25 ml min 1 the temperature of the column for pcba measurement was maintained at 25 c and for ibp measurement was maintained at 40 c the detailed analyses of humic substance hydrophilic doc and hydrophobic doc were conducted by liquid size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd ond doc labor huber germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of surface modified go catalysts the xrd patterns of different go suspension were shown in fig 1 the xrd pattern of go shows a characteristics 2θ peak at 10 9 corresponding to the reflection of go for go fe3o4 samples a well resolved diffraction peak was observed at 35 1 with no go diffraction peaks indicating the absence of layer stacking after fe3o4 deposition detailed description in supplementary information text s1 for the xrd pattern of go tio2 fe3o4 the appearance of both the peaks of tio2 and fe3o4 mainly at 25 1 and 35 3 indicates the successful deposition fe3o4 tio2 on graphene oxide mondal et al 2014 raghu et al 2017 fig 2 showed the sem images of different go suspensions and its corresponding edx spectrum the sem results indicate that the go possessed the flaky appearance without any crystallized phase particles over the go surface fig 2a the sem image results of go fe3o4 indicates the agglomeration of fe3o4 particles on the go surface which were predominantly hexagonal shape with sharp edges fig 2b in case of go tio2 nanoparticles fig 2c it can be seen that tio2 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed on to the go flake surface the sem images of go tio2 fe3o4 fig 2d clearly shows deposition of many inhomogeneous size particles on the go surface caused due the agglomeration of fe3o4 and tio2 the edx pattern results confirm the presence of fe and c in go fe3o4 catalyst that revealed the existence of fe3o4 and go in the nanocomposites likewise the edx pattern of go tio2 fe3o4 evidence the presence of fe ti and c elements in the go this indicates the effective formation of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 fig 2 3 2 quantification of ozone decay and hydroxyl radical formation for graphene based heterogeneous catalysis experimental conditions were chosen to mimic those used in previous catalytic ozonation studies with carbon nanotubes mwcnt and granular activated carbon gac to enable an easier comparison of our results with graphene based catalysts to those earlier studies sánchez polo et al 2005 2006 oulton et al 2015 kinetic performances of graphene oxide go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 in the ozonation process were analyzed using the simulated rct model and validated using the experimental rct concept additionally the performance evaluation of o3 go as an alternative aop were conducted and compared with traditional aops such as o3 h2o2 process experiments were conducted at 25 c and ph 7 in various go suspensions that were completely dispersed in the reactor through constant mixing with a magnetic stirrer figs 3 and 4 show the ozone decomposition and pcba decay for different suspensions of go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 with an initial concentration of ozone at 4 mg l results of control experiments indicated that pcba decay was negligible due to the adsorption in all the go suspensions fig s2 and the decay of pcba was solely due to ozone oxidation reactions on the catalytic surface furthermore the ozonation control experiments of fe3o4 and tio2 powders without go fig s3 text s2 revealed that ozone decomposition and pcba decay was slower when compared to go suspensions in all cases go suspensions go go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 enhanced o3 decay when compared to the systems without go which exhibits an essentially identical reactivity toward o3 in a clear view the decomposition of ozone was found to be higher with o3 go suspensions than o3 alone process in fig 3 fig 4 also showed that the pcba decay was considerably faster for go suspensions i e o3 decomposition is accompanied by oh formation for all go suspensions than for ozone alone process as the go suspensions were thoroughly dispersed in the reactant water pure water this indicates that surface functionalized go go fe3o4 go tio2 fe3o4 was significantly more reactive per unit mass than as received go nearly completely consuming o3 over 3 min this observation was found to be in accordance with a study by oulton et al 2015 about mwcnts performance in ozonation they found that surface functionalized mwcnt effectively promoted the formation of oh during ozonation it is also noted from figs 3 and 4 that for the go alone suspension the o3 decomposition was much higher with much lower pcba decay when compared to other go suspensions this observation suggests that o3 decomposes on non functionalized go without surface modification through a mechanism that does not induce oh formation or that go acts as a better oh scavenger limiting the reaction of oh toward pcba oulton et al 2015 made similar observations with regard to mwcnt suggesting that a mwcnt without surface modification may enhance o3 decay without oh formation the experimental results also showed that the decomposition of o3 and pcba decay were the highest for go fe3o4 tio2 due to the fastest initiation reaction contributed by fe3o4 and tio2 in the suspension table 1 compares rct values for different go suspensions o3 in the absence of gos a combination of o3 and go suspensions go 30 mg l and other go nanocomposite suspensions 20 mg l each and a combination of o3 4 mg l and h2o2 0 01 mm in comparison to o3 alone the go tio2 fe3o4 suspension provided a relatively higher rct value followed by go tio2 go fe3o4 and go alone the rct values for suspensions of go tio2 go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 were almost 20 to 30 folds greater than o3 alone with an order of magnitude greater than that observed for o3 gac oulton et al 2015 go suspensions such as go tio2 go fe3o4 and go fe3o4 tio2 also produced oh nearly equivalent to or slightly lower than o3 h2o2 exhibiting that substrate modified go suspensions can be utilized as future alternative aops however many future studies needs to be done based on the go catalyst life time process cost and engineering design so as to adopt go as future aops fig 5 shows the plot of pcba decay vs time in go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions as a function of initial concentrations of ozone and go tio2 fe3o4 it was noted from the results that the pcba decay increased with the increase in both initial ozone concentration and go tio2 fe3o4 the increase in pcba decay with an increased concentration in go suspension is due to the surface mediated process of a catalyst enhancing oh formation in the case of ozone at a lower concentration 2 mg l almost all ozone was quickly consumed over the time leaving no oxidizing reactants available to further decay the remaining pcba fig s4 this limitation of oxidizing reactants is reconciled at higher concentration 4 mg l of ozone providing a more efficient removal of pcba 3 3 total organic carbon toc removal and stability test for go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 for catalytic ozonation in general o3 only breaks the large organic molecules into smaller organic molecules which could be further decomposed easily thus the toc reduction was always thought to be mainly affected by oh experiments were carried out in an attempt to understand the toc reduction in different go suspensions under three different conditions 1 adsorption of toc control on different go suspensions 2 ozonation only 3 catalytic ozonation using different go substrate as can be seen from fig 6 the reduction of toc through adsorption condition 1 was found to be minimal 5 for all go suspensions from the aspect of ozone alone and catalytic ozonation using different go suspensions the degradation of toc was in the sequence of go fe3o4 51 go tio2 fe3o4 49 go tio2 32 go alone 24 o3 alone 17 the higher toc reduction in go fe3o4 indicated the predominance of catalytic reaction in ozonation process when compared with ozone oxidation alone the toc results also indicates that the surface modified go suspension can enhance the mineralization of organics due to yield of excess oh several studies have explored mwcnt fe3o4 as efficient catalysts for ozonation to improve the mineralization of organics bai et al 2017a b bai et al 2017b demonstrated fe3o4 mwcnts performance in ozonation process they found the toc removal efficiency in presence of fe3o4 mwcnts was much higher than the single ozone alone process they found the toc removal efficiency in presence of fe3o4 mwcnts was much higher than the single ozone alone process another study by yin et al 2016 demonstrated the higher degree of mineralization of antibiotics sulfamethoxazole in presence of o3 fe3o4 when compared to ozonation process alone the catalytic activity on the degradation of pcba was investigated to evaluate the stability of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 fig 7 shows the degradation of pcba through three consecutive runs using go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 and with an initial ozone concentration of 4 mg l as shown in fig 7 during the 2nd run the degradation of pcba decreased to 10 and 14 for the go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 when compared with the 1st run fresh catalyst this might be due to the surface oxidation of the catalyst through ozone leaching of metal ions and adsorption of intermediate organics formed during the ozonation process wang et al 2016 found the similar observation with regard to rgo 300 catalyst stability and mentioned the deactivation of catalyst might be due to the oxidation and adsorption of organic intermediates fig 7 also shows the regenerated catalytic activity after thermal treatment for pcba degradation the deactivated go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 catalysts after the 1st run was regenerated by washing with di water followed by the thermal treatment at 300 c for 2 h after the thermal treatment the deactivated catalyst was recovered leading to enhanced pcba degradation closer to 1st run 3 4 determination of initiation inhibition and promotion rate constants of go based heterogeneous catalysts using the modified rct concept using the known external inhibitor tert butanol concentrations the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants of go suspensions were determined to clearly understand the kinetic effects of go suspensions experiments were carried out at different tert butanol concentrations 0 01 0 2 mm go suspensions 30 mg l each at ph 7 and with 4 mg l initial o3 concentration table 2 shows the experimental rct values for all the go suspensions with different tert butanol concentrations with an increase in concentration of tert butanol the rct value decreased for all types of go suspensions as the reaction between tert butanol and oh leads to a decrease in both ozone decomposition and pcba decay which terminates the ozone radical chain reaction using the obtained experimental rct values the ki kp and ks values of different go suspensions were determined in the ozonation process go might act as the initiator inhibitor and promoter in the ozone chain reaction by considering go to be the ozone radical chain foreign constituents initiator inhibitor and promoter it is incorporated in both the denominator and numerator of eq 2 by consolidating eq 2 leads to eq 3 detailed derivation in supplementary information text s3 3 r ct 2 k 1 oh k i go k oh t buoh t buoh k s go initiation and inhibition rate constants were determined by the reciprocal of eq 3 4 1 r ct k t buoh t buoh k s go 2 k 1 oh k i go the plot of 1 rct vs k t buoh t buoh yields a straight line with an intercept of k s go 2 k 1 oh k i go and a slope of 1 2 k 1 oh k i go fig 8 the promotion rate constants were determined using a pseudo first order reaction eq 5 involving go suspensions detailed derivation in supplementary information text s4 5 d o 3 dt 1 o 3 k obs 3 k 1 oh k d go k p go r ct the plot between kobs and rct fig 9 provides the determination of promotion rate constant from the slope the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants obtained from the different go suspensions at various concentrations of tert butanol are presented in table 3 the simulated initiation and promotion rate constants ki kp for go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions were found to be one order higher than for go alone suspensions on the other hand the inhibition rate constant values determined for go suspensions had wider variations i e 0 09 103 1 76 103 and 1 85 103 for go alone go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions as explained in figs 3 and 4 the go alone suspensions leads to very high o3 decomposition and very low pcba degradation due to the mechanism of go that does not yield oh thus the non participation of go alone suspensions in oh formation leads to lower initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants when compared with those of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspensions since go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 had almost similar initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants further experiments on testing nom effect and ibp degradation was carried out using go fe3o4 catalyst 3 5 influence of go on pcba decay in the presence of nom srfa to determine the applicability of the combination of o3 go in the presence of nom ozonation experiments were conducted with pure water containing nom srfa fig 10 shows the pcba decay as a function of ozone decomposition time in the presence absence of go fe3o4 many literature clearly illustrated that dissolved organic carbon doc was highly reactive toward o3 and initiated promoted its decomposition while simultaneously increasing pcba decay yong and lin 2012 the presence of go fe3o4 along with srfa noticeably increased pcba decay in more detail the decay of pcba was greater than 90 for go suspensions along with srfa and only 60 with srfa alone suspension at 1 min generally in an ozonation based aop process doc plays an essential role in affecting pcba decay as it highly promotes ozone decomposition and scavenges the oh to further investigate the role of nom in the o3 go suspension experiments were carried out with various srfa concentrations the results are shown in fig 10 and it indicated that pcba decay was found to have less obvious variations with the increase in srfa concentration in presence of go the reason might be the adsorption or faster degradation of humic substance in o3 go fe3o4 based catalytic ozonation process to get the clearer view lc ocd analysis was performed to test the humic acid concentration with and without ozonation in presence of go fe3o4 suspensions table 4 shows the lc ocd data which evidences the effect go fe3o4 on adsorption and oxidation of humic substances the reduction of humic substances was found to be 17 through adsorption in go fe3o4 53 in ozone alone and 90 in o3 go fe3o4 respectively moreover humic substance reduction was evidenced by the formation of more hydrophilic organic matter fewer molecular weight neutrals and lower doc content in the hydrophobic fraction higher reduction of humic substance in o3 go fe3o4 process might be due to the reaction between oh and humic substance this observation indicated that the increase in doc on the surface of go did not affect the initiating and promoting activity a study by ikhlaq et al 2015 demonstrated the effect of ha in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ibuprofen and cumene they demonstrated that if the catalyst showed a low adsorption capacity towards ha the catalytic activity was not influenced by ha whereas ha could inhibit the catalyst generating hydroxyl radicals therefore this might be the reason for slight variations of pcba decay with increase in srha concentration oulton et al 2015 observed a similar effect of nom when using o3 mwcnt for pcba and pharmaceutical degradation their study found that the increase in ha concentration slightly impacted the organic degradation in o3 mwcnt process this is also evidenced in a study by liu et al 2016 indicating the less participation of nom in deet degradation during the o3 go process the study also explained that the presence of ha could slightly inhibit the go generating oh in real water condition such as natural water and wastewater the effect of doc in ozonation becomes more critical to understand due to the presence of other scavenging parameters such as alkalinity ph etc so it becomes practically important to analyze the o3 go system for the real water system which will be conducted in our future studies 3 6 degradation of ibuprofen in the presence of go suspension catalytic activity studies of modified go were conducted with an ozone recalcitrant organic micropollutant ibuprofen degradation of ibp was studied using different ozonation based aops including o3 alone o3 h2o2 and catalytic ozonation o3 go o3 go fe3o4 the pharmaceutical compound degradation can be modeled using the ozone decomposition and pcba decay if the rct value in the go suspension system was determined the degradation of a pharmaceutical compound denoted as p is given by eq 6 elovitz and von gunten 1999 6 ln p p o o 3 d t k oh p r ct k o 3 p where p o and p represent the initial and final concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds k oh p and k o 3 p represent the second order reaction rate constants of pharmaceutical compounds with oh and ozone respectively using the determined initiation inhibition and promotion rate constants of different go suspensions table 3 the degradation of ibuprofen was modeled using eq 6 the srfa rate constants ki 3 9 10 4 l mg 1s 1 ks 4 4 103 l mg 1s 1 kp 7 5 104 l mg 1s 1 was adapted from yong and lin 2012 for predicting ibuprofen degradation control experimental data suggested that the adsorption of ibuprofen was negligible or very minimal 3 for all go suspensions fig s5 in comparing among all the different go suspensions the ibp degradation was found to be 85 for the o3 go fe3o4 suspensions followed by o3 go 76 and o3 alone 55 indicating that surface modified go enhances the yield of excess oh fig 11 these results were in line with a study by liu et al 2016 demonstrating the enhanced deet degradation in the presence of o3 go suspensions and also indicating the promotional effect of oh formation in the presence of go the obtained simulated values were in good accordance with the experimental values for ibuprofen degradation the degree of ibp degradation in the presence of srfa and go was also evaluated fig 12 showed that with an increase in srfa concentration from 0 to 2 mg l the degradation of ibuprofen increased although with small differences for o3 go fe3o4 suspensions in a clear view the influence of nom in the presence of go catalyst was however very little it is also evidenced from table 5 that both ozone exposure and oh exposure increased with an increase in srfa concentration however small difference in rct value to a slight variation in the degradation of ibuprofen for ozonation in the presence of go this is in agreement with a study by ikhlaq et al 2015 where they demonstrated the non participation of ha in the ibuprofen degradation in the catalytic ozonation process moreover it was noted that the degradation of ibuprofen in the presence of go catalysts was very similar to that in the o3 h2o2 process indicating that the surface modified go can be used as an alternative aop process in the future 4 conclusion this work for the first time demonstrated the kinetic role of o3 go catalytic process and its findings may assist future studies in predicting pharmaceutical decomposition in the presence of go the applicability of the modified rct concept was demonstrated using different go suspensions in the ozonation process the results revealed that the surface modified go suspensions go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 enhanced the o3 exposure and oh formation and were almost equivalent to traditional o3 h2o2 process contrastingly the go catalyst without any surface modification acted as oh scavenger which limits the reactivity of oh with organics additionally the initiation and promotion rate constants ki kp of go fe3o4 and go tio2 fe3o4 suspension were found to be one order higher than those of go alone suspension on the other hand the inhibition rate constants determined for go suspensions had a wider variation for go alone and surface modified go suspensions therefore the lower participation of go alone suspension in oh formation to the lower initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants when compared with go fe3o4 suspension it was also found that the presence of srfa along with a go fe3o4 suspension induced more organic degradation but the effect was minimal compared to o3 h2o2 process these results suggest that a substrate modified go suspension can be utilized as a future alternative aop more in depth knowledge is required on the applicability of go in the real water situation such as in wastewater and natural water the stability of go catalysts requires testing in the ozonation process which may provide the necessary information for designing the experimental setup and operational parameters for water and wastewater

19694,wastewater treatment plants have widely been described as a significant source of odour nuisance which has led to an increase of neighbourhood complaints therefore to mitigate the negative impact of odours the detection and analysis of these emissions are required this paper presents a measurement system based on an electronic nose for quantitative and qualitative odour analysis of samples collected from six different stages on a wastewater plant hence two features vectors were performed in order to represent quantitative trends of the gaseous mixture sampled on the facility in addition odour fingerprints and a pca were computed to discriminate odours from its sources and to detect relationships among the samples this approach also comprises a dynamic dilution olfactometer a pls regression model was performed to predict the odour concentration by the electronic nose in term of odour units per cubic meter the results show that the developed electronic nose is a promising and feasible instrument to characterize odours from wastewater plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords electronic nose wastewater treatment plant olfactometric analysis environmental odours 1 introduction malodorous released from wastewater treatment plants wwtps can cause health problems nuisance to the community and frequently neighbourhood complaints carrera chapela et al 2014 gostelow et al 2001 stuetz and nicolas 2001 indeed odours are recently considered as atmospheric contaminants capelli et al 2013 the management strategies to mitigate odour nuisance entail monitoring assessment and controlling the generated substances however this issue implies significant challenges because odours are complex gaseous mixtures which can be found at low concentrations at ambient conditions odours also exhibit high variability over time which can be related to weather conditions effluent load characteristics and others specific features the random and temporal population activities relative to sewage disposal can also influence over odour emission bourgeois and stuetz 2002 frechen 2004 jeon et al 2009 mcginley and mcginley 2008 muñoz et al 2010 stuetz et al 1999a wilson 2012 in addition to the complexity smell perception involves a subjective interpretation that varies according to many factors therefore to successfully assess odours emissions the use of suitable measurement instruments is required there are different techniques to analyze gases and odours detectors and gases analysers provide information about specific gases concentration in the odorant mixture the more complex gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometers gc ms chin et al 2017 and also with sulphur chemoluminescence detector sun et al 2014 can be used to identify and quantify potential odorant compounds usually expressed in ppm or ppb however it is not possible to characterize an odour as a whole by only analysing its individual components blanes vidal et al 2009 qu et al 2008 stuetz et al 1999a this kind of measurements does not encompass the gas mixture interactions suppression synergism hypoadditivity and linear sum which might lead to uncertain environmental assessment moreover the gases and their respective concentrations on the odorant mixtures cause different effects on human odour perception capurro et al 2012 kim and kim 2014 kuebler et al 2011 despite that analyses by gc ms provide accurate and reproducible measurements the cost of the analyses and the restriction to perform measurements in the laboratory not in situ are other drawbacks that constrain the use of gc ms the terms odorant and odour must be explained an odorant is a gaseous chemical component which stimulates the human olfactory system while an odour is the sensorial response of the olfactory organ when sniffing certain volatile substances brattoli et al 2011 gostelow et al 2001 muñoz et al 2010 for odour measurements the dynamic olfactometry is the more applied methodology capelli et al 2008b this technique employs an olfactometer combined with human assessors an olfactometer is an instrument that performs controlled dilutions of a gaseous sample then exposing them to the assessors panel and compute results the assessors are certified experts with certain capabilities to sniff previously selected through different tests then the results of odour concentration are quantified in odour unit per cubic meter o u m 3 this measuring unit represents the number of dilutions with neutral air odourless that are necessary to the odorous sample achieves its odour detection threshold the concentration at which there is a 50 probability of detectability by the human assessors gostelow et al 2001 for this reason this technique is the more appropriate method to characterize the odours released to the atmosphere indeed most environmental odour regulations in different countries and municipalities are based on the odour concentration in o u m 3 brancher et al 2017 although olfactometry is expensive time consuming and presents lower repeatability and accuracy due to its subjective nature brattoli et al 2011 the so called electronic nose e nose is another kind of instrument which can be employed for odours assessment capelli et al 2008b muñoz et al 2010 the e nose in a simple way mimics the mammalian olfactory system in term of sensory response and information processing arshak et al 2004 these instruments mainly contain an array of sensors with cross sensitivities and an appropriate patterns recognition system capable of recognising simple or complex odours gardner and bartlett 1994 there are some relevant features that distinguish the e noses regarding the rest of the gas odour measurement systems these concomitantly support gases and odours analyses as well as temperature humidity wind velocity and others variables abdullah et al 2012 dentoni et al 2012 allowing continuous monitoring of input odour data and also performing both qualitative and quantitative analysis for continuous odour monitoring can be used to estimate odour impact on the neighbourhood in real time support rapid information for population acquire data of high odour peaks over short time scales capture of extreme odour events and even for a proactive purpose to detect odours before their impact on surrounding areas bourgeois and stuetz 2002 capelli et al 2008a purenne et al 2007 a relate difficult from e noses is that the non specific gas sensors can respond to both odorous and odourless substances in fact this is a drawback of e noses not only for environmental odour applications the low sensitivity of gas sensors to the odours threshold is another problem of e noses boeker 2014 however to environmental odour analysis these systems are an interesting choice and they have been successfully applied in several assessments the development of an electronic nose comprises different stages that embrace the selection of the sensor array and the conditioning circuits the processing and signal acquisition hardware as well as the signal processing training and analysis of data as concerning the selection of sensors each sensor should maximize the overall sensitivity providing different selectivity profiles over the range of application to the target odour phaisangittisagul et al 2010 then a first step consists in obtaining several features from each sensor dynamic response validating them and picking the main features which characterize the odours under study this selection of the sensors strongly depends on the application and it is needed when classification performance cost and technology limitations are issues of concern phaisangittisagul et al 2010 the next stages in processing the e nose data include data signal pre processing feature extraction feature selection classification regression clustering and validation that way several methods from statistical pattern recognition artificial neural networks chemometrics and machine learning has been used to process electronic nose data gutierrez osuna 2002 frequently gas odour monitoring systems only comprise one kind of measurement device nevertheless it is also relevant to correlate outputs from different instruments this integration usually provides more detailed and encompassed outcomes abdullah et al 2012 brattoli et al 2011 muñoz et al 2010 sohn et al 2008 the analysis of environmental odours demands some difficult tasks hence it can be supported by the combination of results from various measurement instruments in order to obtain more representative data about substances evaluated for instance coupling olfactometry with gc ms gc ms o allows the identification of odour active compounds which indicate the relevance of some gases as odorants for this demand emerge another possibility correlations between e noses and olfactometry which can allowed portable and fast odour analysis in term of odour concentrations it can be used as a public tool to attend cases of complaints or to evaluate odour episodes that cause impacts on the populations brattoli et al 2011 purenne et al 2007 several measurement instruments have been used for environmental applications alam and saeed 2013 bootsmaa et al 2014 capelli et al 2013 de melo lisboa et al 2009 wilson 2012 including the assessment of odours emitted from wwtps there are reported e noses responses correlated with olfactometry analysis to supply quantitative results from wastewater odours purenne et al 2007 zarra et al 2014 guz et al 2015 performed a comparison of e nose response to the standard physical chemical parameters of treated wastewater while zarra et al 2009 2014 compared and evaluated different odour measurement methods for wastewater odours rajbansi et al 2014 presented an assessment of odours from a sewage wastewater in terms of odour intensity by human assessors and gc ms a portable and commercial e nose pen3 in conjunction with gc ms was employed to discriminate between alkaline stabilized biosolids treated at different doses romero flores et al 2017 a sophisticated network of e noses to quantify odours at montreal wwtp was reported by purenne et al 2007 this system used correlations with olfactometry to calibrate the e noses and also employed these results as input data to an atmospheric dispersion model various e noses have also been applied as a single instrument to wastewater odours assessment capelli et al 2008a proposed a system with three e noses for continuous monitoring of environmental odours at specific receptors around a wwtp in this approach was identified the major odour source in the facility and was also estimated the odour impact on the neighbourhood the e nose presented by stuetz et al 1999b was able to discriminate odour samples from three different sources raw sewage settled sewage and final effluent franke et al 2009 represented qualitative differences among sewer samples through sensors profiles features in a polar graph while öztürk et al 2009 obtained an intensity response of quartz crystal microbalance qcm sensor array then the peaks of these input signals were used to infer a primary odours discrimination among samples from biological treatment unit sedimentation tank and inlet unit nicolas et al 2000 implemented a classification model through discriminant analysis da and bourgeois and stuetz 2002 used pca to cluster samples collected on the inlet of a wwtp another application was presented by nake et al 2005 which employed two portable commercial e noses to analyze samples of outdoor locations near a wastewater facility however the three data classes identified were overlapping and also the observations were spread in the pca graph making it difficult to establish appropriate clusters for qualitative assessment of environmental odours the e noses can use various processing tools pca is one of commonly method used to discriminate odour patterns through the pca the input data with n dimensions is transformed in a new dimensional space where each dimension axes is orthogonal to the others the new axes called principal components are linear combinations of input data and these are uncorrelated thus the principal components are organized decreasingly from maximum to the minimum variance that can be adequately computed graphically the first axis is located in the direction of greatest data variation and the second perpendicularly then the variables under study can be represented in the pca space plotted by the so called scores in a 2d or 3d graph afterward data patterns can be established according to the proximity of scores bro and smilde 2014 haykin 2005 romero flores et al 2017 linear discriminant analysis lda is another tool that can be employed to distinguish data groups basically this supervised classification method allows achieving an optimal classes separation from a linear combination of data this procedure is based on creating linear functions to maximizing the ratio of the between group variance to the within group variance this criterion is the main difference with pca therefore from the linear function target data can be classified in term of classes boeker 2014 romero flores et al 2017 sironi et al 2007 despite the advantages and potential of the e noses the use of these instruments to carry out an extensive analysis of wastewater odours has not been completely explored for instance to discriminate the odours sources inside a wwtp in a comprehensive way this kind of assessment could be useful to identify sources responsible for odour nuisance events consequently a localized control action could be executed in order to restore the correct operation of the process affected or even to adjust some plant functionalities for proactive purposes this study presents the application of an e nose for qualitative and quantitative odour analysis from a wwtp odour samples from six different stages in a wastewater facility were analysed the data acquired was processed by the e nose in order to establish quantitative vectors features along the treatment stages and to discriminate the samples origin a dynamic dilution olfactometer combined with human assessors was also used a correlation between the e nose and the olfactometer results was modelled by pls to predict the odour concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 electronic nose analysis the e nose is based on a previous system developed in the laboratory valiente romero 2014 the instrument comprises a gas sensor array an automatic fluid transportation line a microcontroller board and software processing tools to carry out qualitative and quantitative analysis of odour samples to select the gas sensors the following criteria were considered high sensitivity to the main odorants emitted from wwtps cross sensitivity sensors suitable for e nose analyses minimal number of sensors and measurement channels for less complexity and cost of the system and because excessive number of sensors can increase noise and processing time without useful information previous studies of similar sensor array configuration for this kind of application which have been tested with successful results and use of commercially available sensors then in this approach five mos sensors manufactured by figaro figaro inc japan were used tgs2611 tgs2602 tgs2610 tgs826 and tgs2600 resistive mos sensors are relatively small size low cost and these have been widely used to detect odorants from sewage treatment activities capelli et al 2008a guz et al 2015 nicolas et al 2000 purenne et al 2007 zarra et al 2014 as recommended by the manufacturers these type of sensors requires a simple conditioning circuit hence to measure the sensor resistance output a typical resistive voltage divider was used the input gases induce chemical changes on the sensing surface which causes variations in the electrical conductivity of these devices according to the manufacturer figaro 2004a b 2005a b 2006 in table 1 are presented the sensors employed and their corresponding sensitivities to the gases this sensors response capability matched with some of the major odorants emitted from wwtps mainly h2s and nh3 in addition by the sensors used on the e nose the emission of other odorants can be indirectly measured by chemicals that are by products of anaerobical activity such as methane ethanol and hydrogen de mes et al 2003 mos sensors also present cross sensitivity or non selectivity which indicates that the sensors respond towards different input compounds the voltage values from the five sensors were sampled with an inbuilt analog to digital converter adc in the arduino mega 2560 microcontroller board atmel u s a this board is coupled via rs232 with a virtual instrument vi developed in labview platform national instruments usa this vi running on the computer to command the acquisition process stores data from sensors shows graphical information about electrical profiles and manages the fluid transportation line the fluid transportation line is mainly composed by three solenoid valves teflon and silicone tubing a sensors chamber a charcoal filter to obtain the baseline from ambient air and a vacuum pump this delivery block allows establishing a four stage sequence for measurement baseline passing reference gas rise transient passing odour steady state maintaining odour inside the sensor chamber and recovery transient passing reference gas again the amplitude versus time response of a gas sensor has a pulse shape output which is obtained by modulating the passage of the sample and the odourless reference through the sensors chamber this dynamic response from an array of sensors contains qualitative and quantitative information to characterize the gas under analysis a typical modulation profile comprises the four steps mentioned above baseline rise transient steady state and recovery transient arshak et al 2004 a sequence of operations to deliver the gas under analysis from the odour sample to the sensors chamber is carried out data acquisition from sensors output is performed from the beginning of this sequence duration of these steps can vary from seconds to minutes in the e noses based on mos sensors arshak et al 2004 the time duration of steps must be sufficient for the sensors to reach the steady stage for all odour sources and to return to the baseline in addition consuming the minimum volume of the sample is required because olfactometry analysis demands tens of liters 2 1 1 data pre processing after pulses acquisition a data pre processing stage was carried out this is a basic stage in the e noses because the sensors outputs can present drifts and redundant information which should be treated before performing the instrument response by this procedure the signals from sensor array vrl were adjusted and main features were extracted data pre processing in e noses mainly involves signal filtering baseline manipulation normalization and feature extraction campo garcía 2016 ferreira 2015 marco and gutiérrez gálvez 2012 for this application a moving average filter was applied to each voltage data profile in order to remove random errors smith 1999 then a baseline manipulation differential method was computed by the difference between each digital sample of the profile and the baseline value thus reducing noise and sensor drifts arshak et al 2004 gutierrez osuna and nagle 1999 pearce et al 2003 afterward the euclidian norm for data fitting to non dimensional values was determined it allows correcting the scale difference between dataset what is a requirement for any subsequent data comparison pearce et al 2003 during feature extraction different parameters from pulses with higher discrimination capability were computed and picked for example the maximum voltage vmax and rising transient slope to perform this data pre processing stage a software code was developed in matlab 2017a mathworks u s a as specific applications tool 2 1 2 odours analysis quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to characterize gaseous mixture and odour emissions from a wwtp firstly a quantitative trend of the sensors responses across the treatment stages in the facility was associated with the compounds released for this purpose two features vectors called v1 and v2 were computed from the vmax of the electrical profiles both vectors were defined with six elements each performing one element from treatment stage then v1 was a vector of means with each element computed from vmax means of all sensors at each location while the v2 was another vector of means performed from vmax means of the three sensors with the highest responses at each location too by this procedure it is possible to represent in a simple way the emission of the gaseous mixture as a whole due to the non selectivity response of the mos sensors then from v1 and v2 performed at each treatment stage relationships about the gaseous mixtures emissions among different locations of the plant were obtained a qualitative analysis by odour fingerprints and pca was computed to discriminate odours from its source in the wwtp pca is an unsupervised multivariate technique which describes the data in term of variance the scores produced represent the maximum variance and it may be plotted in few dimensions this tool is mainly used to identify data clusters as well as to reduce the dimensionality by a linear compression of data pca is a simple and fast method and it is useful to perform a qualitative analysis of odours marco and gutiérrez gálvez 2012 scott et al 2007 regarding quantitative analysis a correlation between e nose and olfactometric outputs was also computed to estimate mos sensors response in o u m 3 this relationship was modelled by a pls regression technique which is frequently used in the chemical sensor array marco and gutiérrez gálvez 2012 wold et al 2001 synthetically pls is a linear multivariate method for relating two groups of data by regression coefficients each group expressed as a matrix represents independent and dependent variables in this case the feature extracted from electrical profiles at the pre processing stage is considered the independent variable while the olfactometric test output is the dependent variable so the regression coefficients were firstly computed from e nose and olfactometry responses typically these data set are called as training or calibration set afterward it is possible to predict new input data in term of o u m 3 by the training matrix modelled wold et al 2001 the correlation coefficient r square and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the predictive model the coefficient r square indicates the existence of a linear relationship between model variables while rmse measures how well the model adjusts the data 2 2 olfactometry analysis the olfactometric measurements were performed by using a dynamic dilution olfactometer odile 3500 odotech canada according to the european standard en 13725 cen 2003 the instrument is composed by an air purification system a pressurized vessel a dilution unit a six cell olfactometric table and an operation software running on a personal computer dilutions were made decreasingly and logarithmically and then exposed to a panel of six certified experts the gas concentrations were quantified in odour units per cubic meter o u m 3 2 3 experimental procedure the study was carried out in a three stage procedure odour sampling measuring and data processing in the first stage odour samples from a wastewater facility were collected in sampling bags and carried to the laboratory at the second stage each sample was measured by the electronic nose and by the olfactometer according to en 13725 standard cen 2003 a 30 h time lapse between sampling and measuring stages was respected finally acquired data were processed in order to obtain the response of the instrument 2 3 1 odours sampling the odour sampling was conducted on a wwtp in criciúma southern santa catarina state in brazil the wwtp is composed by a preliminary system with screening and grit chamber flotation tank two parallel upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors and three parallel settling tanks firstly were identified six locations as potentially the main sources of odours within the wwtp these sampling points were located on the exhaust of the preliminary treatment which leads to biofilter inlet bioinlet after the biofilter biooutlet on the flotation tank flotation on the exhaust line of one uasb reactor flare on a settling tank settling and on a sludge thickener sludge sampling was carried out according to the source type bioinlet biooutlet and flare were point sources where direct sampling was used flotation settling and sludge were area sources flux chamber sampling was applied a preliminary sampling test was performed on 27 10 2016 for this purpose only three sampling bags on the area sources were collected flotation settling and sludge then two sampling campaigns were conducted under different wwtp operating regimes to more broadly characterize the emissions odour sampling was carried out on 31 10 2016 campaign 1 and 10 11 2016 campaign 2 the campaign 1 was conducted on a monday which according to the wwtp operators is a critical day due to the habit of the population of washing cars and clothes on the weekends in fact a lot of foam was observed during sampling on that day the household detergents sulphonates influence in the organic sulphur content of sewage effluents gostelow et al 2001 while the campaign 2 occurred on a thursday which is considered as a normal operating day one sampling bag was collected on each point for each campaign different equipment materials and instruments were selected to odour sampling procedure vacuum pumps model moa gast manufacturing usa were employed these have a metallic interior are oilless and were cleaned prior to sampling polyurethane and silicone tubing which have inert and odourless features were used as well as glass and teflon valves coupled to sampling bags nalophan bags with a capacity of 60 l approximately were employed this kind of bag preserves the sample gas composition during a certain time due to its adsorption properties in addition at the three area sources the flux chamber method was applied this device was conceived as stated on epa s document klenbusch 1986 two flowmeters model vfa 24 dwyer visi float usa two thermocouples type k and an adsorption system activated charcoal to clean the sweep air were also used 2 3 2 odours measuring each sampling bag collected at the previous stage was measured in a sequence by the e nose and olfactometer described above then five replicates per bag were selected and five electrical profiles per sensor were performed via the e nose obtaining 25 pulses per odour sample the time intervals for each profile sequence were experimentally determined as 50 s baseline 50 s rise transient 1 s steady state and 75 s recovery transient this measuring stage was performed in the laboratory of air quality control lcqar at federal university of santa catarina ufsc 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensor array response by the e nose in fig 1 the sensors response to odours from six sources is synthetically presented the bars amplitude represents the maximum voltage vmax in term of means and standard deviations computed from each odour sample in campaign 1 the vmax parameter was the feature extracted at the pre processing stage the names of locations displayed in fig 1 were ordered on the x axis according to the sequence of treatment stages in the wwtp starting from bioinlet to sludge in the previous graph each sensor showed readable output signals expressed by the amplitudes of the vmax means registered between 0 05 v tgs2600 sludge and 2 18 v tgs2610 flare from the previous figure can also be observed low dispersion values around the means represented by standard deviations less than 0 06 v on that point only the responses from tgs2611 tgs2610 and tgs2600 to the flare samples showed highs values of standard deviation equals to 0 41 0 41 and 0 28 v respectively it was caused by one profile for each sensor which presented slightly higher amplitude than the other four profiles in addition a cross sensitivity response of the sensors to the target odours can be confirmed which is indicated by the broad variability among the vmax sensors outputs it suggests that the instrument is capable to acquire wide and representative input data from the samples collected this behaviour is verified through the large amplitude difference among the same sensor across all treatment stages and all sensors within each stage being that only two minimal differences were computed these values were 0 01 and 0 001 v for tgs2602 flare tgs2602 settling and tgs2610 sludge tgs826 sludge respectively also the vmax value of each sensor to the bioinlet was higher than the biooutlet which implies on gas concentrations reductions it suggests a proper biofilter treatment in terms of gaseous compounds removal different profiles from sensor responses were found among sampling locations for example tgs2602 sensor showed different amplitude levels between the exhaust line of the preliminary treatment bioinlet and biooutlet and the other odour sources it suggests a greater presence of hydrogen sulphide and or ammonia in comparison to the other sampling sites from fig 1 can also be observed that higher sensors reactions were obtained in flotation and flare points sensors that stood out were tgs2610 tgs2611 and tgs2600 this response might be linked to the turbulence caused on the flotation tank which leads to gases release from the liquid phase higher reactions on the flare point might be due to its nature it exhausts gases from a uasb reactor which induces microbial anaerobic activity and the generation of gases vapours such as methane hydrogen and ethanol to quantitatively represent the concentration of the gaseous mixture across the treatment stages the feature vectors v1 and v2 were presented in fig 2 a and 2b from fig 2a and b the v1 and v2 showed a decrease between the beginning bioinlet and the end sludge of the process in the wwtp mainly in the campaign 1 in general campaign 1 responses were higher than responses of campaign 2 the flare point with the higher response it might be related to the fact that flare supply a gaseous outlet from a uasb reactor since these anaerobic digesters have a tendency to emit odorants and gases therefore it is expected the most significant sensor responses for on flare source the smallest values were observed in the last stages of the treatment which makes sense because most of the organic matter that could possibly be digested by bacteria and emit odours was removed by the previous reactor uasb similar profiles can observe by comparing v1 and v2 in each graph and v1 vector presented lower amplitude than v2 for all treatment stages thus v1 feature vector provides a moderate response along the sampling points and it can be useful for example to represent the operation regime in the facility while v2 presents more sensibility which may aid to report possible events of sudden increases from gases various parameters performed from v1 and v2 features were presented in table 2 the relationship between vmax from sludge and vmax from bioinlet was presented in campaign 1 it was 10 1 and 10 2 for v1 and v2 respectively while in campaign 2 the relationship was 35 7 and 45 1 for v1 and v2 respectively then from this parameter was also estimated the gaseous mixture reduction by the plant in table 2 the treatment of the gaseous mixture by the biofilter was also presented it was estimated through the relationship between vmax from biooutlet and vmax from bioinlet these results were close for both campaigns ranged between 85 8 and 87 7 then the gases reduction by the biofilter was also estimated indicating that its performance was stable around 13 4 this parameter also suggests a gaseous mixture removal by this treatment stage of approximately 13 for both campaigns these results do not provide information in terms of odour concentrations for this purpose a multivariate regression was developed subsequently 3 2 odour fingerprints the maximum of the electrical profiles from each sensor vmax was represented in two polar graphs fig 3 a campaign 1 and fig 3b campaign 2 the vmax value showed in both figures was the compute average from five replicates this magnitude was plotted in five axes one per sensor then as each sensor is sensitive to various gaseous compounds the shapes obtained are visual qualitative indicators of the samples called fingerprint from the previous figures can be perceived different shapes which represent odour samples points according to their original location in the plant indeed a clear pattern variation among the samples were displayed in campaign 1 fig 3a is noteworthy the differences among the shapes only bioinlet and biooutlet treatment stages were similarly represented in fig 3b campaign 2 different patterns can also be observed mainly from flare source however the radius of vmax decreased and some shapes were alike for instance settling sludge and flotation biooutlet visualizing vmax data through a relative sensor response allows to distinguish among different odour sources from a wwtp nevertheless to more explore the sensor array response another qualitative odour analysis by a pca was developed 3 3 discrimination of wwtp odours the vmax was also the parameter used as input data to the pca model results of these unsupervised technique were presented in fig 4 a and fig 4b in these graphs each plot represents its corresponding sensor signal being that five pulses per sample were acquired through fig 4a is possible to discriminate six clusters related to the six odours sources sampled in the campaign 1 the plots of each group were close and all groups were located separately which led to identifying six odour patterns from fig 4b can also distinguish the same number of clusters however the observations of settling and sludge were close almost overlapping a hypothesis about this proximity is a difference between the effluents features and or wwtp operating regime at campaign 2 regarding campaign 1 sampling weather conditions in term of temperature and relative humidity were similar for both campaigns therefore these variables must not have influenced in a significant way for this odour assessment also for campaign 2 the plots from flotation samples were spread in the graph but even so they were disjointed from the others observations 3 4 prediction of odour concentration to estimate the odour concentrations from wwtp emissions a prediction model by pls regression technique was applied to achieve more broad input data in this analysis was also include the responses from the samplings bags of the preliminary test averages of vmax and rising transient slope from the five replicates of each sensor were the parameters selected as one of the input variables to the pls model the other input was the odour concentration value obtained by the olfactometric assessments related to the e nose a data input matrix with 15 10 observations x variables elements was arranged the columns contain orderly the five vmax values and the five transient slopes values for each sensor while in the rows were fixed these variables for the 15 sampling points the olfactometry input data were organized in a 15 1 matrix where each row represents their corresponding observation in o u m 3 from these data the regression coefficients were computed and then the predicted model output was computed as odours concentrations values fig 5 a and fig 5b in fig 5 blue circles represent the modelled odours data the blue dashed line shows the fit and the black dashed lines represent the error bounds for a 95 of confidence level from fig 5a was considered three observations as outliers black circles due to these points were out of scale then by excluding the anomalous values the fit was improved fig 5b the predicted concentrations are distributed around the ideal line 1 1 it was confirmed by slope and intercept values with the y axis of fitting line equals to 0 9597 and 410 8 o u m 3 respectively however a slight skewness around the fitting line was perceived the value of r square was 0 9967 for a 95 of confidence level which showed a linear dependence the coefficient rmse was equal to 1 17 104 indicating that from the model output is expected an error range around this value due to the rmse value represents only the 0 17 of the measurements range it can be considered appropriate for this application through the pls components used in the multivariable model most of the variances in predictor variables and response matrix was explained the pls model performed was able to establish a linear relationship between the e nose output and the olfactometry analysis then a global calibration curve for the whole plant was obtained it allows to predict the odour concentrations released from all treatment stages in the wwtp by the e nose 4 conclusions in this study a wwtp odours samples characterization by using an e nose was presented samples collected from six locations which represented the main odour emitting sources in the plant were measured bioinlet biooutlet flotation flare settling and sludge both quantitative and qualitative analysis were performed by this approach some steps for analysing the samples from wwtp were proposed setting of trend functions to represent the emitted gaseous mixture across the plant for this purpose two features vectors called v1 and v2 were proposed both features represent a quantitative approximation about compounds released in term of vmax variations these vectors can be useful to represent the operation regime of the plant and to report possible events of sudden increases from substances through this multi sensor analysis response is possible to establish a primary assessment about the gaseous mixture in a simple way which can assist to estimate and compare the compounds emitted from specific locations in the wwtp calculation of parameters from v1 and v2 to estimate the efficiency in the treatment of the gaseous mixture by the plant and through the biofilter then a relationship between sludge final treatment stage and bioinlet first treatment stage of emitted compounds was presented others relationship could be computed like at biofilter stage in addition the reduction of gaseous substances by the plant was estimated which suggests a removal of approximately 90 and 60 of compounds emitted in campaign 1 and in campaign 2 respectively at the biofilter treatment stage the gases reduction was around 13 for both campaigns to perform odour fingerprints and pca qualitative analyses of compounds emitted at each stage these tools allowed to identify odours patterns according to the treatment stage in the facility basically these assessments would help to identify possible fails at wwtp locations odours emissions emergence of hazardous substances or other anomalies in the wastewater treatment process prediction of odour concentrations in term of o u m 3 to provide a quantitative response according to the european standard en 13725 for this purpose a pls regression between the e nose and the olfactometry analysis was performed the model output showed an appropriate performance with r square and rmse equals to 0 9967 and 1 17 104 respectively the results showed that the e nose proposed is capable of measuring odour samples from a wwtp with no large input data as concerning as the results from feature vectors odour fingerprint and pca this instrument can be employed as a single device for qualitative and quantitative analysis the instrument can provide some parameters to monitor the efficiency of odour treatment stages as seen on biofilter as a result the e nose could be a suitable tool to perform early warning responses related to odours released in the wastewater plant this instrument allows to infer and register irregular operations in the stages of wastewater treatment and consequently take control actions even in a proactive way to decrease the unpleasant odours released by the e nose anaerobic degradation in the stages of the facility can also be indirectly identified it would assist the odours management of the plant in order to establish proper maintenance cycles and even to adjust the dimensions of each treatment stage this approach supports a broad response as a combination of results in term of odour concentration and qualitative information it would be a fast and low cost tool projected to recognize irregularity events emphasizing that for this early warning purpose it is not necessary the use of precise and complex instruments additionally the e nose could be used as an in situ instrument to monitor the odours from a wwtp further samples analysis at different seasons and under different wwtp operating conditions could be performed more physico chemical information about the sewage effluents would be handled in order to associate it with the gaseous compound emissions acknowledgments the

19694,wastewater treatment plants have widely been described as a significant source of odour nuisance which has led to an increase of neighbourhood complaints therefore to mitigate the negative impact of odours the detection and analysis of these emissions are required this paper presents a measurement system based on an electronic nose for quantitative and qualitative odour analysis of samples collected from six different stages on a wastewater plant hence two features vectors were performed in order to represent quantitative trends of the gaseous mixture sampled on the facility in addition odour fingerprints and a pca were computed to discriminate odours from its sources and to detect relationships among the samples this approach also comprises a dynamic dilution olfactometer a pls regression model was performed to predict the odour concentration by the electronic nose in term of odour units per cubic meter the results show that the developed electronic nose is a promising and feasible instrument to characterize odours from wastewater plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords electronic nose wastewater treatment plant olfactometric analysis environmental odours 1 introduction malodorous released from wastewater treatment plants wwtps can cause health problems nuisance to the community and frequently neighbourhood complaints carrera chapela et al 2014 gostelow et al 2001 stuetz and nicolas 2001 indeed odours are recently considered as atmospheric contaminants capelli et al 2013 the management strategies to mitigate odour nuisance entail monitoring assessment and controlling the generated substances however this issue implies significant challenges because odours are complex gaseous mixtures which can be found at low concentrations at ambient conditions odours also exhibit high variability over time which can be related to weather conditions effluent load characteristics and others specific features the random and temporal population activities relative to sewage disposal can also influence over odour emission bourgeois and stuetz 2002 frechen 2004 jeon et al 2009 mcginley and mcginley 2008 muñoz et al 2010 stuetz et al 1999a wilson 2012 in addition to the complexity smell perception involves a subjective interpretation that varies according to many factors therefore to successfully assess odours emissions the use of suitable measurement instruments is required there are different techniques to analyze gases and odours detectors and gases analysers provide information about specific gases concentration in the odorant mixture the more complex gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometers gc ms chin et al 2017 and also with sulphur chemoluminescence detector sun et al 2014 can be used to identify and quantify potential odorant compounds usually expressed in ppm or ppb however it is not possible to characterize an odour as a whole by only analysing its individual components blanes vidal et al 2009 qu et al 2008 stuetz et al 1999a this kind of measurements does not encompass the gas mixture interactions suppression synergism hypoadditivity and linear sum which might lead to uncertain environmental assessment moreover the gases and their respective concentrations on the odorant mixtures cause different effects on human odour perception capurro et al 2012 kim and kim 2014 kuebler et al 2011 despite that analyses by gc ms provide accurate and reproducible measurements the cost of the analyses and the restriction to perform measurements in the laboratory not in situ are other drawbacks that constrain the use of gc ms the terms odorant and odour must be explained an odorant is a gaseous chemical component which stimulates the human olfactory system while an odour is the sensorial response of the olfactory organ when sniffing certain volatile substances brattoli et al 2011 gostelow et al 2001 muñoz et al 2010 for odour measurements the dynamic olfactometry is the more applied methodology capelli et al 2008b this technique employs an olfactometer combined with human assessors an olfactometer is an instrument that performs controlled dilutions of a gaseous sample then exposing them to the assessors panel and compute results the assessors are certified experts with certain capabilities to sniff previously selected through different tests then the results of odour concentration are quantified in odour unit per cubic meter o u m 3 this measuring unit represents the number of dilutions with neutral air odourless that are necessary to the odorous sample achieves its odour detection threshold the concentration at which there is a 50 probability of detectability by the human assessors gostelow et al 2001 for this reason this technique is the more appropriate method to characterize the odours released to the atmosphere indeed most environmental odour regulations in different countries and municipalities are based on the odour concentration in o u m 3 brancher et al 2017 although olfactometry is expensive time consuming and presents lower repeatability and accuracy due to its subjective nature brattoli et al 2011 the so called electronic nose e nose is another kind of instrument which can be employed for odours assessment capelli et al 2008b muñoz et al 2010 the e nose in a simple way mimics the mammalian olfactory system in term of sensory response and information processing arshak et al 2004 these instruments mainly contain an array of sensors with cross sensitivities and an appropriate patterns recognition system capable of recognising simple or complex odours gardner and bartlett 1994 there are some relevant features that distinguish the e noses regarding the rest of the gas odour measurement systems these concomitantly support gases and odours analyses as well as temperature humidity wind velocity and others variables abdullah et al 2012 dentoni et al 2012 allowing continuous monitoring of input odour data and also performing both qualitative and quantitative analysis for continuous odour monitoring can be used to estimate odour impact on the neighbourhood in real time support rapid information for population acquire data of high odour peaks over short time scales capture of extreme odour events and even for a proactive purpose to detect odours before their impact on surrounding areas bourgeois and stuetz 2002 capelli et al 2008a purenne et al 2007 a relate difficult from e noses is that the non specific gas sensors can respond to both odorous and odourless substances in fact this is a drawback of e noses not only for environmental odour applications the low sensitivity of gas sensors to the odours threshold is another problem of e noses boeker 2014 however to environmental odour analysis these systems are an interesting choice and they have been successfully applied in several assessments the development of an electronic nose comprises different stages that embrace the selection of the sensor array and the conditioning circuits the processing and signal acquisition hardware as well as the signal processing training and analysis of data as concerning the selection of sensors each sensor should maximize the overall sensitivity providing different selectivity profiles over the range of application to the target odour phaisangittisagul et al 2010 then a first step consists in obtaining several features from each sensor dynamic response validating them and picking the main features which characterize the odours under study this selection of the sensors strongly depends on the application and it is needed when classification performance cost and technology limitations are issues of concern phaisangittisagul et al 2010 the next stages in processing the e nose data include data signal pre processing feature extraction feature selection classification regression clustering and validation that way several methods from statistical pattern recognition artificial neural networks chemometrics and machine learning has been used to process electronic nose data gutierrez osuna 2002 frequently gas odour monitoring systems only comprise one kind of measurement device nevertheless it is also relevant to correlate outputs from different instruments this integration usually provides more detailed and encompassed outcomes abdullah et al 2012 brattoli et al 2011 muñoz et al 2010 sohn et al 2008 the analysis of environmental odours demands some difficult tasks hence it can be supported by the combination of results from various measurement instruments in order to obtain more representative data about substances evaluated for instance coupling olfactometry with gc ms gc ms o allows the identification of odour active compounds which indicate the relevance of some gases as odorants for this demand emerge another possibility correlations between e noses and olfactometry which can allowed portable and fast odour analysis in term of odour concentrations it can be used as a public tool to attend cases of complaints or to evaluate odour episodes that cause impacts on the populations brattoli et al 2011 purenne et al 2007 several measurement instruments have been used for environmental applications alam and saeed 2013 bootsmaa et al 2014 capelli et al 2013 de melo lisboa et al 2009 wilson 2012 including the assessment of odours emitted from wwtps there are reported e noses responses correlated with olfactometry analysis to supply quantitative results from wastewater odours purenne et al 2007 zarra et al 2014 guz et al 2015 performed a comparison of e nose response to the standard physical chemical parameters of treated wastewater while zarra et al 2009 2014 compared and evaluated different odour measurement methods for wastewater odours rajbansi et al 2014 presented an assessment of odours from a sewage wastewater in terms of odour intensity by human assessors and gc ms a portable and commercial e nose pen3 in conjunction with gc ms was employed to discriminate between alkaline stabilized biosolids treated at different doses romero flores et al 2017 a sophisticated network of e noses to quantify odours at montreal wwtp was reported by purenne et al 2007 this system used correlations with olfactometry to calibrate the e noses and also employed these results as input data to an atmospheric dispersion model various e noses have also been applied as a single instrument to wastewater odours assessment capelli et al 2008a proposed a system with three e noses for continuous monitoring of environmental odours at specific receptors around a wwtp in this approach was identified the major odour source in the facility and was also estimated the odour impact on the neighbourhood the e nose presented by stuetz et al 1999b was able to discriminate odour samples from three different sources raw sewage settled sewage and final effluent franke et al 2009 represented qualitative differences among sewer samples through sensors profiles features in a polar graph while öztürk et al 2009 obtained an intensity response of quartz crystal microbalance qcm sensor array then the peaks of these input signals were used to infer a primary odours discrimination among samples from biological treatment unit sedimentation tank and inlet unit nicolas et al 2000 implemented a classification model through discriminant analysis da and bourgeois and stuetz 2002 used pca to cluster samples collected on the inlet of a wwtp another application was presented by nake et al 2005 which employed two portable commercial e noses to analyze samples of outdoor locations near a wastewater facility however the three data classes identified were overlapping and also the observations were spread in the pca graph making it difficult to establish appropriate clusters for qualitative assessment of environmental odours the e noses can use various processing tools pca is one of commonly method used to discriminate odour patterns through the pca the input data with n dimensions is transformed in a new dimensional space where each dimension axes is orthogonal to the others the new axes called principal components are linear combinations of input data and these are uncorrelated thus the principal components are organized decreasingly from maximum to the minimum variance that can be adequately computed graphically the first axis is located in the direction of greatest data variation and the second perpendicularly then the variables under study can be represented in the pca space plotted by the so called scores in a 2d or 3d graph afterward data patterns can be established according to the proximity of scores bro and smilde 2014 haykin 2005 romero flores et al 2017 linear discriminant analysis lda is another tool that can be employed to distinguish data groups basically this supervised classification method allows achieving an optimal classes separation from a linear combination of data this procedure is based on creating linear functions to maximizing the ratio of the between group variance to the within group variance this criterion is the main difference with pca therefore from the linear function target data can be classified in term of classes boeker 2014 romero flores et al 2017 sironi et al 2007 despite the advantages and potential of the e noses the use of these instruments to carry out an extensive analysis of wastewater odours has not been completely explored for instance to discriminate the odours sources inside a wwtp in a comprehensive way this kind of assessment could be useful to identify sources responsible for odour nuisance events consequently a localized control action could be executed in order to restore the correct operation of the process affected or even to adjust some plant functionalities for proactive purposes this study presents the application of an e nose for qualitative and quantitative odour analysis from a wwtp odour samples from six different stages in a wastewater facility were analysed the data acquired was processed by the e nose in order to establish quantitative vectors features along the treatment stages and to discriminate the samples origin a dynamic dilution olfactometer combined with human assessors was also used a correlation between the e nose and the olfactometer results was modelled by pls to predict the odour concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 electronic nose analysis the e nose is based on a previous system developed in the laboratory valiente romero 2014 the instrument comprises a gas sensor array an automatic fluid transportation line a microcontroller board and software processing tools to carry out qualitative and quantitative analysis of odour samples to select the gas sensors the following criteria were considered high sensitivity to the main odorants emitted from wwtps cross sensitivity sensors suitable for e nose analyses minimal number of sensors and measurement channels for less complexity and cost of the system and because excessive number of sensors can increase noise and processing time without useful information previous studies of similar sensor array configuration for this kind of application which have been tested with successful results and use of commercially available sensors then in this approach five mos sensors manufactured by figaro figaro inc japan were used tgs2611 tgs2602 tgs2610 tgs826 and tgs2600 resistive mos sensors are relatively small size low cost and these have been widely used to detect odorants from sewage treatment activities capelli et al 2008a guz et al 2015 nicolas et al 2000 purenne et al 2007 zarra et al 2014 as recommended by the manufacturers these type of sensors requires a simple conditioning circuit hence to measure the sensor resistance output a typical resistive voltage divider was used the input gases induce chemical changes on the sensing surface which causes variations in the electrical conductivity of these devices according to the manufacturer figaro 2004a b 2005a b 2006 in table 1 are presented the sensors employed and their corresponding sensitivities to the gases this sensors response capability matched with some of the major odorants emitted from wwtps mainly h2s and nh3 in addition by the sensors used on the e nose the emission of other odorants can be indirectly measured by chemicals that are by products of anaerobical activity such as methane ethanol and hydrogen de mes et al 2003 mos sensors also present cross sensitivity or non selectivity which indicates that the sensors respond towards different input compounds the voltage values from the five sensors were sampled with an inbuilt analog to digital converter adc in the arduino mega 2560 microcontroller board atmel u s a this board is coupled via rs232 with a virtual instrument vi developed in labview platform national instruments usa this vi running on the computer to command the acquisition process stores data from sensors shows graphical information about electrical profiles and manages the fluid transportation line the fluid transportation line is mainly composed by three solenoid valves teflon and silicone tubing a sensors chamber a charcoal filter to obtain the baseline from ambient air and a vacuum pump this delivery block allows establishing a four stage sequence for measurement baseline passing reference gas rise transient passing odour steady state maintaining odour inside the sensor chamber and recovery transient passing reference gas again the amplitude versus time response of a gas sensor has a pulse shape output which is obtained by modulating the passage of the sample and the odourless reference through the sensors chamber this dynamic response from an array of sensors contains qualitative and quantitative information to characterize the gas under analysis a typical modulation profile comprises the four steps mentioned above baseline rise transient steady state and recovery transient arshak et al 2004 a sequence of operations to deliver the gas under analysis from the odour sample to the sensors chamber is carried out data acquisition from sensors output is performed from the beginning of this sequence duration of these steps can vary from seconds to minutes in the e noses based on mos sensors arshak et al 2004 the time duration of steps must be sufficient for the sensors to reach the steady stage for all odour sources and to return to the baseline in addition consuming the minimum volume of the sample is required because olfactometry analysis demands tens of liters 2 1 1 data pre processing after pulses acquisition a data pre processing stage was carried out this is a basic stage in the e noses because the sensors outputs can present drifts and redundant information which should be treated before performing the instrument response by this procedure the signals from sensor array vrl were adjusted and main features were extracted data pre processing in e noses mainly involves signal filtering baseline manipulation normalization and feature extraction campo garcía 2016 ferreira 2015 marco and gutiérrez gálvez 2012 for this application a moving average filter was applied to each voltage data profile in order to remove random errors smith 1999 then a baseline manipulation differential method was computed by the difference between each digital sample of the profile and the baseline value thus reducing noise and sensor drifts arshak et al 2004 gutierrez osuna and nagle 1999 pearce et al 2003 afterward the euclidian norm for data fitting to non dimensional values was determined it allows correcting the scale difference between dataset what is a requirement for any subsequent data comparison pearce et al 2003 during feature extraction different parameters from pulses with higher discrimination capability were computed and picked for example the maximum voltage vmax and rising transient slope to perform this data pre processing stage a software code was developed in matlab 2017a mathworks u s a as specific applications tool 2 1 2 odours analysis quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to characterize gaseous mixture and odour emissions from a wwtp firstly a quantitative trend of the sensors responses across the treatment stages in the facility was associated with the compounds released for this purpose two features vectors called v1 and v2 were computed from the vmax of the electrical profiles both vectors were defined with six elements each performing one element from treatment stage then v1 was a vector of means with each element computed from vmax means of all sensors at each location while the v2 was another vector of means performed from vmax means of the three sensors with the highest responses at each location too by this procedure it is possible to represent in a simple way the emission of the gaseous mixture as a whole due to the non selectivity response of the mos sensors then from v1 and v2 performed at each treatment stage relationships about the gaseous mixtures emissions among different locations of the plant were obtained a qualitative analysis by odour fingerprints and pca was computed to discriminate odours from its source in the wwtp pca is an unsupervised multivariate technique which describes the data in term of variance the scores produced represent the maximum variance and it may be plotted in few dimensions this tool is mainly used to identify data clusters as well as to reduce the dimensionality by a linear compression of data pca is a simple and fast method and it is useful to perform a qualitative analysis of odours marco and gutiérrez gálvez 2012 scott et al 2007 regarding quantitative analysis a correlation between e nose and olfactometric outputs was also computed to estimate mos sensors response in o u m 3 this relationship was modelled by a pls regression technique which is frequently used in the chemical sensor array marco and gutiérrez gálvez 2012 wold et al 2001 synthetically pls is a linear multivariate method for relating two groups of data by regression coefficients each group expressed as a matrix represents independent and dependent variables in this case the feature extracted from electrical profiles at the pre processing stage is considered the independent variable while the olfactometric test output is the dependent variable so the regression coefficients were firstly computed from e nose and olfactometry responses typically these data set are called as training or calibration set afterward it is possible to predict new input data in term of o u m 3 by the training matrix modelled wold et al 2001 the correlation coefficient r square and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the predictive model the coefficient r square indicates the existence of a linear relationship between model variables while rmse measures how well the model adjusts the data 2 2 olfactometry analysis the olfactometric measurements were performed by using a dynamic dilution olfactometer odile 3500 odotech canada according to the european standard en 13725 cen 2003 the instrument is composed by an air purification system a pressurized vessel a dilution unit a six cell olfactometric table and an operation software running on a personal computer dilutions were made decreasingly and logarithmically and then exposed to a panel of six certified experts the gas concentrations were quantified in odour units per cubic meter o u m 3 2 3 experimental procedure the study was carried out in a three stage procedure odour sampling measuring and data processing in the first stage odour samples from a wastewater facility were collected in sampling bags and carried to the laboratory at the second stage each sample was measured by the electronic nose and by the olfactometer according to en 13725 standard cen 2003 a 30 h time lapse between sampling and measuring stages was respected finally acquired data were processed in order to obtain the response of the instrument 2 3 1 odours sampling the odour sampling was conducted on a wwtp in criciúma southern santa catarina state in brazil the wwtp is composed by a preliminary system with screening and grit chamber flotation tank two parallel upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors and three parallel settling tanks firstly were identified six locations as potentially the main sources of odours within the wwtp these sampling points were located on the exhaust of the preliminary treatment which leads to biofilter inlet bioinlet after the biofilter biooutlet on the flotation tank flotation on the exhaust line of one uasb reactor flare on a settling tank settling and on a sludge thickener sludge sampling was carried out according to the source type bioinlet biooutlet and flare were point sources where direct sampling was used flotation settling and sludge were area sources flux chamber sampling was applied a preliminary sampling test was performed on 27 10 2016 for this purpose only three sampling bags on the area sources were collected flotation settling and sludge then two sampling campaigns were conducted under different wwtp operating regimes to more broadly characterize the emissions odour sampling was carried out on 31 10 2016 campaign 1 and 10 11 2016 campaign 2 the campaign 1 was conducted on a monday which according to the wwtp operators is a critical day due to the habit of the population of washing cars and clothes on the weekends in fact a lot of foam was observed during sampling on that day the household detergents sulphonates influence in the organic sulphur content of sewage effluents gostelow et al 2001 while the campaign 2 occurred on a thursday which is considered as a normal operating day one sampling bag was collected on each point for each campaign different equipment materials and instruments were selected to odour sampling procedure vacuum pumps model moa gast manufacturing usa were employed these have a metallic interior are oilless and were cleaned prior to sampling polyurethane and silicone tubing which have inert and odourless features were used as well as glass and teflon valves coupled to sampling bags nalophan bags with a capacity of 60 l approximately were employed this kind of bag preserves the sample gas composition during a certain time due to its adsorption properties in addition at the three area sources the flux chamber method was applied this device was conceived as stated on epa s document klenbusch 1986 two flowmeters model vfa 24 dwyer visi float usa two thermocouples type k and an adsorption system activated charcoal to clean the sweep air were also used 2 3 2 odours measuring each sampling bag collected at the previous stage was measured in a sequence by the e nose and olfactometer described above then five replicates per bag were selected and five electrical profiles per sensor were performed via the e nose obtaining 25 pulses per odour sample the time intervals for each profile sequence were experimentally determined as 50 s baseline 50 s rise transient 1 s steady state and 75 s recovery transient this measuring stage was performed in the laboratory of air quality control lcqar at federal university of santa catarina ufsc 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensor array response by the e nose in fig 1 the sensors response to odours from six sources is synthetically presented the bars amplitude represents the maximum voltage vmax in term of means and standard deviations computed from each odour sample in campaign 1 the vmax parameter was the feature extracted at the pre processing stage the names of locations displayed in fig 1 were ordered on the x axis according to the sequence of treatment stages in the wwtp starting from bioinlet to sludge in the previous graph each sensor showed readable output signals expressed by the amplitudes of the vmax means registered between 0 05 v tgs2600 sludge and 2 18 v tgs2610 flare from the previous figure can also be observed low dispersion values around the means represented by standard deviations less than 0 06 v on that point only the responses from tgs2611 tgs2610 and tgs2600 to the flare samples showed highs values of standard deviation equals to 0 41 0 41 and 0 28 v respectively it was caused by one profile for each sensor which presented slightly higher amplitude than the other four profiles in addition a cross sensitivity response of the sensors to the target odours can be confirmed which is indicated by the broad variability among the vmax sensors outputs it suggests that the instrument is capable to acquire wide and representative input data from the samples collected this behaviour is verified through the large amplitude difference among the same sensor across all treatment stages and all sensors within each stage being that only two minimal differences were computed these values were 0 01 and 0 001 v for tgs2602 flare tgs2602 settling and tgs2610 sludge tgs826 sludge respectively also the vmax value of each sensor to the bioinlet was higher than the biooutlet which implies on gas concentrations reductions it suggests a proper biofilter treatment in terms of gaseous compounds removal different profiles from sensor responses were found among sampling locations for example tgs2602 sensor showed different amplitude levels between the exhaust line of the preliminary treatment bioinlet and biooutlet and the other odour sources it suggests a greater presence of hydrogen sulphide and or ammonia in comparison to the other sampling sites from fig 1 can also be observed that higher sensors reactions were obtained in flotation and flare points sensors that stood out were tgs2610 tgs2611 and tgs2600 this response might be linked to the turbulence caused on the flotation tank which leads to gases release from the liquid phase higher reactions on the flare point might be due to its nature it exhausts gases from a uasb reactor which induces microbial anaerobic activity and the generation of gases vapours such as methane hydrogen and ethanol to quantitatively represent the concentration of the gaseous mixture across the treatment stages the feature vectors v1 and v2 were presented in fig 2 a and 2b from fig 2a and b the v1 and v2 showed a decrease between the beginning bioinlet and the end sludge of the process in the wwtp mainly in the campaign 1 in general campaign 1 responses were higher than responses of campaign 2 the flare point with the higher response it might be related to the fact that flare supply a gaseous outlet from a uasb reactor since these anaerobic digesters have a tendency to emit odorants and gases therefore it is expected the most significant sensor responses for on flare source the smallest values were observed in the last stages of the treatment which makes sense because most of the organic matter that could possibly be digested by bacteria and emit odours was removed by the previous reactor uasb similar profiles can observe by comparing v1 and v2 in each graph and v1 vector presented lower amplitude than v2 for all treatment stages thus v1 feature vector provides a moderate response along the sampling points and it can be useful for example to represent the operation regime in the facility while v2 presents more sensibility which may aid to report possible events of sudden increases from gases various parameters performed from v1 and v2 features were presented in table 2 the relationship between vmax from sludge and vmax from bioinlet was presented in campaign 1 it was 10 1 and 10 2 for v1 and v2 respectively while in campaign 2 the relationship was 35 7 and 45 1 for v1 and v2 respectively then from this parameter was also estimated the gaseous mixture reduction by the plant in table 2 the treatment of the gaseous mixture by the biofilter was also presented it was estimated through the relationship between vmax from biooutlet and vmax from bioinlet these results were close for both campaigns ranged between 85 8 and 87 7 then the gases reduction by the biofilter was also estimated indicating that its performance was stable around 13 4 this parameter also suggests a gaseous mixture removal by this treatment stage of approximately 13 for both campaigns these results do not provide information in terms of odour concentrations for this purpose a multivariate regression was developed subsequently 3 2 odour fingerprints the maximum of the electrical profiles from each sensor vmax was represented in two polar graphs fig 3 a campaign 1 and fig 3b campaign 2 the vmax value showed in both figures was the compute average from five replicates this magnitude was plotted in five axes one per sensor then as each sensor is sensitive to various gaseous compounds the shapes obtained are visual qualitative indicators of the samples called fingerprint from the previous figures can be perceived different shapes which represent odour samples points according to their original location in the plant indeed a clear pattern variation among the samples were displayed in campaign 1 fig 3a is noteworthy the differences among the shapes only bioinlet and biooutlet treatment stages were similarly represented in fig 3b campaign 2 different patterns can also be observed mainly from flare source however the radius of vmax decreased and some shapes were alike for instance settling sludge and flotation biooutlet visualizing vmax data through a relative sensor response allows to distinguish among different odour sources from a wwtp nevertheless to more explore the sensor array response another qualitative odour analysis by a pca was developed 3 3 discrimination of wwtp odours the vmax was also the parameter used as input data to the pca model results of these unsupervised technique were presented in fig 4 a and fig 4b in these graphs each plot represents its corresponding sensor signal being that five pulses per sample were acquired through fig 4a is possible to discriminate six clusters related to the six odours sources sampled in the campaign 1 the plots of each group were close and all groups were located separately which led to identifying six odour patterns from fig 4b can also distinguish the same number of clusters however the observations of settling and sludge were close almost overlapping a hypothesis about this proximity is a difference between the effluents features and or wwtp operating regime at campaign 2 regarding campaign 1 sampling weather conditions in term of temperature and relative humidity were similar for both campaigns therefore these variables must not have influenced in a significant way for this odour assessment also for campaign 2 the plots from flotation samples were spread in the graph but even so they were disjointed from the others observations 3 4 prediction of odour concentration to estimate the odour concentrations from wwtp emissions a prediction model by pls regression technique was applied to achieve more broad input data in this analysis was also include the responses from the samplings bags of the preliminary test averages of vmax and rising transient slope from the five replicates of each sensor were the parameters selected as one of the input variables to the pls model the other input was the odour concentration value obtained by the olfactometric assessments related to the e nose a data input matrix with 15 10 observations x variables elements was arranged the columns contain orderly the five vmax values and the five transient slopes values for each sensor while in the rows were fixed these variables for the 15 sampling points the olfactometry input data were organized in a 15 1 matrix where each row represents their corresponding observation in o u m 3 from these data the regression coefficients were computed and then the predicted model output was computed as odours concentrations values fig 5 a and fig 5b in fig 5 blue circles represent the modelled odours data the blue dashed line shows the fit and the black dashed lines represent the error bounds for a 95 of confidence level from fig 5a was considered three observations as outliers black circles due to these points were out of scale then by excluding the anomalous values the fit was improved fig 5b the predicted concentrations are distributed around the ideal line 1 1 it was confirmed by slope and intercept values with the y axis of fitting line equals to 0 9597 and 410 8 o u m 3 respectively however a slight skewness around the fitting line was perceived the value of r square was 0 9967 for a 95 of confidence level which showed a linear dependence the coefficient rmse was equal to 1 17 104 indicating that from the model output is expected an error range around this value due to the rmse value represents only the 0 17 of the measurements range it can be considered appropriate for this application through the pls components used in the multivariable model most of the variances in predictor variables and response matrix was explained the pls model performed was able to establish a linear relationship between the e nose output and the olfactometry analysis then a global calibration curve for the whole plant was obtained it allows to predict the odour concentrations released from all treatment stages in the wwtp by the e nose 4 conclusions in this study a wwtp odours samples characterization by using an e nose was presented samples collected from six locations which represented the main odour emitting sources in the plant were measured bioinlet biooutlet flotation flare settling and sludge both quantitative and qualitative analysis were performed by this approach some steps for analysing the samples from wwtp were proposed setting of trend functions to represent the emitted gaseous mixture across the plant for this purpose two features vectors called v1 and v2 were proposed both features represent a quantitative approximation about compounds released in term of vmax variations these vectors can be useful to represent the operation regime of the plant and to report possible events of sudden increases from substances through this multi sensor analysis response is possible to establish a primary assessment about the gaseous mixture in a simple way which can assist to estimate and compare the compounds emitted from specific locations in the wwtp calculation of parameters from v1 and v2 to estimate the efficiency in the treatment of the gaseous mixture by the plant and through the biofilter then a relationship between sludge final treatment stage and bioinlet first treatment stage of emitted compounds was presented others relationship could be computed like at biofilter stage in addition the reduction of gaseous substances by the plant was estimated which suggests a removal of approximately 90 and 60 of compounds emitted in campaign 1 and in campaign 2 respectively at the biofilter treatment stage the gases reduction was around 13 for both campaigns to perform odour fingerprints and pca qualitative analyses of compounds emitted at each stage these tools allowed to identify odours patterns according to the treatment stage in the facility basically these assessments would help to identify possible fails at wwtp locations odours emissions emergence of hazardous substances or other anomalies in the wastewater treatment process prediction of odour concentrations in term of o u m 3 to provide a quantitative response according to the european standard en 13725 for this purpose a pls regression between the e nose and the olfactometry analysis was performed the model output showed an appropriate performance with r square and rmse equals to 0 9967 and 1 17 104 respectively the results showed that the e nose proposed is capable of measuring odour samples from a wwtp with no large input data as concerning as the results from feature vectors odour fingerprint and pca this instrument can be employed as a single device for qualitative and quantitative analysis the instrument can provide some parameters to monitor the efficiency of odour treatment stages as seen on biofilter as a result the e nose could be a suitable tool to perform early warning responses related to odours released in the wastewater plant this instrument allows to infer and register irregular operations in the stages of wastewater treatment and consequently take control actions even in a proactive way to decrease the unpleasant odours released by the e nose anaerobic degradation in the stages of the facility can also be indirectly identified it would assist the odours management of the plant in order to establish proper maintenance cycles and even to adjust the dimensions of each treatment stage this approach supports a broad response as a combination of results in term of odour concentration and qualitative information it would be a fast and low cost tool projected to recognize irregularity events emphasizing that for this early warning purpose it is not necessary the use of precise and complex instruments additionally the e nose could be used as an in situ instrument to monitor the odours from a wwtp further samples analysis at different seasons and under different wwtp operating conditions could be performed more physico chemical information about the sewage effluents would be handled in order to associate it with the gaseous compound emissions acknowledgments the
