11285,farm irrigation management and real time irrigation decisions are based on a series of parameters including irrigation water demand predictions which estimated by the short term daily reference evapotranspiration eto based on the temperature data a simplest empirical model called the temperature based method was developed to forecast near future eto although temperature is one of the most influential weather variables in eto forecasting wind velocity also has non ignorable impact on the forecast performance of eto therefore we employed the reduced set penman monteith rpm model for short term eto forecasting using temperature data derived from public weather forecasts and wind speed data four different types of wind speed data were adopted as model inputs including wind speed assumed as a default value i e u 2 2 0 m s 1 w1 forecasted wind speed w2 long term daily average wind speed w3 and annual average wind speed w4 based on the above mentioned wind speed inputs we presented four types of rpm models rc rf rd and rm models respectively corresponding to w1 w2 w3 and w4 to forecast daily eto for lead times up to 7 days for eight weather stations in china the results confirmed that the highest precision wind speed input was w3 followed by w4 w1 and w2 and the most accurate eto forecasts of four rpm models was provided by rc followed with rd rm and rf by comparing with one of the most common used temperature based models the hargreaves samani hs it was found that the performance of rpm approaches were better than that of hs model for arid and sub arid regions whereas opposite results were found in sub tropical area suggesting inclusion of wind speed parameter makes positive impact on eto forecast for arid and semi arid regions further it was found that the greatest type of rpm model the rc model was superior to hs method for most climate regions including arid humid sub arid and sub humid areas thus the w1 wind speed type could be highly recommended for eto forecasting for most climate regions keywords reference evapotranspiration forecast reduced set penman monteith model wind speed public weather forecast crop water requirement 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration etc is the main component which contribute to significant water consumption in agricultural production and has great importance in optimizing irrigation decisions and farm irrigation management payero and irmak 2013 nevertheless it is difficult and costly to measure etc directly because this variable is affected by numerous dynamic factors such as meteorological parameters soil conditions and crop varieties reference evapotranspiration eto and the kc eto method are widely used for etc estimation allen et al 1998 in the past many studies have been conducted to estimate or predict eto in different climate regions lópez urrea et al 2006 khoob 2008 gavilán and castillo llanque 2009 kisi 2013 tabari et al 2013 feng et al 2016 gocic et al 2016 however in recent years many investigators have found that eto forecasts were more valuable in real time irrigation scheduling compared to those eto estimations ballesteros et al 2012 luo et al 2014 traore et al 2015 ballesteros et al 2016 pelosi et al 2016 eto forecast approaches can be divided into direct and indirect methods perera et al 2014 and many indirect approaches such as the penman monteith pm hargreaves samani hs and blaney criddle bc methods have been successfully applied in short and medium term eto forecasting by using the weather forecast data perera et al 2014 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 among these procedures the pm model is considered the standard method to calculate eto across a wide range of climates and is recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao as the standard method allen et al 1998 ventura et al 1999 gavilán et al 2007 rahimikhoob and hosseinzadeh 2014 the pm equation is established on physical and aerodynamic parameters and thus produces reliable eto results in most climates without local calibration garcia et al 2004 pelosi et al 2016 however this equation entails numerous meteorological variables for eto computation including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation some of these data are usually unavailable in many study areas and limit the application of the pm method thus leading to the development of simple approaches for eto computation that require fewer meteorological parameters for data restricted areas temperature based models using temperature as the only input data are widely used for eto forecasting however the fewer weather variables the model uses the more the forecast result is affected by the weather variables in other words the lower the accuracy of meteorological factors the worse the forecast results will be therefore in order to obtain reliable forecast the high precision weather input data is needed recently several studies illustrated that the forecast performance of numerical weather prediction nwp outputs was highly precise and forecasting eto using nwp outputs indeed produced reliable results perera et al 2014 evaluated weather forecast data derived from nwp outputs and forecasted daily eto using the pm equation for a lead time of up to 9 days across 40 stations in australia both the eto forecast results as well as the nwp outputs showed good performance similarly pelosi et al 2016 forecasted eto with lead times of 1 to 5 days using cosmo leps european consortium for small scale modeling nwp outputs in southern italy and good performances were achieved using the hargreaves samani hs and priestley taylor pt methods though nwp outputs have been demonstrated as the main source of weather forecast data for eto forecasting duce et al 1999 arca et al 2006 silva et al 2010 tian and martinez 2012 complete nwp outputs are only available to professional researchers and not the public in some developing countries such as china therefore irrigation system operators cannot obtain these data for the application of agricultural production recently in countries with restricted nwp outputs public weather forecasts have been used for eto forecasting as these data can be easily and freely accessed from public channels in china public weather forecasts are generated by the global and regional assimilation and prediction system grapes which is an nwp system established by the china meteorological administration cma the grapes nwp output data cannot be parsed by amateurs thus for the sake of public utilization the nwp outputs are simplified to the public weather forecast data which are also modified by weather forecasters to reduce the error from the grapes system xue 2005 the performance of public weather forecasts has been considerably improved by the cma in the last decades and these data have been confirmed as a valuable and reliable source for eto computation cai et al 2007 guo et al 2011 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 guo et al 2011 employed a least squares support vector machine lssvm model to forecast eto using public weather forecasts for a 1 day lead time however this model lacked physical fundamentals previous studies found that although public weather forecasts contained a series of parameters including maximum temperature minimum temperature wind scale and weather type temperature was the most influential factor in eto calculation while other factors for example wind speed forecasts contained large errors luo et al 2014 traore et al 2015 hence temperature based models are used to forecast eto luo et al 2014 forecasted daily eto across 4 stations in china for a lead time of up to 7 days using the hargreaves samani hs model based on temperature forecasts and achieved favorable results similarly xiong et al 2016 forecasted daily eto for 1 to 7 day lead times in eastern china using the blaney criddle bc model and the forecast performance was proved to be robust and reliable despite the temperature based methods performing well in eto forecasting eto is influenced by multiple factors for example adding both the weather type and wind scale forecasts into eto forecasting significantly improved the forecast result by comparing those of the hs model yang et al 2016 the wind velocity is an important dynamic parameter in eto calculations and the performance of eto forecasts might be benefit from this factor as long as the wind speed forecast is sufficiently accurate georger et al 1985 thus far hardly any work has been conducted using the combination of temperature and wind speed data for near future eto forecasting allen et al 1998 proposed an alternative method to calculate eto for areas where radiation and or humidity data were unavailable i e the reduced set penman monteith rpm model the required weather parameters for this method are temperature and wind velocity the wind speed is assumed as a constant value of 2 m s 1 which is the average value over 2000 weather stations around the world thus the input data can easily be obtained from public weather forecast sources for eto forecasting although a wind speed of 2 m s 1 is suitable for daily eto computation in some locations it may not be applicable in areas where the wind speed has obvious seasonal variation and the mean annual wind speed is far higher or lower than 2 m s 1 differences in wind speed have different effects on eto computation in arid areas martinez cob and tejero juste 2004 therefore considering that more accurate wind speed might improve the precision of daily eto forecasts we modified the rpm method by replacing the constant value of wind speed with three types of wind data i e the forecast wind speed estimated by the wind scale forecast from public weather forecast messages the long term average daily wind speed and the local annual mean wind speed the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to compare the forecast performance of the rpm model with that of the hs model to determine whether the addition of wind speed data improves the eto forecasts and 2 to determine the wind speed type that most improves the accuracy of eto forecasts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in this study we selected 8 weather stations across a wide range of irrigation districts and five climate regions of china as climate and geographical location invariably influence the performance of daily eto forecasts according to the rainfall and aridity index zhang and li 1999 zhang et al 2009 these 8 weather stations fall under two main climates i e arid and humid and three sub climates namely sub arid sub humid and sub tropical the geographic distribution and detailed parameters of these 8 stations are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively the observed daily meteorological data of the weather stations were collected for the period of may 24 2012 to jun 24 2014 including maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min mean temperature t mean mean wind speed u 2 sunshine hours n mean relative humidity rh and vapor pressure ea moreover for the same stations and period public weather forecast data including t max t min and wind scale forecasts for lead times of 1 7 days were acquired from the weather china website http www weather com cn the rpm model proposed by allen et al 1998 is recommended for locations that lack humidity or solar radiation data because for eto computation using the rpm model only three input weather factors are required i e t max t min and wind speed it is noted that the wind speed data used in the rpm model are assumed as the default value i e u 2 2 0 m s 1 while it seems that the constant value is not applicable across different climates trajkovic et al 2003 therefore for the sake of improving the daily eto forecast performance we attempted to modify the rpm model by using different types of wind speed data including forecasted wind speed estimated by wind scale forecast derived from public weather forecasts regional long term daily average wind speed and regional annual average wind speed furthermore we also collected the measured daily wind speed data for the past 40 years from january 1 1959 to january 1 2000 for 8 weather stations to calculate the long term daily average wind speed and annual average wind speed 2 2 et0 calculation models 2 2 1 fao 56 penman monteith model the fao 56 penman monteith pm model is recommended by fao as the standard method to calculate eto and for the evaluation of other methods rahimikhoob and hosseinzadeh 2014 therefore the observed meteorological data were provided as an input into the pm equation and the output eto results were used to quantify the accuracy of the forecasted eto computed using the rpm models the 56 pm equation is allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 2 2 hargreaves samani model the hargreaves samani hs method hargreaves and samani 1985 is one of the most common used temperature based models over the world luo et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 and written as followed 2 e t 0 h s 1 λ c r a t max t min e t max t min 2 17 8 where the et o hs is the eto forecasted by hs model mm day 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2day 1 t max and t min are the maximum and minimum air temperature respectively c the empirical coefficient c and e are initially set to 0 0023 and 0 5 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 in order to improve the accuracy of hs model c and e are local calibrated in this study 2 2 3 reduced set penman monteith model if some of the required weather data are unavailable or cannot be calculated the pm model might not be suitable for eto calculation therefore allen et al 1998 proposed a modified version of pm for eto estimation called the reduced set penman monteith rpm which only used the air temperature and wind speed as the input data the radiation and relative humidity can be estimated by eqs 3 and 4 allem et al 1998 trajkovic 2005 thus the factors needed in eto calculation are all set when solar radiation data were unavailable allen et al 1998 recommended a method for r s calculation by using the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures and the results obtained from this method were close to the actual solar radiation 3 r s k t max t min 0 5 r a where r s is solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 r a is extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 t max and t min are maximum and minimum temperature c respectively and k is the adjustment coefficient k 0 16 for interior locations and k 0 19 for coastal locations actual vapor pressure is determined from the daily dew point temperature t dew which may not always be available at most regions across china as t min is close to the t dew the actual vapor pressure can be assumed based on the t min using the following equation allen et al 1998 thornton et al 2000 4 e a 0 611exp 17 27 t min t min 237 3 where e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and t min is the minimum temperature c t min might be higher than t dew and e a should be checked when using eq 4 allen 1996 the estimation of e a using t min was confirmed under humid sub humid and sub arid climates cai et al 2007 jabloun and sahli 2008 while t min was not a good estimator under arid region thus we calibrated e a for the kohtan station allen et al 1998 proposed that if wind data are unavailable the wind speed can be assumed as the default value i e u 2 2 m s 1 which is the average value across 2000 weather stations around the world several authors have followed this suggestion for eto calculations when wind data were lacking trajkovic 2005 jabloun and sahli 2008 2 2 4 three modified rpm models it is noted that the wind speed used in the original rpm model denoted as rc is assumed as u 2 2 0 m s 1 while it seems that the default value is not applicable in different regions and climates different wind speeds have different impacts on eto computation in arid areas martinez cob and tejero juste 2004 and allen et al 1998 proposed the use of daily average wind speed information when actual wind data are unavailable hence accurate wind data may improve the eto forecast performance for the three modified rpm models the input forecasted air temperature data remained unchanged and the default wind speed value i e u 2 2 m s 1 was respectively replaced by three types of wind speed data i e forecasted wind speed long term daily average wind speed values and annual average wind speed and the three modified rpm models are denoted as rf rd and rm accordingly the long term daily average wind speed and annual average wind speed of each study area were calculated using actual wind speed data for the past 40 years january 1 1959 to january 1 2000 forecasted wind speed was estimated using daily wind scale forecasts which are also contained in public weather forecast information according to the surface meteorological observation criterion cma 2003 wind is classified into twelve scales based on its velocity in turn the transformation to wind speed at 10 m u 10 was calculated using the equivalent wind scales listed in table 2 these transformation relationships between wind speed at a 10 m height and wind scales were formulated by the world meteorological organization wmo and are suggested for the use of surface wind speed estimation if the equivalent wind scale data are available nevertheless wind speed at a 2 m height u 2 is needed in the calculation of eto and can be calculated from eq 5 5 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 m height m s 1 u z is the average value of measured wind speed at height z m s 1 and z is the height of measurements above the ground surface m 2 3 statistical analysis the results of eto forecasts obtained from the forecast models were compared to eto calculated from the pm model with complete meteorological data four statistical indicators were adopted to quantify the forecast performance of eto for each lead time including the ratio of means rm mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r the rm value was defined as the mean of the forecasted value relative to the observed value and was used to quantify the bias this ratio might indicate over under prediction if the values are greater lower than one perera et al 2016 tomas burguera et al 2017 the mae was used to measure the deviation between the forecast and actual values as represented by observations the level of agreement between the forecast and observed values was measured using the rmse cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 r was adopted to measure the correlation between the forecast and observed data an r value close to one illustrates goodness of fit between forecast and observed data traore et al 2015 yang et al 2016 previous studies have employed the above statistical indicators to evaluate the eto forecast performance luo et al 2014 perera et al 2014 traore et al 2015 perera et al 2016 tomas burguera et al 2017 and these indices were computed as follows 6 r m f o 7 m a e i 1 n f i o i n 8 r m s e i 1 n f i o i 2 n 9 r i 1 n f i f o i o i 1 n f i f 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of observations f i and o i are the ith observed and forecasted values respectively and f and o are the mean f i and o i respectively for the period of observation 3 results and discussion any bias with respect to weather variables would lead to systematic errors in daily eto forecasts perera et al 2014 thus checking the quality of the weather forecasts is encouraged by allen 1996 first we analyzed the performance of temperature for a lead time of 1 7 days and the precision of the four types of wind speed data was also evaluated second the eto forecast performance for lead times of 1 7 days provided by the original and three modified rpm models were also assessed then we compared the performance of rpm models to determine the best one i e we identified the wind speed data type that resulted in the best performance of eto finally the forecast performance of the rpm models and hs model were compared to determine whether adding wind speed data would improve the precision of eto forecast 3 1 forecast performance of weather variables 3 1 1 air temperature the solar radiation was computed using daily maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min and the relative humidity was estimated using t min therefore it was essential to evaluate the forecast performance of air temperature for all stations fig 2 a shows that the rm of t max ranged between 0 95 and 1 02 for all lead times and the average rm of 1 7 days for eight stations ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 which indicated systematic under prediction of t max for t min fig 2b shows that rm ranged from 0 93 to 1 02 and with the exception of the kh station located in an arid climate the rm values were lower than 1 00 for the other stations which indicated that the forecasted t min was under predicted compared to the observed values similar to t max it can be concluded that the temperature forecast slightly under predicted the temperature values the mae and rmse for t max ranged from 1 91 to 3 37 c and 2 52 to 5 03 c respectively and the corresponding values for t min ranged from 0 95 to 3 10 c and 1 24 to 4 76 c for both t max and t min the r values were close to 1 00 ranging from 0 88 to 0 97 and 0 95 to 0 99 respectively i e strong linear relationships were observed between the forecast and observed data the four indicators suggested a similar trend i e that the performance of both t max and t min decreased with increasing lead time the above results show that the t min forecasts had a relatively better performance than that of t max and this result is in accordance with most of the previous findings in china luo et al 2014 2015 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 3 1 2 wind speed the wind speed of 2 m s 1 the forecast wind speed the average daily wind speed and the annual average wind speed are represented by w1 w2 w3 and w4 respectively when quantifying the input wind speed using the observed values it must be noted that both w1 and w4 are constant values and cannot be analyzed using the correlation coefficient r comparing the other statistical indices the best measure of performance is the rmse as this represents the level of agreement between the input data and the actual wind speed data additionally rm values were calculated to determine over and under prediction fig 3 shows the forecast performance of w1 w4 as indicated by rm and rmse for the 8 stations as shown in the fig 3 the rm values of w1 and w2 were higher than 1 00 for all stations and ranged from 1 06 to 1 54 and 1 68 to 2 57 respectively it is obvious that w2 had the largest bias and resulted in over estimates compared with the observed data this bias might lead to significant over prediction in eto forecasts for w3 and w4 the rm values ranged from 0 96 to 1 35 and 0 94 to 1 35 respectively and six locations had values higher than 1 00 which resulted in over estimation for w3 and w4 the rmse values for w2 were the highest among w1 w4 ranging from 1 45 to 2 87 m s 1 the rmse values of w1 w3 and w4 ranged between 0 66 and 1 00 m s 1 0 47 and 1 16 m s 1 and 0 54 and 1 19 m s 1 respectively across all stations which indicated that w3 performed the best followed by w4 and w1 comparing the 8 weather stations the lowest and highest rmse values were found at the kh and hb stations respectively the best performance with respect to the wind speed was observed for w1 at hb and kf whereas w3 and w4 resulted in the best performance for the remaining six stations the forecast performance of wind speed implies a regional difference and is significantly influenced by the geographical position and local terrain features where the weather stations located further there appeared to be little difference in the performance of w1 w3 and w4 for the same weather station while w2 showed considerable deviation fig 4 illustrates the variation pattern between daily w1 w4 vs observed wind speed for the period 2012 2014 for the eight stations the observed wind speed showed obviously significant seasonal variation between different months and only w3 showed an analogous changing pattern and fitted well with the measured values throughout the year both w1 and w4 were default values w2 which was calculated using wind scales could only be four constant values in this study i e 2 99 m s 1 4 81 m s 1 5 98 m s 1 or 8 08 m s 1 hence these three wind data types cannot reflect the variation during different seasons for the kh yc kf and gl stations the peak and nadir values of observed wind speed were found during spring or winter and autumn respectively while other stations did not show an obvious trend considering the overall results only w3 showed agreement with the actual values in terms of seasonality and appeared to exhibit the best performance followed by w4 w1 and w2 3 2 forecast performance of eto in this section four different input combinations including rc t max t min and wind speed using the default value u 2 2 0 m s 1 rf t max t min and forecasted wind speed estimated using the wind scale forecast rd t max t min and long term daily average wind speed and rm t max t min and annual average wind speed were used to forecast daily eto for 1 7 day lead times and we quantified the forecasted eto through comparison with observed values calculated using the pm equation and complete meteorological data then we compared the performance of the four rpm models to determine the best model i e to identify the wind speed data type that resulted in the best forecast performance of eto fig 5 shows the daily eto changes for the period 2012 2014 calculated using the four rpm models and the pm model for 1 day lead time at 8 stations it could be found that the forecasted eto from rpm models displayed the same patterns as the eto pm throughout the year while slightly over predicted eto for all the stations at daily timescale especially the rf model averaged for all sites the rf models over predicted eto by 2 1 23 1 fig 6 illustrates the average forecast performance across 8 stations for the different models for lead time up to 7 days the rm values for rc rd rm and rf ranged between 1 00 1 03 1 02 1 04 1 00 1 02 and 1 10 1 13 respectively for lead times of 1 7 days suggesting the forecasted eto was over predicted for all lead times systematical over prediction of the wind speed occurred and thus led to the over prediction of eto hence it is necessary to calibrate the wind speed data in the future work in general both the mae and rmse values increased as the lead time increased for lead times of 1 to 7 days the mae values for rc rf rd and rm ranged from 0 70 to 0 74 mm day 1 0 78 to 0 84 mm day 1 0 71 to 0 74 mm day 1 and 0 71 to 0 76 mm day 1 respectively and the rmse for the above models ranged between 0 96 1 01 mm day 1 1 05 1 12 mm day 1 0 97 1 00 mm day 1 and 0 97 1 03 mm day 1 respectively in terms of mae and rmse the worst performance was observed from rf with considerably large bias for the other three models there was little difference in the mae and rmse values which differed by no more than 3 among the three models for corresponding lead times the r values for rc rd and rm were higher than 0 80 for all lead times and rf resulted in a preferable outcome that ranged from 0 82 1 day lead time to 0 79 7 day lead time this result indicated that the forecast and observed daily eto anomalies were consistent across all stations a clear decrease in the eto forecast performance was observed with increase lead time for all rpm models this downward trend for rc rd and rm occurred because the temperature forecast also decreased with increasing lead time as their input wind speed data did not change with lead time on the other hand the declined for rf with increasing lead time was a result of caused by both the temperature and wind speed since both of them were forecast data that their accuracy were changed with the variation of lead time overall results indicated that the average performance of rc was slightly better than the other three approaches followed with rd rm and rf table 3 provides the mean values of 7 day statistical indices of eto forecasts using the four rpm models for 8 sites for the hb kh yc and kf stations rc exhibited the best performance and rd and rm yielded the best results at wh for the remaining stations i e gl gy and fz these three models showed a similar and reliable performance the mae values did not vary by more than 3 5 with respect to r there was no significant difference among the different models the rc model gained the best performance for 87 5 of the total stations which means w1 was the best type of wind speed that suitable for almost all the climate regions and thus the w1 could be highly recommended for eto forecasting in most climate regions since it is easy to use and lead to a great forecast result according to the table 3 it was also found that the climate region where the weather stations located had a stronger impact on the eto forecast performance than the type of model therefore we selected the forecasts provided by rd for spatial analysis for all stations the rm values for the kf station were the closest to the target value of 1 00 and the lowest and highest rm values were observed at the kh and fz stations respectively both the lowest mae and rmse were observed at the yc station and the highest mae and rmse values were observed at the fz station a similar result was observed with respect to r where the highest and lowest values were recorded at the yc and fz stations respectively above results showed that the best performance was found by the yc followed with the hb and kh and these three sites were located in arid and sub arid regions whereas the worst predictive behavior was observed at fz which is located in sub tropical climate also similar performance were provided by kf gl and gy which all situated in humid or sub humid regions as a whole it can be concluded that the applicability of the rpm models for arid and semi arid regions was better than the other climate regions although most of the rpm models exhibited reliable forecast performance we compared the rpm and hs models in the next section to determine whether adding wind speed data would improve the eto forecast performance i e to discern whether it is necessary to use wind speed data in eto forecasting 3 3 comparison of the rpm and hs models fig 7 shows the respective forecast performance of the rpm and hs models as indicated by four statistical indices for 8 weather stations for the hb kh and yc stations which located in arid or sub arid climates the mae rmse and r all indicated that the rpm models performed greater than the hs model for the kf wh gy and gl stations that suited in humid or sub humid climates the greatest forecast behavior were mostly provided by rc model and the performance of hs ranked in the middle of all models for most times for the fz site located in sub tropical climate the hs behaved better than all the other rpm models considering the above facts it was found that inclusion of wind speed parameter makes positive impact on eto forecasts for arid and semi arid regions further the greatest type of rpm model the rc model was superior to hs method for most climate regions including arid humid sub arid and sub humid area and this suggested the w1 would be recommended for almost all climate regions when choosing the wind speed type for eto forecasting 4 conclusions this paper explored whether the addition of wind speed data improves the eto forecast and determined the type of wind speed data that would result in the most accurate eto forecast the main conclusions are as follows four types of wind speed data used for eto forecasting were quantified including wind speed assumed as a default value i e u 2 2 0 m s 1 w1 forecasted wind speed w2 estimated from wind scale forecasts long term daily average wind speed w3 and annual average wind speed w4 and results showed that the best performance was found by w3 followed with w1 w4 and w2 additionally there was systematic over prediction of all wind speed types which led to eto over prediction indicating that it is necessary to calibrate the wind speed information before utilization in the future work daily eto forecast for lead time up to 7 days by four types of rpm models including rc rf rd and rm rc rf rd and rm models respectively corresponding to w1 w2 w3 and w4 were compared for eight weather sites across china it was found that the rc model gained the best performance for 87 5 of the total stations and the greatest average performance were also obtained by rc followed with rd rm and rf suggesting the w1 was the best type of wind speed that suitable for almost all the climate regions by comparing with the hargreaves samani hs it was found that the performance of four rpm approaches were better than that of hs model in arid and sub arid regions whereas opposite results were found in sub tropical area thus the inclusion of wind speed parameter had positive impact on eto forecast in arid and semi arid regions further it was found that the greatest type of rpm model the rc was superior to hs method for most climate regions including arid humid sub arid and sub humid area thus the w1 wind speed type could be highly recommended for eto forecasting at almost all climate regions since it is easy to use and lead to a great forecast result from a practical viewpoint irrigation system operators can obtain temperature forecasts from public weather forecast messages at no cost from the website such as weather china http www weather com cn further using the rc model with the combined input of temperature forecasts and wind speed of 2 m s 1 these operators can forecast daily eto for lead time up to 7 days and then the real time irrigation decisions can be predicted by irrigation water demand predictions which estimated using the forecasted daily eto acknowledgements this work was financiallysupported by the national

11285,farm irrigation management and real time irrigation decisions are based on a series of parameters including irrigation water demand predictions which estimated by the short term daily reference evapotranspiration eto based on the temperature data a simplest empirical model called the temperature based method was developed to forecast near future eto although temperature is one of the most influential weather variables in eto forecasting wind velocity also has non ignorable impact on the forecast performance of eto therefore we employed the reduced set penman monteith rpm model for

presented four types of rpm models rc rf rd and rm models respectively corresponding to w1 w2 w3 and w4 to forecast daily eto for lead times up to 7 days for eight weather stations in china the results confirmed that the highest precision wind speed input was w3 followed by w4 w1 and w2 and the most accurate eto forecasts of four rpm models was provided by rc followed with rd rm and rf by comparing with one of the most common used temperature based models the hargreaves samani hs it was found that the performance of rpm approaches were better than that of hs model for arid and sub arid regions whereas opposite results were found in sub tropical area suggesting inclusion of wind speed parameter makes positive impact on eto forecast for arid and semi arid regions further it was found that the greatest type of rpm model the rc model was superior to hs method for most climate regions including arid humid sub arid and sub humid areas thus the w1 wind speed type could be highly recommended for eto forecasting for most climate regions keywords reference evapotranspiration forecast reduced set penman monteith model wind speed public weather forecast crop water requirement 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration etc is the main component which contribute to significant water consumption in agricultural production and has great importance in optimizing irrigation decisions and farm irrigation management payero and irmak 2013 nevertheless it is difficult and costly to measure etc directly because this variable is affected by numerous dynamic factors such as meteorological parameters soil conditions and crop varieties reference evapotranspiration eto and the kc eto method are widely used for etc estimation allen et al 1998 in the past many studies have been conducted to estimate or predict eto in different climate regions lópez urrea et al 2006 khoob 2008 gavilán and castillo llanque 2009 kisi 2013 tabari et al 2013 feng et al 2016 gocic et al 2016 however in recent years many investigators have found that eto forecasts were more valuable in real time irrigation scheduling compared to those eto estimations ballesteros et al 2012 luo et al 2014 traore et al 2015 ballesteros et al 2016 pelosi et al 2016 eto forecast approaches can be divided into direct and indirect methods perera et al 2014 and many indirect approaches such as the penman monteith pm hargreaves samani hs and blaney criddle bc methods have been successfully applied in short and medium term eto forecasting by using the weather forecast data perera et al 2014 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 among these procedures the pm model is considered the standard method to calculate eto across a wide range of climates and is recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao as the standard method allen et al 1998 ventura et al 1999 gavilán et al 2007 rahimikhoob and hosseinzadeh 2014 the pm equation is established on physical and aerodynamic parameters and thus produces reliable eto results in most climates without local calibration garcia et al 2004 pelosi et al 2016 however this equation entails numerous meteorological variables for eto computation including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation some of these data are usually unavailable in many study areas and limit the application of the pm method thus leading to the development of simple approaches for eto computation that require fewer meteorological parameters for data restricted areas temperature based models using temperature as the only input data are widely used for eto forecasting however the fewer weather variables the model uses the more the forecast result is affected by the weather variables in other words the lower the accuracy of meteorological factors the worse the forecast results will be therefore in order to obtain reliable forecast the high precision weather input data is needed recently several studies illustrated that the forecast performance of numerical weather prediction nwp outputs was highly precise and forecasting eto using nwp outputs indeed produced reliable results perera et al 2014 evaluated weather forecast data derived from nwp outputs and forecasted daily eto using the pm equation for a lead time of up to 9 days across 40 stations in australia both the eto forecast results as well as the nwp outputs showed good performance similarly pelosi et al 2016 forecasted eto with lead times of 1 to 5 days using cosmo leps european consortium for small scale modeling nwp outputs in southern italy and good performances were achieved using the hargreaves samani hs and priestley taylor pt methods though nwp outputs have been demonstrated as the main source of weather forecast data for eto forecasting duce et al 1999 arca et al 2006 silva et al 2010 tian and martinez 2012 complete nwp outputs are only available to professional researchers and not the public in some developing countries such as china therefore irrigation system operators cannot obtain these data for the application of agricultural production recently in countries with restricted nwp outputs public weather forecasts have been used for eto forecasting as these data can be easily and freely accessed from public channels in china public weather forecasts are generated by the global and regional assimilation and prediction system grapes which is an nwp system established by the china meteorological administration cma the grapes nwp output data cannot be parsed by amateurs thus for the sake of public utilization the nwp outputs are simplified to the public weather forecast data which are also modified by weather forecasters to reduce the error from the grapes system xue 2005 the performance of public weather forecasts has been considerably improved by the cma in the last decades and these data have been confirmed as a valuable and reliable source for eto computation cai et al 2007 guo et al 2011 luo et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 guo et al 2011 employed a least squares support vector machine lssvm model to forecast eto using public weather forecasts for a 1 day lead time however this model lacked physical fundamentals previous studies found that although public weather forecasts contained a series of parameters including maximum temperature minimum temperature wind scale and weather type temperature was the most influential factor in eto calculation while other factors for example wind speed forecasts contained large errors luo et al 2014 traore et al 2015 hence temperature based models are used to forecast eto luo et al 2014 forecasted daily eto across 4 stations in china for a lead time of up to 7 days using the hargreaves samani hs model based on temperature forecasts and achieved favorable results similarly xiong et al 2016 forecasted daily eto for 1 to 7 day lead times in eastern china using the blaney criddle bc model and the forecast performance was proved to be robust and reliable despite the temperature based methods performing well in eto forecasting eto is influenced by multiple factors for example adding both the weather type and wind scale forecasts into eto forecasting significantly improved the forecast result by comparing those of the hs model yang et al 2016 the wind velocity is an important dynamic parameter in eto calculations and the performance of eto forecasts might be benefit from this factor as long as the wind speed forecast is sufficiently accurate georger et al 1985 thus far hardly any work has been conducted using the combination of temperature and wind speed data for near future eto forecasting allen et al 1998 proposed an alternative method to calculate eto for areas where radiation and or humidity data were unavailable i e the reduced set penman monteith rpm model the required weather parameters for this method are temperature and wind velocity the wind speed is assumed as a constant value of 2 m s 1 which is the average value over 2000 weather stations around the world thus the input data can easily be obtained from public weather forecast sources for eto forecasting although a wind speed of 2 m s 1 is suitable for daily eto computation in some locations it may not be applicable in areas where the wind speed has obvious seasonal variation and the mean annual wind speed is far higher or lower than 2 m s 1 differences in wind speed have different effects on eto computation in arid areas martinez cob and tejero juste 2004 therefore considering that more accurate wind speed might improve the precision of daily eto forecasts we modified the rpm method by replacing the constant value of wind speed with three types of wind data i e the forecast wind speed estimated by the wind scale forecast from public weather forecast messages the long term average daily wind speed and the local annual mean wind speed the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to compare the forecast performance of the rpm model with that of the hs model to determine whether the addition of wind speed data improves the eto forecasts and 2 to determine the wind speed type that most improves the accuracy of eto forecasts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in this study we selected 8 weather stations across a wide range of irrigation districts and five climate regions of china as climate and geographical location invariably influence the performance of daily eto forecasts according to the rainfall and aridity index zhang and li 1999 zhang et al 2009 these 8 weather stations fall under two main climates i e arid and humid and three sub climates namely sub arid sub humid and sub tropical the geographic distribution and detailed parameters of these 8 stations are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively the observed daily meteorological data of the weather stations were collected for the period of may 24 2012 to jun 24 2014 including maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min mean temperature t mean mean wind speed u 2 sunshine hours n mean relative humidity rh and vapor pressure ea moreover for the same stations and period public weather forecast data including t max t min and wind scale forecasts for lead times of 1 7 days were acquired from the weather china website http www weather com cn the rpm model proposed by allen et al 1998 is recommended for locations that lack humidity or solar radiation data because for eto computation using the rpm model only three input weather factors are required i e t max t min and wind speed it is noted that the wind speed data used in the rpm model are assumed as the default value i e u 2 2 0 m s 1 while it seems that the constant value is not applicable across different climates trajkovic et al 2003 therefore for the sake of improving the daily eto forecast performance we attempted to modify the rpm model by using different types of wind speed data including forecasted wind speed estimated by wind scale forecast derived from public weather forecasts regional long term daily average wind speed and regional annual average wind speed furthermore we also collected the measured daily wind speed data for the past 40 years from january 1 1959 to january 1 2000 for 8 weather stations to calculate the long term daily average wind speed and annual average wind speed 2 2 et0 calculation models 2 2 1 fao 56 penman monteith model the fao 56 penman monteith pm model is recommended by fao as the standard method to calculate eto and for the evaluation of other methods rahimikhoob and hosseinzadeh 2014 therefore the observed meteorological data were provided as an input into the pm equation and the output eto results were used to quantify the accuracy of the forecasted eto computed using the rpm models the 56 pm equation is allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 2 2 hargreaves samani model the hargreaves samani hs method hargreaves and samani 1985 is one of the most common used temperature based models over the world luo et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 and written as followed 2 e t 0 h s 1 λ c r a t max t min e t max t min 2 17 8 where the et o hs is the eto forecasted by hs model mm day 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2day 1 t max and t min are the maximum and minimum air temperature respectively c the empirical coefficient c and e are initially set to 0 0023 and 0 5 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 in order to improve the accuracy of hs model c and e are local calibrated in this study 2 2 3 reduced set penman monteith model if some of the required weather data are unavailable or cannot be calculated the pm model might not be suitable for eto calculation therefore allen et al 1998 proposed a modified version of pm for eto estimation called the reduced set penman monteith rpm which only used the air temperature and wind speed as the input data the radiation and relative humidity can be estimated by eqs 3 and 4 allem et al 1998 trajkovic 2005 thus the factors needed in eto calculation are all set when solar radiation data were unavailable allen et al 1998 recommended a method for r s calculation by using the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures and the results obtained from this method were close to the actual solar radiation 3 r s k t max t min 0 5 r a where r s is solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 r a is extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 t max and t min are maximum and minimum temperature c respectively and k is the adjustment coefficient k 0 16 for interior locations and k 0 19 for coastal locations actual vapor pressure is determined from the daily dew point temperature t dew which may not always be available at most regions across china as t min is close to the t dew the actual vapor pressure can be assumed based on the t min using the following equation allen et al 1998 thornton et al 2000 4 e a 0 611exp 17 27 t min t min 237 3 where e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and t min is the minimum temperature c t min might be higher than t dew and e a should be checked when using eq 4 allen 1996 the estimation of e a using t min was confirmed under humid sub humid and sub arid climates cai et al 2007 jabloun and sahli 2008 while t min was not a good estimator under arid region thus we calibrated e a for the kohtan station allen et al 1998 proposed that if wind data are unavailable the wind speed can be assumed as the default value i e u 2 2 m s 1 which is the average value across 2000 weather stations around the world several authors have followed this suggestion for eto calculations when wind data were lacking trajkovic 2005 jabloun and sahli 2008 2 2 4 three modified rpm models it is noted that the wind speed used in the original rpm model denoted as rc is assumed as u 2 2 0 m s 1 while it seems that the default value is not applicable in different regions and climates different wind speeds have different impacts on eto computation in arid areas martinez cob and tejero juste 2004 and allen et al 1998 proposed the use of daily average wind speed information when actual wind data are unavailable hence accurate wind data may improve the eto forecast performance for the three modified rpm models the input forecasted air temperature data remained unchanged and the default wind speed value i e u 2 2 m s 1 was respectively replaced by three types of wind speed data i e forecasted wind speed long term daily average wind speed values and annual average wind speed and the three modified rpm models are denoted as rf rd and rm accordingly the long term daily average wind speed and annual average wind speed of each study area were calculated using actual wind speed data for the past 40 years january 1 1959 to january 1 2000 forecasted wind speed was estimated using daily wind scale forecasts which are also contained in public weather forecast information according to the surface meteorological observation criterion cma 2003 wind is classified into twelve scales based on its velocity in turn the transformation to wind speed at 10 m u 10 was calculated using the equivalent wind scales listed in table 2 these transformation relationships between wind speed at a 10 m height and wind scales were formulated by the world meteorological organization wmo and are suggested for the use of surface wind speed estimation if the equivalent wind scale data are available nevertheless wind speed at a 2 m height u 2 is needed in the calculation of eto and can be calculated from eq 5 5 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 m height m s 1 u z is the average value of measured wind speed at height z m s 1 and z is the height of measurements above the ground surface m 2 3 statistical analysis the results of eto forecasts obtained from the forecast models were compared to eto calculated from the pm model with complete meteorological data four statistical indicators were adopted to quantify the forecast performance of eto for each lead time including the ratio of means rm mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r the rm value was defined as the mean of the forecasted value relative to the observed value and was used to quantify the bias this ratio might indicate over under prediction if the values are greater lower than one perera et al 2016 tomas burguera et al 2017 the mae was used to measure the deviation between the forecast and actual values as represented by observations the level of agreement between the forecast and observed values was measured using the rmse cai et al 2007 perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 r was adopted to measure the correlation between the forecast and observed data an r value close to one illustrates goodness of fit between forecast and observed data traore et al 2015 yang et al 2016 previous studies have employed the above statistical indicators to evaluate the eto forecast performance luo et al 2014 perera et al 2014 traore et al 2015 perera et al 2016 tomas burguera et al 2017 and these indices were computed as follows 6 r m f o 7 m a e i 1 n f i o i n 8 r m s e i 1 n f i o i 2 n 9 r i 1 n f i f o i o i 1 n f i f 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of observations f i and o i are the ith observed and forecasted values respectively and f and o are the mean f i and o i respectively for the period of observation 3 results and discussion any bias with respect to weather variables would lead to systematic errors in daily eto forecasts perera et al 2014 thus checking the quality of the weather forecasts is encouraged by allen 1996 first we analyzed the performance of temperature for a lead time of 1 7 days and the precision of the four types of wind speed data was also evaluated second the eto forecast performance for lead times of 1 7 days provided by the original and three modified rpm models were also assessed then we compared the performance of rpm models to determine the best one i e we identified the wind speed data type that resulted in the best performance of eto finally the forecast performance of the rpm models and hs model were compared to determine whether adding wind speed data would improve the precision of eto forecast 3 1 forecast performance of weather variables 3 1 1 air temperature the solar radiation was computed using daily maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min and the relative humidity was estimated using t min therefore it was essential to evaluate the forecast performance of air temperature for all stations fig 2 a shows that the rm of t max ranged between 0 95 and 1 02 for all lead times and the average rm of 1 7 days for eight stations ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 which indicated systematic under prediction of t max for t min fig 2b shows that rm ranged from 0 93 to 1 02 and with the exception of the kh station located in an arid climate the rm values were lower than 1 00 for the other stations which indicated that the forecasted t min was under predicted compared to the observed values similar to t max it can be concluded that the temperature forecast slightly under predicted the temperature values the mae and rmse for t max ranged from 1 91 to 3 37 c and 2 52 to 5 03 c respectively and the corresponding values for t min ranged from 0 95 to 3 10 c and 1 24 to 4 76 c for both t max and t min the r values were close to 1 00 ranging from 0 88 to 0 97 and 0 95 to 0 99 respectively i e strong linear relationships were observed between the forecast and observed data the four indicators suggested a similar trend i e that the performance of both t max and t min decreased with increasing lead time the above results show that the t min forecasts had a relatively better performance than that of t max and this result is in accordance with most of the previous findings in china luo et al 2014 2015 xiong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 3 1 2 wind speed the wind speed of 2 m s 1 the forecast wind speed the average daily wind speed and the annual average wind speed are represented by w1 w2 w3 and w4 respectively when quantifying the input wind speed using the observed values it must be noted that both w1 and w4 are constant values and cannot be analyzed using the correlation coefficient r comparing the other statistical indices the best measure of performance is the rmse as this represents the level of agreement between the input data and the actual wind speed data additionally rm values were calculated to determine over and under prediction fig 3 shows the forecast performance of w1 w4 as indicated by rm and rmse for the 8 stations as shown in the fig 3 the rm values of w1 and w2 were higher than 1 00 for all stations and ranged from 1 06 to 1 54 and 1 68 to 2 57 respectively it is obvious that w2 had the largest bias and resulted in over estimates compared with the observed data this bias might lead to significant over prediction in eto forecasts for w3 and w4 the rm values ranged from 0 96 to 1 35 and 0 94 to 1 35 respectively and six locations had values higher than 1 00 which resulted in over estimation for w3 and w4 the rmse values for w2 were the highest among w1 w4 ranging from 1 45 to 2 87 m s 1 the rmse values of w1 w3 and w4 ranged between 0 66 and 1 00 m s 1 0 47 and 1 16 m s 1 and 0 54 and 1 19 m s 1 respectively across all stations which indicated that w3 performed the best followed by w4 and w1 comparing the 8 weather stations the lowest and highest rmse values were found at the kh and hb stations respectively the best performance with respect to the wind speed was observed for w1 at hb and kf whereas w3 and w4 resulted in the best performance for the remaining six stations the forecast performance of wind speed implies a regional difference and is significantly influenced by the geographical position and local terrain features where the weather stations located further there appeared to be little difference in the performance of w1 w3 and w4 for the same weather station while w2 showed considerable deviation fig 4 illustrates the variation pattern between daily w1 w4 vs observed wind speed for the period 2012 2014 for the eight stations the observed wind speed showed obviously significant seasonal variation between different months and only w3 showed an analogous changing pattern and fitted well with the measured values throughout the year both w1 and w4 were default values w2 which was calculated using wind scales could only be four constant values in this study i e 2 99 m s 1 4 81 m s 1 5 98 m s 1 or 8 08 m s 1 hence these three wind data types cannot reflect the variation during different seasons for the kh yc kf and gl stations the peak and nadir values of observed wind speed were found during spring or winter and autumn respectively while other stations did not show an obvious trend considering the overall results only w3 showed agreement with the actual values in terms of seasonality and appeared to exhibit the best performance followed by w4 w1 and w2 3 2 forecast performance of eto in this section four different input combinations including rc t max t min and wind speed using the default value u 2 2 0 m s 1 rf t max t min and forecasted wind speed estimated using the wind scale forecast rd t max t min and long term daily average wind speed and rm t max t min and annual average wind speed were used to forecast daily eto for 1 7 day lead times and we quantified the forecasted eto through comparison with observed values calculated using the pm equation and complete meteorological data then we compared the performance of the four rpm models to determine the best model i e to identify the wind speed data type that resulted in the best forecast performance of eto fig 5 shows the daily eto changes for the period 2012 2014 calculated using the four rpm models and the pm model for 1 day lead time at 8 stations it could be found that the forecasted eto from rpm models displayed the same patterns as the eto pm throughout the year while slightly over predicted eto for all the stations at daily timescale especially the rf model averaged for all sites the rf models over predicted eto by 2 1 23 1 fig 6 illustrates the average forecast performance across 8 stations for the different models for lead time up to 7 days the rm values for rc rd rm and rf ranged between 1 00 1 03 1 02 1 04 1 00 1 02 and 1 10 1 13 respectively for lead times of 1 7 days suggesting the forecasted eto was over predicted for all lead times systematical over prediction of the wind speed occurred and thus led to the over prediction of eto hence it is necessary to calibrate the wind speed data in the future work in general both the mae and rmse values increased as the lead time increased for lead times of 1 to 7 days the mae values for rc rf rd and rm ranged from 0 70 to 0 74 mm day 1 0 78 to 0 84 mm day 1 0 71 to 0 74 mm day 1 and 0 71 to 0 76 mm day 1 respectively and the rmse for the above models ranged between 0 96 1 01 mm day 1 1 05 1 12 mm day 1 0 97 1 00 mm day 1 and 0 97 1 03 mm day 1 respectively in terms of mae and rmse the worst performance was observed from rf with considerably large bias for the other three models there was little difference in the mae and rmse values which differed by no more than 3 among the three models for corresponding lead times the r values for rc rd and rm were higher than 0 80 for all lead times and rf resulted in a preferable outcome that ranged from 0 82 1 day lead time to 0 79 7 day lead time this result indicated that the forecast and observed daily eto anomalies were consistent across all stations a clear decrease in the eto forecast performance was observed with increase lead time for all rpm models this downward trend for rc rd and rm occurred because the temperature forecast also decreased with increasing lead time as their input wind speed data did not change with lead time on the other hand the declined for rf with increasing lead time was a result of caused by both the temperature and wind speed since both of them were forecast data that their accuracy were changed with the variation of lead time overall results indicated that the average performance of rc was slightly better than the other three approaches followed with rd rm and rf table 3 provides the mean values of 7 day statistical indices of eto forecasts using the four rpm models for 8 sites for the hb kh yc and kf stations rc exhibited the best performance and rd and rm yielded the best results at wh for the remaining stations i e gl gy and fz these three models showed a similar and reliable performance the mae values did not vary by more than 3 5 with respect to r there was no significant difference among the different models the rc model gained the best performance for 87 5 of the total stations which means w1 was the best type of wind speed that suitable for almost all the climate regions and thus the w1 could be highly recommended for eto forecasting in most climate regions since it is easy to use and lead to a great forecast result according to the table 3 it was also found that the climate region where the weather stations located had a stronger impact on the eto forecast performance than the type of model therefore we selected the forecasts provided by rd for spatial analysis for all stations the rm values for the kf station were the closest to the target value of 1 00 and the lowest and highest rm values were observed at the kh and fz stations respectively both the lowest mae and rmse were observed at the yc station and the highest mae and rmse values were observed at the fz station a similar result was observed with respect to r where the highest and lowest values were recorded at the yc and fz stations respectively above results showed that the best performance was found by the yc followed with the hb and kh and these three sites were located in arid and sub arid regions whereas the worst predictive behavior was observed at fz which is located in sub tropical climate also similar performance were provided by kf gl and gy which all situated in humid or sub humid regions as a whole it can be concluded that the applicability of the rpm models for arid and semi arid regions was better than the other climate regions although most of the rpm models exhibited reliable forecast performance we compared the rpm and hs models in the next section to determine whether adding wind speed data would improve the eto forecast performance i e to discern whether it is necessary to use wind speed data in eto forecasting 3 3 comparison of the rpm and hs models fig 7 shows the respective forecast performance of the rpm and hs models as indicated by four statistical indices for 8 weather stations for the hb kh and yc stations which located in arid or sub arid climates the mae rmse and r all indicated that the rpm models performed greater than the hs model for the kf wh gy and gl stations that suited in humid or sub humid climates the greatest forecast behavior were mostly provided by rc model and the performance of hs ranked in the middle of all models for most times for the fz site located in sub tropical climate the hs behaved better than all the other rpm models considering the above facts it was found that inclusion of wind speed parameter makes positive impact on eto forecasts for arid and semi arid regions further the greatest type of rpm model the rc model was superior to hs method for most climate regions including arid humid sub arid and sub humid area and this suggested the w1 would be recommended for almost all climate regions when choosing the wind speed type for eto forecasting 4 conclusions this paper explored whether the addition of wind speed data improves the eto forecast and determined the type of wind speed data that would result in the most accurate eto forecast the main conclusions are as follows four types of wind speed data used for eto forecasting were quantified including wind speed assumed as a default value i e u 2 2 0 m s 1 w1 forecasted wind speed w2 estimated from wind scale forecasts long term daily average wind speed w3 and annual average wind speed w4 and results showed that the best performance was found by w3 followed with w1 w4 and w2 additionally there was systematic over prediction of all wind speed types which led to eto over prediction indicating that it is necessary to calibrate the wind speed information before utilization in the future work daily eto forecast for lead time up to 7 days by four types of rpm models including rc rf rd and rm rc rf rd and rm models respectively corresponding to w1 w2 w3 and w4 were compared for eight weather sites across china it was found that the rc model gained the best performance for 87 5 of the total stations and the greatest average performance were also obtained by rc followed with rd rm and rf suggesting the w1 was the best type of wind speed that suitable for almost all the climate regions by comparing with the hargreaves samani hs it was found that the performance of four rpm approaches were better than that of hs model in arid and sub arid regions whereas opposite results were found in sub tropical area thus the inclusion of wind speed parameter had positive impact on eto forecast in arid and semi arid regions further it was found that the greatest type of rpm model the rc was superior to hs method for most climate regions including arid humid sub arid and sub humid area thus the w1 wind speed type could be highly recommended for eto forecasting at almost all climate regions since it is easy to use and lead to a great forecast result from a practical viewpoint irrigation system operators can obtain temperature forecasts from public weather forecast messages at no cost from the website such as weather china http www weather com cn further using the rc model with the combined input of temperature forecasts and wind speed of 2 m s 1 these operators can forecast daily eto for lead time up to 7 days and then the real time irrigation decisions can be predicted by irrigation water demand predictions which estimated using the forecasted daily eto acknowledgements this work was financiallysupported by the national

mexico watershed nutrient task force 2008 the nlrs science assessment of each umrb state estimated that the manipulation of n application timing and rate result in an n loading reduction of 10 20 on tile drained land while cover cropping alone was estimated to reduce n loading by 28 40 david et al 2013 illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy 2015 iowa nutrient reduction strategy 2013 minnesota nutrient reduction strategy 2014 missouri nutrient loss reduction strategy 2014 wisconsin nutrient reduction strategy 2013 among all umrb nlrs cover crops demonstrated the highest efficacy to achieve the proposed non point source nutrient loss reduction targets on a watershed scale the scientific literature has demonstrated that actively growing cover crops cc influence the concentration of nitrate no3 n in tile water during the fallow period of the year which frequently results in less nitrate loading drury et al 2014 kaspar et al 2007 2012 strock et al 2004 cc absorb inorganic n from the residual fertilized and mineralized soil n pools affecting the distribution of inorganic n in the soil profile kaspar et al 2007 lacey and armstrong 2014 the presence of both winter kill and winter hardy cc species result in significantly less soil inorganic n at lower soil depths closer to the location of the tile drainage cooper et al 2017 lacey and armstrong 2014 studies have also demonstrated that evapotranspiration from cc reduces the soil moisture content in the fallow period without negatively affecting cash crop yield basche et al 2016 this reduction in soil moisture content has resulted in a higher soil matric potential a lower soil leaching potential and less tile drainage resulting in reduced n loading daigh et al 2014 kaspar et al 2007 qi and helmers 2010 few studies have quantified the environmental impacts of systematic conservation where multiple nutrient loss reduction strategies are concurrently applied to one field such as n application timing and cc in spring n application systems the ability of cover crops to improve water quality has been documented in the literature for example in iowa kaspar et al 2007 studied the system of spring n management combined with cc inclusion and determined that a rye cc significantly reduced the average annual flow weighted no3 n concentration of drainage water by 50 or more compared to the control in minnesota strock et al 2004 also studied the impact of establishing a cereal rye cc following corn within a spring n application system and found a 13 reduction in no3 n loading via tile drainage while fertilizer n applications have been trending toward the spring there remains a large percentage 41 46 of row crop acreage in the umrb that receives fall applied n bierman et al 2012 illinois nutrient loss survey results 2016 lemke et al 2011 ribaudo et al 2012 smiciklas et al 2008 the source of n during this fall n application could be anhydrous ammonia ammonium phosphate or livestock manure equipment and labor availability in the fall reduced n fertilizer costs and spring soil conditions have all been suggested as reasons for fall n application ribaudo et al 2012 smiciklas et al 2008 to achieve the targeted surface area reduction of the gulf of mexico hypoxic zone established by the usepa all agricultural fertilizer n management systems common to the umrb must significantly improve n retention currently there remains a dearth of research concerning the ability of cover crops to reduce tile nitrogen concentrations within fall n application systems and that investigates the concurrent adoption of both n timing and cc therefore the objectives of this study were to quantify the impact of n application timing and cc inclusion on the flow weighted no3 n concentration and loading from agricultural tile drainage within five n management scenarios i applying the dominant portion of the n rate in the spring ii applying the dominant portion of the n rate in the fall iii augmenting the a spring n system with cc iv and augementing the fall n application system with cc and v a zero control without n fertilizer or cc 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and cultural practices the experimental site was located east of lexington illinois 40 38 25 9 n 88 43 11 2 w at the illinois state university nitrogen management research field station the predominant soil types within the approximately 10 ha site are drummer and el paso 67 5 and hartsburg 26 silty clay loams both soil types are common in the central illinois region and are classified as poorly drained with a 0 2 slope the drainage system was established on april 18 2014 three 7 6 cm inside diameter tile laterals spaced 13 7 m apart were installed in each plot at an approximate depth of 0 9 m the laterals merge 4 5 m from a controlled drainage structure before connecting to 15 2 cm main tile precipitation and air temperature data were collected from a weather station located at the experimental site in each year of the experiment the production history of this field consists of an eight year rotation of rain fed strip tilled corn zea mays l and no till soybeans glycine max l which were both harvested for grain this experiment was a continuation of these cultural practices the site was comprised of fifteen individually tile drained 0 65 ha plots each of which included a tile water monitoring station the experiment consisted of five treatments replicated three times arranged in a complete randomized block design the experimental treatments included a zero control no n no cc a spring dominated nitrogen management system with and without cc and a fall dominated nitrogen management system with and without cc table 1 all fall anhydrous ammonia aa was applied with a nitrification inhibitor and application occurred only once soil temperatures fell below 10 c the remaining n was applied as a side dress aa application without an inhibitor near the v6 growth stage specific n sources and rates for each treatment can be found in table 1 corn and soybeans were planted in 76 2 cm rows using a john deere 1770 n t 24 row planter corn was planted at a targeted rate of 86 485 seeds ha 1 on april 30 2015 and april 25 2017 population counts resulted in average corn plant stands of 83 520 plants ha 1 in 2015 and 87 990 plants ha 1 in 2017 soybeans were planted at a rate of 308 875 seeds per hectare on may 7 2016 weather conditions in the early spring of the 2016 growing season caused poor emergence and resulted in an average population of approximately 214 977 soybean plants per hectare due to this reduction in the plant stand a replant at a rate of 135 905 seeds per hectare occurred on may 25 2016 after a population check the replant stand was found to be at approximately 133 434 plants per hectare which resulted in an average of 348 411 plants per ha harvest was conducted on september 23 2015 october 21 2016 and october 9 2017 using a john deere s670 combine with a john deere 608c 8 row head for corn and a john deere 635fd 10 7 meter flex draper head for soybeans deere company moline illinois u s the cc mixture for this study was a 92 cereal rye secale cereal l and 8 daikon radish raphanus sativus l blend calculated by weight first established in september 2014 and was grown in the same plots each year the cc were inter seeded at a rate of 84 kg ha 1 into the standing crops using a hagie sts12 hagie manufacturing company clarion iowa u s modified with an air seeding box in early september throughout the study the daikon radish self terminated through vegetative desiccation in mid to late december following several days of subfreezing weather conditions the cereal rye however is a winter hardy species that was chemically terminated at least two weeks before the anticipated planting of the cash crop along with the chemical termination of the cc the research plots received pesticide applications dependent upon the primary crop and weather conditions 2 2 cover crop shoot samples cc sampling occurred in both the fall and spring to document both above ground shoot biomass and nitrogen uptake within each treatment two 1 m2 quadrants were randomly chosen and the cc shoot biomass was collected to create a representative sample for each treatment this sampling technique is a modified version of dean and weil s method developed in 2009 dean and weil 2009 in fall 2015 and fall 2016 radish and rye shoot biomass was separated and analyzed by species the cc biomass samples were oven dried at 60 c and ground to pass through a 1 mm sieve the dry weight of each biomass sample was determined and used to calculate both total cc biomass as well as total cc nitrogen uptake the dried and ground cc shoot biomass were analyzed for percent total nitrogen using a 0 1000 g sample via the use of a flash 2000 series dry combustion instrument thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts u s the percent total nitrogen was then multiplied by total cc biomass to determine total cc nitrogen uptake kg ha 1 2 3 corn and soybean yield grain yields were calculated by harvesting the entire plot area grain weights were collected from a weigh wagon at harvest a grain subsample was then collected wieghed and dried to measure grain moisture content reported yields were corrected to 0 155 and 0 130 g g 1 moisture content for corn and soybean respectively 2 4 water sampling an automated tile water monitoring and sampling system was employed to determine the no3 n flow weighted concentration and loading through the subsurface drainage system the system included an isco 6712 automated water sampling unit an isco 2105 communication module and an isco 2150 data logger module teledyne isco lincoln nebraska u s all of which were powered by a marine grade 12 volt battery maintained through the use of a solar panel and power inverter the automated sampler collected a 200 ml sample every hour and formed a three hour composite 600 ml sample in each of the twenty four bottles at the completion of the sampling program each plots hydrograph was analyzed and sampled to represent the base flow rising limb peak flow falling limb and the inflection point of the hydrograph using the flowlink software teledyne isco lincoln nebraska u s each of the samples selected to be analyzed was filtered with 0 45 micron filter paper to remove any suspended particulates and analyzed for no3 n concentrations using a lachat quikchem 8500 series flow injection analysis autosampler hach company loveland colorado u s 2 5 statistical analysis the experimental design was a complete random block with three replications of five treatments for each plot the variables of average flow weighted no3 n concentration cumulative no3 n load cover crop aboveground biomass cover crop n uptake and corn and soybean yield were calculated individually by year data for all three years were combined and the main effects of block year cover crop and n application timing were analyzed along with the interactions of cover crop by n application timing cover crop by year n application timing by year and cover crop by n application timing and year using the proc mixed procedure sas 9 4 2017 for all analyses the lsmeans statement was used to apply the tukey s test at the 0 05 probability level to compare treatment means when the analysis of variance indicated significant effects at the 0 05 alpha level 3 results 3 1 weather data the 2014 hydrologic year the hydrologic year was determined based on the average planting date of the cover crop september august was the coldest relative to 2015 and 2016 averaging 1 3 c cooler than the 30 year average there was relatively little variation in air temperature between the 2015 and 2016 hydrologic years averaging 1 2 and 1 1 c above the 30 year average respectively table 2 to examine the influence of weather on different phases of the cropping system each hydrologic year was divided into cover crop september april and cash crop may august growing seasons fig 1 additionally when examining the cover crop growing season both the fall and spring portions were considered separately the average ambient air temperatures for the fall portion september december of the 2014 cover crop growing was slightly below the regional norm while the fall of 2015 and 2016 were slightly above the 30 year average specifically average air temperatures in november of 2015 and 2016 were on average 6 6 c warmer than in 2014 in the spring portion january april of the cover crop growing seasons an average deviation from the 30 year norm of 2 1 1 2 and 2 9 c was observed in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in the spring of 2017 january and february air temperatures were warmer than in spring 2015 and 2016 for example the temperatures were 3 6 and 12 2 c warmer in january and february of 2017 compared to the same months in 2015 average monthly temperatures during the cash crop growing season were similar to the 30 year norm and did not indicate any limitation to corn or soybean growth annual precipitation in 2014 2015 and 2016 hydrologic years was 163 3 mm and 86 1 mm above the 30 year average and 221 0 mm below average respectively table 2 the fall cover crop growing seasons had 137 5 58 2 and 99 3 mm of precipitation relative to the 30 year average in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively spring cumulative precipitation deviated from the 30 year average by 127 1 86 7 and 32 1 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively despite having below average annual rainfall the 2016 hydrologic year had the greatest spring precipitation of all three years specifically 180 6 mm of cumulative rainfall in march and april of 2017 which was above the 30 year norm and had 98 and 38 8 mm greater precipitation relative to the springs of 2015 and 2016 respectively cumulative precipitation during the cash crop growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 hydrologic years was 152 9 114 6 and 89 7 mm compared to the 30 year average respectively in 2014 hydrologic year which was the wettest of the three years may june and july cumulative precipitation were 29 2 and 92 8 mm greater relative to the same period in 2016 or 2017 respectively specifically june of 2015 had the highest precipitation on record for the state of illinois 3 2 cover crop biomass and n uptake the main effect of n application timing did not significantly affect cover crop biomass or n uptake for this reason results and discussion regarding cover crop growth will use averages across n application timing unless otherwise stated 3 2 1 2014 2015 cover crop growing season during the fall of 2014 the rye radish mixture accumulated a total biomass of 298 7 kg ha 1 and a total n uptake of 11 7 kg ha 1 by the following spring rye accumulated significantly greater biomass 1106 7 kg ha 1 and n uptake 53 6 kg n ha 1 compared to fall of 2014 tables 3 and 4 the 2014 2015 cover crop growing season was coldest observed fig 1 during the study which potentially limited fall rye and radish growth cold conditions combined with below average spring precipitation likely limited spring rye growth as well 3 2 2 2015 2016 cover crop growing season the 2015 cover crop season preceded a soybean cash crop and no n fertilizer was applied in contrast to the other cc seasons the cc mixture only had the potential to interact with naturally mineralized n and residual n within the soil from the previous corn season in the fall of 2015 the cc mixture accumulated a total biomass of 1417 3 kg ha 1 and absorbed 59 4 kg n ha 1 above average fall temperatures and precipitation provided an opportunity to accumulate cc growth as a result significantly greater fall biomass and n uptake occurred relative to the fall of 2014 and 2016 specifically above average air temperatures in november 2015 contributed to increased cc growth and a late november radish termination date by chemical termination in the spring of 2016 rye accumulated 1223 3 kg ha 1 of shoot biomass and 31 4 kg n ha 1 of n uptake which was on average less than the total growth that occurred in the preceding fall however spring rye resulted in significantly greater biomass 587 4 kg ha 1 and greater n uptake 6 3 kg n ha 1 relative to the rye alone growth observed in the previous fall 3 2 3 2016 2017 cover crop growing season in the fall of 2016 the cc mixture accumulated an average total biomass of 617 7 kg ha 1 and absorbed 22 9 kg n ha 1 this fall was the driest of the study with precipitation 99 3 mm below the 30 year average it is likely that dry conditions limited both rye and radish fall growth in contrast to the fall of 2015 in which radish accounted for the largest percentage of fall growth fall 2016 radish growth resulted in only 135 7 kg ha 1 of shoot biomass and 5 3 kg n ha 1 of n uptake rye however accounted for 78 482 0 kg ha 1 and 77 17 6 kg n ha 1 of the total fall shoot biomass and n uptake respectively above average temperatures in february and march 2017 allowed the rye to begin growth earlier relative to the first two springs this combined with greater precipitation relative to spring 2015 or 2016 resulted in ideal rye growing conditions as a result the greatest rye biomass 2197 kg ha 1 and n uptake 80 9 kg n ha 1 was observed in the spring of 2017 3 3 corn and soybean yields in 2015 the inclusion of cc significantly reduced corn grain yields by 7 within the spring dominated nitrogen application system however cc did not significantly affect corn grain yields in the fall dominated nitrogen application system furthermore nitrogen application timing had no significant effect on corn grain yields table 5 during the 2016 soybean year no significant differences were observed in grain yield between any of the experimental treatments the presence of cc resulted in significant decreases in corn grain yield in both the fall 22 and spring 16 dominated nitrogen application systems in 2017 however like the previous corn season no significant differences were observed as a result of n application timing table 5 3 4 nitrogen application timing and cover crop inclusion on water quality 3 4 1 impact of nitrogen application timing on tile nitrate n loss in the 2014 hydrologic year tile water flow weighted no3 n concentration was significantly greater in the fall dominated nitrogen treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment by 18 table 6 though this did not translate to significantly different no3 n loads between the two application timings table 7 however in the 2015 or 2016 hydrologic years nitrogen application timing did not have a significant impact on annual average flow weighted no3 n concentrations likewise there was not a significant impact on annual tile n loads during any year of the study soybeans were grown during the 2015 hydrologic year as part of the on going corn soybean crop rotation common to the region therefore no n fertilizer was applied though no n fertilizer was applied there were slightly greater concentrations in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment relative to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment which agrees with the 1 65 times greater no3 n load in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment these findings are similar to those of pittelkow et al 2017 who reported on average greater no3 n concentration and load in the soybean phase of a corn soybean rotation when n was applied in the spring relative to the fall during the 2016 hydrologic year the fall dominated nitrogen treatment resulted in 18 greater no3 n flow weighted concentration relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment however no3 n loads were 14 lower in the fall dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment though not significant three year average annual no3 n concentrations were 11 less in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment but no3 n loads were 25 greater in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment 48 9 kg n ha 1 relative to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment 39 0 kg n ha 1 tables 6 and 7 3 4 2 impact of cover crops on tile nitrate n loss cover crops did not significantly affect flow weighted no3 n concentration or load during the 2014 hydrologic year within n application timing averaged across n timing cc inclusion resulted in 10 less flow weighted no3 n concentration and 11 less no3 n load the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment significantly reduced the no3 n concentration by 24 compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment and resulted in an n load reduction of 34 tables 6 and 7 and fig 2 a there were no significant differences in flow weighted concentration or n load for the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment during the 2015 hydrologic year cover cropping significantly reduced no3 n concentration by 39 and no3 n load by 59 in the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment furthermore there was a trend for cover crops to reduce flow weighted no3 n concentration p 0 119 35 and no3 n load p 0 187 by 50 in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment no significant difference between the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop and fall dominated nitrogen treatments were observed however the flow weighted no3 n and n loads were significantly less in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to spring dominated nitrogen treatment by 40 and 70 respectively in the 2016 hydrologic year both cover crop treatments resulted in a significant reduction of 61 in flow weighted no3 n concentration when compared to their respective non cover cropped treatments cc inclusion resulted in significant no3 n load reductions of 62 within the fall n system and 64 for the spring n system the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment significantly reduced both no3 n concentration and n load compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment by 67 and 58 respectively additionally both no3 n concentration and load were 54 and 67 less in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment 3 4 3 tile nitrate n loss from the zero control treatment within the 2014 hydrologic year the tile flow weighted no3 n concentration 7 18 mg l 1 of the zero control was significantly less relative to the fall dominated nitrogen 10 48 mg l 1 and fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop 9 52 mg l 1 treatments and was similar to both the spring dominated nitrogen and spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatments table 6 the zero control flow weighted no3 n concentration 4 29 mg l 1 was similar to all treatments in the 2015 hydrologic year during the 2016 hydrologic year flow weighted no3 n concentrations in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop 5 48 mg l 1 and spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop 4 65 mg l 1 treatments were significantly lower relative to the zero control 8 29 mg l 1 on the other hand the fall dominated nitrogen 13 98 mg l 1 and spring dominated nitrogen 11 80 mg l 1 treatments resulted in significantly greater flow weighted no3 n concentrations when compared to the zero control 8 92 mg l 1 when considering no3 n load there was no significant difference between the zero control and all other treatments that received fertilizer n over the course of the experiment however on average the no3 n loading for treatments augmented with cc was 66 lower than the zero control table 7 4 discussion 4 1 cover crop biomass growth and n uptake cover crops have been identified within the nlrs of umrb states as the most efficient in field practice to mitigate non point source no3 n contributions to surface waterways the efficacy of cover crops to generate no3 n reduction depends primarily on cover crop growth in the current study we observed considerable year to year variation in radish shoot biomass 120 894 6 kg ha 1 and n uptake 5 7 40 6 kg n ha 1 however fall rye shoot biomass 465 2 683 3 kg ha 1 and n uptake 17 2 26 1 kg n ha 1 was relatively consistent these observations suggest that radish influenced the variation in fall growth of the cover crop mixture the data also demonstrated that the selection of a cover crop mixture allows for responsive cover crop growth in the event of abnormal increases in air temperature and precipitation in the fall that create ideal conditions for n losses via leaching through tile drainage spring rye biomass 1098 7 2208 3 kg ha 1 and n uptake 50 6 83 3 kg n ha 1 were similar to what has been reported in the literature for rye grown as a monoculture johnson et al 1998 dean and weil 2009 kaspar et al 2012 lacey and armstrong 2015 white and weil 2010 also examined a rye radish mixture over a two year study they reported rye radish and combined biomass ranges 763 869 kg ha 1 771 1821 kg ha 1 and 1640 2584 kg ha 1 respectively observed rye and radish biomass ranges reported in that study differed from our study likely due to variation in location weather cash crop n management and cover crop management 4 2 impact of nitrogen application timing and zero control on tile no3 n losses in the umrb a consistent emphasis has been placed on transitioning fall applied n to the spring as pre plant or side dress applications closer to the timing of peak n demand of corn to reduce the susceptibility of n loss from agricultural fields illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy 2015 ribaudo et al 2012 in our study this transitioning of fall applied n to the spring resulted in an 11 reduction in flow weighted no3 n and a 25 increase in no3 n load over a three year period this trend of variability in no3 n load reductions between fall and spring n management is consistent with the literature that suggests switching from a fall n system to a majority spring n system results in a 67 to 52 reduction in no3 n load via tile drainage with an average of 9 3 randall et al 2003 randall and vetsch 2005 randall and mulla 2001 dinnes 2004 rejesus and hornbaker 1999 specifically in our study when considering no3 n load we observed 66 greater no3 n load for the spring dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment during the soybean this trend is corroborated by other tile drainage studies within the umrb that found 32 less and 88 greater n load for spring n versus fall n during soybean years randall and vetsch 2005 pittelkow et al 2017 these observations indicate that in spring n systems reductions in excessive no3 n leaching could be attributed to a timely n application and corn n uptake however in the subsequent fallow period and soybean growing season a significant mass of residual n loss occurs via tile drainage when n fertilizer is applied in the spring randall and vetsch 2005 pittelkow et al 2017 additionally our data agree with the literature and confirms that switching n application timing alone is not adequate to achieve n load reductions in the umrb that could lead to a significant reduction in the size of the gulf of mexico hypoxic zone one of the unexpected observations from our study was the fact that no3 n loading via tile drainage was similar for the zero control that did not receive n fertilizer to both the fall dominated nitrogen and spring dominated nitrogen that received the full rate of n fertilizer contributing factors to this finding may be differences in corn yield and n uptake between the zero control and fertilized treatments fertilized plots resulted in an average of 2 5 times greater corn yield then the zero control table 5 it is likely that unfertilized corn plants resulted in less evapotranspiration and exerted less physical demand on the no3 n in the soil solution due to poor n nutrition and root development furthermore the soil at the experimental site had an average soil organic matter of 3 4 which could be contributing to increased inorganic n within the soil solution 4 3 impact of cover crop inclusion on spring and fall n application systems in our study combining a spring n application with cover crops resulted in a 39 and 47 reduction in no3 n flow weighted concentration and load respectively these reductions were consistent with what was observed in the literature where cover crops in spring n application systems reduced flow weighted no3 n concentration by 30 59 kaspar et al 2007 kaspar et al 2012 drury et al 2014 and no3 n load by 12 61 strock et al 2004 kaspar et al 2007 2012 drury et al 2014 with the exception of strock et al 2004 who reported that rye reduced flow weighted no3 n concentrations by 13 over a 3 year period which was drastically lower due to the application of cover crops only after corn to address n loading from fall n application which is common in the umrb one objective our study was to compare the effectiveness of augmenting a fall n application system with cover crops to a fall n system without cover crops we observed that cc reduced the mean annual flow weighted no3 n concentrations of tile water by 38 and no3 n load by 40 when added to a fall n application system to the authors knowledge the data presented in this study represent the only report of the impact of cc on tile no3 n in fall n application systems however these reductions are similar to those in spring n application systems reported in both this study and the literature suggesting that despite n application timing cover crops are effective at reducing tile n losses additionally we found that no3 n reductions due to cover crops occurred across the entire hydrologic year fig 2b and c demonstrating that the impact of cc on water quality is not limited only to the cc growing season moreover unlike n application timing cc inclusion resulted in water quality benefits in years where n was not applied for example we observed an average reduction of 37 in the soybean year which is similar to 42 reported by kaspar et al 2007 this annual impact of cc on n loading could be attributed n cycling where cc are altering the concentration and distribution of available n in the soil profile making a smaller mass of no3 n susceptible to loss through tile drainage lacey and armstrong 2014 johnson et al 1998 in our study an example of n cycling is that on average we found a 2 1 ratio of cc shoot n relative to n that cover crops prevented from leaving via tile drainage this is a conservative measure of cc n cycling potential because it is not considering the n that is in the cc roots moreover both cc treatments reduced n loading by 66 on average relative to the zero control this indicates that cc are potentially absorbing naturally mineralized n that contributes to n loss via tile drainage adjusting the n application timing from fall to spring application of n and cover cropping have both demonstrated the potential to be effective n loss reduction methods combination the two methods reduced flow weighted no3 n concentrations by 39 however the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment only resulted in an average reduction of 46 in no3 n concentration relative to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment fig 2d this suggests that while not additive the combination of spring n application timing and cover cropping does result in increased efficacy to reduce no3 n losses through agricultural subsurface drainage systems despite the long standing effort to encourage farmer adoption of spring n application systems in the umrb there are many watersheds in the region where it is a common practice for a significant mass of n to be fall applied as anhydrous ammonia ammonium phosphate and manure bierman et al 2012 illinois nutrient loss survey results 2016 lemke et al 2011 ribaudo et al 2012 smiciklas et al 2008 results of this study demonstrated that applying fall n into a living cc stand resulted in a 30 and 52 reduction in no3 n concentration and load relative to applying n in the spring without the presence of cc this observation suggests that augmenting a fall n system with cc could be an effective adaptive bmp that reduces the susceptibility of n loading via tile drainage in watersheds dominated by fall applied n 5 conclusion the results of this study confirmed that right timing of n application alone results in a variable impact on n loading via tile drainage and that coupling in field n reduction practices are most effective adoption of a cc mixture allows for responsive cover crop growth in the event of abnormal increases in air temperature and precipitation in the fall or spring that results in ideal conditions for n losses through tile drainage zero application of fertilizer n resulted in similar no3 n loading compared to fall and spring n management systems without cover crops however augmenting those systems with cover crops drastically reduced n loss when compared to the non fertilized plots the presence of cover crops reduced corn yields but did not affect soybean yields the inclusion of cc was an effective no3 n loss mitigation strategy regardless of the n fertilizer application timing finally cc proved to be effective in reducing no3 n loading through tile drainage across the spectrum of n fertilizer management systems common to the

11286,significant reductions in nitrogen loading from sub surface drainage fields of the upper mississippi river basin to the gulf of mexico will most likely be achieved from the mass adoption of nutrient loss reduction strategies at a watershed scale few studies have quantified the efficacy of cover crops to reduce no3 n loading in nitrogen fertilizer management systems where the dominant portion of the n rate is applied in the spring or fall both of which are common practices in the upper mississippi river basin in this experiment we quantified the impact of n application timing and cover crop inclusion on no3 n loss leaching from agricultural sub surface drainage within five nitrogen management scenarios a zero control applying the dominant portion of the n rate in the spring applying the dominant portion of the n rate in the fall augmenting the a spring and fall n application system with cover crop each of the five nitrogen management scenarios was replicated three times on individually monitored sub surface drainage plots established in lexington il during the experiment a cereal rye secale cereal l and radish raphanus sativus l blend was interseeded within both corn zea mays l and soybean glycine max l fertilizer n application timing did not affect cover crop growth or n uptake the inclusion of cover crop resulted in more consistent and greater no3 n loss reductions relative to adjusting fertilizer n application timing from fall to spring cover crop reduced the flow weighted no3 n concentrations by 39 and 38 and the n load by 40 and 47 when added to spring and fall fertilizer n management systems respectively cover crop proved to be effective in reducing no3 n loss through sub surface drainage across the spectrum of n fertilizer management

inorganic fertilizer nitrogen n management for row crop production only affects a minute percentage of the soils total n however within exported tile drainage water inorganic n is a significant proportion of the total n blesh and drinkwater 2014 furthermore low fertilizer n efficiency of row crops combined with high tile drainage density in the upper mississippi river basin umrb contribute to the export of excessive n local water quality issues and the hypoxic zone in the gulf of mexico gardner and drinkwater 2009 smil 1999 the severity of this n loading issue resulted in the united states environmental protection agency gulf of mexico hypoxia task force requiring umrb states to develop a nutrient loss reduction strategy nlrs to reduce n and p loading mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force 2008 the nlrs science assessment of each umrb state estimated that the manipulation of n application timing and rate result in an n loading reduction of 10 20 on tile drained land while cover cropping alone was estimated to reduce n loading by 28 40 david et al 2013 illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy 2015 iowa nutrient reduction strategy 2013 minnesota nutrient reduction strategy 2014 missouri nutrient loss reduction strategy 2014 wisconsin nutrient reduction strategy 2013 among all umrb nlrs cover crops demonstrated the highest efficacy to achieve the proposed non point source nutrient loss reduction targets on a watershed scale the scientific literature has demonstrated that actively growing cover crops cc influence the concentration of nitrate no3 n in tile water during the fallow period of the year which frequently results in less nitrate loading drury et al 2014 kaspar et al 2007 2012 strock et al 2004 cc absorb inorganic n from the residual fertilized and mineralized soil n pools affecting the distribution of inorganic n in the soil profile kaspar et al 2007 lacey and armstrong 2014 the presence of both winter kill and winter hardy cc species result in significantly less soil inorganic n at lower soil depths closer to the location of the tile drainage cooper et al 2017 lacey and armstrong 2014 studies have also demonstrated that evapotranspiration from cc reduces the soil moisture content in the fallow period without negatively affecting cash crop yield basche et al 2016 this reduction in soil moisture content has resulted in a higher soil matric potential a lower soil leaching potential and less tile drainage resulting in reduced n loading daigh et al 2014 kaspar et al 2007 qi and helmers 2010 few studies have quantified the environmental impacts of systematic conservation where multiple nutrient loss reduction strategies are concurrently applied to one field such as n application timing and cc in spring n application systems the ability of cover crops to improve water quality has been documented in the literature for example in iowa kaspar et al 2007 studied the system of spring n management combined with cc inclusion and determined that a rye cc significantly reduced the average annual flow weighted no3 n concentration of drainage water by 50 or more compared to the control in minnesota strock et al 2004 also studied the impact of establishing a cereal rye cc following corn within a spring n application system and found a 13 reduction in no3 n loading via tile drainage while fertilizer n applications have been trending toward the spring there remains a large percentage 41 46 of row crop acreage in the umrb that receives fall applied n bierman et al 2012 illinois nutrient loss survey results 2016 lemke et al 2011 ribaudo et al 2012 smiciklas et al 2008 the source of n during this fall n application could be anhydrous ammonia ammonium phosphate or livestock manure equipment and labor availability in the fall reduced n fertilizer costs and spring soil conditions have all been suggested as reasons for fall n application ribaudo et al 2012 smiciklas et al 2008 to achieve the targeted surface area reduction of the gulf of mexico hypoxic zone established by the usepa all agricultural fertilizer n management systems common to the umrb must significantly improve n retention currently there remains a dearth of research concerning the ability of cover crops to reduce tile nitrogen concentrations within fall n application systems and that investigates the concurrent adoption of both n timing and cc therefore the objectives of this study were to quantify the impact of n application timing and cc inclusion on the flow weighted no3 n concentration and loading from agricultural tile drainage within five n management scenarios i applying the dominant portion of the n rate in the spring ii applying the dominant portion of the n rate in the fall iii augmenting the a spring n system with cc iv and augementing the fall n application system with cc and v a zero control without n fertilizer or cc 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and cultural practices the experimental site was located east of lexington illinois 40 38 25 9 n 88 43 11 2 w at the illinois state university nitrogen management research field station the predominant soil types within the approximately 10 ha site are drummer and el paso 67 5 and hartsburg 26 silty clay loams both soil types are common in the central illinois region and are classified as poorly drained with a 0 2 slope the drainage system was established on april 18 2014 three 7 6 cm inside diameter tile laterals spaced 13 7 m apart were installed in each plot at an approximate depth of 0 9 m the laterals merge 4 5 m from a controlled drainage structure before connecting to 15 2 cm main tile precipitation and air temperature data were collected from a weather station located at the experimental site in each year of the experiment the production history of this field consists of an eight year rotation of rain fed strip tilled corn zea mays l and no till soybeans glycine max l which were both harvested for grain this experiment was a continuation of these cultural practices the site was comprised of fifteen individually tile drained 0 65 ha plots each of which included a tile water monitoring station the experiment consisted of five treatments replicated three times arranged in a complete randomized block design the experimental treatments included a zero control no n no cc a spring dominated nitrogen management system with and without cc and a fall dominated nitrogen management system with and without cc table 1 all fall anhydrous ammonia aa was applied with a nitrification inhibitor and application occurred only once soil temperatures fell below 10 c the remaining n was applied as a side dress aa application without an inhibitor near the v6 growth stage specific n sources and rates for each treatment can be found in table 1 corn and soybeans were planted in 76 2 cm rows using a john deere 1770 n t 24 row planter corn was planted at a targeted rate of 86 485 seeds ha 1 on april 30 2015 and april 25 2017 population counts resulted in average corn plant stands of 83 520 plants ha 1 in 2015 and 87 990 plants ha 1 in 2017 soybeans were planted at a rate of 308 875 seeds per hectare on may 7 2016 weather conditions in the early spring of the 2016 growing season caused poor emergence and resulted in an average population of approximately 214 977 soybean plants per hectare due to this reduction in the plant stand a replant at a rate of 135 905 seeds per hectare occurred on may 25 2016 after a population check the replant stand was found to be at approximately 133 434 plants per hectare which resulted in an average of 348 411 plants per ha harvest was conducted on september 23 2015 october 21 2016 and october 9 2017 using a john deere s670 combine with a john deere 608c 8 row head for corn and a john deere 635fd 10 7 meter flex draper head for soybeans deere company moline illinois u s the cc mixture for this study was a 92 cereal rye secale cereal l and 8 daikon radish raphanus sativus l blend calculated by weight first established in september 2014 and was grown in the same plots each year the cc were inter seeded at a rate of 84 kg ha 1 into the standing crops using a hagie sts12 hagie manufacturing company clarion iowa u s modified with an air seeding box in early september throughout the study the daikon radish self terminated through vegetative desiccation in mid to late december following several days of subfreezing weather conditions the cereal rye however is a winter hardy species that was chemically terminated at least two weeks before the anticipated planting of the cash crop along with the chemical termination of the cc the research plots received pesticide applications dependent upon the primary crop and weather conditions 2 2 cover crop shoot samples cc sampling occurred in both the fall and spring to document both above ground shoot biomass and nitrogen uptake within each treatment two 1 m2 quadrants were randomly chosen and the cc shoot biomass was collected to create a representative sample for each treatment this sampling technique is a modified version of dean and weil s method developed in 2009 dean and weil 2009 in fall 2015 and fall 2016 radish and rye shoot biomass was separated and analyzed by species the cc biomass samples were oven dried at 60 c and ground to pass through a 1 mm sieve the dry weight of each biomass sample was determined and used to calculate both total cc biomass as well as total cc nitrogen uptake the dried and ground cc shoot biomass were analyzed for percent total nitrogen using a 0 1000 g sample via the use of a flash 2000 series dry combustion instrument thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts u s the percent total nitrogen was then multiplied by total cc biomass to determine total cc nitrogen uptake kg ha 1 2 3 corn and soybean yield grain yields were calculated by harvesting the entire plot area grain weights were collected from a weigh wagon at harvest a grain subsample was then collected wieghed and dried to measure grain moisture content reported yields were corrected to 0 155 and 0 130 g g 1 moisture content for corn and soybean respectively 2 4 water sampling an automated tile water monitoring and sampling system was employed to determine the no3 n flow weighted concentration and loading through the subsurface drainage system the system included an isco 6712 automated water sampling unit an isco 2105 communication module and an isco 2150 data logger module teledyne isco lincoln nebraska u s all of which were powered by a marine grade 12 volt battery maintained through the use of a solar panel and power inverter the automated sampler collected a 200 ml sample every hour and formed a three hour composite 600 ml sample in each of the twenty four bottles at the completion of the sampling program each plots hydrograph was analyzed and sampled to represent the base flow rising limb peak flow falling limb and the inflection point of the hydrograph using the flowlink software teledyne isco lincoln nebraska u s each of the samples selected to be analyzed was filtered with 0 45 micron filter paper to remove any suspended particulates and analyzed for no3 n concentrations using a lachat quikchem 8500 series flow injection analysis autosampler hach company loveland colorado u s 2 5 statistical analysis the experimental design was a complete random block with three replications of five treatments for each plot the variables of average flow weighted no3 n concentration cumulative no3 n load cover crop aboveground biomass cover crop n uptake and corn and soybean yield were calculated individually by year data for all three years were combined and the main effects of block year cover crop and n application timing were analyzed along with the interactions of cover crop by n application timing cover crop by year n application timing by year and cover crop by n application timing and year using the proc mixed procedure sas 9 4 2017 for all analyses the lsmeans statement was used to apply the tukey s test at the 0 05 probability level to compare treatment means when the analysis of variance indicated significant effects at the 0 05 alpha level 3 results 3 1 weather data the 2014 hydrologic year the hydrologic year was determined based on the average planting date of the cover crop september august was the coldest relative to 2015 and 2016 averaging 1 3 c cooler than the 30 year average there was relatively little variation in air temperature between the 2015 and 2016 hydrologic years averaging 1 2 and 1 1 c above the 30 year average respectively table 2 to examine the influence of weather on different phases of the cropping system each hydrologic year was divided into cover crop september april and cash crop may august growing seasons fig 1 additionally when examining the cover crop growing season both the fall and spring portions were considered separately the average ambient air temperatures for the fall portion september december of the 2014 cover crop growing was slightly below the regional norm while the fall of 2015 and 2016 were slightly above the 30 year average specifically average air temperatures in november of 2015 and 2016 were on average 6 6 c warmer than in 2014 in the spring portion january april of the cover crop growing seasons an average deviation from the 30 year norm of 2 1 1 2 and 2 9 c was observed in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively in the spring of 2017 january and february air temperatures were warmer than in spring 2015 and 2016 for example the temperatures were 3 6 and 12 2 c warmer in january and february of 2017 compared to the same months in 2015 average monthly temperatures during the cash crop growing season were similar to the 30 year norm and did not indicate any limitation to corn or soybean growth annual precipitation in 2014 2015 and 2016 hydrologic years was 163 3 mm and 86 1 mm above the 30 year average and 221 0 mm below average respectively table 2 the fall cover crop growing seasons had 137 5 58 2 and 99 3 mm of precipitation relative to the 30 year average in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively spring cumulative precipitation deviated from the 30 year average by 127 1 86 7 and 32 1 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively despite having below average annual rainfall the 2016 hydrologic year had the greatest spring precipitation of all three years specifically 180 6 mm of cumulative rainfall in march and april of 2017 which was above the 30 year norm and had 98 and 38 8 mm greater precipitation relative to the springs of 2015 and 2016 respectively cumulative precipitation during the cash crop growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 hydrologic years was 152 9 114 6 and 89 7 mm compared to the 30 year average respectively in 2014 hydrologic year which was the wettest of the three years may june and july cumulative precipitation were 29 2 and 92 8 mm greater relative to the same period in 2016 or 2017 respectively specifically june of 2015 had the highest precipitation on record for the state of illinois 3 2 cover crop biomass and n uptake the main effect of n application timing did not significantly affect cover crop biomass or n uptake for this reason results and discussion regarding cover crop growth will use averages across n application timing unless otherwise stated 3 2 1 2014 2015 cover crop growing season during the fall of 2014 the rye radish mixture accumulated a total biomass of 298 7 kg ha 1 and a total n uptake of 11 7 kg ha 1 by the following spring rye accumulated significantly greater biomass 1106 7 kg ha 1 and n uptake 53 6 kg n ha 1 compared to fall of 2014 tables 3 and 4 the 2014 2015 cover crop growing season was coldest observed fig 1 during the study which potentially limited fall rye and radish growth cold conditions combined with below average spring precipitation likely limited spring rye growth as well 3 2 2 2015 2016 cover crop growing season the 2015 cover crop season preceded a soybean cash crop and no n fertilizer was applied in contrast to the other cc seasons the cc mixture only had the potential to interact with naturally mineralized n and residual n within the soil from the previous corn season in the fall of 2015 the cc mixture accumulated a total biomass of 1417 3 kg ha 1 and absorbed 59 4 kg n ha 1 above average fall temperatures and precipitation provided an opportunity to accumulate cc growth as a result significantly greater fall biomass and n uptake occurred relative to the fall of 2014 and 2016 specifically above average air temperatures in november 2015 contributed to increased cc growth and a late november radish termination date by chemical termination in the spring of 2016 rye accumulated 1223 3 kg ha 1 of shoot biomass and 31 4 kg n ha 1 of n uptake which was on average less than the total growth that occurred in the preceding fall however spring rye resulted in significantly greater biomass 587 4 kg ha 1 and greater n uptake 6 3 kg n ha 1 relative to the rye alone growth observed in the previous fall 3 2 3 2016 2017 cover crop growing season in the fall of 2016 the cc mixture accumulated an average total biomass of 617 7 kg ha 1 and absorbed 22 9 kg n ha 1 this fall was the driest of the study with precipitation 99 3 mm below the 30 year average it is likely that dry conditions limited both rye and radish fall growth in contrast to the fall of 2015 in which radish accounted for the largest percentage of fall growth fall 2016 radish growth resulted in only 135 7 kg ha 1 of shoot biomass and 5 3 kg n ha 1 of n uptake rye however accounted for 78 482 0 kg ha 1 and 77 17 6 kg n ha 1 of the total fall shoot biomass and n uptake respectively above average temperatures in february and march 2017 allowed the rye to begin growth earlier relative to the first two springs this combined with greater precipitation relative to spring 2015 or 2016 resulted in ideal rye growing conditions as a result the greatest rye biomass 2197 kg ha 1 and n uptake 80 9 kg n ha 1 was observed in the spring of 2017 3 3 corn and soybean yields in 2015 the inclusion of cc significantly reduced corn grain yields by 7 within the spring dominated nitrogen application system however cc did not significantly affect corn grain yields in the fall dominated nitrogen application system furthermore nitrogen application timing had no significant effect on corn grain yields table 5 during the 2016 soybean year no significant differences were observed in grain yield between any of the experimental treatments the presence of cc resulted in significant decreases in corn grain yield in both the fall 22 and spring 16 dominated nitrogen application systems in 2017 however like the previous corn season no significant differences were observed as a result of n application timing table 5 3 4 nitrogen application timing and cover crop inclusion on water quality 3 4 1 impact of nitrogen application timing on tile nitrate n loss in the 2014 hydrologic year tile water flow weighted no3 n concentration was significantly greater in the fall dominated nitrogen treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment by 18 table 6 though this did not translate to significantly different no3 n loads between the two application timings table 7 however in the 2015 or 2016 hydrologic years nitrogen application timing did not have a significant impact on annual average flow weighted no3 n concentrations likewise there was not a significant impact on annual tile n loads during any year of the study soybeans were grown during the 2015 hydrologic year as part of the on going corn soybean crop rotation common to the region therefore no n fertilizer was applied though no n fertilizer was applied there were slightly greater concentrations in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment relative to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment which agrees with the 1 65 times greater no3 n load in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment these findings are similar to those of pittelkow et al 2017 who reported on average greater no3 n concentration and load in the soybean phase of a corn soybean rotation when n was applied in the spring relative to the fall during the 2016 hydrologic year the fall dominated nitrogen treatment resulted in 18 greater no3 n flow weighted concentration relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment however no3 n loads were 14 lower in the fall dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment though not significant three year average annual no3 n concentrations were 11 less in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment but no3 n loads were 25 greater in the spring dominated nitrogen treatment 48 9 kg n ha 1 relative to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment 39 0 kg n ha 1 tables 6 and 7 3 4 2 impact of cover crops on tile nitrate n loss cover crops did not significantly affect flow weighted no3 n concentration or load during the 2014 hydrologic year within n application timing averaged across n timing cc inclusion resulted in 10 less flow weighted no3 n concentration and 11 less no3 n load the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment significantly reduced the no3 n concentration by 24 compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment and resulted in an n load reduction of 34 tables 6 and 7 and fig 2 a there were no significant differences in flow weighted concentration or n load for the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment during the 2015 hydrologic year cover cropping significantly reduced no3 n concentration by 39 and no3 n load by 59 in the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment furthermore there was a trend for cover crops to reduce flow weighted no3 n concentration p 0 119 35 and no3 n load p 0 187 by 50 in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment no significant difference between the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop and fall dominated nitrogen treatments were observed however the flow weighted no3 n and n loads were significantly less in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to spring dominated nitrogen treatment by 40 and 70 respectively in the 2016 hydrologic year both cover crop treatments resulted in a significant reduction of 61 in flow weighted no3 n concentration when compared to their respective non cover cropped treatments cc inclusion resulted in significant no3 n load reductions of 62 within the fall n system and 64 for the spring n system the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment significantly reduced both no3 n concentration and n load compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment by 67 and 58 respectively additionally both no3 n concentration and load were 54 and 67 less in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment relative to the spring dominated nitrogen treatment 3 4 3 tile nitrate n loss from the zero control treatment within the 2014 hydrologic year the tile flow weighted no3 n concentration 7 18 mg l 1 of the zero control was significantly less relative to the fall dominated nitrogen 10 48 mg l 1 and fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop 9 52 mg l 1 treatments and was similar to both the spring dominated nitrogen and spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatments table 6 the zero control flow weighted no3 n concentration 4 29 mg l 1 was similar to all treatments in the 2015 hydrologic year during the 2016 hydrologic year flow weighted no3 n concentrations in the fall dominated nitrogen with cover crop 5 48 mg l 1 and spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop 4 65 mg l 1 treatments were significantly lower relative to the zero control 8 29 mg l 1 on the other hand the fall dominated nitrogen 13 98 mg l 1 and spring dominated nitrogen 11 80 mg l 1 treatments resulted in significantly greater flow weighted no3 n concentrations when compared to the zero control 8 92 mg l 1 when considering no3 n load there was no significant difference between the zero control and all other treatments that received fertilizer n over the course of the experiment however on average the no3 n loading for treatments augmented with cc was 66 lower than the zero control table 7 4 discussion 4 1 cover crop biomass growth and n uptake cover crops have been identified within the nlrs of umrb states as the most efficient in field practice to mitigate non point source no3 n contributions to surface waterways the efficacy of cover crops to generate no3 n reduction depends primarily on cover crop growth in the current study we observed considerable year to year variation in radish shoot biomass 120 894 6 kg ha 1 and n uptake 5 7 40 6 kg n ha 1 however fall rye shoot biomass 465 2 683 3 kg ha 1 and n uptake 17 2 26 1 kg n ha 1 was relatively consistent these observations suggest that radish influenced the variation in fall growth of the cover crop mixture the data also demonstrated that the selection of a cover crop mixture allows for responsive cover crop growth in the event of abnormal increases in air temperature and precipitation in the fall that create ideal conditions for n losses via leaching through tile drainage spring rye biomass 1098 7 2208 3 kg ha 1 and n uptake 50 6 83 3 kg n ha 1 were similar to what has been reported in the literature for rye grown as a monoculture johnson et al 1998 dean and weil 2009 kaspar et al 2012 lacey and armstrong 2015 white and weil 2010 also examined a rye radish mixture over a two year study they reported rye radish and combined biomass ranges 763 869 kg ha 1 771 1821 kg ha 1 and 1640 2584 kg ha 1 respectively observed rye and radish biomass ranges reported in that study differed from our study likely due to variation in location weather cash crop n management and cover crop management 4 2 impact of nitrogen application timing and zero control on tile no3 n losses in the umrb a consistent emphasis has been placed on transitioning fall applied n to the spring as pre plant or side dress applications closer to the timing of peak n demand of corn to reduce the susceptibility of n loss from agricultural fields illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy 2015 ribaudo et al 2012 in our study this transitioning of fall applied n to the spring resulted in an 11 reduction in flow weighted no3 n and a 25 increase in no3 n load over a three year period this trend of variability in no3 n load reductions between fall and spring n management is consistent with the literature that suggests switching from a fall n system to a majority spring n system results in a 67 to 52 reduction in no3 n load via tile drainage with an average of 9 3 randall et al 2003 randall and vetsch 2005 randall and mulla 2001 dinnes 2004 rejesus and hornbaker 1999 specifically in our study when considering no3 n load we observed 66 greater no3 n load for the spring dominated nitrogen treatment compared to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment during the soybean this trend is corroborated by other tile drainage studies within the umrb that found 32 less and 88 greater n load for spring n versus fall n during soybean years randall and vetsch 2005 pittelkow et al 2017 these observations indicate that in spring n systems reductions in excessive no3 n leaching could be attributed to a timely n application and corn n uptake however in the subsequent fallow period and soybean growing season a significant mass of residual n loss occurs via tile drainage when n fertilizer is applied in the spring randall and vetsch 2005 pittelkow et al 2017 additionally our data agree with the literature and confirms that switching n application timing alone is not adequate to achieve n load reductions in the umrb that could lead to a significant reduction in the size of the gulf of mexico hypoxic zone one of the unexpected observations from our study was the fact that no3 n loading via tile drainage was similar for the zero control that did not receive n fertilizer to both the fall dominated nitrogen and spring dominated nitrogen that received the full rate of n fertilizer contributing factors to this finding may be differences in corn yield and n uptake between the zero control and fertilized treatments fertilized plots resulted in an average of 2 5 times greater corn yield then the zero control table 5 it is likely that unfertilized corn plants resulted in less evapotranspiration and exerted less physical demand on the no3 n in the soil solution due to poor n nutrition and root development furthermore the soil at the experimental site had an average soil organic matter of 3 4 which could be contributing to increased inorganic n within the soil solution 4 3 impact of cover crop inclusion on spring and fall n application systems in our study combining a spring n application with cover crops resulted in a 39 and 47 reduction in no3 n flow weighted concentration and load respectively these reductions were consistent with what was observed in the literature where cover crops in spring n application systems reduced flow weighted no3 n concentration by 30 59 kaspar et al 2007 kaspar et al 2012 drury et al 2014 and no3 n load by 12 61 strock et al 2004 kaspar et al 2007 2012 drury et al 2014 with the exception of strock et al 2004 who reported that rye reduced flow weighted no3 n concentrations by 13 over a 3 year period which was drastically lower due to the application of cover crops only after corn to address n loading from fall n application which is common in the umrb one objective our study was to compare the effectiveness of augmenting a fall n application system with cover crops to a fall n system without cover crops we observed that cc reduced the mean annual flow weighted no3 n concentrations of tile water by 38 and no3 n load by 40 when added to a fall n application system to the authors knowledge the data presented in this study represent the only report of the impact of cc on tile no3 n in fall n application systems however these reductions are similar to those in spring n application systems reported in both this study and the literature suggesting that despite n application timing cover crops are effective at reducing tile n losses additionally we found that no3 n reductions due to cover crops occurred across the entire hydrologic year fig 2b and c demonstrating that the impact of cc on water quality is not limited only to the cc growing season moreover unlike n application timing cc inclusion resulted in water quality benefits in years where n was not applied for example we observed an average reduction of 37 in the soybean year which is similar to 42 reported by kaspar et al 2007 this annual impact of cc on n loading could be attributed n cycling where cc are altering the concentration and distribution of available n in the soil profile making a smaller mass of no3 n susceptible to loss through tile drainage lacey and armstrong 2014 johnson et al 1998 in our study an example of n cycling is that on average we found a 2 1 ratio of cc shoot n relative to n that cover crops prevented from leaving via tile drainage this is a conservative measure of cc n cycling potential because it is not considering the n that is in the cc roots moreover both cc treatments reduced n loading by 66 on average relative to the zero control this indicates that cc are potentially absorbing naturally mineralized n that contributes to n loss via tile drainage adjusting the n application timing from fall to spring application of n and cover cropping have both demonstrated the potential to be effective n loss reduction methods combination the two methods reduced flow weighted no3 n concentrations by 39 however the spring dominated nitrogen with cover crop treatment only resulted in an average reduction of 46 in no3 n concentration relative to the fall dominated nitrogen treatment fig 2d this suggests that while not additive the combination of spring n application timing and cover cropping does result in increased efficacy to reduce no3 n losses through agricultural subsurface drainage systems despite the long standing effort to encourage farmer adoption of spring n application systems in the umrb there are many watersheds in the region where it is a common practice for a significant mass of n to be fall applied as anhydrous ammonia ammonium phosphate and manure bierman et al 2012 illinois nutrient loss survey results 2016 lemke et al 2011 ribaudo et al 2012 smiciklas et al 2008 results of this study demonstrated that applying fall n into a living cc stand resulted in a 30 and 52 reduction in no3 n concentration and load relative to applying n in the spring without the presence of cc this observation suggests that augmenting a fall n system with cc could be an effective adaptive bmp that reduces the susceptibility of n loading via tile drainage in watersheds dominated by fall applied n 5 conclusion the results of this study confirmed that right timing of n application alone results in a variable impact on n loading via tile drainage and that coupling in field n reduction practices are most effective adoption of a cc mixture allows for responsive cover crop growth in the event of abnormal increases in air temperature and precipitation in the fall or spring that results in ideal conditions for n losses through tile drainage zero application of fertilizer n resulted in similar no3 n loading compared to fall and spring n management systems without cover crops however augmenting those systems with cover crops drastically reduced n loss when compared to the non fertilized plots the presence of cover crops reduced corn yields but did not affect soybean yields the inclusion of cc was an effective no3 n loss mitigation strategy regardless of the n fertilizer application timing finally cc proved to be effective in reducing no3 n loading through tile drainage across the spectrum of n fertilizer management systems common to the

water saving techniques which could potentially reduce irrigation water input for rice cultivation through alteration of soil submergence period with period of soil non submergence unsaturated soil conditions during the growing season rice straw is often scattered in the field after harvest or burned in intensive rice cultivation systems response of irrigated lowland rice with respect to grain yield and water use under different water and rice straw management practices largely remains unknown field experiments were conducted at the ayutthaya rice research center ayutthaya thailand in two consecutive rice growing seasons wet and dry of 2016 2017 to evaluate the growth yield and water productivity of irrigated lowland rice under different water and rice straw management practices the treatments included were two water continuous flooding cf and awd and three rice straw management practices rice straw incorporation rs i rice straw burning rs b and without rice straw incorporation

grain weight were also higher under awd compared with cf depending on the growing season awd reduced total water input by 19 in the wet season and by 39 in the dry season resulting in an improvement in total water productivity by 46 in the wet season and by 77 in the dry season relative to cf rice straw application either as soil incorporation or open field burning had no effect on grain yield water saving potential and water productivity of the tested variety regardless of the growing season although its positive role in supplying plant nutrients and maintaining soil fertility rice straw incorporation in the field or burning should be discouraged due to negative environmental impacts awd 15 cm threshold water level below the soil surface for irrigation or with soil water potential of

almost 30 rice production contributes the largest share in the national production where rice is cultivated both in the rainy season may october and to irrigated area in the dry season november april the soils in the central plain are predominantly composed of clay with a high water holding capacity both traditional transplanting and direct seeding methods of rice establishment are commonly practiced in the central plain of thailand the area under direct seeding or broadcasting method was 1 72 million hectares mha in 2016 and 1 62 mha in 2017 whereas the area under transplanting was 0 12 mha in 2016 and 0 06 mha in 2017 office of agricultural economics oae 2018 transplanting is increasingly being replaced by seeding of pre germinated seed to wet soil in irrigated rice production system to reduce production costs like most of the rice producing countries farmers in thailand usually apply more water than required to suppress weed populations causing excessive seepage and percolation losses and a resultant reduction in water productivity wp the area under irrigation and its associated cost energy fuel consumption in pumping has significantly increased in the country in the past several years the sustainability of irrigated rice production system has also been challenged by water scarcity due to climate change and rapid urbanization and industrialization are further depleting water reserves and limiting the availability of irrigation water bouman and tuong 2001 yan et al 2015 these necessitate the adoption of water efficient techniques to reduce water use in agricultural sector while maintaining or increasing yield to support a growing population carrijo et al 2017 rijsberman 2006 cultivation techniques with less water demand higher yield less greenhouse gas ghg emission and more wp are ideally needed for sustainable rice production systems to improve food security in many asian countries the popular continuous flooding cf system provides a favorable water and nutrient supply as well as weed management under anaerobic conditions however rice cultivation under this traditional system demands higher water input than other cereal crops datta et al 2017 nguyen et al 2009 various water efficient techniques have been developed for rice cultivation in the context of decreasing irrigation water availability liu et al 2015 nie et al 2011 alternate wetting and drying awd is among the most widely promoted water saving irrigation technique introduced by the international rice research institute irri to cope with increasing threat of water scarcity in rice cultivation belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2001 datta et al 2017 under this system fields are subjected to intermittent flooding alternate cycles of saturated and unsaturated conditions where water of about 2 5 cm is applied at an interval of 2 7 days depending on the soil type and weather condition followed by disappearance of ponded water from the soil surface and appearance of visible sign of some fine cracks on the soil surface tuong and bouman 2003 awd irrigation is an efficient technique that helps maintain sustainable rice production by saving water and reducing methane emission rate into the atmosphere watanabe et al 2013 liang et al 2016 a reduction of 23 in water input has been reported under awd compared with continuously flooded rice systems bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 reported that awd technique can save water and reduce water use by 15 20 without jeopardizing yield moreover awd irrigation can help reduce annual methane emission by 57 78 from rice fields lahue et al 2016 awd can significantly reduce total water input in thailand ullah et al 2018b thereby reducing input costs and improving farmers livelihoods in thailand the cost of water input for rice production is about us 142 3 ha 1 crop 1 and a slight reduction in irrigation water input could be financially remunerative for the farmers office of agricultural economics oae 2018 apart from reducing water input while maintaining or increasing yields and methane emission some other benefits associated with awd include enhancement in nutrient uptake better root growth more grain filling rate remobilization of carbon reserves from vegetative tissues to grains and reduction of energy fuel consumption where irrigation is supplied by pumping chu et al 2014 liu et al 2013 nalley

proper utilization could help achieve better yield in thailand a total of about 42 mt of rice straw is produced annually and out of which almost 10 mt is generated in the central plain office of agricultural economics oae 2018 about 69 of rice straw produced in the country is burnt open field burning due to limited time availability to prepare the field for the next crop and easiness in field maintenance rice straw is also left scattered in the field after harvest rice straw incorporation has positive relationship to soil fertility and ecological environment wang et al 2015 the burning practice is less laborious than straw incorporation but has environmental consequences in the form of air pollution and emission of ghg wang et al 2015 2016 the inefficient use of freshwater and rice straw is a major concern in rice production systems in thailand grain yield and water use of irrigated lowland rice under different water and rice straw management practices are not well documented we hypothesized that rice straw incorporation along with awd 15 cm threshold water level below the soil surface for irrigation awd15 would be a better approach for maintaining soil moisture status and supplying nutrients thereby reducing water input and increasing yield pathumthani 1 released for lowland rice fields in the central plain is a photoperiod insensitive variety ullah et al 2017 ullah

then irrigation was stopped the plot was irrigated again to a depth of around 5 cm above the soil surface whenever the water level dropped to 15 cm below the soil surface as indicated by perforated field water tube installed in each plot this awd cycle continues throughout the tillering stage until the initial flowering stage as indicated by panicle initiation 60 and 61 dab in the wet and dry seasons respectively followed by continuously maintaining a standing water depth of 5 cm until 2 weeks before harvest the data on irrigation water input and total monthly rainfall during both rice

in the rs b plots 5000 kg rice straw ha 1 was burned under open field burning conditions straws were ignited by a butane fueled lighter and the burning typically lasted for 3 5 min in each plot the rs i and rs b treatments were applied around 2 weeks before broadcasting the rice seeds in both seasons followed by tillage operations with a power tiller the wrs i b plots did not receive any rice straw incorporation and burning all treatments received the same synthetic fertilizer in both growing seasons fertilizer was applied at the rate of 156 kg ha 1 at 21 and 24 dab in the wet and dry seasons respectively in the form of npk 16 20 0 as a basal dose urea 46 0 0 was top dressed at the rate of 94 kg ha 1 at 65 and 69 dab in the wet and dry seasons respectively insect pests diseases and weeds were chemically controlled to avoid yield loss by following the recommended plant protection measures for rice cultivation in ayutthaya province 2 3 data collection the seasonal and long term temperature and rainfall data were collected from the ayutthaya rice research center data on growth parameters such as plant height leaf area index lai shoot and root dry matter were collected at

panicles if any and root samples were oven dried at 75 c until constant weight weighted and shoot and root dry matter measured at maturity grain yield was measured from a 10 m2 harvest area within each plot excluding the plants at the border areas and was adjusted to 14 kg kg 1 moisture content basis data on yield components such as panicle number m 2 spikelet number panicle 1 filled grain and 1000 grain weight were collected from a 1 m2 area in each plot at the same day of harvesting for both seasons data were not collected from the plants at the border areas in each plot to avoid the border effect 2 4 determination of water input and water productivity in both seasons data on total water input m3 ha 1 and total water productivity kg m 3 were also collected total water input

rainfall data were collected from the ayutthaya rice research center total water productivity twp was calculated by dividing the grain yield kg by total water input m3 liang et al 2016 ullah et al 2018b 2 5 statistical analysis a two way anova was performed using the statistical package spss 20 0 to test the significance of treatment combinations and their interactions on the basis of growth grain yield yield components total water input and twp means for significant treatment effects were separated by fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 growth parameters the two way interaction between water and rice straw management was highly significant p 0 01 for plant height at flowering stage whereas the individual effect of water management was highly significant at tillering stage and rice straw management at tillering and maturity stages in the wet season table 2 in the wet season plant height was significantly higher under cf than awd at tillering stage rs i had significantly lower plant height than plant height at rs b and wrs i b at both tillering and maturity stages plant height remained similar at rs b irrespective of water management practice whereas rs i had significantly higher plant height under awd than cf and wrs i b had significantly lower plant height under awd than cf at flowering stage in the wet season plant height was not affected by either water or rice straw management practice in the dry season regardless of growth stage water and rice straw management did not influence lai in the wet season regardless of growth stage and the same was also true for tillering and flowering stages in the dry season table 3 lai was significantly affected p 0 05 by rice straw management at maturity stage in the dry season lai was the highest 4 8 at rs i which was statistically at par with lai at rs b but 17 higher than lai at wrs i b shoot dry matter was highly significantly p 0 01 affected by the two way interaction between water and rice straw management at flowering stage in the wet season and by the individual effect of rice straw management at flowering and maturity stages in the dry season table 4 in the wet season shoot dry matter was significantly higher under awd at rs i which was reduced by 42 at the same rice straw management under cf the two water management practices resulted in similar shoot dry matter at wrs i b whereas rs b under cf had 60 higher shoot dry matter than the same rice straw management under awd in the dry season rs i had significantly lower shoot dry matter than both rs b and wrs i b at flowering and maturity stages root dry matter was not affected by water and rice straw management in the wet season except at flowering stage where the individual effect of water management was highly significant p 0 01 table 5 the two way interaction between water and rice straw management at flowering stage and the individual effect of water management at maturity stage were highly significant p 0 01 for root dry matter in the dry season in the wet season root dry matter under awd was 36 higher than cf at flowering stage in the dry season there was no significant difference in root dry matter between the two water management practices at rs b and wrs i b at flowering stage however root dry mater was reduced by 73 at rs i under cf compared with the same rice straw management practice under awd root dry matter under awd was 42 higher than root dry matter under cf at maturity stage 3 2 yield components and grain yield number of

that of water as well as rice straw management were highly significant p 0 01 in the dry season table 6 awd had 23 and 9 greater number of panicle m 2 than cf in wet and dry seasons respectively among the three rice straw management practices wrs i b had significantly lower number of panicle m 2 than rs i and rs b in the dry season the individual effect of water management was highly significant p 0 01 for spikelet number panicle 1 in the wet season whereas it was highly significantly affected by the two way interaction between water and rice straw management as well as the individual effect of rice straw management in the dry season table 6 awd had 12 higher spikelet number panicle 1 than cf in the wet season in the dry season the two water management practices resulted in similar spikelet number panicle 1 at rs i whereas awd had 12 and 7 higher spikelet number panicle 1 than cf at rs b and wrs i b respectively there was no significant difference in filled grain percentage regardless of water and rice straw management practices in the wet season whereas the two way interaction between water and rice straw management as well as the individual effect of rice straw management were highly significant p 0 01 in the dry season table 6 in the dry season the three rice straw management practices resulted in similar filled grain percentage under awd and the same was also true for rs b under both water management practices at rs i and wrs i b cf had significantly lower filled grain percentage than the corresponding filled grain percentage at the same rice straw management practices under awd filled grain percentage at rs b was 6 and 11 higher than filled grain percentage at rs i and wrs i b under cf the individual effect of water management was highly significant p 0

grain yield in both seasons table 7 overall a higher grain yield was obtained from plants maintained under awd than under cf in both seasons awd had 15 and 7 higher grain yields than cf in the wet and dry seasons respectively the difference in yields among rice straw management practices was not significant in the wet season the highest grain yield 4122 kg ha 1 was obtained at rs b plots whereas it was the lowest 3889 kg ha 1 at rs i in the dry season grain yield was the highest 4096 kg ha 1 at rs b followed by statistically similar grain yield at rs i 4063 kg ha 1 and at wrs i b 3999 kg ha 1 3 3 water use and water productivity total water input and twp were highly significantly p 0 01 affected by the individual effect of water management in both seasons table 7 the plots maintained under cf had the highest total water input in both rice growing seasons awd irrigation reduced total water input by 19 and 39 compared with cf in the wet and dry seasons respectively awd water saving technique reduced total water input in both seasons with a corresponding increase in twp twp was significantly higher under awd than cf in both growing seasons awd resulted in 46 and 77 higher twp than cf in the wet and dry seasons respectively 4 discussion 4 1 water management rice growth and grain yield safe or moderate awd awd15 is a comparatively new and easy to use technique developed for asian farmers to reduce water input while maintaining yield in irrigated rice production system liang et al 2016 some studies have observed similar or even increased grain yield under awd compared with cf yang et al 2007 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 whereas a reduction in yield under awd has also been reported belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2001 the main constraints in wider adoption of this technology include difficulty in handling reliability and effectiveness liang et al 2016 extensive studies under different soil and environmental conditions are therefore needed for a wider acceptability of this technique we observed higher grain yields under awd compared with cf in both growing seasons these higher yields under awd irrigation could be attributed at least in part to greater panicle number m 2 wet and dry seasons spikelet number panicle 1 wet and dry seasons filled grain percentage dry season and 1000 grain weight wet and dry seasons table 6 water stress at critical growth stages affects growth and yield contributing factors of rice liang et al 2016 observed more unfilled grains under severe awd 30 cm threshold water level below the soil surface for irrigation awd30 and claimed the yield reduction under this treatment as a result of reduced grain filling we observed no difference in filled grain percentage between awd15 and cf in both wet and dry seasons overall rice straw management had no significant effect on most of the yield components including filled grain percentage under awd irrigation from these findings it can be concluded that better rice straw management avoiding soil incorporation or burning could help increase filled grain percentage of rice leading towards higher grain yield and awd could be safely recommended without a significant reduction in filled grain percentage application of awd soil drying during grain filling stage of rice enhances root growth for maximum uptake of nutrients which causes soluble carbohydrate accumulation and promotes faster remobilization of these assimilates to the grain li et al 2016 yang and zhang 2006 based on this mechanism yield enhancement could be possible by imposing awd at grain filling stage as it will direct maximum photoassimilate transport from source to inferior spikelet grain filling when supply of nutrient is limited li et al 2016 there is an inconsistency among the published literature regarding the success in maintaining grain yields of rice subjected to awd irrigation technique possibly because of differences in the specification of awd technique and experimental conditions such as climate soil type ground water depth crop management and rice variety carrijo et al 2017 liang et al 2016 ullah et al 2018b the threshold for rewatering in most growth stages of rice under awd irrigation could be based on either field water level or soil water potential bouman et al 2007 mentioned that reflooding of the field when field water level reaches 15 cm below the soil surface as observed in perforated field water tubes installed into the soil would not affect grain yield of rice and is termed as safe awd awd15 the same technique has been applied in the present study and the results are in line with the findings of lampayan et al 2015 who also observed an increased grain yield of rice under awd compared with traditional cf irrigation in a similar study carrijo et al 2017 found comparable grain yield between safe awd and cf with a significant reduction in irrigation water input and ghg emission under awd it can be concluded from the present findings that application of awd could maintain or even increase grain yield of lowland irrigated rice along with a significant reduction in total water input compared with cf therefore this water saving irrigation technique could be a feasible option in reducing total water input and maintaining grain yield for soil and weather conditions comparable to the present study extensive root system is vital for growth and development of aerial plant parts and grain yield ullah et al 2017 ullah and datta 2018 similarly shoot dry matter panicle number and harvest index are closely associated with grain yield of rice fageria 2007 liang et al 2016 optimum panicle density and uniform maturity are also important parameters for higher grain yield li et al 2014 overall there was no difference in shoot and root dry matter between water management practices cf and awd however the two way interaction between water and rice straw management practices significantly affected shoot dry matter in the wet season as well as root dry matter in the dry season at flowering stage with better performance of rs i under awd than cf tables 4 and 5 rs i had the lowest shoot and root dry matter under cf which might be responsible for lower grain yield under this treatment the effect of rice straw management on root dry matter was not clearly visible under awd as the three rice straw management practices had similar results indicating better performance of this irrigation technique in maintaining root growth of rice regardless of rice straw management practice other growth parameters such as plant height table 2 and lai table 3 were also similar for most of the rice straw management practices suggesting no benefit of rice straw management incorporation or burning incorporation of rice straw to the paddy field has become a prevailing agricultural practice as it can supply plant nutrients to the present crop leave substantial residual effect on succeeding crops in the system and also positively influence various soil properties surekha et al 2006 however these benefits could be offset by an enhanced methane emission the analysis of the impacts of rice straw incorporation is critical as it can significantly increase grain yield of rice huang et al 2013 as against the previous findings of zhang et al 2017 who observed a significant increase in rice grain yield with rice straw incorporation we found no significant effect of rice straw incorporation on grain yield compared with no straw incorporation regardless of water management practice rice straw is an important source of plant nutrients and organic carbon resulting in an increase in soil organic matter and an improvement in soil fertility zhang et al 2017 in the present study the poor performance of rice straw under cf could be caused by the accumulation of some toxic materials such as h2s due to fast decomposition of rice straw under anaerobic conditions zhang et al 2017 awio et al 2015 observed no significant effect of rice straw incorporation on grain yield of rice under field conditions but a significant effect was evident under screenhouse conditions in another study supapoj et al 1998 found that types of crop residue e g rice straw rice husk had significant residual effect on crops where more pronounced effects were evident with rice straw than rice husk rice straw incorporation could increase grain yield of rice but its application should be discouraged as straw incorporation creates favorable conditions for methane production in rice paddy fields bhattacharyya et al 2012 wang et al 2016 rice straw burning which is a common practice in the study area had beneficial effects on some of the yield components such as panicle number m 2 and filled grain percentage in the dry season under cf table 6 these could be due to substantial nutrient contribution through the ash of rice straw under flooded conditions as most of the elements will remain in the ash and become water soluble and readily available for plant uptake surekha et al 2006 however these benefits were not translated in the form of grain yield and twp which were significantly lower under cf than awd regardless of rice straw management practice burning of rice straw in the fields should be discouraged as it produces gaseous and non gaseous matter which pollutes the atmosphere surekha et al 2006 based on our results awd irrigation is therefore recommended in lowland rice cultivation without rice straw incorporation or burning 4 2 total water input and water productivity total water input was reduced by 19 in the wet season and by 39 in the dry season under awd compared with cf table 7 studies dealing with water saving potential of awd compared with cf mostly reported varying degrees of irrigation water savings but with a yield penalty carrijo et al 2017 observed an average reduction of 27 5 in irrigation water input under awd compared with cf but with a grain yield reduction of 5 4 the authors suggested that severe awd where soil water potential was allowed to drop below 20 kpa should be avoided because of higher yield loss although the water saving potential was 33 4 in contrast to these findings we observed more water saving potential and an increase in grain yield of rice under awd depending on growing season a significantly higher twp of 46 in the wet season and 77 in the dry season was observed under awd compared with cf carrijo et al 2017 also reported an increased wp of 25 9 under awd compared with cf higher twp observed during the present study was due to reduced total water input and higher grain yield under awd compared with cf moreover reduced rate of seepage and percolation under awd could also be partly responsible for this higher twp carrijo et al 2017 increased wp and better grain yield are critically important for sustainable rice production in the changing climate scenarios and this goal could be achieved with wider adoption of awd ullah et al 2018b however economic analysis of using this technique is also essential as nalley et al 2015 investigated the viability of various awd practices and observed that awd method with the highest wp was economically the most unfeasible 5 conclusion contrasting results regarding the yield performance of rice under awd irrigation and rice straw management exist necessitating the evaluation of these practices in diverse soil and weather conditions we observed a significant reduction in total water input and higher twp under awd compared with cf along with an increase in grain yield rice straw application either soil incorporation or burning had little or no effect on grain yield and its components rice straw incorporation creates favorable conditions for methane production in rice paddy fields and burning pollutes the atmosphere by producing gaseous and non gaseous matter our findings highlight that awd irrigation awd15 could be used as a water saving technique for irrigated lowland rice production system under soil and weather conditions comparable to the present study rice straw application should be discouraged due to its associated environmental concern compared with its role in enhancing grain yield and wp acknowledgments the authors thank the ministry of agriculture and cooperatives thailand and the asian institute of technology thailand for providing financial

11287,rice cultivation techniques with less irrigation water input are crucial for global food security in the context of changing climate scenarios alternate wetting and drying awd is among such water saving techniques which could potentially reduce irrigation water input for rice cultivation through alteration of soil submergence period with period of soil non submergence unsaturated soil conditions during the growing season rice straw is often scattered in the field after harvest or burned in intensive rice cultivation systems response of irrigated lowland rice with respect to grain

and burning wrs i b awd increased grain yield by 15 in the wet season and by 7 in the dry season compared with cf other yield components such as panicle number m 2 spikelet number panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight were also higher under awd compared with cf depending on the growing season awd reduced total water input by 19 in the wet season and by 39 in the dry season resulting in an improvement in total water productivity by 46 in the wet season and by 77 in the dry season relative to cf rice straw application either as soil incorporation or open field burning had no effect on grain yield

almost 30 rice production contributes the largest share in the national production where rice is cultivated both in the rainy season may october and to irrigated area in the dry season november april the soils in the central plain are predominantly composed of clay with a high water holding capacity both traditional transplanting and direct seeding methods of rice establishment are commonly practiced in the central plain of thailand the area under direct seeding or broadcasting method was 1 72 million hectares mha in 2016 and 1 62 mha in 2017 whereas the area under transplanting was 0 12

the past several years the sustainability of irrigated rice production system has also been challenged by water scarcity due to climate change and rapid urbanization and industrialization are further depleting water reserves and limiting the availability of irrigation water bouman and tuong 2001 yan et al 2015 these necessitate the adoption of water efficient techniques to reduce water use in agricultural sector while maintaining or increasing yield to support a growing population carrijo et al 2017 rijsberman 2006 cultivation techniques with less water demand higher yield less greenhouse gas ghg emission and more wp are ideally needed for sustainable rice production systems to improve food security in many asian countries the popular continuous flooding cf system provides a favorable water and nutrient supply as well as weed management under anaerobic conditions however rice cultivation under this traditional system demands higher water input than other cereal crops datta et al 2017 nguyen et al 2009 various water efficient techniques have been developed for rice cultivation in the context of decreasing irrigation water availability liu et al 2015 nie et al 2011 alternate wetting and drying awd is among the most widely promoted water saving irrigation technique introduced by the international rice research institute irri to cope with increasing threat of water scarcity in rice cultivation belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2001 datta et al 2017 under this system fields are subjected to intermittent flooding alternate cycles of saturated and unsaturated conditions where water of about 2 5 cm is applied at an interval of 2 7 days depending on the soil type and weather condition followed by disappearance of ponded water from the soil surface and appearance of visible sign of some fine cracks on the soil surface tuong and bouman 2003 awd irrigation is an efficient technique that helps maintain sustainable rice production by saving water and reducing methane emission rate into the atmosphere watanabe et al 2013 liang et al 2016 a reduction of 23 in water input has been reported under awd compared with continuously flooded rice systems bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 reported that awd technique can save water and reduce water use by 15 20 without jeopardizing yield moreover awd irrigation can help reduce annual methane emission by 57 78 from rice fields lahue et al 2016 awd can significantly reduce total water input in thailand ullah et al 2018b thereby reducing input costs and improving farmers livelihoods in thailand the cost of water input for rice production is about us 142 3 ha 1 crop 1 and a slight reduction in irrigation water input could be financially remunerative for the farmers office of agricultural economics oae 2018 apart from reducing water input while maintaining or increasing yields and methane emission some other benefits associated with awd include enhancement in nutrient uptake better root growth more grain filling rate remobilization of carbon reserves from vegetative tissues to grains and reduction of energy fuel consumption where irrigation is supplied by pumping chu et al 2014 liu et al 2013 nalley et al 2015 tuong et al 2005 ullah and datta 2018 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 2009 2012 poor management of rice straw in intensive rice cultivation systems is an environmental concern and its proper utilization could help achieve better yield in thailand a total of about 42 mt of rice straw is produced annually and out of which almost 10 mt is generated in the central plain office of agricultural economics oae 2018 about 69 of rice straw produced in the country is burnt open field burning due to limited time availability to prepare the field for the next crop and easiness in field maintenance rice straw is also left scattered in the field after harvest rice straw incorporation has positive relationship to soil fertility and ecological environment wang et al 2015 the burning practice is less laborious than straw incorporation but has environmental consequences in the form of air pollution and emission of ghg wang et al 2015 2016 the inefficient use of freshwater and rice straw is a major concern in rice production systems in thailand grain yield and water use of irrigated lowland rice under different water and rice straw management practices are not well documented we hypothesized that rice straw incorporation along with awd 15 cm threshold water level below the soil surface for irrigation awd15 would be a better approach for maintaining soil moisture status and supplying nutrients thereby reducing water input and increasing yield pathumthani 1 released for lowland rice fields in the central plain is a photoperiod insensitive variety ullah et al 2017 ullah

without rice straw incorporation and burning wrs i b the individual plot size was 5 m 7 m and plots were separated by a 1 m wide alley bunds dikes of 30 cm height were constructed along each side of the plot to prevent lateral water movement and were covered with black plastic film inserted to a depth of 30 cm below the soil surface in the wet season seeds of pathumthani 1 rice variety were sown by pre germinated broadcasting method wet direct seeding into the main field on 5 july and harvested on 18 october 2016 the field was left idle for a short fallow period about two weeks after rice harvest in the wet season and the same field was used for rice cultivation in the dry season in the dry season seeds of the same variety were broadcasted on 31 october 2016 and crops were harvested on 26 february 2017 the seed rate was 125 kg ha 1 in both seasons pathumthani 1 is a photoperiod insensitive variety and the maturity period ranges between 106 and 126 days in the wet season the plot

harvest 119 dab for the awd treatment awd15 the plot was flooded with 1 2 cm water from the first day of broadcasting until 25 and 30 dab in the wet and dry seasons seedling stage respectively and then irrigation was stopped the plot was irrigated again to a depth of around 5 cm above the soil surface whenever the water level dropped to 15 cm below the soil surface as indicated by perforated field water tube installed in each plot this awd cycle continues throughout the tillering stage until the initial flowering stage as indicated by panicle initiation 60 and 61 dab in the wet and dry seasons respectively followed by continuously maintaining a standing water depth of 5 cm until 2 weeks before harvest the data on irrigation water input and total monthly rainfall during both rice growing seasons are presented in table 1 in the rs i plots rice straw from the preceding season was soaked in water for 2 days and was manually spread onto the soil surface at the rate of 5000 kg ha 1 in the rs b plots 5000 kg rice straw ha 1 was burned under open field burning conditions straws were ignited by a butane fueled lighter and the burning typically lasted for 3 5 min in each plot the rs i and rs b treatments were applied around 2 weeks before broadcasting the rice seeds in both seasons followed by tillage operations with a power tiller the wrs i b plots did not receive any rice straw incorporation and burning all treatments received the same synthetic fertilizer in both growing seasons fertilizer was applied at the rate of 156 kg ha 1 at 21 and 24 dab in the wet and dry seasons respectively in the form of npk 16 20 0 as a basal dose urea 46 0 0 was top dressed at the rate of 94 kg ha 1 at 65 and 69 dab in the wet and dry seasons respectively insect pests diseases and weeds were chemically controlled to avoid yield loss by following the recommended plant protection measures for rice cultivation in ayutthaya province 2 3 data collection the seasonal and long term temperature and rainfall data were collected from the ayutthaya rice research center data on growth parameters such as plant height leaf area index lai shoot and root dry matter were collected at three growth stages of tillering flowering and maturity in the wet season data on growth parameters were collected at 60 dab corresponding to tillering 26 60 dab at 84 dab corresponding to flowering

from the ground level to the top most tiller panicle and lai was measured nondestructively with the help of an app pocketlai using a smartphone confalonieri et al 2013 fresh shoot leaves stems and panicles if any and root samples were oven dried at 75 c until constant weight weighted and shoot and root dry matter measured at maturity grain yield was measured from a 10 m2 harvest area within each plot excluding the plants at the border areas and was adjusted to 14 kg kg 1 moisture content basis data on yield components such as panicle number m 2 spikelet number panicle 1 filled grain and 1000 grain weight were collected from a 1 m2 area in each plot at the same day of harvesting for both seasons data were not collected from the plants at the border areas in each plot to avoid the border effect 2 4 determination of water input and water productivity in both seasons data on total water input m3 ha 1 and total water productivity kg m 3 were also collected total water input included water input from both irrigation and rainfall in both seasons water volume input from irrigation to each plot was measured using a flow meter installed in the irrigation pipeline whereas rainfall data were collected from the ayutthaya rice research center total water productivity twp was calculated by dividing the grain yield kg by total water input m3 liang et al 2016 ullah et al 2018b 2 5 statistical analysis a two way anova was performed using the statistical package spss 20 0 to test the significance of treatment combinations and their interactions on the basis of growth grain yield yield components total water input and twp means for significant treatment effects were separated by fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 growth parameters the two way interaction between water and rice straw management was highly significant p 0 01 for plant height at flowering stage whereas the individual effect of water management was highly significant at tillering stage and rice straw management at tillering and maturity stages in the wet season table 2 in the wet season plant height was significantly higher under cf than awd at tillering stage rs i had significantly lower plant height than plant height at rs b and wrs i b at both tillering and maturity stages plant height remained similar at rs b irrespective of water management practice whereas rs i had significantly higher plant height under awd than cf and wrs i b had significantly lower plant height under awd than cf at flowering stage in the wet season plant height was not affected by either water or rice straw management practice in the dry season regardless of growth stage water and rice straw management did not influence lai in the wet season regardless of growth stage and the same was also true for tillering and flowering stages in the dry season table 3 lai was significantly affected p 0 05 by rice straw management at maturity stage in the dry season lai was the highest 4 8 at rs i which was statistically at par with lai at rs b but 17 higher than lai at wrs i b shoot dry matter was highly significantly p 0 01 affected by the two way interaction between water and rice straw management at flowering stage in the wet season and by the individual effect of rice straw management at flowering and maturity stages in the dry season table 4 in the wet season shoot dry matter was significantly higher under awd at rs i which was reduced by 42 at the same rice straw management under cf the two water management practices resulted in similar shoot dry matter at wrs i b whereas rs b under cf had 60 higher shoot dry matter than the same rice straw management under awd in the dry season rs i had significantly lower shoot dry matter than both rs b and wrs i b at flowering and maturity stages root dry matter was not affected by water and rice straw management in the wet season except at flowering stage where the individual effect of water management was highly significant p 0 01 table 5 the two way interaction between water and rice straw management at flowering stage and the individual effect of water management at maturity stage were highly significant p 0 01 for root dry matter in the dry season in the wet season root dry matter under awd was 36 higher than cf at flowering stage in the dry season there was no significant difference in root dry matter between the two water management practices at rs b and wrs i b at flowering stage however root dry mater was reduced by 73 at rs i under cf compared with the same rice straw management practice under awd root dry matter under awd was 42 higher than root dry matter under cf at maturity stage 3 2 yield components and grain yield number of panicle m 2 was not affected by the two way interaction between water and rice straw management however the individual effect of water management was highly significant p 0 01 in the wet season and that of water as well as rice straw management were highly significant p 0 01 in the dry season table 6 awd had 23 and 9 greater number of panicle m 2 than cf in wet and dry seasons respectively among the three rice straw management practices wrs i b had significantly lower number of panicle m 2 than rs i and rs b in the dry season the individual effect of water management was highly significant p 0 01 for spikelet number panicle 1 in the wet season whereas it was highly significantly affected by the two way interaction between water and rice straw management as well as the individual effect of rice straw management in the dry season table 6 awd had 12 higher spikelet number panicle 1 than cf in the wet season in the dry season the two water management practices resulted in similar spikelet number panicle 1 at rs i whereas awd had 12 and 7 higher spikelet number panicle 1 than cf at rs b and wrs i b respectively there was no significant difference in filled grain percentage regardless of water and rice straw management practices in the wet season whereas the two way interaction between water and rice straw management as well as the individual effect of rice straw management were highly significant p 0 01 in the dry season table 6 in the dry season the three rice straw management practices resulted in similar filled grain percentage under awd and the same was also true for rs b under both water management practices at rs i and wrs i b cf had significantly lower filled grain percentage than the corresponding filled grain percentage at the same rice straw management practices under awd filled grain percentage at rs b was 6 and 11 higher than filled grain percentage at rs i and wrs i b under cf the individual effect of water management was highly significant p 0 01 for 1000 grain weight in both wet and dry seasons table 6 awd had significantly higher 1000 grain weight than cf irrespective of growing season water management highly significantly p 0 01 affected grain yield in both seasons table 7 overall a higher grain yield was obtained from plants maintained under awd than under cf in both seasons awd had 15 and 7 higher grain yields than cf in the wet and dry seasons respectively the difference in yields among rice straw management practices was not significant in the wet season the highest grain yield 4122 kg ha 1 was obtained at rs b plots whereas it was the lowest 3889 kg ha 1 at rs i in the dry season grain yield was the highest 4096 kg ha 1 at rs b followed by statistically similar grain yield at rs i 4063 kg ha 1 and at wrs i b 3999 kg ha 1 3 3 water use and water productivity total water input and twp were highly significantly p 0 01 affected by the individual effect of water management in both seasons table 7 the plots maintained under cf had the highest total water input in both rice growing seasons awd irrigation reduced total water input by 19 and 39 compared with cf in the wet and dry seasons respectively awd water saving technique reduced total water input in both seasons with a corresponding increase in twp twp was significantly higher under awd than cf in both growing seasons awd resulted in 46 and 77 higher twp than cf in the wet and dry seasons respectively 4 discussion 4 1 water management rice growth and grain yield safe or moderate awd awd15 is a comparatively new and easy to use technique developed for asian farmers to reduce water input while maintaining yield in irrigated rice production system liang et al 2016 some studies have observed similar or even increased grain yield under awd compared with cf yang et al 2007 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 whereas a reduction in yield under awd has also been reported belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2001 the main constraints in wider adoption of this technology include difficulty in handling reliability and effectiveness liang et al 2016 extensive studies under different soil and environmental conditions are therefore needed for a wider acceptability of this technique we observed higher grain yields under awd compared with cf in both growing seasons these higher yields under awd irrigation could be attributed at least in part to greater panicle number m 2 wet and dry seasons spikelet number panicle 1 wet and dry seasons filled grain percentage dry season and 1000 grain weight wet and dry seasons table 6 water stress at critical growth stages affects growth and yield contributing factors of rice liang et al 2016 observed more unfilled grains under severe awd 30 cm threshold water level below the soil surface for irrigation awd30 and claimed the yield reduction under this treatment as a result of reduced grain filling we observed no difference in filled grain percentage between awd15 and cf in both wet and dry seasons overall rice straw management had no significant effect on most of the yield components including filled grain percentage under awd irrigation from these findings it can be concluded that better rice straw management avoiding soil incorporation or burning could help increase filled grain percentage of rice leading towards higher grain yield and awd could be safely recommended without a significant reduction in filled grain percentage application of awd soil drying during grain filling stage of rice enhances root growth for maximum uptake of nutrients which causes soluble carbohydrate accumulation and promotes faster remobilization of these assimilates to the grain li et al 2016 yang and zhang 2006 based on this mechanism yield enhancement could be possible by imposing awd at grain filling stage as it will direct maximum photoassimilate transport from source to inferior spikelet grain filling when supply of nutrient is limited li et al 2016 there is an inconsistency among the published literature regarding the success in maintaining grain yields of rice subjected to awd irrigation technique possibly because of differences in the specification of awd technique and experimental conditions such as climate soil type ground water depth crop management and rice variety carrijo et al 2017 liang et al 2016 ullah et al 2018b the threshold for rewatering in most growth stages of rice under awd irrigation could be based on either field water level or soil water potential bouman et al 2007 mentioned that reflooding of the field when field water level reaches 15 cm below the soil surface as observed in perforated field water tubes installed into the soil would not affect grain yield of rice and is termed as safe awd awd15 the same technique has been applied in the present study and the results are in line with the findings of lampayan et al 2015 who also observed an increased grain yield of rice under awd compared with traditional cf irrigation in a similar study carrijo et al 2017 found comparable grain yield between safe awd and cf with a significant reduction in irrigation water input and ghg emission under awd it can be concluded from the present findings that application of awd could maintain or even increase grain yield of lowland irrigated rice along with a significant reduction in total water input compared with cf therefore this water saving irrigation technique could be a feasible option in reducing total water input and maintaining grain yield for soil and weather conditions comparable to the present study extensive root system is vital for growth and development of aerial plant parts and grain yield ullah et al 2017 ullah and datta 2018 similarly shoot dry matter panicle number and harvest index are closely associated with grain yield of rice fageria 2007 liang et al 2016 optimum panicle density and uniform maturity are also important parameters for higher grain yield li et al 2014 overall there was no difference in shoot and root dry matter between water management practices cf and awd however the two way interaction between water and rice straw management practices significantly affected shoot dry matter in the wet season as well as root dry matter in the dry season at flowering stage with better performance of rs i under awd than cf tables 4 and 5 rs i had the lowest shoot and root dry matter under cf which might be responsible for lower grain yield under this treatment the effect of rice straw management on root dry matter was not clearly visible under awd as the three rice straw management practices had similar results indicating better performance of this irrigation technique in maintaining root growth of rice regardless of rice straw management practice other growth parameters such as plant height table 2 and lai table 3 were also similar for most of the rice straw management practices suggesting no benefit of rice straw management incorporation or burning incorporation of rice straw to the paddy field has become a prevailing agricultural practice as it can supply plant nutrients to the present crop leave substantial residual effect on succeeding crops in the system and also positively influence various soil properties surekha et al 2006 however these benefits could be offset by an enhanced methane emission the analysis of the impacts of rice straw incorporation is critical as it can significantly increase grain yield of rice huang et al 2013 as against the previous findings of zhang et al 2017 who observed a significant increase in rice grain yield with rice straw incorporation we found no significant effect of rice straw incorporation on grain yield compared with no straw incorporation regardless of water management practice rice straw is an important source of plant nutrients and organic carbon resulting in an increase in soil organic matter and an improvement in soil fertility zhang et al 2017 in the present study the poor performance of rice straw under cf could be caused by the accumulation of some toxic materials such as h2s due to fast decomposition of rice straw under anaerobic conditions zhang et al 2017 awio et al 2015 observed no significant effect of rice straw incorporation on grain yield of rice under field conditions but a significant effect was evident under screenhouse conditions in another study supapoj et al 1998 found that types of crop residue e g rice straw rice husk had significant residual effect on crops where more pronounced effects were evident with rice straw than rice husk rice straw incorporation could increase grain yield of rice but its application should be discouraged as straw incorporation creates favorable conditions for methane production in rice paddy fields bhattacharyya et al 2012 wang et al 2016 rice straw burning which is a common practice in the study area had beneficial effects on some of the yield components such as panicle number m 2 and filled grain percentage in the dry season under cf table 6 these could be due to substantial nutrient contribution through the ash of rice straw under flooded conditions as most of the elements will remain in the ash and become water soluble and readily available for plant uptake surekha et al 2006 however these benefits were not translated in the form of grain yield and twp which were significantly lower under cf than awd regardless of rice straw management practice burning of rice straw in the fields should be discouraged as it produces gaseous and non gaseous matter which pollutes the atmosphere surekha et al 2006 based on our results awd irrigation is therefore recommended in lowland rice cultivation without rice straw incorporation or burning 4 2 total water input and water productivity total water input was reduced by 19 in the wet season and by 39 in the dry season under awd compared with cf table 7 studies dealing with water saving potential of awd compared with cf mostly reported varying degrees of irrigation water savings but with a yield penalty carrijo et al 2017 observed an average reduction of 27 5 in irrigation water input under awd compared with cf but with a grain yield reduction of 5 4 the authors suggested that severe awd where soil water potential was allowed to drop below 20 kpa should be avoided because of higher yield loss although the water saving potential was 33 4 in contrast to these findings we observed more water saving potential and an increase in grain yield of rice under awd depending on growing season a significantly higher twp of 46 in the wet season and 77 in the dry season was observed under awd compared with cf carrijo et al 2017 also reported an increased wp of 25 9 under awd compared with cf higher twp observed during the present study was due to reduced total water input and higher grain yield under awd compared with cf moreover reduced rate of seepage and percolation under awd could also be partly responsible for this higher twp carrijo et al 2017 increased wp and better grain yield are critically important for sustainable rice production in the changing climate scenarios and this goal could be achieved with wider adoption of awd ullah et al 2018b however economic analysis of using this technique is also essential as nalley et al 2015 investigated the viability of various awd practices and observed that awd method with the highest wp was economically the most unfeasible 5 conclusion contrasting results regarding the yield performance of rice under awd irrigation and rice straw management exist necessitating the evaluation of these practices in diverse soil and weather conditions we observed a significant reduction in total water input and higher twp under awd compared with cf along with an increase in grain yield rice straw application either soil incorporation or burning had little or no effect on grain yield and its components rice straw incorporation creates favorable conditions for methane production in rice paddy fields and burning pollutes the atmosphere by producing gaseous and non gaseous matter our findings highlight that awd irrigation awd15 could be used as a water saving technique for irrigated lowland rice production system under soil and weather conditions comparable to the present study rice straw application should be discouraged due to its associated environmental concern compared with its role in enhancing grain yield and wp acknowledgments the authors thank the ministry of agriculture and cooperatives thailand and the asian institute of technology thailand for providing financial

11288,in the north china plain ncp increased water shortages and food yield increase present serious threats to the sustainability of cultivated lands irrigation by brackish or saline water is a possible solution to alleviate freshwater shortages it is critical to understand the soil salt variations and the characteristics of salt accumulation and leaching under long term brackish water irrigation in cultivated croplands in this study the hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated and then applied to evaluate that how 20 years of irrigating with brackish water affects soil salinity and soil salt transport in wheat maize cultivated lands with different texture layers in the lowland of ncp the results showed that the simulations of soil matric potential and soil salt concentrations fitted well with the measured values soil salt dynamics were dominated by seasonal precipitation and hydrological years seasonal rainfall distribution determined seasonal characteristics of salt changes in shallow layers 0 100 cm soil salt accumulated during the growth period of winter wheat corresponding to the dry season and was greatest at the harvest soil salt leached down to deeper soil layers under abundant rainfall during growth period of maize the annual soil salt in 300 cm profiles were driven by hydrological years and soil salt could be accumulated in dry and normal years and leached in wet years especially in the extremely wet year soil salt accumulation was higher under two brackish water irrigations compared to one irrigation for winter wheat and soil salinity in homogeneous soils was less than in the heterogeneous soil with clay loam interlining the results showed the effect of irrigation times of brackish water was greater than that of soil texture on soil salt accumulation our results demonstrated that wheat and maize could be grown well under one irrigation with brackish water a year salt accumulation increased with the number of irrigation events that used brackish water for winter wheat the brackish water irrigation was evaluated and the results demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water by brackish water for irrigation is feasible in the lowland area of the ncp it is more suitable for long term brackish water irrigation in relatively homogeneous soil than in heterogeneous soil these simulated results are helpful to provide appropriate management measures for long term brackish water irrigation and fresh water saving and provide a basis for assessing the environmental effect under long term brackish water irrigation keywords brackish water irrigation cultivated lowland soil salt accumulation and leaching vertical homogeneous and heterogeneous soil hydrus 1d model north china plain 1 introduction the lowland area of the north china plain ncp is an important grain cotton and fruit production region of china zhou et al 2012 in the region the winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l cultivated in sequence within one year is the dominant double cropping system the system requires significantly more water than is available from natural precipitation wheat is especially at risk of water deficiency because it grows in the winter and spring with little rainfall sun et al 2010 crops in the region are largely irrigated but irrigation over uses deep groundwater resulting groundwater decline and a pervasive water scarcity in the ncp to restrict the exploitation of freshwater resources the chinese government implemented a limited pumping program in 2014 in hebei plain however there are extensive brackish water resources which account for 36 of the total amount of groundwater resources in the coastal plains of north china qian et al 2014 zhang 2009 there is 32 billion m3 a of exploitable saline and brackish water in hebei province and 28 billion m3 a of brackish water 1 3 g l is available in the coastal plain qian et al 2014 the combination of adequate shallow brackish groundwater and limited fresh water supply necessitate the development of a proper irrigation mode the utilization of saline and brackish water resources for crop irrigation not only offers potential to alleviate the water scarcity in the region chauhan et al 2008 ma et al 2008 pang et al 2010 but also may help renew groundwater resources increase freshwater stores and protect ecological environment irrigation using saline groundwater for several years may have negative effects including lower crop production and accumulation of soil salts which may damage the balance between local soil water and salt and gradually cause soil salinization and groundwater quality deterioration huang et al 2011a verma et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in a multi year field experiment on brackish water irrigation of a winter wheat summer maize cultivation system ma et al 2010 showed that soil salinity in the 0 100 cm soil layer was up to 133 higher than the initial conditions in dry years selim et al 2012 observed that salinity in the surface soil layer increased with the increase in salt concentration of irrigation water experiments following six years of saline water irrigation on to fruit trees showed that compared with fresh water irrigation soil salt content increased significantly under saline water irrigation after the third year nicolás et al 2016 soil salt accumulation and leaching are highly affected by the hydrological conditions such as hydrological years and precipitation distribution soil texture as well as frequency of salt water irrigation and crop patterns it is recommended that medium or long term saline water irrigation schemes should consider variations in hydrological conditions climate conditions and soil features to assure the soil salt is within the range for normal crop growth therefore it is important to study the effects of long term use of brackish water for irrigation on soil salinity in the ncp several researchers have indicated that brackish or saline water can be used for irrigated crops jiang et al 2012 kiani and mirlatifi 2012 malash et al 2012 singh and panda 2012 sharma et al 2013 xue and ren 2017 studied soil salinity in the root zone did not increase with saline irrigation over time and they demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water with shallow saline groundwater for irrigation is feasible in the hetao irrigation district rasouli et al 2013 studied the maximum salinity of the irrigation water supply that can be safely used in the long term 33 years without impairing wheat production they determined the maximum safe salinity level to be 6 ds m in southwest iran saline water irrigation has been widely reported for different crops in the ncp during field experiments over several years pang et al 2010 sun et al 2012 wan et al 2010 based on experimental results saline water irrigation 5 g l at the jointing stage of winter wheat provided clear benefits to wheat yields compared to no irrigation as well as insignificant yield losses compared to fresh water irrigation in lowland areas of the ncp chen et al 2016 liu et al 2016 traditional field based experiments require considerable time expense and labor and long term trends in the spatial and temporal patterns of variability at the field scale cannot be established mathematical models have the advantage of evaluating long term consequences of saline water irrigation by considering spatial variability in time series weather crops and soil factors ramos et al 2011 2012 rasouli et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 a variety of simulation models have been developed to describe the aquifer soil vegetation atmosphere system including hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 swap kroes et al 2008 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012 using hydrus 1d to analyze the effects of saline irrigation on soil salt accumulation and grain yield in the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the low plain of ncp liu et al 2016 concluded that the risk of long term accumulation of salts as a result of saline irrigation during the peak of dry season is considered low wang et al 2017 found that winter wheat yield decreased by 10 and soil salinity increased above the initial value as the result of brackish water irrigation using hydrus id coupled with a crop growth model under brackish water irrigation kanzari et al 2012 modelled salt balance across a 4 m depth and showed high salt accumulation and salinity at a clay silt interface considering the importance of using numerical models for a better understanding of salinity processes and for evaluating various irrigation management options a widely verified and used model hydrus 1d was adopted in our study to simulate soil water flow and solute transport processes in irrigated croplands min et al 2015 ren et al 2016 shang et al 2016 however few studies have modelled soil salt migration processes considering different soil textures and brackish water irrigation scenarios under long term period in this study the hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated against experimental data whereby brackish water has been used for irrigation further simulations were carried out using the model to obtain a better understanding how 20 years of irrigating with brackish water affects soil profile salinity and soil salt transport in wheat maize cultivated lands our objectives were i to test the feasibility of the hydrus 1d model in simulating water flow and solute transport through calibrating and validating the model with observed data ii to investigate the characteristics of soil salt accumulation and leaching and long term trends of soil salinity under different irrigation scenarios and soil texture conditions and iii to assess whether it is feasible to irrigate using brackish water for 20 years in wheat maize croplands under vertical homogeneous and heterogeneous soil profile 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in nanpi county hebei province china which is located in the hebei lowland area around the bohai sea in the ncp fig 1 the climate is semi arid monsoon with hot humid summer and a rainy season from july to september during the period of 1990 to 2016 the average annual precipitation is 562 mm and about 80 concentrates on the four months jun sep with the other months of a year experiencing rather arid conditions the mean annual temperature is 13 2 c the annual evaporation in the region is 1900 2200 mm the extensive brackish water resources in nanpi county in the upper aquifer shallow groundwater are stored about at a depth of 10 60 m and have total dissolved solids tds ranging from 2 g l to 5 g l electrical conductivity ec of 2 8 8 2 ds m mwr 1998 historically saline alkaline soils account for 0 39 million ha 11 6 of arable land from the 1960s to 1980s in this study area the soils are characterized by excessive sodium chloride nacl and sodium sulfate na2so4 yang et al 2016 the traditional agricultural system of the area is dominated by a winter wheat summer maize double cropping agro system sequence within one year winter wheat is usually grown from early october to june of the following year followed by summer maize from the middle june to the end of september 2 2 measurements the filed experiments were conducted in two irrigated croplands which cultivated with winter wheat summer maize soil profiles in the two experimental sites were different in soil texture the soil with clay loam 30 170 cm and sandy loam 0 30 cm and 170 300 cm are distributed in an interlayered way at site 1 indicative of the heterogeneous soil structure while the soil profile is almost consisted with silt loam 30 150 and 170 300 cm at site 2 and with clay loam only in 0 30 cm and 150 170 cm depth showing a relatively homogeneous structure soil matric potential data were obtained by tensionmeters and recorded automatically every hour at depths of 10 20 30 50 70 100 150 200 250 and 300 cm in two croplands from 14 july to 30 september of 2015 and from 1 april to 30 september of 2016 soil pore water samples were collected by a vacuum extraction system to obtain the soil solute at the same periods and depths as tensionmeter observations the sampling frequency of soil pore water was every day after irrigation and large precipitation for 7 days and every seven days at other times water samples were stored in polyethylene bottles two bottles of each sample were collected if possible and immediately transported to the laboratory and analyzed within one week all samples were sealed with adhesive tape to reduce evaporation the water samples were passed through 0 45 μm filters before analysis samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity ec ds m with an ec analyser horiba es 71 precipitation and other meteorological parameters of nanpi county including solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperature were downloaded from national meteorological data network of china http data cma cn site index html with the daily meteorological data the potential evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 the daily precipitation and et0 are shown in fig 2 2 3 modelling methods the hydrus 1d model is a one dimensional physically based model that can be used to simulate soil water flow and solute transport šimůnek et al 2013 parameterized was based on the experimental site s soil physical properties and weather conditions the simulated soil profile depth was 300 cm and the water table was always below 300 cm according to our monitoring data from the study area for water flow the bottom boundary condition was considered free drainage the upper boundary condition was set as the atmospheric condition which was defined by evapotranspiration irrigation and precipitation for solute transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined by a concentration flux and zero concentration gradient respectively the crop potential evapotranspiration etp was calculated by multiplying et0 with a crop coefficient then potential evaporation ep and crop potential transpiration tp were separated by beer s law and the leaf area index šimůnek et al 2013 and then required as inputs for atmospheric boundary parameters in hydus 1d the leaf area index was collected by previous studies zhang et al 2002 wu and wang 2010 the growth of the roots was adopted from liu and wang 1999 and zhang et al 2004 root water uptake parameters were set using the default values in hydrus 1d the initial soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from percentages of sand silt and clay values using the rosetta pedotransfer functions šimůnek et al 2013 the van genuchten parametric functions were used to calculate the hydraulic properties of the soil profile the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters dispersivity length in the model were calibrated by the dataset from july to september 2015 and validated by the dataset from april to may 2016 the soil texture and the optimized parameters of each layer at the two experimental sites are presented in table 1 to assess the performance of the model several goodness of fit indicators have been used as in former studies xu et al 2013 the coefficient of determination r2 the mean relative error mre and the root mean square error rmse were computed as indicators to evaluate the model performance these indicators were defined as follows 1 mre 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i x 100 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where n is the total number of observations pi and oi are respectively the ith model predicted and observed values i 1 2 n and p and o are the mean model predictions and observations the r2 values close to 1 0 indicate that the variation of the observed values are well captured by the model mre and rmse values close to zero indicate good model performance 2 4 long term irrigation scheme design regarding the timing of the use of brackish irrigation water it is important to consider the crops susceptibility to salt stress during different growth stages the salt tolerant threshold of winter wheat is higher than that of summer maize and the stages of recovery in spring and jointing of winter wheat are the stages that tolerance to salt adaptation occurs after periods of brackish water irrigation guo et al 1992 a study has shown that wheat yields were not significantly affected by using saline water 2 5 g l 1 for irrigation at jointing stage and flowering filling stage compared to fresh water irrigation chen et al 2016 therefore it is viable to using brackish water to irrigate winter wheat at the jointing stage and the flowering filling stage long term irrigation scheduling tends to be generalized by local farmers experience and the previous research results li et al 2005 jiao 2015 generally winter wheat requires three irrigation applications of 60 80 mm each which always irrigated at the growing jointing and flowering filling stages of winter wheat respectively and summer maize always need growing irrigation with about 70 mm sun et al 2010 when soil is moist before growing winter wheat there is no water irrigation and one brackish water irrigation increased in dry years for maize in this study two irrigation scenarios were tested scenario 1 one brackish water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat scenario 2 two brackish water irrigations with one at the jointing stage and another at the flowering filling stage of winter wheat there were two soil textural profiles in this study and both irrigation scenarios were analyzed in each site for a total of four treatments the details of the irrigation schemes for 20 years are listed in table 2 t1 one brackish water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat in site 1 t2 two brackish water irrigations with one at the jointing stage and another at the flowering filling stage of winter wheat in site 1 t3 one brackish water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat in site 2 t4 two brackish water irrigations with one at the jointing stage and another at the flowering filling stage of winter wheat in site 2 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated based on the soil matric potential and ec values which were measured from the soil profiles from july to september 2015 and validated by the dataset from april to may 2016 the mre rmse and r2 between observed and simulated results were used to compare the modeling performances during the calibration period fig 3 for site 1 and site 2 the rmse for the soil matric potentials were 0 04 cm and 0 017 cm mre were 0 028 cm and 0 011 cm and the r2 were 0 885 and 0 920 respectively the rmse of ec was 0 069 ds m for site 1 and 0 059 ds m for site 2 and mre were 0 053 and 0 043 ds m and the r2 were 0 896 and 0 818 for sites 1 and 2 respectively the results indicated that the simulated soil matric potential and ec values were well matched with the measured values at the two experimental sites during the calibration period the model performance during the validation period was evaluated by a linear regression between the simulated soil matric potential and ec values and the corresponding observed values at each plot fig 4 the r2 between simulated and measured matric potential were 0 780 for site 1 and 0 791 for site 2 for ec validation r2 between simulated and measured values were 0 713 and 0 675 for site 1 and 2 respectively the values of r2 were much higher than the r2 crit 95 of 0 3 indicating that the measured and simulated values were significantly correlated both for matric potential and ec during the validation period the above indicators were close to those reported by liu et al 2016 in similar study regions and climate conditions these results demonstrated that the hydrus model performance was generally good for both calibration and validation periods and the model was a suitable and effective model for evaluating water and soil solute transport ramos et al 2012 ren et al 2016 thus the calibrated hydrus could be considered to accurately predict the daily dynamics of soil water and salt movement in the two sites 3 2 soil water flux dynamics of the water flux deficit or recharge in the soil profiles were primarily attributable to natural precipitation evapotranspiration and irrigation during the wheat growth stages the evapotranspiration et was larger at site 1 than that at site 2 for 20 years with et values ranging from 344 3 mm to 421 8 mm and 320 4 mm to 390 5 mm at site 1 and 2 respectively table 3 there were water deficits at the two sites as the differences between precipitation and et were 85 9 to 326 7 mm and 62 3 to 289 3 mm at site 1 and 2 respectively these results inferred that there was more soil water consumption in site 1 due to more water stored in the deep clay loam soil layer during the maize growth stages the soil water was generally consumed in dry years and recharged in normal and wet years and when the annual precipitation was larger the recharge was greater table 3 fig 5 shows the cumulative bottom water flux at 300 cm depth for 20 years there was water leakage occurring when the cumulative bottom water flux was less than zero water leakage occurred for 20 years to a certain extent and the annual precipitation and irrigation directly affected annual cumulative bottom water flux in the years with abundant precipitation the water leakage was high and it was small in the dry years the water leakage was larger in wet years of 1th 95 10 96 10 3th 97 10 98 10 14th 08 10 09 10 17th 11 10 12 10 and 18th 12 10 13 10 and the normal year of 9th 03 10 04 10 this was because there were four rainstorms during rainy season in the 1th year one extraordinary rainstorm 288 1 mm in the 3th year one heavy rainstorm 153 8 mm before wheat was grown in the 9th year three heavy rainstorms in the 14th year and two rainstorms in 17th and 18th years thus these years were the critical years for deep water leakage and soil salt leaching especially in the 1th and 14th years which were wet years with more than three rainstorms 3 3 soil salt accumulation and leaching characteristics the calibrated model was used to simulate the salt dynamics in 300 cm profiles with 20 year 1995 2015 brackish water irrigation the initial soil matric potential and salt concentrations were not known thus the model was run with 5 year meteorological data of 1990 1995 to get the initial values the effect of brackish water irrigation and soil texture on soil salt accumulation was apparent in fig 6 within 20 years in the two sites the dynamics of soil salt accumulation and leaching affected by precipitation and irrigation were similar for both irrigation scenarios soil salt in 300 cm profiles were rapidly and constantly accumulated within five years for all treatments after then the salt concentrations presented slow increase trends and dynamic changed in the 300 cm soil profiles 5th 9th years with rainfall and irrigation soil salt concentrations significantly increase during three relatively dry years 10th 12th year in the 14th year salt amount quickly decreased being influenced by large precipitation before the next dry year 19th year the salt accumulation reached a relative stabilization stage and after then soil salt significantly accumulated again the results showed that soil salt could significantly accumulate during dry years when annual precipitation was less than 350 mm and could be leached in extreme wet years the soil salt leaching characteristics within 20 years are shown in fig 7 in the growth period of winter wheat soil salt was mainly accumulated except three years the salt accumulation ranges from 1 85 to 26 34 mg cm2 for t1 6 08 to 39 76 mg cm2 for t2 0 38 to 26 10 mg cm2 for t3 2 35 to 39 30 mg cm2 for t4 obviously soil salinity accumulation was higher under two saline irrigations scenario 2 compared to one saline irrigation scenario 1 for winter wheat during the growth period of summer maize soil salt was mainly leached in wet and some normal years while soil salt was accumulated in other years especially dry years the salt leaching ranged from 4 42 to 73 49 mg cm2 for t1 5 49 to 103 73 mg cm2 for t2 6 42 to 67 47 mg cm2 for t3 0 92 to 94 56 mg cm2 for t4 the results inferred that the salt accumulation increased with the numbers of irrigation event using brackish water soil salt in the 300 cm profile mainly accumulated during the growth period of winter wheat which corresponded to the dry season and leaching occurred during the growth period of summer maize which corresponded to the rainy season according to these results annual changes in salt fluxes in the 0 300 cm soil profile were driven by salt accumulation during the growth period of winter wheat in dry years and salt leaching during the growth period of summer maize in wet years 3 4 effects of brackish water irrigation on soil salinity development in this study the modified model simulated the spatiotemporal distribution of ec under 20 year continuous brackish water irrigation with meteorological data from 1995 to 2015 figs 8 and 9 for all the treatments the spatiotemporal variation of ec were similar it showed that ec values varied dramatically with time in the 0 50 and 50 100 cm soil layers while there was relatively little changed in the 100 200 and 200 300 cm soil layers under all the treatments salt concentration in the upper soil layers decreased sharply with irrigation or precipitation and then gradually increased till the next irrigation or precipitation figs 8 and 9 this was due to the soil solution being diluted and salts being leached to deeper layers the changes of the ec values showed decrease and hysteresis with depth the annual soil salt concentrations increased from sowing winter wheat to harvest and increased to its greatest after wheat harvest then soil salt concentrations decreased after sowing summer maize because of fresh water leaching and relatively abundant rainfall during the growth period of maize in deep soil layers 100 200 and 200 300 cm ec values varied in different years soil salt concentrations increased gradually in deep soil before 5 years then it remained stable from 6 to 13 years and significantly decreased in the 14th year when annual precipitation was 966 9 mm after that the salt concentrations gradually increased again the results showed that the varitions of ec values were influenced by hydrological year and soil salt could be accumulated in dry and normal years and leached in wet years especially in the extremely wet year 14th year the distribution of soil salt varied between the two simulation scenarios in the two sites under one brackish water irrigation there was no significant salt accumulation in shallow layers fig 9 the ec values in shallow layers at two sites were always lower than the salt tolerant threshold for winter wheat 6 0 ds m during the wheat growth period and almost less than 1 7 ds m during the growth period of maize throughout the 20 years rhoades et al 1992 he et al 2017 these suggested no significant salt damage to wheat and maize under the scenario of one brackish water irrigation while under the scenario of two brackish water irrigation the ec values in shallow layers were lower than 6 0 ds m before the 5rd year during the wheat growth period and after that the ec values were larger than 6 0 ds m at the harvest stage of wheat especially in the 0 50 cm layers at the two sites fig 9 before 5rd year the ec values were also always larger than 1 7 ds m at two sites during the growth period of maize the growth of wheat and maize were both influenced by salt damage after 5 years of successive two irrigation events a year using brackish water in deep soil layer 100 300 cm soil salt concentration under two brackish water irrigation was always larger than under one brackish water irrigation figs 8 and 9 the distribution of soil salt varied between the four treatments with ec ranging from 0 78 to 2 48 ds m for t1 1 07 3 53 ds m for t2 0 64 2 34 ds m for t3 and 0 90 3 32 ds m for t4 in 200 300 cm soil layers during the 20 year brackish water irrigation at site 1 the soil profile contains a clay loam layer 30 170 cm while the soil profile at site 2 was relatively homogenous in the relatively homogeneous soil site 2 the salt concentrations were smaller than in the heterogeneous soil that contained clay loam and the salt leaching effect was greater under wet years the results infer that the degree of soil salinity is affected by irrigation numbers with brackish water and soil textural profile for the four treatments the soil salt concentrations in 300 cm profiles were presented t2 t4 t1 t3 it is concluded that the effect of numbers of irrigated with brackish was greater than that of soil texture on soil salt accumulation 4 discussion 4 1 favorable conditions for salt leaching to relieve the pressure on water resources during the dry season in ncp the successful usage saline or brackish water for crop irrigation offers great potential however the key to using saline water irrigation properly is keeping soil salinity stable through leaching especially in root zone corwin et al 2007 in general soil water and salt fluctuation in the short term were affected by irrigation and rainfall and long term fluctuations occurred with seasonal and annual changes the salts were accumulated during dry periods and leached when water inputs irrigation or precipitation occurred there were significant seasonal characteristics of salt accumulation and leaching in shallow layers 0 50 and 50 100 cm which were accumulated during growth period of wheat and leached during growth period of maize these results occurred because the average water deficit during growth period of wheat was 254 4 mm at site 1 and 231 3 mm at site 2 for 20 years and the irrigation amount was no more than 180 mm resulting soil water deficit and salt accumulation while water recharged during the growth period of maize by average of 97 6 mm at site 1 and 94 7 mm at site 2 and there was fresh water irrigation before growing maize which resulted in soil water replenishment and salt leaching the result was consistent with the results reported by jiao 2015 which concluded soil salt accumulated during the spring leached in summer and autumn and was stable throughout the winter soil salinity in the root zone was easily reversed by factors such as seasonal rainfall and climate variability rameshwaran et al 2016 the accumulation of salts during the growth period of winter wheat was primarily caused by high evapotranspiration demands and little precipitation that resulted in water movement towards the soil surface soil salts are transported with soil water and accumulated after water lost especially in the root zone before sowing summer maize freshwater irrigation of 60 90 mm could ensure suitable soil conditions in the top soil for maize growing liu et al 2016 the increasing intensity and frequency of rainfalls during the subsequent rainy season generally provided a positive climatic water balance and washed salinity below the main rooting zone pang et al 2010 the study showed that soil salt accumulation or leaching dominated by different hydrological years including the accumulated or leaching depth and the amounts under brackish water irrigation soil salt could accumulate in dry years and most normal years in wet years there was no obvious risk of salt accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil layer and salt leached significantly in the whole 300 cm profile in the extremely wet year 14th year in the 14th year the water leakage was significantly greater than in other years these wet years were the critical years for deep water leakage and soil salt leaching especially the 14th years which experienced three heavy rainstorms in dry years and most normal years soil salt accumulation was reversible in the 0 100 cm layer and also in deep layers 100 200 and 200 300 cm our results were consistent with the reports of ma et al 2008 and liu et al 2016 who also reported the salinity leaching effect resulting from abundant rainfall was obvious in the top 100 cm soil layer and salinity was mainly leached down to a depth of 150 cm during the rainy season in years with abundant rainfall in addition with appropriate leaching and drainage systems brackish water can be used to irrigate with little or no soil damage or even minimal reduction in crop yield kiremit and arslan 2016 in the relatively homogeneous soil site 2 soil salinity was less than in the heterogeneous soil with clay loam interlining site 1 and the salt leaching effect was greater in wet years this was because the deep layer of clay loam had some obstacles to soil water movement and salt migration chen et al 2012 while there was appropriate leaching and drainage systems in the relatively homogeneous soil mostly with sandy loam thus the relatively homogeneous soil structure was more suitable for long term irrigation with brackish water than in the heterogeneous soil in this study 4 2 implication of long term brackish water irrigation long term usage of saline water for irrigation still raises concerns about soil salt accumulation liu et al 2016 xue and ren 2017 although many studies have reported positive effects of saline water irrigation on wheat yields chauhan et al 2008 jiang et al 2012 kiani and mirlatifi 2012 wang et al 2015 other studies conducted in north china showed that summer maize suffers from aftereffects of saline water irrigation onto winter wheat ma et al 2008 pang et al 2010 liu et al 2016 furthermore liu et al 2016 reported annual aggregated grain production from wheat and maize was enhanced with additional saline water irrigation compared to no additional irrigation during the peak of the spring dry season it is critical to control soil salt concentrations to prevent salt damage to wheat and maize in the root zone especially for wheat by evaluating the effects of brackish water irrigation rhoades et al 1992 reported that the salt tolerant threshold values beyond which yield reduction occurs for wheat and maize are 6 0 and 1 7 ds m respectively in this study there was no significant salt accumulation in shallow layers and no significant salt damage to wheat and maize for both sites under one brackish water irrigation the growth of wheat and maize were both influenced by salt damage after 5 year under two brackish water irrigation at both sites these results suggested that there was no significant salts accumulation as a result of one brackish water irrigation in a year for 20 years at the jointing stage of winter wheat due to deep leaching of salts during regularly occurring wet years especially in the extremely wet year this was in accordance with the reports in the similar study areas of liu et al 2016 who concluded that the risk of long term accumulation of salts from saline irrigation during the peak of dry season is low because most the root zone salts are leaching by precipitation and fresh water irrigation in the ncp thus applying saline water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat is the most promising to realize high yield and fresh water saving when freshwater in short supply it is possible to irrigate with brackish water twice during the growth period for wheat but not regularly every year therefore the one and two brackish water irrigation event schemes could be used together such as irrigated brackish water for wheat twice in wet year and once in dry and normal years to reduce salt damage in the root zone and reduce deep salt accumulation our results demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water by brackish or saline water for irrigation is feasible in the ncp 4 3 water consumption and water saving potential of brackish water irrigation during the 20 years the average et values for wheat were 383 mm and 360 mm for sites 1 and 2 respectively and were 330 mm and 332 mm for maize for sites 1 and 2 respectively table 3 the water requirement amount was about 360 381 mm during the whole period of winter wheat in ncp jiao 2015 and the average et was simulated as 328 mm during years of 2001 2015 in the lowland area in ncp he et al 2017 these values were consistent with the et values in this modeling study the average et value for wheat for site 1 was larger than for site 2 which was due to soil profiles with vertical heterogeneity in soil texture could hinder vertical water movement reduce percolation and store more water than homogeneous soils zornberg et al 2010 huang et al 2011b however it is rainy season during maize growth period and the precipitation is always enough for maize growth thus the average et values for sites 1 and 2 were similar the brackish water was mainly used for irrigating wheat and the annual brackish water consumption was 60 mm and 120 mm for the two irrigation scenarios respectively the fresh water was mainly irrigated before sowing winter wheat and summer maize and the irrigation amounts of annual fresh water was 190 mm and 130 mm for the two irrigation scenarios respectively therefore the annual water consumption for irrigation was 220 mm the average water deficit was about 136 156 mm and the difference between the annual irrigation and annual water deficit was about 60 80 mm which was mainly due to the irrigation for soil salt leaching in root zone before sowing maize the agricultural irrigation area was about 5 85 105 ha in 2010 in cangzhou city wang 2013 thus the fresh water for irrigation that could be saved ranges from 3 5 to 7 0 108 m3 a considering concurrent use of one and two brackish water irrigation events a year the brackish water use can effectively control the gradual expansion of groundwater fillers by reducing the exploitation of deep groundwater 5 conclusion the study investigated the effect of long term brackish water irrigation and soil texture on soil salt variations and migrated characteristics within 300 cm soil profiles the hydrus 1d model were first calibrated and validated for simulating soil matric potential and soil salt concentration with the observation data from 2015 and 2016 the model generally performed well which indicated that it could be used to evaluate salt migration in the study areas the model was then used to estimate soil salt concentration under 20 years of irrigation with brackish water in soils growing winter wheat and summer maize rotations from 1995 to 2015 the results showed that the characteristics of soil salt accumulation and leaching presented significantly seasonal variations in the shallow layers which accumulated and reached maximum concentrations during the growth period for wheat and leached during the growth period of maize rainfall distribution played a major role in determining seasonal soil salinity in the root zone and summer concentrated rainfall was effective for leaching salt the annual variation of soil salt was basically in dynamic equilibrium in shallow layers soil salt accumulation or leaching was most dominated by different hydrological years including both accumulated or leaching depth and amount under brackish water irrigation annual fluctuations in salt content in the 0 100 cm soil layer were driven by salt accumulation in dry years and salt leaching in wet years the salt content in the 100 200 cm soil layer gradually increased in most years except during the rainy season in wet years where ec values decreased but they gradually increased in the 200 300 cm soil layer the soil salt concentrations increased with an increase in the number of brackish water irrigation events it could realize long term safe and sustainable utilization safe utilization of brackish water at jointing stage of winter wheat with low risk of salt accumulation of salt in the shallow layers because deep leaching of salts occurring regularly during wet years especially in the extremely wet years in the ncp however under two brackish water irrigation events a year fresh water irrigation should be increased especially in dry years to reduce the salt accumulation and enhance salt leaching thus the one and two brackish water irrigation event schemes could be used together such as irrigated brackish water for wheat twice in wet year and once in dry and normal years in the relatively homogeneous soil profile soil salinity was less than in the heterogeneous soil profile and the salt leaching effect was greater in wet years it is appropriate for salt leaching in the relatively homogeneous soil mostly with sandy loam the results demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water by brackish water for irrigation is feasible in the lowland area of the ncp and a relatively homogeneous profile structure was more suitable for long term irrigation with brackish water than in the heterogeneous profile acknowledgements this research is supported by science and technology service network sts program of chinese academy of sciences kfj sts zdtp 001 10

11288,in the north china plain ncp increased water shortages and food yield increase present serious threats to the sustainability of cultivated lands irrigation by brackish or saline water is a possible solution to alleviate freshwater shortages it is critical to understand the soil salt variations and the characteristics of salt accumulation and leaching under long term brackish water irrigation in cultivated croplands in this study the hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated and then applied to evaluate that how 20 years of irrigating with brackish water affects soil salinity and soil salt transport in wheat maize cultivated lands with different texture layers in the lowland of ncp the results showed that the simulations of soil matric potential and soil salt concentrations fitted well with the measured values soil salt dynamics were dominated by seasonal precipitation and hydrological years seasonal rainfall distribution determined seasonal characteristics of salt changes in shallow layers 0 100 cm soil salt accumulated during the growth period of winter wheat corresponding to the dry season and was greatest at the harvest soil salt leached down to deeper soil layers under abundant rainfall during growth period of maize the annual soil salt in 300 cm profiles were driven by hydrological years and soil salt could be accumulated in dry and normal years and leached in wet years especially in the extremely wet year soil salt accumulation was higher under two brackish water irrigations compared to one irrigation for winter wheat and soil salinity in homogeneous soils was less than in the heterogeneous soil with clay loam interlining the results showed the effect of irrigation times of brackish water was greater than that of soil texture on soil salt accumulation our results demonstrated that wheat and maize could be grown well under one irrigation with brackish water a year salt accumulation increased with the number of irrigation events that used brackish water for winter wheat the brackish water irrigation was evaluated and the results demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water by brackish water for irrigation is feasible in the lowland area of the ncp it is more suitable for long term brackish water irrigation in relatively homogeneous soil than in heterogeneous soil these simulated results are helpful to provide appropriate management measures for long term brackish water irrigation and fresh water saving and provide a basis for assessing the environmental effect under long term brackish water irrigation keywords brackish water irrigation cultivated lowland soil salt accumulation and leaching vertical homogeneous and heterogeneous soil hydrus 1d model north china plain 1 introduction the lowland area of the north china plain ncp is an important grain cotton and fruit production region of china zhou et al 2012 in the region the winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l cultivated in sequence within one year is the dominant double cropping system the system requires significantly more water than is available from natural precipitation wheat is especially at risk of water deficiency because it grows in the winter and spring with little rainfall sun et al 2010 crops in the region are largely irrigated but irrigation over uses deep groundwater resulting groundwater decline and a pervasive water scarcity in the ncp to restrict the exploitation of freshwater resources the chinese government implemented a limited pumping program in 2014 in hebei plain however there are extensive brackish water resources which account for 36 of the total amount of groundwater resources in the coastal plains of north china qian et al 2014 zhang 2009 there is 32 billion m3 a of exploitable saline and brackish water in hebei province and 28 billion m3 a of brackish water 1 3 g l is available in the coastal plain qian et al 2014 the combination of adequate shallow brackish groundwater and limited fresh water supply necessitate the development of a proper irrigation mode the utilization of saline and brackish water resources for crop irrigation not only offers potential to alleviate the water scarcity in the region chauhan et al 2008 ma et al 2008 pang et al 2010 but also may help renew groundwater resources increase freshwater stores and protect ecological environment irrigation using saline groundwater for several years may have negative effects including lower crop production and accumulation of soil salts which may damage the balance between local soil water and salt and gradually cause soil salinization and groundwater quality deterioration huang et al 2011a verma et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in a multi year field experiment on brackish water irrigation of a winter wheat summer maize cultivation system ma et al 2010 showed that soil salinity in the 0 100 cm soil layer was up to 133 higher than the initial conditions in dry years selim et al 2012 observed that salinity in the surface soil layer increased with the increase in salt concentration of irrigation water experiments following six years of saline water irrigation on to fruit trees showed that compared with fresh water irrigation soil salt content increased significantly under saline water irrigation after the third year nicolás et al 2016 soil salt accumulation and leaching are highly affected by the hydrological conditions such as hydrological years and precipitation distribution soil texture as well as frequency of salt water irrigation and crop patterns it is recommended that medium or long term saline water irrigation schemes should consider variations in hydrological conditions climate conditions and soil features to assure the soil salt is within the range for normal crop growth therefore it is important to study the effects of long term use of brackish water for irrigation on soil salinity in the ncp several researchers have indicated that brackish or saline water can be used for irrigated crops jiang et al 2012 kiani and mirlatifi 2012 malash et al 2012 singh and panda 2012 sharma et al 2013 xue and ren 2017 studied soil salinity in the root zone did not increase with saline irrigation over time and they demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water with shallow saline groundwater for irrigation is feasible in the hetao irrigation district rasouli et al 2013 studied the maximum salinity of the irrigation water supply that can be safely used in the long term 33 years without impairing wheat production they determined the maximum safe salinity level to be 6 ds m in southwest iran saline water irrigation has been widely reported for different crops in the ncp during field experiments over several years pang et al 2010 sun et al 2012 wan et al 2010 based on experimental results saline water irrigation 5 g l at the jointing stage of winter wheat provided clear benefits to wheat yields compared to no irrigation as well as insignificant yield losses compared to fresh water irrigation in lowland areas of the ncp chen et al 2016 liu et al 2016 traditional field based experiments require considerable time expense and labor and long term trends in the spatial and temporal patterns of variability at the field scale cannot be established mathematical models have the advantage of evaluating long term consequences of saline water irrigation by considering spatial variability in time series weather crops and soil factors ramos et al 2011 2012 rasouli et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 a variety of simulation models have been developed to describe the aquifer soil vegetation atmosphere system including hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 swap kroes et al 2008 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012 using hydrus 1d to analyze the effects of saline irrigation on soil salt accumulation and grain yield in the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the low plain of ncp liu et al 2016 concluded that the risk of long term accumulation of salts as a result of saline irrigation during the peak of dry season is considered low wang et al 2017 found that winter wheat yield decreased by 10 and soil salinity increased above the initial value as the result of brackish water irrigation using hydrus id coupled with a crop growth model under brackish water irrigation kanzari et al 2012 modelled salt balance across a 4 m depth and showed high salt accumulation and salinity at a clay silt interface considering the importance of using numerical models for a better understanding of salinity processes and for evaluating various irrigation management options a widely verified and used model hydrus 1d was adopted in our study to simulate soil water flow and solute transport processes in irrigated croplands min et al 2015 ren et al 2016 shang et al 2016 however few studies have modelled soil salt migration processes considering different soil textures and brackish water irrigation scenarios under long term period in this study the hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated against experimental data whereby brackish water has been used for irrigation further simulations were carried out using the model to obtain a better understanding how 20 years of irrigating with brackish water affects soil profile salinity and soil salt transport in wheat maize cultivated lands our objectives were i to test the feasibility of the hydrus 1d model in simulating water flow and solute transport through calibrating and validating the model with observed data ii to investigate the characteristics of soil salt accumulation and leaching and long term trends of soil salinity under different irrigation scenarios and soil texture conditions and iii to assess whether it is feasible to irrigate using brackish water for 20 years in wheat maize croplands under vertical homogeneous and heterogeneous soil profile 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in nanpi county hebei province china which is located in the hebei lowland area around the bohai sea in the ncp fig 1 the climate is semi arid monsoon with hot humid summer and a rainy season from july to september during the period of 1990 to 2016 the average annual precipitation is 562 mm and about 80 concentrates on the four months jun sep with the other months of a year experiencing rather arid conditions the mean annual temperature is 13 2 c the annual evaporation in the region is 1900 2200 mm the extensive brackish water resources in nanpi county in the upper aquifer shallow groundwater are stored about at a depth of 10 60 m and have total dissolved solids tds ranging from 2 g l to 5 g l electrical conductivity ec of 2 8 8 2 ds m mwr 1998 historically saline alkaline soils account for 0 39 million ha 11 6 of arable land from the 1960s to 1980s in this study area the soils are characterized by excessive sodium chloride nacl and sodium sulfate na2so4 yang et al 2016 the traditional agricultural system of the area is dominated by a winter wheat summer maize double cropping agro system sequence within one year winter wheat is usually grown from early october to june of the following year followed by summer maize from the middle june to the end of september 2 2 measurements the filed experiments were conducted in two irrigated croplands which cultivated with winter wheat summer maize soil profiles in the two experimental sites were different in soil texture the soil with clay loam 30 170 cm and sandy loam 0 30 cm and 170 300 cm are distributed in an interlayered way at site 1 indicative of the heterogeneous soil structure while the soil profile is almost consisted with silt loam 30 150 and 170 300 cm at site 2 and with clay loam only in 0 30 cm and 150 170 cm depth showing a relatively homogeneous structure soil matric potential data were obtained by tensionmeters and recorded automatically every hour at depths of 10 20 30 50 70 100 150 200 250 and 300 cm in two croplands from 14 july to 30 september of 2015 and from 1 april to 30 september of 2016 soil pore water samples were collected by a vacuum extraction system to obtain the soil solute at the same periods and depths as tensionmeter observations the sampling frequency of soil pore water was every day after irrigation and large precipitation for 7 days and every seven days at other times water samples were stored in polyethylene bottles two bottles of each sample were collected if possible and immediately transported to the laboratory and analyzed within one week all samples were sealed with adhesive tape to reduce evaporation the water samples were passed through 0 45 μm filters before analysis samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity ec ds m with an ec analyser horiba es 71 precipitation and other meteorological parameters of nanpi county including solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperature were downloaded from national meteorological data network of china http data cma cn site index html with the daily meteorological data the potential evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 the daily precipitation and et0 are shown in fig 2 2 3 modelling methods the hydrus 1d model is a one dimensional physically based model that can be used to simulate soil water flow and solute transport šimůnek et al 2013 parameterized was based on the experimental site s soil physical properties and weather conditions the simulated soil profile depth was 300 cm and the water table was always below 300 cm according to our monitoring data from the study area for water flow the bottom boundary condition was considered free drainage the upper boundary condition was set as the atmospheric condition which was defined by evapotranspiration irrigation and precipitation for solute transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined by a concentration flux and zero concentration gradient respectively the crop potential evapotranspiration etp was calculated by multiplying et0 with a crop coefficient then potential evaporation ep and crop potential transpiration tp were separated by beer s law and the leaf area index šimůnek et al 2013 and then required as inputs for atmospheric boundary parameters in hydus 1d the leaf area index was collected by previous studies zhang et al 2002 wu and wang 2010 the growth of the roots was adopted from liu and wang 1999 and zhang et al 2004 root water uptake parameters were set using the default values in hydrus 1d the initial soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from percentages of sand silt and clay values using the rosetta pedotransfer functions šimůnek et al 2013 the van genuchten parametric functions were used to calculate the hydraulic properties of the soil profile the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters dispersivity length in the model were calibrated by the dataset from july to september 2015 and validated by the dataset from april to may 2016 the soil texture and the optimized parameters of each layer at the two experimental sites are presented in table 1 to assess the performance of the model several goodness of fit indicators have been used as in former studies xu et al 2013 the coefficient of determination r2 the mean relative error mre and the root mean square error rmse were computed as indicators to evaluate the model performance these indicators were defined as follows 1 mre 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i x 100 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where n is the total number of observations pi and oi are respectively the ith model predicted and observed values i 1 2 n and p and o are the mean model predictions and observations the r2 values close to 1 0 indicate that the variation of the observed values are well captured by the model mre and rmse values close to zero indicate good model performance 2 4 long term irrigation scheme design regarding the timing of the use of brackish irrigation water it is important to consider the crops susceptibility to salt stress during different growth stages the salt tolerant threshold of winter wheat is higher than that of summer maize and the stages of recovery in spring and jointing of winter wheat are the stages that tolerance to salt adaptation occurs after periods of brackish water irrigation guo et al 1992 a study has shown that wheat yields were not significantly affected by using saline water 2 5 g l 1 for irrigation at jointing stage and flowering filling stage compared to fresh water irrigation chen et al 2016 therefore it is viable to using brackish water to irrigate winter wheat at the jointing stage and the flowering filling stage long term irrigation scheduling tends to be generalized by local farmers experience and the previous research results li et al 2005 jiao 2015 generally winter wheat requires three irrigation applications of 60 80 mm each which always irrigated at the growing jointing and flowering filling stages of winter wheat respectively and summer maize always need growing irrigation with about 70 mm sun et al 2010 when soil is moist before growing winter wheat there is no water irrigation and one brackish water irrigation increased in dry years for maize in this study two irrigation scenarios were tested scenario 1 one brackish water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat scenario 2 two brackish water irrigations with one at the jointing stage and another at the flowering filling stage of winter wheat there were two soil textural profiles in this study and both irrigation scenarios were analyzed in each site for a total of four treatments the details of the irrigation schemes for 20 years are listed in table 2 t1 one brackish water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat in site 1 t2 two brackish water irrigations with one at the jointing stage and another at the flowering filling stage of winter wheat in site 1 t3 one brackish water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat in site 2 t4 two brackish water irrigations with one at the jointing stage and another at the flowering filling stage of winter wheat in site 2 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated based on the soil matric potential and ec values which were measured from the soil profiles from july to september 2015 and validated by the dataset from april to may 2016 the mre rmse and r2 between observed and simulated results were used to compare the modeling performances during the calibration period fig 3 for site 1 and site 2 the rmse for the soil matric potentials were 0 04 cm and 0 017 cm mre were 0 028 cm and 0 011 cm and the r2 were 0 885 and 0 920 respectively the rmse of ec was 0 069 ds m for site 1 and 0 059 ds m for site 2 and mre were 0 053 and 0 043 ds m and the r2 were 0 896 and 0 818 for sites 1 and 2 respectively the results indicated that the simulated soil matric potential and ec values were well matched with the measured values at the two experimental sites during the calibration period the model performance during the validation period was evaluated by a linear regression between the simulated soil matric potential and ec values and the corresponding observed values at each plot fig 4 the r2 between simulated and measured matric potential were 0 780 for site 1 and 0 791 for site 2 for ec validation r2 between simulated and measured values were 0 713 and 0 675 for site 1 and 2 respectively the values of r2 were much higher than the r2 crit 95 of 0 3 indicating that the measured and simulated values were significantly correlated both for matric potential and ec during the validation period the above indicators were close to those reported by liu et al 2016 in similar study regions and climate conditions these results demonstrated that the hydrus model performance was generally good for both calibration and validation periods and the model was a suitable and effective model for evaluating water and soil solute transport ramos et al 2012 ren et al 2016 thus the calibrated hydrus could be considered to accurately predict the daily dynamics of soil water and salt movement in the two sites 3 2 soil water flux dynamics of the water flux deficit or recharge in the soil profiles were primarily attributable to natural precipitation evapotranspiration and irrigation during the wheat growth stages the evapotranspiration et was larger at site 1 than that at site 2 for 20 years with et values ranging from 344 3 mm to 421 8 mm and 320 4 mm to 390 5 mm at site 1 and 2 respectively table 3 there were water deficits at the two sites as the differences between precipitation and et were 85 9 to 326 7 mm and 62 3 to 289 3 mm at site 1 and 2 respectively these results inferred that there was more soil water consumption in site 1 due to more water stored in the deep clay loam soil layer during the maize growth stages the soil water was generally consumed in dry years and recharged in normal and wet years and when the annual precipitation was larger the recharge was greater table 3 fig 5 shows the cumulative bottom water flux at 300 cm depth for 20 years there was water leakage occurring when the cumulative bottom water flux was less than zero water leakage occurred for 20 years to a certain extent and the annual precipitation and irrigation directly affected annual cumulative bottom water flux in the years with abundant precipitation the water leakage was high and it was small in the dry years the water leakage was larger in wet years of 1th 95 10 96 10 3th 97 10 98 10 14th 08 10 09 10 17th 11 10 12 10 and 18th 12 10 13 10 and the normal year of 9th 03 10 04 10 this was because there were four rainstorms during rainy season in the 1th year one extraordinary rainstorm 288 1 mm in the 3th year one heavy rainstorm 153 8 mm before wheat was grown in the 9th year three heavy rainstorms in the 14th year and two rainstorms in 17th and 18th years thus these years were the critical years for deep water leakage and soil salt leaching especially in the 1th and 14th years which were wet years with more than three rainstorms 3 3 soil salt accumulation and leaching characteristics the calibrated model was used to simulate the salt dynamics in 300 cm profiles with 20 year 1995 2015 brackish water irrigation the initial soil matric potential and salt concentrations were not known thus the model was run with 5 year meteorological data of 1990 1995 to get the initial values the effect of brackish water irrigation and soil texture on soil salt accumulation was apparent in fig 6 within 20 years in the two sites the dynamics of soil salt accumulation and leaching affected by precipitation and irrigation were similar for both irrigation scenarios soil salt in 300 cm profiles were rapidly and constantly accumulated within five years for all treatments after then the salt concentrations presented slow increase trends and dynamic changed in the 300 cm soil profiles 5th 9th years with rainfall and irrigation soil salt concentrations significantly increase during three relatively dry years 10th 12th year in the 14th year salt amount quickly decreased being influenced by large precipitation before the next dry year 19th year the salt accumulation reached a relative stabilization stage and after then soil salt significantly accumulated again the results showed that soil salt could significantly accumulate during dry years when annual precipitation was less than 350 mm and could be leached in extreme wet years the soil salt leaching characteristics within 20 years are shown in fig 7 in the growth period of winter wheat soil salt was mainly accumulated except three years the salt accumulation ranges from 1 85 to 26 34 mg cm2 for t1 6 08 to 39 76 mg cm2 for t2 0 38 to 26 10 mg cm2 for t3 2 35 to 39 30 mg cm2 for t4 obviously soil salinity accumulation was higher under two saline irrigations scenario 2 compared to one saline irrigation scenario 1 for winter wheat during the growth period of summer maize soil salt was mainly leached in wet and some normal years while soil salt was accumulated in other years especially dry years the salt leaching ranged from 4 42 to 73 49 mg cm2 for t1 5 49 to 103 73 mg cm2 for t2 6 42 to 67 47 mg cm2 for t3 0 92 to 94 56 mg cm2 for t4 the results inferred that the salt accumulation increased with the numbers of irrigation event using brackish water soil salt in the 300 cm profile mainly accumulated during the growth period of winter wheat which corresponded to the dry season and leaching occurred during the growth period of summer maize which corresponded to the rainy season according to these results annual changes in salt fluxes in the 0 300 cm soil profile were driven by salt accumulation during the growth period of winter wheat in dry years and salt leaching during the growth period of summer maize in wet years 3 4 effects of brackish water irrigation on soil salinity development in this study the modified model simulated the spatiotemporal distribution of ec under 20 year continuous brackish water irrigation with meteorological data from 1995 to 2015 figs 8 and 9 for all the treatments the spatiotemporal variation of ec were similar it showed that ec values varied dramatically with time in the 0 50 and 50 100 cm soil layers while there was relatively little changed in the 100 200 and 200 300 cm soil layers under all the treatments salt concentration in the upper soil layers decreased sharply with irrigation or precipitation and then gradually increased till the next irrigation or precipitation figs 8 and 9 this was due to the soil solution being diluted and salts being leached to deeper layers the changes of the ec values showed decrease and hysteresis with depth the annual soil salt concentrations increased from sowing winter wheat to harvest and increased to its greatest after wheat harvest then soil salt concentrations decreased after sowing summer maize because of fresh water leaching and relatively abundant rainfall during the growth period of maize in deep soil layers 100 200 and 200 300 cm ec values varied in different years soil salt concentrations increased gradually in deep soil before 5 years then it remained stable from 6 to 13 years and significantly decreased in the 14th year when annual precipitation was 966 9 mm after that the salt concentrations gradually increased again the results showed that the varitions of ec values were influenced by hydrological year and soil salt could be accumulated in dry and normal years and leached in wet years especially in the extremely wet year 14th year the distribution of soil salt varied between the two simulation scenarios in the two sites under one brackish water irrigation there was no significant salt accumulation in shallow layers fig 9 the ec values in shallow layers at two sites were always lower than the salt tolerant threshold for winter wheat 6 0 ds m during the wheat growth period and almost less than 1 7 ds m during the growth period of maize throughout the 20 years rhoades et al 1992 he et al 2017 these suggested no significant salt damage to wheat and maize under the scenario of one brackish water irrigation while under the scenario of two brackish water irrigation the ec values in shallow layers were lower than 6 0 ds m before the 5rd year during the wheat growth period and after that the ec values were larger than 6 0 ds m at the harvest stage of wheat especially in the 0 50 cm layers at the two sites fig 9 before 5rd year the ec values were also always larger than 1 7 ds m at two sites during the growth period of maize the growth of wheat and maize were both influenced by salt damage after 5 years of successive two irrigation events a year using brackish water in deep soil layer 100 300 cm soil salt concentration under two brackish water irrigation was always larger than under one brackish water irrigation figs 8 and 9 the distribution of soil salt varied between the four treatments with ec ranging from 0 78 to 2 48 ds m for t1 1 07 3 53 ds m for t2 0 64 2 34 ds m for t3 and 0 90 3 32 ds m for t4 in 200 300 cm soil layers during the 20 year brackish water irrigation at site 1 the soil profile contains a clay loam layer 30 170 cm while the soil profile at site 2 was relatively homogenous in the relatively homogeneous soil site 2 the salt concentrations were smaller than in the heterogeneous soil that contained clay loam and the salt leaching effect was greater under wet years the results infer that the degree of soil salinity is affected by irrigation numbers with brackish water and soil textural profile for the four treatments the soil salt concentrations in 300 cm profiles were presented t2 t4 t1 t3 it is concluded that the effect of numbers of irrigated with brackish was greater than that of soil texture on soil salt accumulation 4 discussion 4 1 favorable conditions for salt leaching to relieve the pressure on water resources during the dry season in ncp the successful usage saline or brackish water for crop irrigation offers great potential however the key to using saline water irrigation properly is keeping soil salinity stable through leaching especially in root zone corwin et al 2007 in general soil water and salt fluctuation in the short term were affected by irrigation and rainfall and long term fluctuations occurred with seasonal and annual changes the salts were accumulated during dry periods and leached when water inputs irrigation or precipitation occurred there were significant seasonal characteristics of salt accumulation and leaching in shallow layers 0 50 and 50 100 cm which were accumulated during growth period of wheat and leached during growth period of maize these results occurred because the average water deficit during growth period of wheat was 254 4 mm at site 1 and 231 3 mm at site 2 for 20 years and the irrigation amount was no more than 180 mm resulting soil water deficit and salt accumulation while water recharged during the growth period of maize by average of 97 6 mm at site 1 and 94 7 mm at site 2 and there was fresh water irrigation before growing maize which resulted in soil water replenishment and salt leaching the result was consistent with the results reported by jiao 2015 which concluded soil salt accumulated during the spring leached in summer and autumn and was stable throughout the winter soil salinity in the root zone was easily reversed by factors such as seasonal rainfall and climate variability rameshwaran et al 2016 the accumulation of salts during the growth period of winter wheat was primarily caused by high evapotranspiration demands and little precipitation that resulted in water movement towards the soil surface soil salts are transported with soil water and accumulated after water lost especially in the root zone before sowing summer maize freshwater irrigation of 60 90 mm could ensure suitable soil conditions in the top soil for maize growing liu et al 2016 the increasing intensity and frequency of rainfalls during the subsequent rainy season generally provided a positive climatic water balance and washed salinity below the main rooting zone pang et al 2010 the study showed that soil salt accumulation or leaching dominated by different hydrological years including the accumulated or leaching depth and the amounts under brackish water irrigation soil salt could accumulate in dry years and most normal years in wet years there was no obvious risk of salt accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil layer and salt leached significantly in the whole 300 cm profile in the extremely wet year 14th year in the 14th year the water leakage was significantly greater than in other years these wet years were the critical years for deep water leakage and soil salt leaching especially the 14th years which experienced three heavy rainstorms in dry years and most normal years soil salt accumulation was reversible in the 0 100 cm layer and also in deep layers 100 200 and 200 300 cm our results were consistent with the reports of ma et al 2008 and liu et al 2016 who also reported the salinity leaching effect resulting from abundant rainfall was obvious in the top 100 cm soil layer and salinity was mainly leached down to a depth of 150 cm during the rainy season in years with abundant rainfall in addition with appropriate leaching and drainage systems brackish water can be used to irrigate with little or no soil damage or even minimal reduction in crop yield kiremit and arslan 2016 in the relatively homogeneous soil site 2 soil salinity was less than in the heterogeneous soil with clay loam interlining site 1 and the salt leaching effect was greater in wet years this was because the deep layer of clay loam had some obstacles to soil water movement and salt migration chen et al 2012 while there was appropriate leaching and drainage systems in the relatively homogeneous soil mostly with sandy loam thus the relatively homogeneous soil structure was more suitable for long term irrigation with brackish water than in the heterogeneous soil in this study 4 2 implication of long term brackish water irrigation long term usage of saline water for irrigation still raises concerns about soil salt accumulation liu et al 2016 xue and ren 2017 although many studies have reported positive effects of saline water irrigation on wheat yields chauhan et al 2008 jiang et al 2012 kiani and mirlatifi 2012 wang et al 2015 other studies conducted in north china showed that summer maize suffers from aftereffects of saline water irrigation onto winter wheat ma et al 2008 pang et al 2010 liu et al 2016 furthermore liu et al 2016 reported annual aggregated grain production from wheat and maize was enhanced with additional saline water irrigation compared to no additional irrigation during the peak of the spring dry season it is critical to control soil salt concentrations to prevent salt damage to wheat and maize in the root zone especially for wheat by evaluating the effects of brackish water irrigation rhoades et al 1992 reported that the salt tolerant threshold values beyond which yield reduction occurs for wheat and maize are 6 0 and 1 7 ds m respectively in this study there was no significant salt accumulation in shallow layers and no significant salt damage to wheat and maize for both sites under one brackish water irrigation the growth of wheat and maize were both influenced by salt damage after 5 year under two brackish water irrigation at both sites these results suggested that there was no significant salts accumulation as a result of one brackish water irrigation in a year for 20 years at the jointing stage of winter wheat due to deep leaching of salts during regularly occurring wet years especially in the extremely wet year this was in accordance with the reports in the similar study areas of liu et al 2016 who concluded that the risk of long term accumulation of salts from saline irrigation during the peak of dry season is low because most the root zone salts are leaching by precipitation and fresh water irrigation in the ncp thus applying saline water irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat is the most promising to realize high yield and fresh water saving when freshwater in short supply it is possible to irrigate with brackish water twice during the growth period for wheat but not regularly every year therefore the one and two brackish water irrigation event schemes could be used together such as irrigated brackish water for wheat twice in wet year and once in dry and normal years to reduce salt damage in the root zone and reduce deep salt accumulation our results demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water by brackish or saline water for irrigation is feasible in the ncp 4 3 water consumption and water saving potential of brackish water irrigation during the 20 years the average et values for wheat were 383 mm and 360 mm for sites 1 and 2 respectively and were 330 mm and 332 mm for maize for sites 1 and 2 respectively table 3 the water requirement amount was about 360 381 mm during the whole period of winter wheat in ncp jiao 2015 and the average et was simulated as 328 mm during years of 2001 2015 in the lowland area in ncp he et al 2017 these values were consistent with the et values in this modeling study the average et value for wheat for site 1 was larger than for site 2 which was due to soil profiles with vertical heterogeneity in soil texture could hinder vertical water movement reduce percolation and store more water than homogeneous soils zornberg et al 2010 huang et al 2011b however it is rainy season during maize growth period and the precipitation is always enough for maize growth thus the average et values for sites 1 and 2 were similar the brackish water was mainly used for irrigating wheat and the annual brackish water consumption was 60 mm and 120 mm for the two irrigation scenarios respectively the fresh water was mainly irrigated before sowing winter wheat and summer maize and the irrigation amounts of annual fresh water was 190 mm and 130 mm for the two irrigation scenarios respectively therefore the annual water consumption for irrigation was 220 mm the average water deficit was about 136 156 mm and the difference between the annual irrigation and annual water deficit was about 60 80 mm which was mainly due to the irrigation for soil salt leaching in root zone before sowing maize the agricultural irrigation area was about 5 85 105 ha in 2010 in cangzhou city wang 2013 thus the fresh water for irrigation that could be saved ranges from 3 5 to 7 0 108 m3 a considering concurrent use of one and two brackish water irrigation events a year the brackish water use can effectively control the gradual expansion of groundwater fillers by reducing the exploitation of deep groundwater 5 conclusion the study investigated the effect of long term brackish water irrigation and soil texture on soil salt variations and migrated characteristics within 300 cm soil profiles the hydrus 1d model were first calibrated and validated for simulating soil matric potential and soil salt concentration with the observation data from 2015 and 2016 the model generally performed well which indicated that it could be used to evaluate salt migration in the study areas the model was then used to estimate soil salt concentration under 20 years of irrigation with brackish water in soils growing winter wheat and summer maize rotations from 1995 to 2015 the results showed that the characteristics of soil salt accumulation and leaching presented significantly seasonal variations in the shallow layers which accumulated and reached maximum concentrations during the growth period for wheat and leached during the growth period of maize rainfall distribution played a major role in determining seasonal soil salinity in the root zone and summer concentrated rainfall was effective for leaching salt the annual variation of soil salt was basically in dynamic equilibrium in shallow layers soil salt accumulation or leaching was most dominated by different hydrological years including both accumulated or leaching depth and amount under brackish water irrigation annual fluctuations in salt content in the 0 100 cm soil layer were driven by salt accumulation in dry years and salt leaching in wet years the salt content in the 100 200 cm soil layer gradually increased in most years except during the rainy season in wet years where ec values decreased but they gradually increased in the 200 300 cm soil layer the soil salt concentrations increased with an increase in the number of brackish water irrigation events it could realize long term safe and sustainable utilization safe utilization of brackish water at jointing stage of winter wheat with low risk of salt accumulation of salt in the shallow layers because deep leaching of salts occurring regularly during wet years especially in the extremely wet years in the ncp however under two brackish water irrigation events a year fresh water irrigation should be increased especially in dry years to reduce the salt accumulation and enhance salt leaching thus the one and two brackish water irrigation event schemes could be used together such as irrigated brackish water for wheat twice in wet year and once in dry and normal years in the relatively homogeneous soil profile soil salinity was less than in the heterogeneous soil profile and the salt leaching effect was greater in wet years it is appropriate for salt leaching in the relatively homogeneous soil mostly with sandy loam the results demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water by brackish water for irrigation is feasible in the lowland area of the ncp and a relatively homogeneous profile structure was more suitable for long term irrigation with brackish water than in the heterogeneous profile acknowledgements this research is supported by science and technology service network sts program of chinese academy of sciences kfj sts zdtp 001 10

11289,a low cost subsurface irrigation system can generate benefits for small scale farmers who have scarce water resources a ring shaped emitter made from a standard rubber hose has been developed and introduced for subsurface irrigation in indonesia it is a low cost irrigation technology based on indigenous materials and skills to build a ring shaped emitter of the original design a rubber hose is bent into a ring shape with a diameter of about 20 cm and then five 5 mm holes are drilled into it at even intervals next the entire ring shaped hose is covered with a permeable textile so that water can infiltrate in all directions around the buried emitter water is applied from a water tank connected to the emitter by adjusting the pressure head imposed at the inlet of the emitter although it has been successfully used in practice the performance of the ring shaped emitter has not been evaluated in detail additionally because the ring shaped hose is fully covered with the textile it may be difficult to detect any malfunctions or repair it to promote the ring shaped emitter for subsurface irrigation among small scale farmers in arid or semi arid regions it is important to design an emitter that is easy to maintain this study proposes a reduction in the number of holes and a change of covering method because the number of experiments that can be carried out to evaluate the performance of alternative ring shaped emitters is usually limited numerical simulations can be performed in addition to experiments the main objectives of this study thus were 1 to experimentally investigate the water movement around a buried ring shaped emitter and 2 to numerically evaluate the effect of modifying the design of the ring shaped emitter on soil water dynamics around the emitter numerical simulations were carried out using hydrus one of the most complete packages for simulating variably saturated water flow in two or three dimensional domains hydrus simulations in a fully three dimensional domain were performed using the soil hydraulic parameters that were optimized against experimental data collected during experiments with the original ring shaped emitter simulation results confirmed that reducing the number of holes does not significantly affect the water availability in silt for model plants such as tomato and strawberry and that covering the entire emitter is not necessary partially covering the emitter allows one to maintain the emitter much more easily compared to the original fully covered emitter keywords subsurface irrigation ring shaped emitter macroscopic capillary length water use efficiency wue numerical simulation 1 introduction some of the modern irrigation technologies designed for large scale farming with complex and expensive devices tend to fail when introduced in rural areas of developing countries where farming is generally practiced on a much smaller scale in these areas maintaining complex irrigation systems can become a roadblock to promoting modern technologies because there may not be enough well trained engineers and it may be difficult to find parts to repair these systems therefore the use of indigenous skills and materials is crucial to introducing irrigation technologies in such communities subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter saefuddin et al 2014 is one of the irrigation techniques recently developed and introduced in rural areas of indonesia for cultivating annual and perennial crops e g sumarsono et al 2018 an emitter made from a rubber hose is economically affordable especially for small scale farmers after a rubber hose is bent into a ring shape with a diameter of about 20 cm five 5 mm holes are drilled into it at even intervals an entire ring shaped hose is then covered with a permeable textile so that irrigation water can be distributed through the permeable textile in all directions around an emitter when used in the field conditions a number of ring shaped emitters can be connected to a pipeline which delivers water from a water source such as a reservoir a water tank or a faucet a constant pressure head can be maintained at the inlet when the emitter is connected to a water tank sumarsono et al 2018 applied 25 cm pressure head to the buried ring shaped emitter to cultivate annual and perennial crops although ring shaped emitters have been successfully used for cultivating for example melon on an island of indonesia where precipitation is limited saefuddin et al 2014 its current design and operation are purely empirical understanding soil water movement and the spatial extent of the wetted volume around an emitter is crucial to achieving optimum operation of subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter and to modifying its design to improve usability and water use efficiency in addition the current design of the ring shaped emitter does not allow one to easily detect malfunctions because the emitter is fully covered with a permeable textile as a result it is not easy to repair it quickly for faster promotion of the technology it is important to have a design that is easy to maintain it has not yet been evaluated whether the number of holes can be reduced and or whether it is possible to cover emitters only partially with a permeable textile because the number of experiments that can be carried out is usually limited numerical simulations can be used instead to evaluate the performance of ring shaped emitters of various designs and under different soils and environmental conditions using numerical simulations a design that is more robust may be developed in this study the hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 was used to simulate soil water movement during subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter the model is referred to simply as hydrus in the reminder of the manuscript a number of past studies confirmed the suitability of hydrus for simulating water movement during subsurface irrigation for example skaggs et al 2004 compared hydrus simulated water contents for a subsurface line source drip irrigation with observed field data for three different emitter discharge rates kandelous and šimůnek 2010b used hydrus to evaluate laboratory and field data involving water movement in clay loam from point water sources buried at different depths and with different discharge rates kandelous et al 2011 validated hydrus to simulate water movement from a subsurface drip irrigation system by comparing simulated results with measured soil water contents in several field experiments the main objectives of this study were 1 to experimentally investigate the water movement around a buried ring shaped emitter during irrigation 2 to validate the capacity of hydrus to simulate such water movement and 3 to numerically evaluate the effects of modified designs of the ring shaped emitter on soil water dynamics during irrigation laboratory experiments were first carried out to monitor changes in the soil water content at different positions during irrigation using the buried original ring shaped emitter with five drilled holes that were fully covered by a permeable textile while the emitter was developed to aid plant cultivation the laboratory experiments were carried out without any plants in this study to avoid any difficulties associated with plant root water uptake the collected experimental soil moisture data were used to calibrate hydrus the calibrated model was then validated by comparing its prediction against additional experimental data the third objective was achieved by simulating changes in the soil water content around buried emitters of different designs as an indirect quantitative proxy for evaluating the three dimensional wetted volume around the buried emitter corresponding root water uptake rates were computed when water around the emitter is not uniformly distributed the roots around the buried emitter may not be able to uptake water at an optimum rate because some parts of the root system are under stress the root water uptake rate therefore can be used as an indirect indicator of how buried ring shaped emitters of different designs performed compared to the original ring shaped emitter 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments with the ring shaped emitter the laboratory experiments were carried out using a container 50 cm in diameter at the top 40 cm in diameter at the bottom and 55 cm in height filled with air dried soil fig 1 two soil types silt and sand were used in the experiments soils were packed in 5 cm increments at the predetermined bulk density of 1 41 g cm 3 and 1 52 g cm 3 for silt and sand respectively a 10 cm thick gravel layer was installed at the bottom of the container for each experiment the original ring shaped emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm the emitter was connected to a mariotte tank 10 cm in diameter and 44 cm in height to control the water pressure head applied at the inlet referred to as the inlet pressure in this study a constant pressure head of either 1 cm or 5 cm was maintained at the inlet of the buried emitter for 10 h to apply water through the emitter although a much higher pressure head was imposed at the inlet in field cultivation practices e g sumarsono et al 2018 either 1 cm or 5 cm was used in this experiment to avoid a positive back pressure at the outlets shani et al 1996 lazarovitch et al 2005 during the experiments the volume of water in the mariotte tank was recorded every 30 min to obtain the water application rate i e the emitter discharge rate the ring shaped emitter used in this study was made from a rubber water hose the hose which had a 1 cm inner diameter was bent into a ring shape with a diameter of about 20 cm there were 5 small holes with 0 5 cm in diameter drilled at even intervals on one side of the ring the entire ring was covered with a permeable textile so that applied water could infiltrate in all directions into the soil the original ring shaped emitter is referred to as the 5 f emitter in the remainder of the manuscript the schematic of the ring shaped emitter is depicted in fig 2 when the ring shaped emitter was installed in the soil its 5 holes were all facing down to block any soil particles from entering the holes there were 8 capacitance soil moisture sensors ec5 a product of meter environment installed around the buried emitter to monitor changes in the soil water content fig 1 shows the position of the sensors in the container four sensors were installed at depths of 10 20 30 and 40 cm directly above and below the emitter and four additional sensors were installed at the same depths in the center of the emitter since the ring shaped emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm the four sensor installation depths were 5 cm above and 5 15 and 25 cm below the emitter respectively the soil moisture sensors were individually calibrated for the soils used in the experiments soil water retention data for the sand and silt soil were determined using a suction plate and a pressure plate apparatus the van genuchten mualem model was fitted to the data using the retc software package van genuchten et al 1991 2 2 root water uptake mode in hydrus in this study hydrus was used to simulate water movement in soil during subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter in hydrus root water uptake is modeled as a sink term in the richards equation using the stress response function proposed by feddes et al 1978 a compensated root water uptake model is also implemented by introducing a threshold value referred to as the root adaptability factor of a dimensionless water stress index which is defined as the ratio of actual and potential transpiration šimůnek and hopmans 2009 if the water stress index is above the root adaptability factor reduced root water uptake in one part of the root zone is fully compensated for by root water uptake from other parts of the root zone where the water stress is smaller so that the actual transpiration rate is equal to the potential transpiration rate if the water stress index is below the root adaptability factor reduced water uptake is only partially compensated the ratio of actual to potential transpiration is then equal to the ratio of the water stress index to the root adaptability factor which is less than unity in this study the compensated root water uptake model with the root adaptability factor of 0 25 was used when comparing different configurations of the ring shaped emitter the following three dimensional root distribution function b x y z of vrugt et al 2001 is implemented in hydrus 1 b x y z 1 x x m 1 y y m 1 z z m e p x x m x x p y y m y y p z z m z z where x m y m and z m are the maximum rooting lengths in the x y and z directions l respectively and px py pz x l y l and z l are empirical parameters these empirical parameters are included to account for asymmetrical root water uptake in any direction and to allow for a maximum root water uptake at any location x 0 y 0 z 0 where 0 x 0 x m 0 y 0 y m 0 z 0 z m following vrugt et al 2001 p x p y and p z were all set to unity for x x y y and z z more details about hydrus can be found in šimůnek et al 2011 2016 and radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 2 3 soil hydraulic parameter estimation hydrus also has the ability to inversely estimate soil hydraulic parameters from transient variably saturated water flow data such as from water flow data collected during subsurface water application experiments with the original design ring shaped emitter the inverse method implemented in hydrus is based on the minimization of an objective function which expresses the discrepancy between observed and predicted water flow variables hydrus uses the marquardt levenberg optimization algorithm marquardt et al 1963 to minimize the objective function in this study a soil hydraulic parameter set that minimizes the objective function given below was estimated the objective function o was defined as the sum of two components 2 o β θ q j 1 m θ v j i 1 n θ j w i j θ j x t i θ j x t i β 2 k 1 n q w k q c t k q c t k β 2 where θj is the soil water content swc at the sensor position x and qc is the cumulative emitter discharge at the inlet of the buried ring shaped emitter l3t 1 the superscript represents specific measurements at time ti for swcs and tk for the cumulative discharge while mθ is the number of sensor locations nθj is the number of measurements at each sensor position in this objective function θ j x t j β and q c t k β are the corresponding model predictions for the vector of optimized soil hydraulic parameters β and vj wi j and wk are weights associated with a particular measurement during parameter estimation the selected parameters of the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 were optimized since the original ring shaped emitter used in the experiment was fully covered by a permeable textile we assumed that water infiltrated through the textile in all directions therefore the system could be modeled as an axisymmetrical three dimensional domain the domain geometry used in the axisymmetrical three dimensional model is shown in fig 3 similar axisymmetric modeling approaches have been used in many other studies with a subsurface point water source cote et al 2003 gärdenäs et al 2005 provenzano 2007 kandelous and šimůnek 2010a kandelous et al 2011 naglič et al 2014 a circle with a 1 cm diameter located at a 15 cm depth in the domain represents the cross section of the buried ring shaped emitter fig 3 the entire flow domain was discretized into 661 nodes and 1246 triangular finite elements with their sizes gradually increasing away from the emitter the finite element mesh was generated using an automatic triangulation algorithm that is implemented in hydrus changes in the soil water content through time were simulated at 8 observation nodes that corresponded with the positions of the soil moisture sensors installed as shown by red dots in fig 3 the observed average initial water content θin was assigned to the entire flow domain as the initial water content the average initial water contents were 0 044 cm3 cm 3 and 0 046 cm3 cm 3 for silt and sand respectively the van genuchten mualem model parameters fitted to experimental retention curves were used as initial estimates of optimized parameters as for ks the values provided in the rosetta soil catalog ks 29 7 cm h 1 for sand and 0 35 cm h 1 for silt were used as initial estimates while an atmospheric boundary condition was used at the soil surface no flux boundary conditions were used at the bottom and both sides of the domain during the simulation as for the nodal points along the perimeter of the emitter a boundary condition that changes from a constant pressure head condition to a no flux condition at a specified time was used this boundary condition is referred to in hydrus as the time variable flux head boundary condition while a constant pressure head equal to the pressure head imposed during the laboratory experiment was used in nodes along the emitter during the water application time the first 10 h a no flux boundary condition was used after the water application was stopped after 10 h this boundary condition applies a specified pressure head to the lowest nodal point of the emitter and adjusts pressure heads in the other nodal points based on the vertical coordinates 2 4 numerical analysis of alternative emitter configurations one of the main objectives of this study was to numerically investigate the effect of changing ring shaped emitter configurations especially the number and locations of holes and the textile cover on the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried emitter in addition to the original ring shaped emitter with five drilled holes fully covered by a permeable textile ring shaped emitters with a reduced number of holes and only partially covered by the textile were considered modified emitters with 2 3 4 and 5 holes referred to as 2 p 3 p 4 p and 5 p emitters respectively were considered in this study the original ring shaped emitter is referred to as 5 f fig 4 shows a top view of the five different ring shaped emitters considered in this study the black sections of the ring represent the locations covered with the textile i e permeable sections while the white sections represent the ring without the textile i e impermeable sections the partially covered emitters were designed to increase the ease of inspection and maintenance the numerical simulations were carried out in a fully three dimensional domain so that the asymmetry in the hole configurations could be modeled without any simplifications the three dimensional simulation domain was discretized into 41 016 three dimensional triangular prismatic elements with finer elements around the emitter with sizes of 1 cm and gradually increasing element sizes farther from the emitter up to 2 5 cm the initial and boundary conditions of these simulations were similar to those used in the axisymmetrical three dimensional case the time variable flux head boundary condition was specified in the nodes representing the ring with the textile dark blue parts in fig 4 the inlet pressure head was kept constant at 1 cm during the water application in all simulations following the experimental setup if a much higher inlet pressure head is applied at the inlet a positive back pressure may build up at the outlets of the emitter which can lead to a substantial decrease in the emitter discharge rate shani et al 1996 in this numerical analysis the water application was stopped when the predefined amount of water e g 720 cm3 per day which meets the plant water requirement was injected the effect of the emitter design was first assessed by simulating changes in the soil water content over 24 h after 720 cm3 of water was applied to initially dry soils in practice it is important to know the effect of preceding irrigations on the soil water dynamics during subsurface irrigation with the ring shaped emitter the simulations were thus also carried out for 504 h i e 21 days during which water was applied 7 times i e 7 irrigation cycles in this numerical analysis water was applied every three days i e at 0 72 144 216 288 350 412 and 484 h from the start of simulation the amount of water applied during each irrigation cycle matched the cumulative potential transpiration of the model plants over 3 days the inlet pressure head was again kept constant at 1 cm during the water application the comparison of wetted volumes around the buried ring shaped emitters of different designs is not straightforward in the case of three dimensional simulations calculated water contents at particular locations cannot provide sufficient information on the spatial extent of the wetted volumes in this study the effect of different emitter designs on the spatial extent of the wetted volume was assessed using the soil water stress a plant would have been exposed to assuming that the plant roots are distributed symmetrically around the buried ring shaped emitter a non uniformity in the spatial extent of the wetted volume may cause stress to the plant roots for example when some parts of the soil are too dry the plant roots in these regions cannot uptake water at an optimum rate the uncompensated root water uptake model was first used to indirectly assess the non uniformity of the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried emitter the compensated root water uptake model was then used to assess whether such non uniformity would affect actual plant root water uptake two model plants tomato and strawberry were considered in this study because of their contrasting spatial root distributions it has to be mentioned that both crops are known for their high profitability as it is especially important to investigate the effectiveness of subsurface irrigation with the ring shaped emitter for highly profitable crops fig 5 shows the spatial root distribution defined using the vrugt s model for both tomato and strawberry the spatial root distribution was considered constant with time during simulations i e the root growth was neglected while table 1 summarizes the spatial root distribution parameters for tomato and strawberry table 2 lists the corresponding parameters of the stress response functions these values were modified from those available in hydrus to improve the computational stability the simulations were carried out for two soil textures silt and sand a typical potential evapotranspiration tp rate of 6 mm d 1 shani et al 2007 which corresponds to 720 cm3 of water per day was used in the analysis simulations were carried out using the soil hydraulic parameters inversely estimated as described in section 2 3 the ring shaped emitter was placed in a depth of 15 cm similarly as during the experiment 3 results and discussions 3 1 laboratory experiments subsurface water application experiments were carried out using the original ring shaped emitter 5 f on two different soils silt and sand fig 6 depicts soil water contents swcs observed at 8 locations fig 7 observed cumulative discharge rates as a function of time for two applied inlet pressure heads 1 and 5 cm and two soils open triangles in fig 6 show swcs at the center of the buried ring shaped emitter in four depths i e 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm whereas open circles show swcs directly below and above the buried ring shaped emitter in the same four depths for silt swcs 5 cm directly below and above the buried ring shaped emitter i e 10 and 20 cm depths increased a few hours after the beginning of the water application for both inlet pressure heads this indicates that water infiltrated radially in all directions around the buried emitter regardless of the inlet pressure head applied swcs increased earlier and faster when the inlet pressure head of 5 cm was applied compared to those with the 1 cm inlet pressure head an initially steep increase in swcs became more gradual after a few hours before finally reaching their maximum values after about 10 h at the time when the application of water stopped an increase in swcs 5 cm directly below the emitter increased faster than swcs observed at 5 cm directly above the emitter regardless of the inlet pressure applied because the gravitation enhanced the flow in the downward direction during the redistribution process swcs gradually decreased at both locations on the other hand swcs in the same depths 5 cm above and below the buried emitter at the center of the buried emitter started increasing much later due to the lateral distance from the emitter i e the water source as expected swcs 5 cm below the emitter increased much faster than those 5 cm above the emitter when the inlet pressure head was 1 cm swcs at the center kept increasing but never reached the same peaks as above and below the emitter at both depths swcs at other depths i e 30 and 40 cm below the surface never increased during the experiment the main difference between silt and sand was that observed swcs did not increase 5 cm above the buried emitter dark blue symbols in figs 6 cd for the depth of 10 cm in sand additionally when the applied inlet pressure head was 5 cm increases in swcs 5 cm and 15 cm below the buried emitter i e in depths of 20 and 30 cm were especially large these results indicate that downward water movement was dominant in the sand profile while water moved more radially including lateral and upward directions from the emitter in the silt profile this difference can be attributed to different macroscopic capillary lengths λc given below of these two soils radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 λ c h i h 0 k h d h k h 0 k h i the macroscopic capillary length λc can be interpreted as the measure of the effects of capillarity as opposed to gravity the macroscopic capillary length was 7 56 cm and 5 27 cm for silt and sand respectively when integrating from hi 0 cm to h0 200 cm since sand typically has a much lower macroscopic capillary length than other soils water flowing from a source will move much less laterally or upward than downward the cumulative discharge increased almost linearly for both soils when the applied inlet pressure head was 1 cm there was no obvious difference in the cumulative discharge between silt and sand when the inlet pressure increased to 5 cm while the cumulative discharges for both soils increased almost linearly with time the cumulative discharge after 10 h of water application in sand was much larger than in silt 3 2 model calibration to calibrate the hydrus model for the analysis of water movement during the subsurface water application from the buried ring shaped emitter the experimental data observed with the 1 cm inlet pressure head were used the data collected during the experiments performed with the 5 cm inlet pressure head were then used to validate hydrus with calibrated parameters the soil hydraulic parameters were optimized for both soils by minimizing the objective function given by eq 2 table 3 lists the optimized van genuchten mualem parameters for the sand and silt while table 4 summarizes statistics of discrepancies between observations and simulations for both soils fitted values of swcs and cumulative discharges agreed reasonably well with observed values both swrcs and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions shown in fig 8 agree well with the common shape of the typical curves for both silt and sand e g jury and horton 2004 the optimized soil hydraulic parameters were then used in hydrus to compare simulated and observed swcs at 8 sensor positions and the cumulative discharges during the experiments performed with the inlet pressure head of 5 cm for both soils table 4 summarizes also errors between observations and predictions for simulations with the optimized parameters for experiments with the inlet pressure head of 5 cm figures 6bd show both observed and predicted swcs at 8 sensor positions whereas figures 7bd show both observed and predicted cumulative discharges for silt both swcs and cumulative discharges were predicted well using the optimized parameters for sand however predicted swcs did not agree well with observed ones especially 15 cm directly below i e in the depth of 30 cm where swcs were overestimated and 5 cm directly above i e in the depth of 10 cm where swcs were underestimated this indicates that more downward water flow occurred during the experiment than predicted by the hydrus simulation when the applied inlet pressure head was 5 cm the preferential type flow may have occurred underneath the drilled holes of the emitter that enhanced downward water movement this type of flow clearly creates a non uniform asymmetrical wetted volume around the buried emitter which may not be an ideal situation for plant roots to uptake water sand is known to be susceptible to preferential flow or finger type flow when it is initially dry in places where preferential flow paths are formed the soil becomes strongly wettable increasing its ability to conduct water downward through these pathways dekker and ritsema 1994 it may therefore not be a good idea to apply a high inlet pressure when a ring shaped emitter is installed in an initially dry sandy soil profile fig 9 shows the spatial extent of the simulated wetted areas around the buried emitter in the axisymmetrical three dimensional domain after 1 5 10 15 20 and 24 h using the optimized soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 3 for each soil the wetted area i e the wetted volume was larger when the inlet pressure head was higher the higher water content around the emitter may cause positive pressure heads building up around the outlets of the emitter that can eventually lead to a decrease in the emitter discharge rate as expected while in silt the wetted area expanded radially with time during the water application i e during the first 10 h downward water movement clearly outpaced lateral or upward movement in the sand profile these results can again be explained by the differences in the soil hydraulic characteristics especially the macroscopic capillary length λc of the two soils used this study clarified that hydrus is indeed a useful tool for analyzing soil water dynamics during the water application with the buried ring shaped emitter i e subsurface irrigation as also indicated by a number of other subsurface drip irrigation studies bufon et al 2012 lazarovitch et al 2007 kandelous et al 2012 el nesr et al 2014 ghazouani et al 2015 3 3 the effect of alternative emitter designs on soil water dynamics the effects of changing the ring covering method and reducing the number of holes on the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried ring shaped emitter were numerically investigated using hydrus the optimized soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 3 were used in this analysis root water uptake rwu was computed as an indirect quantitative proxy measure to evaluate the spatial extent of the wetted volume as described in section 2 4 five different emitter configurations were compared 5 f 5 p 4 p 3 p and 2 p fig 10 shows simulated cumulative discharges as a function of the elapsed time for different emitter designs computed over 24 h for initially dry silt and sand when 720 cm3 of water was applied for both soils as expected the duration needed to reach the same infiltration amount depended strongly on the number of holes as the number of holes decreased the duration increased although these simulation results show almost constant discharge rates regardless of the emitter design it has to be mentioned that the emitter discharge rate during subsurface irrigation cannot be kept constant in practice unless a compensated emitter is used fig 11 shows simulated uncompensated top and compensated bottom cumulative root water uptake rwu of tomato over 24 h in the silt left and sand right profiles for different ring shaped emitters fig 12 summarizes the results shown in fig 11 for tomato as well as for strawberry which were not shown in fig 11 using the water use efficiency wue which can be computed as the ratio of cumulative rwu to cumulative irrigation at 24 h uncompensated rwu was used as an indirect quantitative proxy measure of the non uniformity in the wetted volume around the buried emitter compensated rwu was then computed to investigate whether such non uniformity has any effect on actual plant rwu although uncompensated cumulative rwu in silt increased more slowly when the number of holes was reduced cumulative uncompensated rwu was almost the same at the end of the simulation for all emitter designs fig 11a even though the wetted volume expanded more slowly with the smaller discharge rate in silt when the number of holes was smaller uncompensated rwu eventually caught up with those for more holes as the wetted volume evolved radially in all directions as can also be seen in fig 9 as for sand the initial trend is basically the same as for silt the higher the number of holes the higher uncompensated rwu however uncompensated rwu computed for the 3 p or 2 p emitters in sand unlike in silt could not catch up with those for 5 f 5 p or 4 p after the water application was stopped it was also observed that the 5 f emitter had slightly smaller cumulative rwu after 24 h compared to emitters that were partially covered i e 5 p and 4 p when a ring shaped emitter with only a small number of holes is used in the sand profile applied water tends to move downward rather than radially around the emitter as predicted numerically in the axisymmetrical three dimensional domain for sand fig 9b d these results are also summarized in fig 12 for both soils the wue decreased as the number of holes decreased cumulative rwu increased significantly in both soils when the compensated rwu model was used fig 11cd for silt while compensated rwu with a smaller number of holes was much smaller than that for the emitter with more holes at earlier time they were almost the same at the end of simulation this can be also seen in the computed wue for compensated rwu for silt for both model plants fig 12 as water was slowly discharged from the emitter with less holes rwu slowly increased this implies that reducing the number of holes does not affect the amount of water available for plant root uptake over 24 h in silt when the compensated rwu model was used for sand the general trend was the same as for the uncompensated rwu model except that cumulative compensated rwu was much larger the effect of preceding irrigations was then assessed for different emitter designs by computing compensated cumulative rwu over 21 days i e 504 h during which seven irrigation cycles were considered fig 13 cumulative compensated rwus after 21 days for different emitter designs were almost the same for silt on the other hand for sand cumulative compensated rwu is strongly affected by the emitter design for 5 f unlike the 24 hour simulation case shown in fig 11 cumulative rwu starts being reduced after 8 days while cumulative rwus computed for the emitters with fewer holes continuously increase at the end of the simulation simulated cumulative rwu for 3 p reaches the highest value and thus the highest wue among different evaluated designs for 5 f the water application rate was too high for plant roots to uptake as a result there was a significant amount of water lost to deep percolation for the emitters with fewer holes the water application rate was smaller and consequently that there was much less water lost to deep percolations even for sand in summary these simulation results confirm that the number of holes can be reduced to 2 or 3 regardless of the soil types considered in this study 4 summary and conclusions the experimental results showed that water moved radially around the emitter in silt while downward water movement was dominant in sand when water was applied using the buried ring shaped emitter the difference in the flow pattern can be attributed to the difference in the macroscopic capillary length of the soil which can be interpreted as a measure of the contribution of capillarity as opposed to gravity s effect on unsaturated water movement hydrus a model simulating variably saturated water flow in porous media was then calibrated using the experimental data collected from the experiments with the 1 cm inlet pressure head the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters were used to simulate changes in soil water contents swcs for the experiments with the 5 cm inlet pressure head while swcs were predicted well for silt swcs above the buried emitter were overestimated and those directly below the emitter were underestimated for sand although the fitted saturated hydraulic conductivity for sand was too small this result indicates that downward water movement was predominant suggesting the occurrence of preferential flow with the optimized soil hydraulic parameters hydrus was used to investigate the effects of alternative emitter designs on the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried emitter during the subsurface water application had the spatial distribution of the swc been non uniform some parts of the plant root system would have been stressed resulting in the reduction in root water uptake in this analysis plant root water uptake was therefore used as an indirect quantitative proxy measure to assess the non uniformity in the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the emitter two model plants tomato and strawberry were considered because of their contrasting root distributions both uncompensated and compensated rwu were then computed while the former was used to assess the non uniformity in the spatial extent of the wetted volume the latter was used to investigate whether such non uniformity had any effect on plant root water uptake in addition to the original 5 hole emitter that was fully covered by a permeable textile four separate emitter designs with a different number of holes were analyzed the new emitter proposed in this study was only partially covered by the textile around the holes to simplify the maintenance of the emitter numerical simulations with these alternative emitter designs showed that the lower number of holes did not significantly affect uncompensated rwu in silt however in sand cumulative uncompensated rwu decreased when the emitters with reduced number of holes were used in the initially dry soil suggesting non uniformity in the wetted volume the non uniformity in the wetted volume in silt for the emitter with fewer holes was not significantly different because water moved radially from the emitter diminishing the effect of the spatial hole configuration for sand on the other hand the non uniformity in the wetted volume was larger as indicated by uncompensated rwu such non uniformity in the wetted volume does not affect the long term performance of the ring shaped emitter with fewer holes even for sand because of the slow discharge rate simulated compensated rwu for both model plants revealed that reducing the number of holes in sand gradually increased rwu as slowly infiltrating water allowed plant roots to uptake water continuously this may not be beneficial when considering the diurnal water uptake pattern of plants when higher rwu occurs in daylight time these results show that regardless of the soil type reducing the number of holes and changing the covering method may result in a much better water use efficiency and easier maintenance overall this study demonstrates that hydrus is a useful tool for analyzing soil water dynamics around the buried

11289,a low cost subsurface irrigation system can generate benefits for small scale farmers who have scarce water resources a ring shaped emitter made from a standard rubber hose has been developed and introduced for subsurface irrigation in indonesia it is a low cost irrigation technology based on indigenous materials and skills to build a ring shaped emitter of the original design a rubber hose is bent into a ring shape with a diameter of about 20 cm and then five 5 mm holes are drilled into it at even intervals next the entire ring shaped hose is covered with a permeable textile so that water can infiltrate in all directions around the buried emitter water is applied from a water tank connected to the emitter by adjusting the pressure head imposed at the inlet of the emitter although it has been successfully used in practice the performance of the ring shaped emitter has not been evaluated in detail additionally because the ring shaped hose is fully covered with the textile it may be difficult to detect any malfunctions or repair it to promote the ring shaped emitter for subsurface irrigation among small scale farmers in arid or semi arid regions it is important to design an emitter that is easy to maintain this study proposes a reduction in the number of holes and a change of covering method because the number of experiments that can be carried out to evaluate the performance of alternative ring shaped emitters is usually limited numerical simulations can be performed in addition to experiments the main objectives of this study thus were 1 to experimentally investigate the water movement around a buried ring shaped emitter and 2 to numerically evaluate the effect of modifying the design of the ring shaped emitter on soil water dynamics around the emitter numerical simulations were carried out using hydrus one of the most complete packages for simulating variably saturated water flow in two or three dimensional domains hydrus simulations in a fully three dimensional domain were performed using the soil hydraulic parameters that were optimized against experimental data collected during experiments with the original ring shaped emitter simulation results confirmed that reducing the number of holes does not significantly affect the water availability in silt for model plants such as tomato and strawberry and that covering the entire emitter is not necessary partially covering the emitter allows one to maintain the emitter much more easily compared to the original fully covered emitter keywords subsurface irrigation ring shaped emitter macroscopic capillary length water use efficiency wue numerical simulation 1 introduction some of the modern irrigation technologies designed for large scale farming with complex and expensive devices tend to fail when introduced in rural areas of developing countries where farming is generally practiced on a much smaller scale in these areas maintaining complex irrigation systems can become a roadblock to promoting modern technologies because there may not be enough well trained engineers and it may be difficult to find parts to repair these systems therefore the use of indigenous skills and materials is crucial to introducing irrigation technologies in such communities subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter saefuddin et al 2014 is one of the irrigation techniques recently developed and introduced in rural areas of indonesia for cultivating annual and perennial crops e g sumarsono et al 2018 an emitter made from a rubber hose is economically affordable especially for small scale farmers after a rubber hose is bent into a ring shape with a diameter of about 20 cm five 5 mm holes are drilled into it at even intervals an entire ring shaped hose is then covered with a permeable textile so that irrigation water can be distributed through the permeable textile in all directions around an emitter when used in the field conditions a number of ring shaped emitters can be connected to a pipeline which delivers water from a water source such as a reservoir a water tank or a faucet a constant pressure head can be maintained at the inlet when the emitter is connected to a water tank sumarsono et al 2018 applied 25 cm pressure head to the buried ring shaped emitter to cultivate annual and perennial crops although ring shaped emitters have been successfully used for cultivating for example melon on an island of indonesia where precipitation is limited saefuddin et al 2014 its current design and operation are purely empirical understanding soil water movement and the spatial extent of the wetted volume around an emitter is crucial to achieving optimum operation of subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter and to modifying its design to improve usability and water use efficiency in addition the current design of the ring shaped emitter does not allow one to easily detect malfunctions because the emitter is fully covered with a permeable textile as a result it is not easy to repair it quickly for faster promotion of the technology it is important to have a design that is easy to maintain it has not yet been evaluated whether the number of holes can be reduced and or whether it is possible to cover emitters only partially with a permeable textile because the number of experiments that can be carried out is usually limited numerical simulations can be used instead to evaluate the performance of ring shaped emitters of various designs and under different soils and environmental conditions using numerical simulations a design that is more robust may be developed in this study the hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2016 was used to simulate soil water movement during subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter the model is referred to simply as hydrus in the reminder of the manuscript a number of past studies confirmed the suitability of hydrus for simulating water movement during subsurface irrigation for example skaggs et al 2004 compared hydrus simulated water contents for a subsurface line source drip irrigation with observed field data for three different emitter discharge rates kandelous and šimůnek 2010b used hydrus to evaluate laboratory and field data involving water movement in clay loam from point water sources buried at different depths and with different discharge rates kandelous et al 2011 validated hydrus to simulate water movement from a subsurface drip irrigation system by comparing simulated results with measured soil water contents in several field experiments the main objectives of this study were 1 to experimentally investigate the water movement around a buried ring shaped emitter during irrigation 2 to validate the capacity of hydrus to simulate such water movement and 3 to numerically evaluate the effects of modified designs of the ring shaped emitter on soil water dynamics during irrigation laboratory experiments were first carried out to monitor changes in the soil water content at different positions during irrigation using the buried original ring shaped emitter with five drilled holes that were fully covered by a permeable textile while the emitter was developed to aid plant cultivation the laboratory experiments were carried out without any plants in this study to avoid any difficulties associated with plant root water uptake the collected experimental soil moisture data were used to calibrate hydrus the calibrated model was then validated by comparing its prediction against additional experimental data the third objective was achieved by simulating changes in the soil water content around buried emitters of different designs as an indirect quantitative proxy for evaluating the three dimensional wetted volume around the buried emitter corresponding root water uptake rates were computed when water around the emitter is not uniformly distributed the roots around the buried emitter may not be able to uptake water at an optimum rate because some parts of the root system are under stress the root water uptake rate therefore can be used as an indirect indicator of how buried ring shaped emitters of different designs performed compared to the original ring shaped emitter 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments with the ring shaped emitter the laboratory experiments were carried out using a container 50 cm in diameter at the top 40 cm in diameter at the bottom and 55 cm in height filled with air dried soil fig 1 two soil types silt and sand were used in the experiments soils were packed in 5 cm increments at the predetermined bulk density of 1 41 g cm 3 and 1 52 g cm 3 for silt and sand respectively a 10 cm thick gravel layer was installed at the bottom of the container for each experiment the original ring shaped emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm the emitter was connected to a mariotte tank 10 cm in diameter and 44 cm in height to control the water pressure head applied at the inlet referred to as the inlet pressure in this study a constant pressure head of either 1 cm or 5 cm was maintained at the inlet of the buried emitter for 10 h to apply water through the emitter although a much higher pressure head was imposed at the inlet in field cultivation practices e g sumarsono et al 2018 either 1 cm or 5 cm was used in this experiment to avoid a positive back pressure at the outlets shani et al 1996 lazarovitch et al 2005 during the experiments the volume of water in the mariotte tank was recorded every 30 min to obtain the water application rate i e the emitter discharge rate the ring shaped emitter used in this study was made from a rubber water hose the hose which had a 1 cm inner diameter was bent into a ring shape with a diameter of about 20 cm there were 5 small holes with 0 5 cm in diameter drilled at even intervals on one side of the ring the entire ring was covered with a permeable textile so that applied water could infiltrate in all directions into the soil the original ring shaped emitter is referred to as the 5 f emitter in the remainder of the manuscript the schematic of the ring shaped emitter is depicted in fig 2 when the ring shaped emitter was installed in the soil its 5 holes were all facing down to block any soil particles from entering the holes there were 8 capacitance soil moisture sensors ec5 a product of meter environment installed around the buried emitter to monitor changes in the soil water content fig 1 shows the position of the sensors in the container four sensors were installed at depths of 10 20 30 and 40 cm directly above and below the emitter and four additional sensors were installed at the same depths in the center of the emitter since the ring shaped emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm the four sensor installation depths were 5 cm above and 5 15 and 25 cm below the emitter respectively the soil moisture sensors were individually calibrated for the soils used in the experiments soil water retention data for the sand and silt soil were determined using a suction plate and a pressure plate apparatus the van genuchten mualem model was fitted to the data using the retc software package van genuchten et al 1991 2 2 root water uptake mode in hydrus in this study hydrus was used to simulate water movement in soil during subsurface irrigation with a ring shaped emitter in hydrus root water uptake is modeled as a sink term in the richards equation using the stress response function proposed by feddes et al 1978 a compensated root water uptake model is also implemented by introducing a threshold value referred to as the root adaptability factor of a dimensionless water stress index which is defined as the ratio of actual and potential transpiration šimůnek and hopmans 2009 if the water stress index is above the root adaptability factor reduced root water uptake in one part of the root zone is fully compensated for by root water uptake from other parts of the root zone where the water stress is smaller so that the actual transpiration rate is equal to the potential transpiration rate if the water stress index is below the root adaptability factor reduced water uptake is only partially compensated the ratio of actual to potential transpiration is then equal to the ratio of the water stress index to the root adaptability factor which is less than unity in this study the compensated root water uptake model with the root adaptability factor of 0 25 was used when comparing different configurations of the ring shaped emitter the following three dimensional root distribution function b x y z of vrugt et al 2001 is implemented in hydrus 1 b x y z 1 x x m 1 y y m 1 z z m e p x x m x x p y y m y y p z z m z z where x m y m and z m are the maximum rooting lengths in the x y and z directions l respectively and px py pz x l y l and z l are empirical parameters these empirical parameters are included to account for asymmetrical root water uptake in any direction and to allow for a maximum root water uptake at any location x 0 y 0 z 0 where 0 x 0 x m 0 y 0 y m 0 z 0 z m following vrugt et al 2001 p x p y and p z were all set to unity for x x y y and z z more details about hydrus can be found in šimůnek et al 2011 2016 and radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 2 3 soil hydraulic parameter estimation hydrus also has the ability to inversely estimate soil hydraulic parameters from transient variably saturated water flow data such as from water flow data collected during subsurface water application experiments with the original design ring shaped emitter the inverse method implemented in hydrus is based on the minimization of an objective function which expresses the discrepancy between observed and predicted water flow variables hydrus uses the marquardt levenberg optimization algorithm marquardt et al 1963 to minimize the objective function in this study a soil hydraulic parameter set that minimizes the objective function given below was estimated the objective function o was defined as the sum of two components 2 o β θ q j 1 m θ v j i 1 n θ j w i j θ j x t i θ j x t i β 2 k 1 n q w k q c t k q c t k β 2 where θj is the soil water content swc at the sensor position x and qc is the cumulative emitter discharge at the inlet of the buried ring shaped emitter l3t 1 the superscript represents specific measurements at time ti for swcs and tk for the cumulative discharge while mθ is the number of sensor locations nθj is the number of measurements at each sensor position in this objective function θ j x t j β and q c t k β are the corresponding model predictions for the vector of optimized soil hydraulic parameters β and vj wi j and wk are weights associated with a particular measurement during parameter estimation the selected parameters of the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 were optimized since the original ring shaped emitter used in the experiment was fully covered by a permeable textile we assumed that water infiltrated through the textile in all directions therefore the system could be modeled as an axisymmetrical three dimensional domain the domain geometry used in the axisymmetrical three dimensional model is shown in fig 3 similar axisymmetric modeling approaches have been used in many other studies with a subsurface point water source cote et al 2003 gärdenäs et al 2005 provenzano 2007 kandelous and šimůnek 2010a kandelous et al 2011 naglič et al 2014 a circle with a 1 cm diameter located at a 15 cm depth in the domain represents the cross section of the buried ring shaped emitter fig 3 the entire flow domain was discretized into 661 nodes and 1246 triangular finite elements with their sizes gradually increasing away from the emitter the finite element mesh was generated using an automatic triangulation algorithm that is implemented in hydrus changes in the soil water content through time were simulated at 8 observation nodes that corresponded with the positions of the soil moisture sensors installed as shown by red dots in fig 3 the observed average initial water content θin was assigned to the entire flow domain as the initial water content the average initial water contents were 0 044 cm3 cm 3 and 0 046 cm3 cm 3 for silt and sand respectively the van genuchten mualem model parameters fitted to experimental retention curves were used as initial estimates of optimized parameters as for ks the values provided in the rosetta soil catalog ks 29 7 cm h 1 for sand and 0 35 cm h 1 for silt were used as initial estimates while an atmospheric boundary condition was used at the soil surface no flux boundary conditions were used at the bottom and both sides of the domain during the simulation as for the nodal points along the perimeter of the emitter a boundary condition that changes from a constant pressure head condition to a no flux condition at a specified time was used this boundary condition is referred to in hydrus as the time variable flux head boundary condition while a constant pressure head equal to the pressure head imposed during the laboratory experiment was used in nodes along the emitter during the water application time the first 10 h a no flux boundary condition was used after the water application was stopped after 10 h this boundary condition applies a specified pressure head to the lowest nodal point of the emitter and adjusts pressure heads in the other nodal points based on the vertical coordinates 2 4 numerical analysis of alternative emitter configurations one of the main objectives of this study was to numerically investigate the effect of changing ring shaped emitter configurations especially the number and locations of holes and the textile cover on the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried emitter in addition to the original ring shaped emitter with five drilled holes fully covered by a permeable textile ring shaped emitters with a reduced number of holes and only partially covered by the textile were considered modified emitters with 2 3 4 and 5 holes referred to as 2 p 3 p 4 p and 5 p emitters respectively were considered in this study the original ring shaped emitter is referred to as 5 f fig 4 shows a top view of the five different ring shaped emitters considered in this study the black sections of the ring represent the locations covered with the textile i e permeable sections while the white sections represent the ring without the textile i e impermeable sections the partially covered emitters were designed to increase the ease of inspection and maintenance the numerical simulations were carried out in a fully three dimensional domain so that the asymmetry in the hole configurations could be modeled without any simplifications the three dimensional simulation domain was discretized into 41 016 three dimensional triangular prismatic elements with finer elements around the emitter with sizes of 1 cm and gradually increasing element sizes farther from the emitter up to 2 5 cm the initial and boundary conditions of these simulations were similar to those used in the axisymmetrical three dimensional case the time variable flux head boundary condition was specified in the nodes representing the ring with the textile dark blue parts in fig 4 the inlet pressure head was kept constant at 1 cm during the water application in all simulations following the experimental setup if a much higher inlet pressure head is applied at the inlet a positive back pressure may build up at the outlets of the emitter which can lead to a substantial decrease in the emitter discharge rate shani et al 1996 in this numerical analysis the water application was stopped when the predefined amount of water e g 720 cm3 per day which meets the plant water requirement was injected the effect of the emitter design was first assessed by simulating changes in the soil water content over 24 h after 720 cm3 of water was applied to initially dry soils in practice it is important to know the effect of preceding irrigations on the soil water dynamics during subsurface irrigation with the ring shaped emitter the simulations were thus also carried out for 504 h i e 21 days during which water was applied 7 times i e 7 irrigation cycles in this numerical analysis water was applied every three days i e at 0 72 144 216 288 350 412 and 484 h from the start of simulation the amount of water applied during each irrigation cycle matched the cumulative potential transpiration of the model plants over 3 days the inlet pressure head was again kept constant at 1 cm during the water application the comparison of wetted volumes around the buried ring shaped emitters of different designs is not straightforward in the case of three dimensional simulations calculated water contents at particular locations cannot provide sufficient information on the spatial extent of the wetted volumes in this study the effect of different emitter designs on the spatial extent of the wetted volume was assessed using the soil water stress a plant would have been exposed to assuming that the plant roots are distributed symmetrically around the buried ring shaped emitter a non uniformity in the spatial extent of the wetted volume may cause stress to the plant roots for example when some parts of the soil are too dry the plant roots in these regions cannot uptake water at an optimum rate the uncompensated root water uptake model was first used to indirectly assess the non uniformity of the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried emitter the compensated root water uptake model was then used to assess whether such non uniformity would affect actual plant root water uptake two model plants tomato and strawberry were considered in this study because of their contrasting spatial root distributions it has to be mentioned that both crops are known for their high profitability as it is especially important to investigate the effectiveness of subsurface irrigation with the ring shaped emitter for highly profitable crops fig 5 shows the spatial root distribution defined using the vrugt s model for both tomato and strawberry the spatial root distribution was considered constant with time during simulations i e the root growth was neglected while table 1 summarizes the spatial root distribution parameters for tomato and strawberry table 2 lists the corresponding parameters of the stress response functions these values were modified from those available in hydrus to improve the computational stability the simulations were carried out for two soil textures silt and sand a typical potential evapotranspiration tp rate of 6 mm d 1 shani et al 2007 which corresponds to 720 cm3 of water per day was used in the analysis simulations were carried out using the soil hydraulic parameters inversely estimated as described in section 2 3 the ring shaped emitter was placed in a depth of 15 cm similarly as during the experiment 3 results and discussions 3 1 laboratory experiments subsurface water application experiments were carried out using the original ring shaped emitter 5 f on two different soils silt and sand fig 6 depicts soil water contents swcs observed at 8 locations fig 7 observed cumulative discharge rates as a function of time for two applied inlet pressure heads 1 and 5 cm and two soils open triangles in fig 6 show swcs at the center of the buried ring shaped emitter in four depths i e 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm whereas open circles show swcs directly below and above the buried ring shaped emitter in the same four depths for silt swcs 5 cm directly below and above the buried ring shaped emitter i e 10 and 20 cm depths increased a few hours after the beginning of the water application for both inlet pressure heads this indicates that water infiltrated radially in all directions around the buried emitter regardless of the inlet pressure head applied swcs increased earlier and faster when the inlet pressure head of 5 cm was applied compared to those with the 1 cm inlet pressure head an initially steep increase in swcs became more gradual after a few hours before finally reaching their maximum values after about 10 h at the time when the application of water stopped an increase in swcs 5 cm directly below the emitter increased faster than swcs observed at 5 cm directly above the emitter regardless of the inlet pressure applied because the gravitation enhanced the flow in the downward direction during the redistribution process swcs gradually decreased at both locations on the other hand swcs in the same depths 5 cm above and below the buried emitter at the center of the buried emitter started increasing much later due to the lateral distance from the emitter i e the water source as expected swcs 5 cm below the emitter increased much faster than those 5 cm above the emitter when the inlet pressure head was 1 cm swcs at the center kept increasing but never reached the same peaks as above and below the emitter at both depths swcs at other depths i e 30 and 40 cm below the surface never increased during the experiment the main difference between silt and sand was that observed swcs did not increase 5 cm above the buried emitter dark blue symbols in figs 6 cd for the depth of 10 cm in sand additionally when the applied inlet pressure head was 5 cm increases in swcs 5 cm and 15 cm below the buried emitter i e in depths of 20 and 30 cm were especially large these results indicate that downward water movement was dominant in the sand profile while water moved more radially including lateral and upward directions from the emitter in the silt profile this difference can be attributed to different macroscopic capillary lengths λc given below of these two soils radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 λ c h i h 0 k h d h k h 0 k h i the macroscopic capillary length λc can be interpreted as the measure of the effects of capillarity as opposed to gravity the macroscopic capillary length was 7 56 cm and 5 27 cm for silt and sand respectively when integrating from hi 0 cm to h0 200 cm since sand typically has a much lower macroscopic capillary length than other soils water flowing from a source will move much less laterally or upward than downward the cumulative discharge increased almost linearly for both soils when the applied inlet pressure head was 1 cm there was no obvious difference in the cumulative discharge between silt and sand when the inlet pressure increased to 5 cm while the cumulative discharges for both soils increased almost linearly with time the cumulative discharge after 10 h of water application in sand was much larger than in silt 3 2 model calibration to calibrate the hydrus model for the analysis of water movement during the subsurface water application from the buried ring shaped emitter the experimental data observed with the 1 cm inlet pressure head were used the data collected during the experiments performed with the 5 cm inlet pressure head were then used to validate hydrus with calibrated parameters the soil hydraulic parameters were optimized for both soils by minimizing the objective function given by eq 2 table 3 lists the optimized van genuchten mualem parameters for the sand and silt while table 4 summarizes statistics of discrepancies between observations and simulations for both soils fitted values of swcs and cumulative discharges agreed reasonably well with observed values both swrcs and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions shown in fig 8 agree well with the common shape of the typical curves for both silt and sand e g jury and horton 2004 the optimized soil hydraulic parameters were then used in hydrus to compare simulated and observed swcs at 8 sensor positions and the cumulative discharges during the experiments performed with the inlet pressure head of 5 cm for both soils table 4 summarizes also errors between observations and predictions for simulations with the optimized parameters for experiments with the inlet pressure head of 5 cm figures 6bd show both observed and predicted swcs at 8 sensor positions whereas figures 7bd show both observed and predicted cumulative discharges for silt both swcs and cumulative discharges were predicted well using the optimized parameters for sand however predicted swcs did not agree well with observed ones especially 15 cm directly below i e in the depth of 30 cm where swcs were overestimated and 5 cm directly above i e in the depth of 10 cm where swcs were underestimated this indicates that more downward water flow occurred during the experiment than predicted by the hydrus simulation when the applied inlet pressure head was 5 cm the preferential type flow may have occurred underneath the drilled holes of the emitter that enhanced downward water movement this type of flow clearly creates a non uniform asymmetrical wetted volume around the buried emitter which may not be an ideal situation for plant roots to uptake water sand is known to be susceptible to preferential flow or finger type flow when it is initially dry in places where preferential flow paths are formed the soil becomes strongly wettable increasing its ability to conduct water downward through these pathways dekker and ritsema 1994 it may therefore not be a good idea to apply a high inlet pressure when a ring shaped emitter is installed in an initially dry sandy soil profile fig 9 shows the spatial extent of the simulated wetted areas around the buried emitter in the axisymmetrical three dimensional domain after 1 5 10 15 20 and 24 h using the optimized soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 3 for each soil the wetted area i e the wetted volume was larger when the inlet pressure head was higher the higher water content around the emitter may cause positive pressure heads building up around the outlets of the emitter that can eventually lead to a decrease in the emitter discharge rate as expected while in silt the wetted area expanded radially with time during the water application i e during the first 10 h downward water movement clearly outpaced lateral or upward movement in the sand profile these results can again be explained by the differences in the soil hydraulic characteristics especially the macroscopic capillary length λc of the two soils used this study clarified that hydrus is indeed a useful tool for analyzing soil water dynamics during the water application with the buried ring shaped emitter i e subsurface irrigation as also indicated by a number of other subsurface drip irrigation studies bufon et al 2012 lazarovitch et al 2007 kandelous et al 2012 el nesr et al 2014 ghazouani et al 2015 3 3 the effect of alternative emitter designs on soil water dynamics the effects of changing the ring covering method and reducing the number of holes on the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried ring shaped emitter were numerically investigated using hydrus the optimized soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 3 were used in this analysis root water uptake rwu was computed as an indirect quantitative proxy measure to evaluate the spatial extent of the wetted volume as described in section 2 4 five different emitter configurations were compared 5 f 5 p 4 p 3 p and 2 p fig 10 shows simulated cumulative discharges as a function of the elapsed time for different emitter designs computed over 24 h for initially dry silt and sand when 720 cm3 of water was applied for both soils as expected the duration needed to reach the same infiltration amount depended strongly on the number of holes as the number of holes decreased the duration increased although these simulation results show almost constant discharge rates regardless of the emitter design it has to be mentioned that the emitter discharge rate during subsurface irrigation cannot be kept constant in practice unless a compensated emitter is used fig 11 shows simulated uncompensated top and compensated bottom cumulative root water uptake rwu of tomato over 24 h in the silt left and sand right profiles for different ring shaped emitters fig 12 summarizes the results shown in fig 11 for tomato as well as for strawberry which were not shown in fig 11 using the water use efficiency wue which can be computed as the ratio of cumulative rwu to cumulative irrigation at 24 h uncompensated rwu was used as an indirect quantitative proxy measure of the non uniformity in the wetted volume around the buried emitter compensated rwu was then computed to investigate whether such non uniformity has any effect on actual plant rwu although uncompensated cumulative rwu in silt increased more slowly when the number of holes was reduced cumulative uncompensated rwu was almost the same at the end of the simulation for all emitter designs fig 11a even though the wetted volume expanded more slowly with the smaller discharge rate in silt when the number of holes was smaller uncompensated rwu eventually caught up with those for more holes as the wetted volume evolved radially in all directions as can also be seen in fig 9 as for sand the initial trend is basically the same as for silt the higher the number of holes the higher uncompensated rwu however uncompensated rwu computed for the 3 p or 2 p emitters in sand unlike in silt could not catch up with those for 5 f 5 p or 4 p after the water application was stopped it was also observed that the 5 f emitter had slightly smaller cumulative rwu after 24 h compared to emitters that were partially covered i e 5 p and 4 p when a ring shaped emitter with only a small number of holes is used in the sand profile applied water tends to move downward rather than radially around the emitter as predicted numerically in the axisymmetrical three dimensional domain for sand fig 9b d these results are also summarized in fig 12 for both soils the wue decreased as the number of holes decreased cumulative rwu increased significantly in both soils when the compensated rwu model was used fig 11cd for silt while compensated rwu with a smaller number of holes was much smaller than that for the emitter with more holes at earlier time they were almost the same at the end of simulation this can be also seen in the computed wue for compensated rwu for silt for both model plants fig 12 as water was slowly discharged from the emitter with less holes rwu slowly increased this implies that reducing the number of holes does not affect the amount of water available for plant root uptake over 24 h in silt when the compensated rwu model was used for sand the general trend was the same as for the uncompensated rwu model except that cumulative compensated rwu was much larger the effect of preceding irrigations was then assessed for different emitter designs by computing compensated cumulative rwu over 21 days i e 504 h during which seven irrigation cycles were considered fig 13 cumulative compensated rwus after 21 days for different emitter designs were almost the same for silt on the other hand for sand cumulative compensated rwu is strongly affected by the emitter design for 5 f unlike the 24 hour simulation case shown in fig 11 cumulative rwu starts being reduced after 8 days while cumulative rwus computed for the emitters with fewer holes continuously increase at the end of the simulation simulated cumulative rwu for 3 p reaches the highest value and thus the highest wue among different evaluated designs for 5 f the water application rate was too high for plant roots to uptake as a result there was a significant amount of water lost to deep percolation for the emitters with fewer holes the water application rate was smaller and consequently that there was much less water lost to deep percolations even for sand in summary these simulation results confirm that the number of holes can be reduced to 2 or 3 regardless of the soil types considered in this study 4 summary and conclusions the experimental results showed that water moved radially around the emitter in silt while downward water movement was dominant in sand when water was applied using the buried ring shaped emitter the difference in the flow pattern can be attributed to the difference in the macroscopic capillary length of the soil which can be interpreted as a measure of the contribution of capillarity as opposed to gravity s effect on unsaturated water movement hydrus a model simulating variably saturated water flow in porous media was then calibrated using the experimental data collected from the experiments with the 1 cm inlet pressure head the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters were used to simulate changes in soil water contents swcs for the experiments with the 5 cm inlet pressure head while swcs were predicted well for silt swcs above the buried emitter were overestimated and those directly below the emitter were underestimated for sand although the fitted saturated hydraulic conductivity for sand was too small this result indicates that downward water movement was predominant suggesting the occurrence of preferential flow with the optimized soil hydraulic parameters hydrus was used to investigate the effects of alternative emitter designs on the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the buried emitter during the subsurface water application had the spatial distribution of the swc been non uniform some parts of the plant root system would have been stressed resulting in the reduction in root water uptake in this analysis plant root water uptake was therefore used as an indirect quantitative proxy measure to assess the non uniformity in the spatial extent of the wetted volume around the emitter two model plants tomato and strawberry were considered because of their contrasting root distributions both uncompensated and compensated rwu were then computed while the former was used to assess the non uniformity in the spatial extent of the wetted volume the latter was used to investigate whether such non uniformity had any effect on plant root water uptake in addition to the original 5 hole emitter that was fully covered by a permeable textile four separate emitter designs with a different number of holes were analyzed the new emitter proposed in this study was only partially covered by the textile around the holes to simplify the maintenance of the emitter numerical simulations with these alternative emitter designs showed that the lower number of holes did not significantly affect uncompensated rwu in silt however in sand cumulative uncompensated rwu decreased when the emitters with reduced number of holes were used in the initially dry soil suggesting non uniformity in the wetted volume the non uniformity in the wetted volume in silt for the emitter with fewer holes was not significantly different because water moved radially from the emitter diminishing the effect of the spatial hole configuration for sand on the other hand the non uniformity in the wetted volume was larger as indicated by uncompensated rwu such non uniformity in the wetted volume does not affect the long term performance of the ring shaped emitter with fewer holes even for sand because of the slow discharge rate simulated compensated rwu for both model plants revealed that reducing the number of holes in sand gradually increased rwu as slowly infiltrating water allowed plant roots to uptake water continuously this may not be beneficial when considering the diurnal water uptake pattern of plants when higher rwu occurs in daylight time these results show that regardless of the soil type reducing the number of holes and changing the covering method may result in a much better water use efficiency and easier maintenance overall this study demonstrates that hydrus is a useful tool for analyzing soil water dynamics around the buried ring shaped emitter during the subsurface water application acknowledgments this study was partially supported by jsps grant in aid scientific research program 17h03885 we would like to thank dr
