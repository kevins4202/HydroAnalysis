24870,the development of a unique index to represent the real diversity of a community is still a challenge the difficulties to find a single reliable diversity metric is mostly due to the fact that the indices allowing an estimation of the number of species actually present in a sample do not provide information on how species abundances are distributed within a community although some diversity measures attempted to weigh richness in relation to the total abundance the homogeneity evenness of individuals within species is not integrated into them the most common diversity indices have been summarized by hill in 1973 in a single equation and subsequently different indicators have been proposed to estimate the absolute and the effective number of species present in a study area in an attempt to find a unified treatment of all standard diversity indices and to compare the true diversity among community however the choice of one of the effective number of species indices depends on what aspects of diversity of the study sites the research aims to investigate and could bias the study and mislead the interpretation of the comparative results moreover effective hill numbers account for only the observed and not the expected i e the absolute diversity of the studied community to compare and interpret the effective number of species with one single metric and analyze the diversity data with techniques that do not depend on a traditional non parametric index we developed an absolute measure of diversity based on the effective number of species and derived from the hill numbers of order 0 1 and 2 we tested the new index against previously proposed absolute diversity estimators and the first three hill numbers taken alone we simulated the new index s behavior with different gradients of richness abundance and evenness and we finally empirically tested it on tree communities of three biomes boreal temperate and tropical forests of the united states and on a coral reef

chao jost 2015 more recently a novel group of indices has been developed to take into consideration the rare species which are less likely to be detected and included in the sampling chiarucci et al 2018 different indicators were also proposed to estimate i the absolute and ii the effective number of species present in a study area the absolute diversity indices are based on the mark release recapture mrr statistics like ratio to estimate the richness by adding a correction factor to the observed number of species chao 1987 differently the effective number of species is the number of equally abundant species needed to obtain the same mean proportional species abundance as that observed in the dataset of interest jost 2006 1 1 the absolute diversity indices one of the most reliable absolute diversity indices which considers the rarity of the species represented by one individual called singletons and two individuals doubletons is the chao1 developed by anne chao chao 1984 the chao2 is the same index applied to incidence based data chao1 estimates the absolute number of species in a sample based on the number of rare species as 2 s c h a o 1 s o b s n 1 2 2 n 2 where sobs is the number of species observed in the sample n1 the number of species represented by a single individual singletons and n2 those represented by two individuals doubletons in the bias corrected form

and n2 0 the main problem with this estimator is that it is strongly influenced by the sample size so it is important to ensure adequate sampling in order to not to underestimate the richness colwell coddington 1994 messina et al 2016 moreover the chao1 index provides the minimum of richness estimates and assume homogeneity among the samples this must be remembered as it would be inappropriate to use it to compare the estimated richness of sites that have a large difference in their specific composition magurran 2013 1 2 the effective number of species at the same time the benefits to derive effective number of species from the canonical shannon and simpson diversity indices have gained support jost 2006 this is because the true diversity of a community can also be considered the number of equally common species required to give a particular value of an index jost 2006 this approach has an intuitive interpretation in fact after the conversion into common units of standard diversity indices a meaningful comparison of different indices applied to the same area can be performed this makes possible a unified treatment of all standard diversity indices and to compare the true diversity among community assuming that all species are equally abundant the effective number of species can be derived from the following formulas 4 h 0 i 1 s p i 0 s 5 h 1 exp i 1 s p i ln p i ex p h 6 h 2 1 i 1 s p i 2 1 d where s is the number of species in the sample pi n n is the relative abundance i e the abundance of each species n in the sample divided by the total abundance of all species in the sample n h is shannon diversity index and d is simpson diversity index these effective number of species calculated from hill s α values is a continuum that ranges from the rarest α close to 0 to the dominant species α towards fig 1 however previous attempts to identify an ideal diversity measure have failed to find a unique index to represent the real diversity of a community and instead evidenced the need to report at least two measures whittaker 1972 stirling and wilsey 2001 morris et al 2014 the multiple effective diversity measures included in hill s continuum provides a more comprehensive understanding of how the shift in rare and abundant species drives biological communities morris et al 2014 the main benefit of using these diversity metrics as measures of the true or absolute diversity with respect to the closely related and more traditional indices s shannon and simpson is the simplified interpretation of results because units are always in effective number of species regardless of the position along the series jost 2006 moreover effective species numbers behave as expected when diversity is doubled or halved while the traditional indices of diversity do not jost 2006 therefore the choice of one of the effective number of species indices h0 h1 or h2 depends on what aspects of diversity of the study sites the research aims to investigate morris et al 2014 if the effects are expected to be more apparent in rare species or traits then h0 would be appropriate however if dominant species or traits are expected to be more important then h2 would be more relevant h1 could be used instead in situations where rare and abundant species or traits are expected to be equally important morris et al 2014 although converting shannon and simpson diversity indices into true diversities i e effective numbers of species gives them a set of common behaviors and properties leinster cobbold 2012 the choice of the most appropriate one could bias the study and mislead the interpretation of the comparative results moreover after conversion diversity is always measured in units of species number irrespective from which index has been used but it accounts for only the observed and not the expected or the absolute chao 1987 diversity of the studied community to compare and interpret the effective number of species with one single metric and analyze the diversity data with techniques that do not depend on a traditional nonlinear index we developed an absolute measure of diversity chao 1984 based on the effective number of species jost 2006 and derived from the hill numbers h of order 0 1 and 2 hill 1973 this index would constitute the first comparable measure which combines both the absolute richness and the evenness of a community related to the most used traditional indices such as s shannon and simpson in a unique simple and comprehensive numerical value that represents the absolute effective diversity hereafter aed of any biological community 2 the new absolute effective diversity aed index in the form of a chao like absolute diversity i e observed species less abundant more abundant our index is composed by the effective number of observed species h0 plus a proportion between the exponential of shannon index h1 and the inverse of simpson index h2 our new absolute diversity index built on the effective number of species of a community hereafter aed takes the following simple equation 7 a e d h 0 h 1 2 2 h 2 and is constructed in a form that sums up the effective richness h0 to a ratio of less dominant h1 and more dominant h2 effective species this new index is quite convenient since it encapsulates the information of both the three main hill numbers which well describes the diversity profile of a community in an absolute diversity measures i e chao like index which has been shown to be reliable and less affected by estimation errors than the three traditional diversity measures on which it is based taken alone magurran and mcgill 2011 cazzolla gatti and notarnicola 2018 as well as for the chao1 index the aed variance standard error s e can be calculated as 8 s e a e d h 2 1 2 h 1 h 2 2 h 1 h 2 3 1 4 h 1 h 2 4 n for h1 0 and h2 0 and n total number of samples our measure encapsulates the observed richness and the estimated missing diversity due to rare vs dominant species in a single metric in fact even though dominant species have a greater effect on observed geographical patterns of diversity than do rare ones vazquez and gaston 2004 the typically larger numbers of rare species gaston 1994 magurran henderson 2003 the positive correlations between the numbers of rare species and the overall numbers of species in an area gaston and blackburn 2000 cazzolla gatti et al 2017 and the evidence of nested species distributions wright et al 1998 emphasized the importance of rare species in biodiversity studies and as one of the main targets for conservation purvis and hector 2000 lennon et al 2004 gatti et al 2018 cazzolla gatti and notarnicola 2018 from a biological perspective keylock 2005 if a study is especially concerned with the dominant species it is better to use higher order measures the higher the order the more the measure emphasizes the commonest species as depicted in fig 1 when the rarest elements of a sample are as important as the commonest elements the diversity of order zero h0 species richness is analogous of the species observed in the sample sobs in chao s formula eq 2 along the continuum range of hill s measures fig 1 diversity of order one h1 the exponential of the shannon entropy is the first index that accounts for more rare species analogous to singletons in chao s formula and diversity of order two h2 inverse of simpson accounts for the second group of rare species analogous to doubletons in chao s formula higher order diversities h3 h4 exist but are seldom used and also not considered in chao s estimators and similar formulas such as jackknife because the relationship between the first two order rarities singletons h1 and doubletons h2 already proved to be a reliable measure of missing species from a sample jost 2006 clearly mentioned that the three indexes of diversity of order zero species richness one exponential of shannon wiener index and two inverse of simpson index provides more information about the samples than any single measure and it is advisable to give all three in any study of a single community so to judge the degree of dominance in the community by looking at the drops between each one besides confirming jost 2006 s statement on the fact that showing a continuous range of diversities fig 1 and presents a graph of the results as done by hill 1973 is even a better approach because this gives a clearer graphical picture of the degree of dominance in the community we have formulated an index capable to include all the main three diversity measures in a way a chao like index that allows not only a calculation of the effective diversity invoked by jost 2006 but also of the absolute diversity of a community in a single universal metric 3 aed ecological properties the aed index better accounts for the effective richness in a community than traditional indices shannon and simpson inverse and fits more with the shape of the effective richness curve while accounting for the missing species positioning therefore upper fig 2 the aed index keeps the linearity of the effective number of species h0 h1 h2 while accounting for the missing species supplementary fig 1 and shows a higher slope m 1 5 aed which is a more comprehensive measure compared to the other indices that merges the information of richness to the information of evenness and also accounts for rare species seems capable to estimate the absolute number of species in a community with a lower amount of input data in this case richness we also analyzed the behavior supplementary fig 2 of the three main effective number of species indices h0 h1 and h2 and the newly proposed absolute effective diversity aed index when plotted on an incremental evenness from 0 to 1 calculated as the mean between shannon and simpson evenness indexes keeping the species richness h0 constant at 100 the opposite situation of fig 2 then we simulated a system with number of species overall abundance and species evenness kept constant but with varying the relative abundance of species supplementary fig 3 the aed index does not show any specific trend and this confirms that it is independent of the relative abundances of species i e there is no bias towards specific rare or dominant species moreover we assessed statistically the absence of any trend in fact we evaluated the significance of a linear model y ax b describing the aed behavior and found that a 0 and b 100 within a 95 confidence interval we also tested the case of changes in the overall abundance with number of species kept constant and evenness tending to 1 we simulated a variation of the overall abundance from s to 250 individuals supplementary fig 4 as with s species the overall abundance should at least be equals to s this simulation shows that when the overall abundance a is different among the different communities or within the same community during the time with s constant the aed index does not show significant variations i e it is not influenced by the sample size finally we compared the new aed index to previously proposed absolute diversity estimators such as the chao1 bootstrap jackknife of first and second order and michaelis menten indices as defined in magurran and mcgill 2011 and magurran 2013 fig 3 the aed index shows a performance in line with the other indices a reduced variability lower and upper quartiles closer to the median and a lower number of outliers less over and under estimations moreover between 60 70 of sample coverage the aed is already able to estimate the absolute number of species in a community where other metrics in particular the chao 1 and bootstrapping which performs better than jackknife and mm both according to our simulation and the literature need a sample coverage of 80 90 to provide reliable estimates 4 two empirical tests for the aed index after simulating the aed index s behavior with different conditions of s a and e and in a comparison with other estimators we tested on empirical data the reliability of the new metric in comparing the estimated richness of sites that have a large difference in their specific composition first we estimate the absolute effective tree diversity of three biomes boreal temperate and tropical forests of the united states from data included in the forest inventory and analysis fia program of the u s forest service https www fia fs fed us tree data in the fia database are collected in plots with a 7 32 m radius and d b h 12 7 cm 5 inches initially to check if the new index was able to differentiate the three biomes on the basis of their absolute effective diversity we calculated the traditional diversity indices their effective version and the aed index from a small comparable sample size 53 55 randomly chosen plots results table 1 and supplementary fig 5 indicate that aed well discriminates the diversity of the three us forest types and can estimate the expected difference in terms of absolute diversity which is higher in tropical forests 60 effective species intermediate in temperate forests 15 effective species and low in boreal forests 4 effective species secondly after confirming aed index s ability to discriminate communities and differences in their diversities even with a small sample size we tested its performance vs those of other common absolute richness metrics namely chao1 jackknife1 and 2 bootstrapping and michaelis menten in each of the three forest types for the whole large fia datasets fig 4 this allowed us to check whether the aed index was reliable in comparison with other estimators and to better understand its properties in estimating the absolute effective diversity of a community accumulation curves show that the aed index offers a good balance between under and over estimations and the ability to account for the real number of species with a lower sampling effort especially with respect to chao1 and jackknife 1 in particular in more diverse communities such as tropical and temperate forests the aed curves are placed between those higher of jackknife 2 and bootstrapping and those lower of chao1 and jackknife1 in temperate forests the aed index requires an extremely lower sampling effort than other indices in tropical forests the aed index is able to estimate the real diversity of the community with half of the sampling effort needed for the chao1 and a similar sampling effort needed for jackknife 1 and 2 indices whereas the bootstrapping requires a lower sampling effort but excessively overestimates the absolute diversity of the community significantly when the community has a low species richness and the sampling effort required to estimate the real diversity is lower as for the case of us boreal forests sobs 9 the aed gets this value after accumulating just 60 random plots compared to more than hundreds needed by the other indices as an additional test on a different ecosystem we estimate the absolute and effective coral community diversity of a reef at naval station guantánamo bay in southeastern cuba from a published dataset chiappone et al 2001 in this study 25 m transects were oriented perpendicular to shore on four haphazardly selected spurs and used to randomly select 1 1 m quadrat locations abundance data in terms of area coverage were collected per each species including octocorals stony corals turf algae coralline algae etc as above we tested aed performance vs those of other common absolute richness metrics namely chao1 jackknife1 and 2 bootstrapping and michaelis menten on this coral reef community fig 5 again in this test the aed index requires a low sampling effort 40 coverage to estimate the absolute diversity if the community consistently the aed index shows higher accuracy than other indices in the estimation with a lower variability around the mean and no extremely over and under estimations outliers 5 aed vs other effective metrics the aed completely controls community structure and avoid biases related to varying sample sizes however because it is well known that relationships between diversity indices do not always follow mathematically predicted patterns stirling and wilsey 2001 nagendra 2002 we also performed some analyses on real data to ensure that our conclusions would be empirically valid from our simulations and empirical tests we observed that aed is always above the h0 curve and this reflects its purpose to account for additional rare species not included in the observed species of the sampled community both h1 and h2 values are below h0 and this is due to the fact that the effective number of species calculated from the shannon and simpson diversity indices is always lower than h0 fig 1 because they give more weight to abundant and dominant species h1 and h2 curves tend to h0 at about 0 6 and 0 9 supplementary fig 2 respectively as expected by their placement along with the continuum range shown in fig 1 h1 and h2 always show lower values of effective number of species than h0 at low evenness particularly when e 0 6 and in this way they could be highly biased and underestimate the contribution of the missing effective species to the true diversity of a community the aed curve takes the shape along an incremental evenness from 0 to 1 of a normal distribution which would well represent the normal distribution of all species in a community connolly et al 2005 dornelas et al 2006 matthews whittaker 2015 this curve reaches its maximum value at an intermediate evenness level 0 5 reasonably because at this evenness both rare and dominant species are almost equally represented and the aed index accounts for a higher number of missing effective rare species from the sample the aed curve is instead closer to h0 species richness both at very low 0 and very high 1 evenness and this confirms its robustness in fact because our aim was to account for the missing effective species in a sample when the evenness tends to 1 it means that all species are equally abundant or equally rare and therefore there are not many missing effective rare species to add to the effective species richness h0 similarly when the evenness tends to 0 the dominance increases and the number of missing effective rare species would not add much to the diversity of the sample calculated as h0 finally comparing the aed index with the chao1 estimator from which it takes the form they shows similar performances with at least three main advantages for aed its accuracy is much higher a very low variability around the mean it shows no extreme over and under estimations no far outliers and it is able to estimate both the effective and absolute diversity of a community from just the three main diversity indices s shannon and simpson without the need to account for singletons and doubletons in fact the information on s shannon and simpson indices is almost always available in the literature and can be used to produce estimates from previously published study and it is always quantifiable from abundance based datasets whereas the number of singletons and doubletons may not be present in published data and in actual samples it is common the case when either singletons or doubletons or both are 0 making the estimation of the absolute species richness from the chao1 index impossible 6 conclusion the indexes of the effective number of species h0 h1 and h2 perform well only when the evenness of a sampled community is close to 1 i e all species are almost equally abundant or rare however when the evenness is lower than 1 and between 0 and 0 6 which is the case of many real natural communities see the index performance on real ecosystems table 1 and figs 4 and 5 the new aed index is better able to account for the missing effective species that contribute to the diversity of the community furthermore aed represents a reliable estimator of the true diversity of a community since it is based on hill numbers which also take into account the evenness and not just an estimator of species richness finally we believe that the main strength of this index is that it can be used to simply compare the true diversity of communities ecosystems and biomes worldwide with unitless effective and absolute values credit authorship contribution statement roberto cazzolla gatti

accounts for only the observed and not the expected or the absolute chao 1987 diversity of the studied community to compare and interpret the effective number of species with one single metric and analyze the diversity data with techniques that do not depend on a traditional nonlinear index we developed an absolute measure of diversity chao 1984 based on the effective number of species jost 2006 and derived from the hill numbers h of order 0 1 and 2 hill 1973 this index would constitute the first comparable measure which combines both the absolute richness and the evenness of a community related to the most used traditional indices such as s shannon and simpson in a unique simple and comprehensive numerical value that represents the absolute effective diversity hereafter aed of any biological community 2 the new absolute effective diversity aed index in the form of a chao like absolute diversity i e observed species less abundant more abundant our index is composed by the effective number of observed species h0 plus a proportion between the exponential of shannon index h1 and the inverse of simpson index h2 our new absolute diversity index built on the effective number of species of a community hereafter aed takes the following simple equation 7 a e d h 0 h 1 2 2 h 2 and is constructed in a form that sums up the effective richness h0 to a ratio of less dominant h1 and more dominant h2 effective species this new index is quite convenient since it encapsulates the information of both the three main hill numbers which well describes the diversity profile of a community in an absolute diversity measures i e chao like index which has been shown to be reliable and less affected by estimation errors than the three traditional diversity measures on which it is based taken alone magurran and mcgill 2011 cazzolla gatti and notarnicola 2018 as well as for the chao1 index the aed variance standard error s e can be calculated as 8 s e a e d h 2 1 2 h 1 h 2 2 h 1 h 2 3 1 4 h 1 h 2 4 n for h1 0 and h2 0 and n total number of samples our measure encapsulates the observed richness and the estimated missing diversity due to rare vs dominant species in a single metric in fact even though dominant species have a greater effect on observed geographical patterns of diversity than do rare ones vazquez and gaston 2004 the typically larger numbers of rare species gaston 1994 magurran henderson 2003 the positive correlations between the numbers of rare species and the overall numbers of species in an area gaston and blackburn 2000 cazzolla gatti et al 2017 and the evidence of nested species distributions wright et al 1998 emphasized the importance of rare species in biodiversity studies and as one of the main targets for conservation purvis and hector 2000 lennon et al 2004 gatti et al 2018 cazzolla gatti and notarnicola 2018 from a biological perspective keylock 2005 if a study is especially concerned with the dominant species it is better to use higher order measures the higher the order the more the measure emphasizes the commonest species as depicted in fig 1 when the rarest elements of a sample are as important as the commonest elements the diversity of order zero h0 species richness is analogous of the species observed in the sample sobs in chao s formula eq 2 along the continuum range of hill s measures fig 1 diversity of order one h1 the exponential of the shannon entropy is the first index that accounts for more rare species analogous to singletons in chao s formula and diversity of order two h2 inverse of simpson accounts for the second group of rare species analogous to doubletons in chao s formula higher order diversities h3 h4 exist but are seldom used and also not considered in chao s estimators and similar formulas such as jackknife because the relationship between the first two order rarities singletons h1 and doubletons h2 already proved to be a reliable measure of missing species from a sample jost 2006 clearly mentioned that the three indexes of diversity of order zero species richness one exponential of shannon wiener index and two inverse of simpson index provides more information about the samples than any single measure and it is advisable to give all three in any study of a single community so to judge the degree of dominance in the community by looking at the drops between each one besides confirming jost 2006 s statement on the fact that showing a continuous range of diversities fig 1 and presents a graph of the results as done by hill 1973 is even a better approach because this gives a clearer graphical picture of the degree of dominance in the community we have formulated an index capable to include all the main three diversity measures in a way a chao like index that allows not only a calculation of the effective diversity invoked by jost 2006 but also of the absolute diversity of a community in a single universal metric 3 aed ecological properties the aed index better accounts for the effective richness in a community than traditional indices shannon and simpson inverse and fits more with the shape of the effective richness curve while accounting for the missing species positioning therefore upper fig 2 the aed index keeps the linearity of the effective number of species h0 h1 h2 while accounting for the missing species supplementary fig 1 and shows a higher slope m 1 5 aed which is a more comprehensive measure compared to the other indices that merges the information of richness to the information of evenness and also accounts for rare species seems capable to estimate the absolute number of species in a community with a lower amount of input data in this case richness we also analyzed the behavior supplementary fig 2 of the three main effective number of species indices h0 h1 and h2 and the newly proposed absolute effective diversity aed index when plotted on an incremental evenness from 0 to 1 calculated as the mean between shannon and simpson evenness indexes keeping the species richness h0 constant at 100 the opposite situation of fig 2 then we simulated a system with number of species overall abundance and species evenness kept constant but with varying the relative abundance of species supplementary fig 3 the aed index does not show any specific trend and this confirms that it is independent of the relative abundances of species i e there is no bias towards specific rare or dominant species moreover we assessed statistically the absence of any trend in fact we evaluated the significance of a linear model y ax b describing the aed behavior and found that a 0 and b 100 within a 95 confidence interval we also tested the case of changes in the overall abundance with number of species kept constant and evenness tending to 1 we simulated a variation of the overall abundance from s to 250 individuals supplementary fig 4 as with s species the overall abundance should at least be equals to s this simulation shows that when the overall abundance a is different among the different communities or within the same community during the time with s constant the aed index does not show significant variations i e it is not influenced by the sample size finally we compared the new aed index to previously proposed absolute diversity estimators such as the chao1 bootstrap jackknife of first and second order and michaelis menten indices as defined in magurran and mcgill 2011 and magurran 2013 fig 3 the aed index shows a performance in line with the other indices a reduced variability lower and upper quartiles closer to the median and a lower number of outliers less over and under estimations moreover between 60 70 of sample coverage the aed is already able to estimate the absolute number of species in a community where other metrics in particular the chao 1 and bootstrapping which performs better than jackknife and mm both according to our simulation and the literature need a sample coverage of 80 90 to provide reliable estimates 4 two empirical tests for the aed index after simulating the aed index s behavior with different conditions of s a and e and in a comparison with other estimators we tested on empirical data the reliability of the new metric in comparing the estimated richness of sites that have a large difference in their specific composition first we estimate the absolute effective tree diversity of three biomes boreal temperate and tropical forests of the united states from data included in the forest inventory and analysis fia program of the u s forest service https www fia fs fed us tree data in the fia database are collected in plots with a 7 32 m radius and d b h 12 7 cm 5 inches initially to check if the new index was able to differentiate the three biomes on the basis of their absolute effective diversity we calculated the traditional diversity indices their effective version and the aed index from a small comparable sample size 53 55 randomly chosen plots results table 1 and supplementary fig 5 indicate that aed well discriminates the diversity of the three us forest types and can estimate the expected difference in terms of absolute diversity which is higher in tropical forests 60 effective species intermediate in temperate forests 15 effective species and low in boreal forests 4 effective species secondly after confirming aed index s ability to discriminate communities and differences in their diversities even with a small sample size we tested its performance vs those of other common absolute richness metrics namely chao1 jackknife1 and 2 bootstrapping and michaelis menten in each of the three forest types for the whole large fia datasets fig 4 this allowed us to check whether the aed index was reliable in comparison with other estimators and to better understand its properties in estimating the absolute effective diversity of a community accumulation curves show that the aed index offers a good balance between under and over estimations and the ability to account for the real number of species with a lower sampling effort especially with respect to chao1 and jackknife 1 in particular in more diverse communities such as tropical and temperate forests the aed curves are placed between those higher of jackknife 2 and bootstrapping and those lower of chao1 and jackknife1 in temperate forests the aed index requires an extremely lower sampling effort than other indices in tropical forests the aed index is able to estimate the real diversity of the community with half of the sampling effort needed for the chao1 and a similar sampling effort needed for jackknife 1 and 2 indices whereas the bootstrapping requires a lower sampling effort but excessively overestimates the absolute diversity of the community significantly when the community has a low species richness and the sampling effort required to estimate the real diversity is lower as for the case of us boreal forests sobs 9 the aed gets this value after accumulating just 60 random plots compared to more than hundreds needed by the other indices as an additional test on a different ecosystem we estimate the absolute and effective coral community diversity of a reef at naval station guantánamo bay in southeastern cuba from a published dataset chiappone et al 2001 in this study 25 m transects were oriented perpendicular to shore on four haphazardly selected spurs and used to randomly select 1 1 m quadrat locations abundance data in terms of area coverage were collected per each species including octocorals stony corals turf algae coralline algae etc as above we tested aed performance vs those of other common absolute richness metrics namely chao1 jackknife1 and 2 bootstrapping and michaelis menten on this coral reef community fig 5 again in this test the aed index requires a low sampling effort 40 coverage to estimate the absolute diversity if the community consistently the aed index shows higher accuracy than other indices in the estimation with a lower variability around the mean and no extremely over and under estimations outliers 5 aed vs other effective metrics the aed completely controls community structure and avoid biases related to varying sample sizes however because it is well known that relationships between diversity indices do not always follow mathematically predicted patterns stirling and wilsey 2001 nagendra 2002 we also performed some analyses on real data to ensure that our conclusions would be empirically valid from our simulations and empirical tests we observed that aed is always above the h0 curve and this reflects its purpose to account for additional rare species not included in the observed species of the sampled community both h1 and h2 values are below h0 and this is due to the fact that the effective number of species calculated from the shannon and simpson diversity indices is always lower than h0 fig 1 because they give more weight to abundant and dominant species h1 and h2 curves tend to h0 at about 0 6 and 0 9 supplementary fig 2 respectively as expected by their placement along with the continuum range shown in fig 1 h1 and h2 always show lower values of effective number of species than h0 at low evenness particularly when e 0 6 and in this way they could be highly biased and underestimate the contribution of the missing effective species to the true diversity of a community the aed curve takes the shape along an incremental evenness from 0 to 1 of a normal distribution which would well represent the normal distribution of all species in a community connolly et al 2005 dornelas et al 2006 matthews whittaker 2015 this curve reaches its maximum value at an intermediate evenness level 0 5 reasonably because at this evenness both rare and dominant species are almost equally represented and the aed index accounts for a higher number of missing effective rare species from the sample the aed curve is instead closer to h0 species richness both at very low 0 and very high 1 evenness and this confirms its robustness in fact because our aim was to account for the missing effective species in a sample when the evenness tends to 1 it means that all species are equally abundant or equally rare and therefore there are not many missing effective rare species to add to the effective species richness h0 similarly when the evenness tends to 0 the dominance increases and the number of missing effective rare species would not add much to the diversity of the sample calculated as h0 finally comparing the aed index with the chao1 estimator from which it takes the form they shows similar performances with at least three main advantages for aed its accuracy is much higher a very low variability around the mean it shows no extreme over and under estimations no far outliers and it is able to estimate both the effective and absolute diversity of a community from just the three main diversity indices s shannon and simpson without the need to account for singletons and doubletons in fact the information on s shannon and simpson indices is almost always available in the literature and can be used to produce estimates from previously published study and it is always quantifiable from abundance based datasets whereas the number of singletons and doubletons may not be present in published data and in actual samples it is common the case when either singletons or doubletons or both are 0 making the estimation of the absolute species richness from the chao1 index impossible 6 conclusion the indexes of the effective number of species h0 h1 and h2 perform well only when the evenness of a sampled community is close to 1 i e all species are almost equally abundant or rare however when the evenness is lower than 1 and between 0 and 0 6 which is the case of many real natural communities see the index performance on real ecosystems table 1 and figs 4 and 5 the new aed index is better able to account for the missing effective species that contribute to the diversity of the community furthermore aed represents a reliable estimator of the true diversity of a community since it is based on hill numbers which also take into account the evenness and not just an estimator of species richness finally we believe that the main strength of this index is that it can be used to simply compare the true diversity of communities ecosystems and biomes worldwide with unitless effective and absolute values credit authorship contribution statement roberto cazzolla gatti

24871,healthy resilient and diverse marine ecosystems are capable of generating the biotic and abiotic components of natural capital stocks interacting and providing a bundle of ecosystem services vital to human well being increasing pressures and impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems cause habitat degradation and biodiversity loss and as a consequence seriously affect their capacity to provide benefits to humans integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socioeconomic aspects are much needed to protect natural capital stocks and ensure the delivery of ecosystem services in this context marine protected areas mpas are important tools for conserving biodiversity while promoting sustainable human activities in this study an interdisciplinary approach to the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems was adopted in particular the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods were jointly used to account for the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the mediterranean mpa punta campanella located in southern italy the assessment focused on four main macro habitats sciaphilic hard bottom coralligenous bioconstructions photophilic hard bottom soft bottom and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds the habitat posidonia oceanica seagrass beds showed the highest value of eco exergy density 3 58 106 kj m 2 while the highest value of emergy density resulted for the sciaphilic hard bottom habitat 4 94 1012 sej m 2 the high eco exergy value of posidonia oceanica seagrass beds habitat is mainly due to the complex evolutionary history and high biomass density of the posidonia oceanica seagrass on the other hand the high emergy value calculated for the sciaphilic hard bottom habitat reflects the high convergence of natural input flows for the generation of its biomass stocks and high biodiversity in addition to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective the emergy values of natural capital stocks were also converted into monetary units the total value of natural capital stocks in the mpa resulted about 12 m furthermore a set of ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions was identified and their economic value was estimated 3 05 m and 0 62 m respectively finally the value of natural capital and ecosystem services was also estimated by using a 3d bionomic map to consider the presence of coralligenous bioconstructions and other habitats on cliffs characterizing the investigated mpa this study highlighted the importance of posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions in terms of both natural capital stocks and delivery of ecosystem services confirming the need for their protection and conservation in marine and coastal management the biophysical and economic values of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services together with their spatial distribution in the mpa can support local managers and policy makers in implementing and developing nature conservation strategies while ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources keywords marine protected areas emergy eco exergy

representing the basis for the generation of ecosystem services cardinale et al 2012 franzese et al 2018a teixeira et al 2019 vihervaara et al 2019 marine ecosystems are heavily exploited throughout the world the coastal zones represent only about 4 of the earth s total land area yet they contain more than one third of the world s population and account for about 90 of the catches from marine fisheries barbier 2017 the multiple pressures and impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems are increasing globally franzese et al 2018b halpern et al 2015 pauna et al 2019 the major drivers of

benefits to humans halpern et al 2008 haines young and potschin 2010 therefore integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socioeconomic aspects are much needed to protect natural capital stocks and ensure the delivery of ecosystem services through the sustainable exploitation of marine resources franzese et al 2008 2019 picone et al 2017 marine protected areas mpas are recognized worldwide as important tool for mitigating human impacts on marine ecosystems conserving biodiversity while promoting sustainable human activities zupan et al 2018 mpas play a crucial role in the mediterranean area where coastal tourism is one of the main economic sector and employment producer while tourism is crucial for the economic development of the mediterranean region its increasing growth can generate several environmental pressures on the coastal zones cumulating with other impacts generated by local populations drius et al 2019 in light of this in the mediterranean context mpas are essential to protect marine ecosystems while allowing sustainable coastal tourism and local economic activities the biophysical and economic assessments of the value of natural capital and ecosystem services are much needed for achieving nature conservation goals while ensuring the sustainable exploitation of marine resources in fact they are crucial to convey the importance of natural resources to managers and policy makers supporting the development and implementation of policies and strategies oriented to natural capital conservation and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services börger et al 2014 maes et al 2016 environmental accounting is a useful tool to assess the biophysical and economic value of natural capital and ecosystem services in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems häyhä et al 2015 mellino et al 2015 nikodinoska et al 2018 caro et al 2018 in particular environmental accounting allows the assessment of multiple aspects dealing with marine ecosystems among which the environmental costs sustained for the generation and maintenance of natural capital stocks and ecosystems function the received benefits i e the ecosystem services and the impacts generated by human activities for the exploitation of marine resources franzese et al 2015 häyhä and franzese 2014 the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystem is more challenging compared to terrestrial ecosystems townsend et al 2018 in fact the dynamics and complexity of marine ecosystems the high connectivity among marine habitats the dispersal of species and the widespread spatial distribution of the ecological processes make the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services demanding and time and resource consuming manea et al 2019 in spite of this over the past decades there has been an increasing research effort to assess the value of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems and to incorporate these values into marine planning and decision making börger et al 2014 buonocore et al 2018 christie et al 2015 geange et al 2019 franzese et al 2015 pauna et al 2018 among the environmental accounting methods the emergy accounting method odum 1988 1996 has been recently used to assess the value of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems in terms of environmental support needed for their generation berrios et al 2017 franzese et al 2017 paoli et al 2018 picone et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 the eco exergy method jørgensen and mejer 1979 has been also suggested to assess the value of natural capital in terms of chemical energy stored in organic matter and genetic information embodied in living organisms mandal et al 2012 vihervaara et al 2019 previous studies suggested the parallel application of the emergy and eco exergy methods for the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services buonocore et al 2019 coscieme et al 2013 ulgiati et al 2011 1 2 goal of the study in this study an interdisciplinary approach to the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems was adopted in particular the study aimed at assessing the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the mediterranean marine protected area mpa punta campanella located in southern italy through the parallel use of the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods the assessment focused on four main macro habitats sciaphilic hard bottom coralligenous bioconstructions photophilic hard bottom soft bottom and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds in addition to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective the emergy values of natural capital stocks were also converted into monetary units the study also aimed at identifying a set of ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions and estimating their economic value 2 materials and methods 2 1 the area of study punta campanella is a mpa located in the sorrento peninsula of the gulf of naples southern italy it was established in 1997 by the italian ministry of the environment the mpa covers a total area of about 1500 hectares with a coastline of about 40 km the gulf of naples is characterized by peculiar orographic features influencing wind and sea dynamics in particular the vesuvius volcano and the hills system of the city of naples can shelter north easterly winds blowing over the basin mostly in winter creating jet currents responsible for coastal water exchanges cianelli et al 2012 these water exchanges provide a continuous supply of clean and deep water rich in nutrients supporting primary production and its transfer to higher trophic levels appolloni et al 2018a the mpa is also characterized by a very peculiar geomorphological configuration due to the calcareous nature of the sorrento peninsula the area has been subject to intense karst phenomena that have generated several emerged and submerged cavities cinque 2017 more than 50 caves are included within the mpa they are particular environments whose chemical physical parameters strongly affect the composition of the ecological communities the caves mainly host sciaphilic assemblages including rare species such as the sea anemone halcampoides purpureus studer 1879 recorded in the iucn red list of mediterranean anthozoa otero et al 2017 the submerged overhanging walls and carbonate pinnacles allow the presence of pre coralligenous formation at a depth of a few metres while rich biocenoses of coralligenous banks occur at a depth of about 55 metres ferrigno et al 2016 2017 noteworthy is the presence of the endemic mediterranean seagrass posidonia oceanica whose biocenosis covers about 10 of the mpa total area the high biodiversity together with the peculiar geomorphological configuration and mild mediterranean climate makes the mpa an attractive site for many touristic activities such as swimming boating and diving like all the italian mpas punta campanella mpa is characterized by three zones with different levels of protection and allowed human activities namely zone a zone b and zone c fig 1 covering about 12 43 and 45 of the total area respectively all the biocenosis included within the boundaries of the mpa were identified through the analysis of the bionomic map appolloni et al 2018b and clustered into the following four macro habitats 1 sciaphilic hard bottom shb coralligenous bioconstructions 2 photophilic hard bottom phb 3 soft bottom sb and 4 posidonia oceanica seagrass beds psb fig 2 2 2 the environmental accounting model this study provides a biophysical and economic assessment of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services flows of punta campanella mpa the conceptual diagram in fig 3 summarizes the main steps of the implemented environmental accounting model all steps are described in details in the following paragraphs 2 2 1 sampling procedures and data analysis ad hoc sampling campaigns were performed in spring 2018 to collect data on macrobenthic communities and necto benthic fishes in the four investigated macro habitats samplings of macrobenthic organisms were performed through the air lift scraping air lift technique chemello and russo 1997 and randomly replicated three times in each habitat using different frames buonocore et al 2019 after sorting species were identified and clustered in the following main taxonomic groups algae annelida ascidiacea bryozoa cnidaria crustacea demospongiae echinodermata and mollusca the dry biomass of the different macrobenthic groups was assessed by using a drying oven and then converted to grams of ash free dry weight afdw and grams of carbon gc through appropriate conversion factors brey 2016 the biomass of necto benthic fishes was assessed based on visual census transects harmelin vivien et al 1985 randomly performed on the investigated macro habitats buonocore et al 2019 average biomass data on the groups epiphytes microphytobenthos phytoplancton and posidonia were estimated from literature boudouresque et al 2006 charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 the matrix of the biomass density calculated for the different taxonomic groups and the four macro habitats was the basis for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy natural capital assessment 2 2 2 the eco exergy accounting method the eco exergy method accounts for the chemical energy in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in living organisms providing a measure of the organizational level and complexity of an ecosystem jørgensen and mejer 1979 eco exergy for living organisms is calculated according to the following equation eco exergy β b f where β is a weighting factor expressing the information content of the organism s genes b is the organism s biomass and f is the average value of work energy per unit of biomass jørgensen 2015 the total eco exergy of an ecosystem is calculated as the sum of the eco exergy values of all the organisms present in that ecosystem in this study the eco exergy value of natural capital stocks in the investigated macro habitats was calculated the biomass values of the different taxonomic groups were multiplied by their specific ß values and then summed to obtain the total eco exergy value of each macro habitat more details on the accounting procedures can be found in buonocore et al 2019 2 2 3 the emergy accounting method the emergy accounting method odum 1988 1996 aims at evaluating the cumulative environmental support to a system on the global scale of the biosphere taking into account free environmental inputs human driven material and energy flows and the indirect environmental support embodied in human labor and services brown and ulgiati 2004 brown et al 2016a 2016b franzese et al 2009 2014 according to this method inputs are accounted for in terms of their solar emergy defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly used to make a given product or support a given flow and measured in sej solar emergy joules the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 all inputs to an investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to calculate the total emergy support in this study the emergy accounting method was used to assess the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the investigated mpa according to the biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model described in vassallo et al 2017 and buonocore et al 2019 in addition the biophysical values of natural capital were converted into equivalent monetary units by using the emergy to money ratio emr indicator lou and ulgiati 2013 tian et al 2017 in particular in this study the emr of 9 60 1011 sej 1 calculated for italy pereira et al 2013 was used the equivalent monetary value of natural capital for each macro habitat was calculated dividing the emergy value by the emr 2 2 4 emergy and eco exergy indicators a set of emergy and eco exergy indicators was calculated for the four investigated habitats in particular the total emergy value of each habitat was calculated to account for the emergy flows that supported the generation of its natural capital stocks since this indicator is an extensive measure depending on the area of the investigated habitats the emergy density values were also calculated to account for the emergy flows concentrated per unit area these values represent an intensive measure of the emergy support to each habitat similarly the total eco exergy value of each habitat was calculated as an extensive measure of chemical energy and genetic information embodied in its living organisms in addition the eco exergy density was calculated to account for the eco exergy flows concentrated per unit area finally the emergy ecoexergy ratio was calculated for all the investigated habitats this indicator represents the amount of emergy flows required to generate a unit of organization and reflects the efficiency of an ecosystem in building its complexity bastianoni and marchettini 1997 the emergy ecoexergy ratio was calculated dividing the emergy density value by the eco exergy density value calculated for each habitat 2 2 5 ecosystem services assessment the assessment of the ecosystem services generated by the mpa of punta campanella was focused on two main habitats posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions posidonia oceanica plays a crucial ecological role in the mediterranean marine ecosystem and provides several valuable ecosystem services campagne et al 2015 its presence implies a unique enrichment of species enhancing the biodiversity of coastal waters the meadows are nursery and foraging areas for several fish and shellfish species and improve water quality by reducing particle loads in the water and absorbing dissolved nutrients hemminga and duarte 2000 posidonia oceanica also develops a web of roots stabilizing sediments and provides protection against coastal erosion in addition the seagrass beds play a significant role in nutrient cycling and in carbon fixation and storage pergent et al 2012 in this study the following ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds were evaluated raw materials provision food provision carbon sequestration nursery and nutrient cycling coralligenous habitats are very complex marine habitats and together with posidonia oceanica seagrass beds are considered as the most important mediterranean marine ecosystems giakoumi et al 2013 coralligenous habitats are hotspot of biodiversity and provide a large set of ecosystem services ballesteros 2006 among them the regulating service of carbon sequestration by coralligenous bioconstructions is controversial chisholm and barnes 1998 lønborg et al 2019 in fact the sequestering of carbon in the precipitation of calcium carbonate is accompanied by release of co2 for this reason coralligenous bioconstructions can be considered as sink of carbon and source of carbon dioxide ware et al 1991 since the role of coralligenous bioconstructions in global carbon cycles needs to be further investigated the carbon sequestration service provided by the coralligenous habitat was not evaluated in this study the following ecosystem services generated by coralligenous bioconstructions were estimated raw materials provision food provision nursery and recreation the teeb valuation database https www es partnership org services data knowledge sharing ecosystem service valuation database was used to estimate the economic values per unit area of the ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions table 1 these values were then multiplied by the area covered by the two habitats in the mpa to provide an economic estimation of the ecosystem services generated at mpa scale the total area covered by coralligenous bioconstructions and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds was calculated from the bionomic map of the mpa that is two dimensional 2d yet a peculiarity of the investigated mpa is the high presence of coralligenous bioconstructions on cliffs not represented in the 2d bionomic map for this reason a three dimensional 3d bionomic map was developed by using the interpolate shape tool of the arcgis software version 10 1 and the digital elevation model as reference surface 3 results 3 1 natural capital assessment table 2 shows the main taxonomic groups identified in the four habitats of the investigated mpa and relative biomass density expressed in grams of afdw per unit area these biomass values represent the basic information for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy accounting table 3 shows the eco exergy value of the main autotrophic groups the psb habitat showed the highest values of eco exergy density 3 51 106 kj m 2 and total eco exergy 5 03 1012 kj table 4 shows the eco exergy value of the main heterotrophic groups in this case the shb habitat showed the highest values of eco exergy density 6 03 105 kj m 2 and total eco exergy 8 29 1011 kj table 5 shows the emergy flows supporting the generation of autotrophic natural capital stocks inputs accounted for include natural and nutrients flows that supported the formation of autotrophic natural capital stocks the total emergy values range from 3 01 1016 sej for the habitat phb to 1 50 1018 sej for the habitat sb instead the highest value of emergy density resulted 5 47 1011 sej m 2 for the habitat psb table 5 table 6 shows the emergy flows supporting the generation of heterotrophic natural capital stocks in the mpa the total emergy values range from 3 86 1017 sej for the habitat phb to 6 61 1018 sej for the habitat shb the highest value of emergy density was 4 81 1012 sej m 2 for the habitat shb table 6 table 7 summarizes the cumulative emergy and eco exergy indicators calculated for each of the four investigated habitat with reference to both autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks the shb habitat showed the highest total emergy value of natural capital 4 94 1012 sej m 2 while the highest eco exergy value resulted for the psb habitat 3 58 106 kj m 2 the emergy ecoexergy ratio ranges from 7 83 106 sej kj 1 for the habitat shb to 0 31 106 sej kj 1 for the habitat psb table 7 table 8 displays the non market monetary equivalents of the emergy values of natural capital stocks the value per unit area ranges from 5 16 m 2 for the shb habitat to 0 23 m 2 for the sb habitat the total value of natural capital of the whole mpa calculated as the sum of the values of all the habitats resulted about 12 m table 8 fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the emergy and eco exergy values of natural capital in the mpa and its current zonation the map of emergy values distribution fig 4a shows that areas with high density values of natural capital are currently included in the a and b zones designed to ensure high levels of protection within the mpa in particular zone a b and c include 16 45 and 39 of the total emergy value of natural capital respectively instead the map of eco exergy values distribution fig 4b shows that areas with high density values of natural capital are mainly included in zone c in fact zone a b and c represent 4 19 and 77 of the total eco exergy natural capital value respectively these results show that most of the eco exergy value of natural capital falls in zone c the protection zone mainly devoted to promote socioeconomic activities thus highlighting a possible conflict between the protection of natural capital and the development of human activities 3 2 ecosystem services assessment the economic value of the ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions are shown in table 9 a b the total economic value of the ecosystem services annually generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions were 3 05 m and 0 62 m nutrient cycling was the highest ecosystem service generated by posidonia oceanica 2 72 m table 9a while the recreation service resulted the highest ecosystem service generated by coralligenous bioconstructions 0 41 m table 9b fig 5 shows the 2d and 3d bionomic maps for the investigated mpa the generated 3d map allowed detecting many differences compared to the 2d map especially for those habitats growing on vertical substrate mainly shb and phb table 10 shows the area of the different habitats calculated by using both 2d and 3d maps the shb was the most underestimated habitat in the 2d map table 10 therefore the values of natural capital and ecosystem services were recalculated according to the new values of habitats area estimated by using the 3d map table 11 the accounting of 3d areas increased the emergy value of natural capital and the related economic value by 8 the eco exergy value of natural capital by 5 and the economic value of ecosystem services by 5 4 discussion in this study the emergy and eco exergy methods were used to assess the value of natural capital of a mediterranean mpa the assessment focused on four macro habitats sciaphilic hard bottom shb coralligenous bioconstructions photophilic hard bottom phb soft bottom sb and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds psb the emergy and eco exergy assessments highlighted the importance of two main habitats shb and psb in fact the cumulative eco exergy density of natural capital stocks 3 58 106 kj m 2 table 7 was higher for psb habitat compared to all the other habitats the high eco exergy value of psb habitat is mainly due to the high ß value of the seagrass posidonia oceanica reflecting its complex evolutionary history and its high value of biomass density the calculated eco exergy density of psb was in line with the values calculated by buonocore et al 2019 for the same habitat in other mediterranean mpas moreover the cumulative emergy density value of the shb 4 94 1012 sej m 2 table 7 was higher than all the other habitats the high emergy value calculated for the shb habitat reflects the high convergence of natural input flows for the generation of its biomass stock and high biodiversity this value is also comparable with the values calculated by buonocore et al 2019 franzese et al 2017 and paoli et al 2018 for the coralligenous habitat in other mediterranean mpas the low value of the emergy eco exergy ratio calculated for psb showed that this habitat is the most efficient among the others in building its organization and complexity instead the high value of the same indicator calculated for shb is due to the high convergence of natural flows generating the complex ecological structure characterizing coralligenous bioconstructions paoli et al 2016 in addition the integration of the emergy and ecoexergy value with the bionomic map of the mpa showed that maps of the spatial distribution of natural capital value are useful in support of local managers and policy makers to evaluate the effectiveness of zonation and other nature conservation strategies furthermore to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective the emergy values of natural capital stocks calculated for the four investigated macro habitats were converted into monetary units the monetary values calculated for the different macro habitats e g 7 09 m for shb and 1 69 m for psb table 8 and for the whole mpa 12 m table 8 allow for an easier understanding of the value of nature in socioeconomic contexts the biophysical and economic assessment of natural capital value was then complemented with an estimation of a set of ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions at mpa scale the total economic value of the ecosystem services generated by both habitats 3 05 m and 0 62 m table 9 was underestimated for two main reasons firstly the assessment of ecosystem services was based on the area covered by the two macro habitats calculated by using a 2d bionomic map of the mpa that does not include habitats on vertical substrates to face this limitation a 3d bionomic map for punta campanella mpa was generated to detect differences in the value of both natural capital and ecosystem services confirming the importance of considering cliffs when accounting for the value of coastal ecosystems in addition the data available in this study allowed for an estimation of selected ecosystem services that although very important for human well being do not reflect the overall set of ecosystem functions and services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds hemminga and duarte 2000 pergent et al 2012 and coralligenous bioconstructions ballesteros 2006 un map 2017 future studies might focus on the assessment of other ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds coralligenous bioconstructions and other marine habitats the main findings of the present study are useful to complete the assessment of natural capital value in the network of mpas located in campania region southern italy providing a more solid benchmark for future assessment at larger scales in terms of novelty with respect to a previous study performed in the same region buonocore et al 2019 the environmental accounting model was further improved in particular the assessment of natural capital was enriched by the calculation of integrated emergy ecoexergy indices and complemented by the assessment of a set of ecosystem services in addition the generation of a 3d bionomic map allowed for the assessment of marine habitats laying on vertical surfaces that in some contexts do not represent a negligible contribution in light of these aspects although the use of a standardized environmental accounting protocol is surely desirable for a consistent comparison of results calculated for different mpas we maintain the importance of adapting the accounting model to comply with physical and biological peculiarities characterizing different marine ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods were jointly used to assess the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the main habitats of a mediterranean mpa the eco exergy results showed the importance of the habitat formed by the seagrass posidonia oceanica in terms of stored biomass and genetic information while the emergy method highlighted the high convergence of natural flows in generating the complexity of coralligenous habitat the conversion of the emergy values into monetary equivalents also allowed an estimation of the economic value of natural capital stocks in the mpa in addition the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of natural capital stocks was complemented by the economic assessment of selected ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions the results of this study showed the high value of these two habitats in terms of both natural capital stocks and delivery of ecosystem services confirming the importance of their protection and conservation in marine and coastal management the biophysical and economic values of natural capital and ecosystem services together with the maps showing the spatial distribution of their value in the mpa can support local managers and policy makers to develop and implement nature conservation strategies while ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources future studies could be oriented towards a more comprehensive assessment of the overall set of ecosystem services generated by all the marine habitats characterizing the investigated mpa in addition the proposed assessment framework could be applied to estimate the value of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine and coastal ecosystems at larger spatial scales credit authorship contribution statement elvira buonocore conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing

24871,healthy resilient and diverse marine ecosystems are capable of generating the biotic and abiotic components of natural capital stocks interacting and providing a bundle of ecosystem services vital to human well being increasing pressures and impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems cause habitat degradation and biodiversity loss and as a consequence seriously affect their capacity to provide benefits to humans integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socioeconomic aspects are much needed to protect natural capital stocks and ensure the delivery of ecosystem services in this context marine protected areas mpas are important tools for conserving biodiversity while promoting sustainable human activities in this study an interdisciplinary approach to the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems was adopted in particular the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods were jointly used to account for the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the mediterranean mpa punta campanella located in southern italy the assessment focused on four main macro habitats sciaphilic hard bottom coralligenous bioconstructions photophilic hard bottom soft bottom and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds the habitat posidonia oceanica seagrass beds showed the highest value of eco exergy density 3 58 106 kj m 2 while the highest value of emergy density resulted for the sciaphilic hard bottom habitat 4 94 1012 sej m 2 the high eco exergy value of posidonia oceanica seagrass beds habitat is mainly due to the complex evolutionary history and high biomass density of the posidonia oceanica seagrass on the other hand the high emergy value calculated for the sciaphilic hard bottom habitat reflects the high convergence of natural input flows for the generation of its biomass stocks and high biodiversity in addition to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective the emergy values of natural capital stocks were also converted into monetary units the total value of natural capital stocks in the mpa resulted about 12 m furthermore a set of ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions was identified and their economic value was estimated 3 05 m and 0 62 m respectively finally the value of natural capital and ecosystem services was also estimated by using a 3d bionomic map to consider the presence of coralligenous bioconstructions and other habitats on cliffs characterizing the investigated mpa this study highlighted the importance of posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions in terms of both natural capital stocks and delivery of ecosystem services confirming the need for their protection and conservation in marine and coastal management the biophysical and economic values of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services together with their spatial distribution in the mpa can support local managers and policy makers in implementing and developing nature conservation strategies while ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources keywords marine protected areas emergy eco exergy

ecosystem services depends on healthy resilient and diverse marine ecosystems smith et al 2017 there is a growing evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions thus representing the basis for the generation of ecosystem services cardinale et al 2012 franzese et al 2018a teixeira et al 2019 vihervaara et al 2019 marine ecosystems are heavily exploited throughout the world the coastal zones represent only about 4 of the earth s total land area yet they contain more than one third of the world s population and account for about 90 of the catches from marine fisheries barbier 2017 the multiple pressures and impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems are increasing globally franzese et al 2018b halpern et al 2015 pauna et al 2019 the major drivers of change and degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems are population growth and related increasing food demand overexploitation of fish stocks introduction of invasive species climate change eutrophication and waste release halpern et al 2012 unep 2006 the anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems cause biodiversity loss and as a consequence seriously affect their capacity to provide benefits to humans halpern et al 2008 haines young and potschin 2010 therefore integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socioeconomic aspects are much needed to protect natural capital stocks and ensure the delivery of ecosystem services through the sustainable exploitation of marine resources franzese et al 2008 2019 picone et al 2017 marine protected areas mpas are recognized worldwide as important tool for mitigating human impacts on marine ecosystems conserving biodiversity while promoting sustainable human activities zupan et al 2018 mpas play a crucial role in the mediterranean area where coastal tourism is one of the main economic sector and employment producer while tourism is crucial for the economic development of the mediterranean region its increasing growth can generate several environmental pressures on the coastal zones cumulating with other impacts generated by local populations drius et al 2019 in light of this in the mediterranean context mpas are essential to protect marine ecosystems while allowing sustainable coastal tourism and local economic activities the biophysical and economic assessments of the value of natural capital and ecosystem services are much needed for achieving nature conservation goals while ensuring the sustainable exploitation of marine resources in fact they are crucial to convey the importance of natural resources to managers and policy makers supporting the development and implementation of policies and strategies oriented to natural capital conservation and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services börger et al 2014 maes et al 2016 environmental accounting is a useful tool to assess the biophysical and economic value of natural capital and ecosystem services in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems häyhä et al 2015 mellino et al 2015 nikodinoska et al 2018 caro et al 2018 in particular environmental accounting allows the assessment of multiple aspects dealing with marine ecosystems among which the environmental costs sustained for the generation and maintenance of natural capital stocks and ecosystems function the received benefits i e the ecosystem services and the impacts generated by human activities for the exploitation of marine resources franzese et al 2015 häyhä and franzese 2014 the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystem is more challenging compared to terrestrial ecosystems townsend et al 2018 in fact the dynamics and complexity of marine ecosystems the high connectivity among marine habitats the dispersal of species and the widespread spatial distribution of the ecological processes make the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services demanding and time and resource consuming manea et al 2019 in spite of this over the past decades there has been an increasing research effort to assess the value of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems and to incorporate these values into marine planning and decision making börger et al 2014 buonocore et al 2018 christie et al 2015 geange et al 2019 franzese et al 2015 pauna et al 2018 among the environmental accounting methods the emergy accounting method odum 1988 1996 has been recently used to assess the value of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems in terms of environmental support needed for their generation berrios et al 2017 franzese et al 2017 paoli et al 2018 picone et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 the eco exergy method jørgensen and mejer 1979 has been also suggested to assess the value of natural capital in terms of chemical energy stored in organic matter and genetic information embodied in living organisms mandal et al 2012 vihervaara et al 2019 previous studies suggested the parallel application of the emergy and eco exergy methods for the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services buonocore et al 2019 coscieme et al 2013 ulgiati et al 2011 1 2 goal of the study in this study an interdisciplinary approach to the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems was adopted in particular the study aimed at assessing the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the mediterranean marine protected area mpa punta campanella located in southern italy through the parallel use of the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods the assessment focused on four main macro habitats sciaphilic hard bottom coralligenous bioconstructions photophilic hard bottom soft bottom and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds in addition to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective the emergy values of natural capital stocks were also converted into monetary units the study also aimed at identifying a set of ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions and estimating their economic value 2 materials and methods 2 1 the area of study punta campanella is a mpa located in the sorrento peninsula of the gulf of naples southern italy it was established in 1997 by the italian ministry of the environment the mpa covers a total area of about 1500 hectares with a coastline of about 40 km the gulf of naples is characterized by peculiar orographic features influencing wind and sea dynamics in particular the vesuvius volcano and the hills system of the city of naples can shelter north easterly winds blowing over the basin mostly in winter creating jet currents responsible for coastal water exchanges cianelli et al 2012 these water exchanges provide a continuous supply of clean and deep water rich in nutrients supporting primary production and its transfer to higher trophic levels appolloni et al 2018a the mpa is also characterized by a very peculiar geomorphological configuration due to the calcareous nature of the sorrento peninsula the area has been subject to intense karst phenomena that have generated several emerged and submerged cavities cinque 2017 more than 50 caves are included within the mpa they are particular environments whose chemical physical parameters strongly affect the composition of the ecological communities the caves mainly host sciaphilic assemblages including rare species such as the sea anemone halcampoides purpureus studer 1879 recorded in the iucn red list of mediterranean anthozoa otero et al 2017 the submerged overhanging walls and carbonate pinnacles allow the presence of pre coralligenous formation at a depth of a few metres while rich biocenoses of coralligenous banks occur at a depth of about 55 metres ferrigno et al 2016 2017 noteworthy is the presence of the endemic mediterranean seagrass posidonia oceanica whose biocenosis covers about 10 of the mpa total area the high biodiversity together with the peculiar geomorphological configuration and mild mediterranean climate makes the mpa an attractive site for many touristic activities such as swimming boating and diving like all the italian mpas punta campanella mpa is characterized by three zones with different levels of protection and allowed human activities namely zone a zone b and zone c fig 1 covering about 12 43 and 45 of the total area respectively all the biocenosis included within the boundaries of the mpa were identified through the analysis of the bionomic map appolloni et al 2018b and clustered into the following four macro habitats 1 sciaphilic hard bottom shb coralligenous bioconstructions 2 photophilic hard bottom phb 3 soft bottom sb and 4 posidonia oceanica seagrass beds psb fig 2 2 2 the environmental accounting model this study provides a biophysical and economic assessment of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services flows of punta campanella mpa the conceptual diagram in fig 3 summarizes the main steps of the implemented environmental accounting model all steps are described in details in the following paragraphs 2 2 1 sampling procedures and data analysis ad hoc sampling campaigns were performed in spring 2018 to collect data on macrobenthic communities and necto benthic fishes in the four investigated macro habitats samplings of macrobenthic organisms were performed through the air lift scraping air lift technique chemello and russo 1997 and randomly replicated three times in each habitat using different frames buonocore et al 2019 after sorting species were identified and clustered in the following main taxonomic groups algae annelida ascidiacea bryozoa cnidaria crustacea demospongiae echinodermata and mollusca the dry biomass of the different macrobenthic groups was assessed by using a drying oven and then converted to grams of ash free dry weight afdw and grams of carbon gc through appropriate conversion factors brey 2016 the biomass of necto benthic fishes was assessed based on visual census transects harmelin vivien et al 1985 randomly performed on the investigated macro habitats buonocore et al 2019 average biomass data on the groups epiphytes microphytobenthos phytoplancton and posidonia were estimated from literature boudouresque et al 2006 charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 the matrix of the biomass density calculated for the different taxonomic groups and the four macro habitats was the basis for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy natural capital assessment 2 2 2 the eco exergy accounting method the eco exergy method accounts for the chemical energy in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in living organisms providing a measure of the organizational level and complexity of an ecosystem jørgensen and mejer 1979 eco exergy for living organisms is calculated according to the following equation eco exergy β b f where β is a weighting factor expressing the information content of the organism s genes b is the organism s biomass and f is the average value of work energy per unit of biomass jørgensen 2015 the total eco exergy of an ecosystem is calculated as the sum of the eco exergy values of all the organisms present in that ecosystem in this study the eco exergy value of natural capital stocks in the investigated macro habitats was calculated the biomass values of the different taxonomic groups were multiplied by their specific ß values and then summed to obtain the total eco exergy value of each macro habitat more details on the accounting procedures can be found in buonocore et al 2019 2 2 3 the emergy accounting method the emergy accounting method odum 1988 1996 aims at evaluating the cumulative environmental support to a system on the global scale of the biosphere taking into account free environmental inputs human driven material and energy flows and the indirect environmental support embodied in human labor and services brown and ulgiati 2004 brown et al 2016a 2016b franzese et al 2009 2014 according to this method inputs are accounted for in terms of their solar emergy defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly used to make a given product or support a given flow and measured in sej solar emergy joules the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 all inputs to an investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to calculate the total emergy support in this study the emergy accounting method was used to assess the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the investigated mpa according to the biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model described in vassallo et al 2017 and buonocore et al 2019 in addition the biophysical values of natural capital were converted into equivalent monetary units by using the emergy to money ratio emr indicator lou and ulgiati 2013 tian et al 2017 in particular in this study the emr of 9 60 1011 sej 1 calculated for italy pereira et al 2013 was used the equivalent monetary value of natural capital for each macro habitat was calculated dividing the emergy value by the emr 2 2 4 emergy and eco exergy indicators a set of emergy and eco exergy indicators was calculated for the four investigated habitats in particular the total emergy value of each habitat was calculated to account for the emergy flows that supported the generation of its natural capital stocks since this indicator is an extensive measure depending on the area of the investigated habitats the emergy density values were also calculated to account for the emergy flows concentrated per unit area these values represent an intensive measure of the emergy support to each habitat similarly the total eco exergy value of each habitat was calculated as an extensive measure of chemical energy and genetic information embodied in its living organisms in addition the eco exergy density was calculated to account for the eco exergy flows concentrated per unit area finally the emergy ecoexergy ratio was calculated for all the investigated habitats this indicator represents the amount of emergy flows required to generate a unit of organization and reflects the efficiency of an ecosystem in building its complexity bastianoni and marchettini 1997 the emergy ecoexergy ratio was calculated dividing the emergy density value by the eco exergy density value calculated for each habitat 2 2 5 ecosystem services assessment the assessment of the ecosystem services generated by the mpa of punta campanella was focused on two main habitats posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions posidonia oceanica plays a crucial ecological role in the mediterranean marine ecosystem and provides several valuable ecosystem services campagne et al 2015 its presence implies a unique enrichment of species enhancing the biodiversity of coastal waters the meadows are nursery and foraging areas for several fish and shellfish species and improve water quality by reducing particle loads in the water and absorbing dissolved nutrients hemminga and duarte 2000 posidonia oceanica also develops a web of roots stabilizing sediments and provides protection against coastal erosion in addition the seagrass beds play a significant role in nutrient cycling and in carbon fixation and storage pergent et al 2012 in this study the following ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds were evaluated raw materials provision food provision carbon sequestration nursery and nutrient cycling coralligenous habitats are very complex marine habitats and together with posidonia oceanica seagrass beds are considered as the most important mediterranean marine ecosystems giakoumi et al 2013 coralligenous habitats are hotspot of biodiversity and provide a large set of ecosystem services ballesteros 2006 among them the regulating service of carbon sequestration by coralligenous bioconstructions is controversial chisholm and barnes 1998 lønborg et al 2019 in fact the sequestering of carbon in the precipitation of calcium carbonate is accompanied by release of co2 for this reason coralligenous bioconstructions can be considered as sink of carbon and source of carbon dioxide ware et al 1991 since the role of coralligenous bioconstructions in global carbon cycles needs to be further investigated the carbon sequestration service provided by the coralligenous habitat was not evaluated in this study the following ecosystem services generated by coralligenous bioconstructions were estimated raw materials provision food provision nursery and recreation the teeb valuation database https www es partnership org services data knowledge sharing ecosystem service valuation database was used to estimate the economic values per unit area of the ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions table 1 these values were then multiplied by the area covered by the two habitats in the mpa to provide an economic estimation of the ecosystem services generated at mpa scale the total area covered by coralligenous bioconstructions and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds was calculated from the bionomic map of the mpa that is two dimensional 2d yet a peculiarity of the investigated mpa is the high presence of coralligenous bioconstructions on cliffs not represented in the 2d bionomic map for this reason a three dimensional 3d bionomic map was developed by using the interpolate shape tool of the arcgis software version 10 1 and the digital elevation model as reference surface 3 results 3 1 natural capital assessment table 2 shows the main taxonomic groups identified in the four habitats of the investigated mpa and relative biomass density expressed in grams of afdw per unit area these biomass values represent the basic information for the implementation of the emergy and eco exergy accounting table 3 shows the eco exergy value of the main autotrophic groups the psb habitat showed the highest values of eco exergy density 3 51 106 kj m 2 and total eco exergy 5 03 1012 kj table 4 shows the eco exergy value of the main heterotrophic groups in this case the shb habitat showed the highest values of eco exergy density 6 03 105 kj m 2 and total eco exergy 8 29 1011 kj table 5 shows the emergy flows supporting the generation of autotrophic natural capital stocks inputs accounted for include natural and nutrients flows that supported the formation of autotrophic natural capital stocks the total emergy values range from 3 01 1016 sej for the habitat phb to 1 50 1018 sej for the habitat sb instead the highest value of emergy density resulted 5 47 1011 sej m 2 for the habitat psb table 5 table 6 shows the emergy flows supporting the generation of heterotrophic natural capital stocks in the mpa the total emergy values range from 3 86 1017 sej for the habitat phb to 6 61 1018 sej for the habitat shb the highest value of emergy density was 4 81 1012 sej m 2 for the habitat shb table 6 table 7 summarizes the cumulative emergy and eco exergy indicators calculated for each of the four investigated habitat with reference to both autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks the shb habitat showed the highest total emergy value of natural capital 4 94 1012 sej m 2 while the highest eco exergy value resulted for the psb habitat 3 58 106 kj m 2 the emergy ecoexergy ratio ranges from 7 83 106 sej kj 1 for the habitat shb to 0 31 106 sej kj 1 for the habitat psb table 7 table 8 displays the non market monetary equivalents of the emergy values of natural capital stocks the value per unit area ranges from 5 16 m 2 for the shb habitat to 0 23 m 2 for the sb habitat the total value of natural capital of the whole mpa calculated as the sum of the values of all the habitats resulted about 12 m table 8 fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the emergy and eco exergy values of natural capital in the mpa and its current zonation the map of emergy values distribution fig 4a shows that areas with high density values of natural capital are currently included in the a and b zones designed to ensure high levels of protection within the mpa in particular zone a b and c include 16 45 and 39 of the total emergy value of natural capital respectively instead the map of eco exergy values distribution fig 4b shows that areas with high density values of natural capital are mainly included in zone c in fact zone a b and c represent 4 19 and 77 of the total eco exergy natural capital value respectively these results show that most of the eco exergy value of natural capital falls in zone c the protection zone mainly devoted to promote socioeconomic activities thus highlighting a possible conflict between the protection of natural capital and the development of human activities 3 2 ecosystem services assessment the economic value of the ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions are shown in table 9 a b the total economic value of the ecosystem services annually generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions were 3 05 m and 0 62 m nutrient cycling was the highest ecosystem service generated by posidonia oceanica 2 72 m table 9a while the recreation service resulted the highest ecosystem service generated by coralligenous bioconstructions 0 41 m table 9b fig 5 shows the 2d and 3d bionomic maps for the investigated mpa the generated 3d map allowed detecting many differences compared to the 2d map especially for those habitats growing on vertical substrate mainly shb and phb table 10 shows the area of the different habitats calculated by using both 2d and 3d maps the shb was the most underestimated habitat in the 2d map table 10 therefore the values of natural capital and ecosystem services were recalculated according to the new values of habitats area estimated by using the 3d map table 11 the accounting of 3d areas increased the emergy value of natural capital and the related economic value by 8 the eco exergy value of natural capital by 5 and the economic value of ecosystem services by 5 4 discussion in this study the emergy and eco exergy methods were used to assess the value of natural capital of a mediterranean mpa the assessment focused on four macro habitats sciaphilic hard bottom shb coralligenous bioconstructions photophilic hard bottom phb soft bottom sb and posidonia oceanica seagrass beds psb the emergy and eco exergy assessments highlighted the importance of two main habitats shb and psb in fact the cumulative eco exergy density of natural capital stocks 3 58 106 kj m 2 table 7 was higher for psb habitat compared to all the other habitats the high eco exergy value of psb habitat is mainly due to the high ß value of the seagrass posidonia oceanica reflecting its complex evolutionary history and its high value of biomass density the calculated eco exergy density of psb was in line with the values calculated by buonocore et al 2019 for the same habitat in other mediterranean mpas moreover the cumulative emergy density value of the shb 4 94 1012 sej m 2 table 7 was higher than all the other habitats the high emergy value calculated for the shb habitat reflects the high convergence of natural input flows for the generation of its biomass stock and high biodiversity this value is also comparable with the values calculated by buonocore et al 2019 franzese et al 2017 and paoli et al 2018 for the coralligenous habitat in other mediterranean mpas the low value of the emergy eco exergy ratio calculated for psb showed that this habitat is the most efficient among the others in building its organization and complexity instead the high value of the same indicator calculated for shb is due to the high convergence of natural flows generating the complex ecological structure characterizing coralligenous bioconstructions paoli et al 2016 in addition the integration of the emergy and ecoexergy value with the bionomic map of the mpa showed that maps of the spatial distribution of natural capital value are useful in support of local managers and policy makers to evaluate the effectiveness of zonation and other nature conservation strategies furthermore to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective the emergy values of natural capital stocks calculated for the four investigated macro habitats were converted into monetary units the monetary values calculated for the different macro habitats e g 7 09 m for shb and 1 69 m for psb table 8 and for the whole mpa 12 m table 8 allow for an easier understanding of the value of nature in socioeconomic contexts the biophysical and economic assessment of natural capital value was then complemented with an estimation of a set of ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions at mpa scale the total economic value of the ecosystem services generated by both habitats 3 05 m and 0 62 m table 9 was underestimated for two main reasons firstly the assessment of ecosystem services was based on the area covered by the two macro habitats calculated by using a 2d bionomic map of the mpa that does not include habitats on vertical substrates to face this limitation a 3d bionomic map for punta campanella mpa was generated to detect differences in the value of both natural capital and ecosystem services confirming the importance of considering cliffs when accounting for the value of coastal ecosystems in addition the data available in this study allowed for an estimation of selected ecosystem services that although very important for human well being do not reflect the overall set of ecosystem functions and services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds hemminga and duarte 2000 pergent et al 2012 and coralligenous bioconstructions ballesteros 2006 un map 2017 future studies might focus on the assessment of other ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds coralligenous bioconstructions and other marine habitats the main findings of the present study are useful to complete the assessment of natural capital value in the network of mpas located in campania region southern italy providing a more solid benchmark for future assessment at larger scales in terms of novelty with respect to a previous study performed in the same region buonocore et al 2019 the environmental accounting model was further improved in particular the assessment of natural capital was enriched by the calculation of integrated emergy ecoexergy indices and complemented by the assessment of a set of ecosystem services in addition the generation of a 3d bionomic map allowed for the assessment of marine habitats laying on vertical surfaces that in some contexts do not represent a negligible contribution in light of these aspects although the use of a standardized environmental accounting protocol is surely desirable for a consistent comparison of results calculated for different mpas we maintain the importance of adapting the accounting model to comply with physical and biological peculiarities characterizing different marine ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods were jointly used to assess the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the main habitats of a mediterranean mpa the eco exergy results showed the importance of the habitat formed by the seagrass posidonia oceanica in terms of stored biomass and genetic information while the emergy method highlighted the high convergence of natural flows in generating the complexity of coralligenous habitat the conversion of the emergy values into monetary equivalents also allowed an estimation of the economic value of natural capital stocks in the mpa in addition the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of natural capital stocks was complemented by the economic assessment of selected ecosystem services generated by posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and coralligenous bioconstructions the results of this study showed the high value of these two habitats in terms of both natural capital stocks and delivery of ecosystem services confirming the importance of their protection and conservation in marine and coastal management the biophysical and economic values of natural capital and ecosystem services together with the maps showing the spatial distribution of their value in the mpa can support local managers and policy makers to develop and implement nature conservation strategies while ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources future studies could be oriented towards a more comprehensive assessment of the overall set of ecosystem services generated by all the marine habitats characterizing the investigated mpa in addition the proposed assessment framework could be applied to estimate the value of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine and coastal ecosystems at larger spatial scales credit authorship contribution statement elvira buonocore conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing

24872,network theories have been largely applied to the investigation of spatial ecology and there is a new trend to use them to explore the responses of complex dispersal networks to patch loss combining both network and metapopulation approaches we used a spatially explicit patch model to compare the robustness of networks with different heterogeneities to both random and selective patch removal we found that species in more heterogeneous networks can persist at higher extinction to colonization ratios in addition dispersal networks with higher heterogeneity display stronger robustness to random patch loss suggesting that previous models based on lattice or randomly structured networks might underestimate species extinction thresholds however such strong tolerance to random patch removal comes at a high cost in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to selective removal of the most connected patches so called keystone patches as this removal mode directly leads to a rapid decline in the total number of links among patches we further explored the mechanism underlying these outcomes via network analysis and found a strong positive correlation between overall metapopulation size and the largest cluster size concerning ecological conservation and management our findings suggest that future efforts should focus on considering species dispersal networks by identifying and preserving the keystone patches and as such optimizing the connectivity between existing habitat patches should be an effective strategy to rescue the endangered species keywords dispersal network heterogeneity metapopulation dynamics patch loss species extinction thresholds 1 introduction recently an increasing number of studies have applied network theory to spatial ecology and explored how changing connectivity among patches affects the persistence and dynamics of interacting species holland and hastings 2008 grilli et al 2015 gilarranz et al 2017 in these representations each network is characterized as a graph consisting of a set of nodes i e patches and the links i e species dispersal pathways connecting them fortuna et al 2006 2009 the connection topology is often assumed to be either completely regular with 4 or 8 nearest neighbors for each patch or completely random liao et al 2013a b ying et al 2014 shen et al 2019 these previous spatial models have significantly advanced understanding of species persistence and coexistence bascompte and solé 1995 tilman and kareiva 1997 hiebeler 2000 shi et al 2018 for example when habitat patches are randomly distributed across the landscape a simple non spatial metapopulation model is able to yield similar dynamical behaviors to complex spatially explicit simulation in contrast to the case where patches are not randomly distributed hiebeler 2000 frank and wissel 2002 in addition metapopulation persistence depends not only on the landscape properties but also on the dispersal ability of the species hiebeler 2000 liao et al 2013a b shen et al 2019 this assumption however is too ideal to reflect reality as species dispersal in nature displays at least some level of spatial heterogeneity for example riparian plants in a landscape crossed by a river will be concentrated in the vicinity of the water leading to a non uniform distribution grilli et al 2015 trees with bird dispersed seeds perceive the landscape as a heterogeneous network as opposed to trees with wind dispersed seeds which move through a homogeneous network montoya et al 2008 kininmonth et al 2010 found that the 321 reefs of the great barrier reef constitute a scale free small world network for the species where most reefs have only one or a few links and a very small proportion of reefs are extremely well connected i e following a power law degree distribution fortuna et al 2006 identified a large spatial network of temporary ponds as breeding sites for amphibian species observing a shift from a power law to a truncated power law distribution as the level of drought increases over the past decade a few studies have begun to explicitly explore the dynamical implication of the network structure of habitat patches jordán et al 2007 bode et al 2008 economo and keitt 2008 vasas et al 2009 for instance gilarranz and bascompte 2012 investigated metapopulation dynamics on spatial networks with contrasting architectures finding that scale free networks can maintain the highest population abundance greatly promoting species persistence in addition holland and hastings 2008 demonstrated that irregularities in connections among patches strongly affect prey predator system stability more specifically heterogeneous networks typically have larger periods of asynchronous dynamics resulting in lower amplitude fluctuations in population abundances with increasing anthropogenic disturbance e g land use change pollution and over exploitation and climate change e g flooding and drought species around the world are under threat from ongoing habitat destruction a leading driver of species extinction pimm and raven 2000 shi et al 2020 it is clear that habitat destruction can result in two consequences patch loss i e decline in habitat amount and patch fragmentation i e reduced patch connectivity as habitat loss increased how to accurately predict species extinction thresholds defined as the critical value of patch loss at which a species just goes extinct has become a fundamental issue in conservation ecology for instance thompson et al 2014 2017 explored how habitat loss changes the mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance in networks where patches are distributed randomly in 2 dimentional space yet previous studies modeling species extinction risks e g hiebeler 2000 mcinerny et al 2007 mortelliti et al 2010 primarily focused on lattice structured or randomly structured networks while ignoring more heterogeneous networks addressed above although some studies have explored the robustness of complex spatial networks with regard to patch removal by analyzing their changes in structural properties urban and keitt 2001 fortuna et al 2006 kininmonth et al 2010 we still lack a systematic comparative analysis on how these effects of patch loss transfer to metapopulation dynamics in spatial networks with contrasting heterogeneities defined as the extent of variation in patch linking degrees with larger variation in connectivity indicating higher dispersal heterogeneity in this study we construct a spatially explicit metapopulation model incorporating dispersal network structure cf gilarranz and bascompte 2012 so as to understand the underlying mechanism of metapopulation viability following patch loss in different heterogeneous networks this understanding relies on two aspects modeling metapopulation dynamics on these networks see figs 1 3 s1 s2 in appendix and describing the architecture of spatial dispersal networks after patch removal figs 4 s3 s4 in appendix we focus on four types of dispersal networks with contrasting linking heterogeneities illustrated in fig 1a d regular network bascompte and solé 1995 random network erdös and rényi 1959 watts and strogatz 1998 exponential network and scale free network barabási and albert 1999 at the same time three modes of patch loss are included random patch removal removing the most connected patches and the opposite with the model we thus attempt to predict under which circumstances a network of habitat patches will support a metapopulation and consequently the robustness of dispersal network structure to patch loss 2 methods 2 1 spatial dispersal networks similar to gilarranz and bascompte 2012 four architectures of dispersal networks are considered as represented in fig 1a d where each node denotes a suitable habitat patch linked with a number of other patches i e linking degree k and links among patches indicate species dispersal pathways i e functional connectivity among populations each network can be defined by its linking degree distribution fig 1a represents a regular network with each patch having four links to other patches k 4 this configuration characterizes a completely homogeneous network similar to the traditional lattice structured models with nearest neighbor dispersal under periodic boundary conditions bascompte and solé 1995 hiebeler 2000 fig 1b describes a randomly structured network in which patches are linked at random watts and strogatz 1998 this consequently brings variation in patch linking degrees which follow a poisson distribution with the variance equal to the average degree per patch k 4 erdös and rényi 1959 fig 1c displays an exponential network with the same k 4 but more variability in linking degrees i e higher heterogeneity than the random network fortuna et al 2006 we construct the exponential networks following the algorithm of barabási and albert 1999 see details therein with random attachment finally fig 1d shows a scale free network with extremely high heterogeneity but again keeping average patch linking degree at k 4 i e most patches have one or a few links while a few patches are extremely well connected following a power law degree distribution kininmonth et al 2010 this type of network is likewise constructed according to the algorithm by barabási and albert 1999 see details therein but now with preferential attachment species are assumed to disperse equally in all directions with no preference i e if patches i and j are connected dispersal can occur from either i to j or vice versa 2 2 metapopulation dynamics similar to gilarranz and bascompte 2012 we use a discrete time spatially explicit model to simulate metapopulation dynamics in the spatial dispersal networks described above for model simplicity we assume i no habitat difference among patches ii no effect of population emigration on source populations iii stable populations and iv a fixed maximum population capacity for occupied patches based on the premise that local population dynamic succession should be faster than patch colonization extinction dynamics each patch has two states occupied or empty in each time step every occupied patch becomes extinct with a probability e 0 1 while each empty patch is colonized by one of its directly connected occupied patches with an independent colonization probability c 0 1 thus the overall effective colonization probability for a given empty patch i should be 1 c i 1 1 c x i with xi being the number of occupied patches directly linked to the patch i xi ki k i the number of connected patches for the patch i 2 3 patch removal modes we begin with the entire dispersal network and remove patches in three ways i randomly irrespective of patch linking degree ii starting from highly connected patches to least connected patches that is we first remove the most connected patches and continue selecting and removing patches in decreasing order of their initial linking degree k iii from least connected patches to highly connected patches opposite to case ii after patch removal f fraction of removed patches we further analyze the structural properties of connected patches remaining in the network using three characteristic parameters more details seen in albert et al 2000 1 s the relative size of the largest cluster defined as the fraction of patches contained in the largest cluster that is s 1 if there is no patch loss 2 l the fraction of remaining links in the network 3 p s the cluster size distribution of the remaining network 4 s the average size of the isolated clusters i e all the clusters except the largest one thus we can explore the inner relationship between the network properties and metapopulation dynamics so as to explain the underlying mechanism of species persistence subject to habitat loss in heterogeneous dispersal networks 2 4 simulations using matlab r2018b we generate four types of dispersal networks with contrasting heterogeneities i a regular network based on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions bascompte and solé 1995 hiebeler 2000 ii a randomly structured network according to the algorithm of watts and strogatz 1998 iii an exponential network following the algorithm of barabási and albert 1999 with random attachment and iv a scale free network using the algorithm of barabási and albert 1999 with preferential attachment to reduce stochastic effects we model patch occupancy dynamics using large networks consisting of 1024 patches and 2048 undirected links cf gilarranz and bascompte 2012 as such all types of network have the same number of patches and links thereby allowing us to compare metapopulation dynamics in dispersal networks with contrasting heterogeneities see matlab codes for more details in appendix initially all patches within the network are assumed to be occupied within each time step we first remove a given fraction of patches f based on removal mode for example selective patch removal starting from the most or least connected according to the order of initial species linking degree in the intact network next we determine the local population extinction for each occupied patch with a given probability e finally according to eq 1 we compute the probability that an empty patch becomes occupied to determine patch recolonization opportunity we calculate species patch occupancy at each time step as the number of occupied patches divided by the total number of patches to find the steady state for a given system we initially run the simulations for a long time finding that 5000 time steps are sufficient to achieve system stability in each simulation we estimate species patch occupancy at steady state by averaging their patch occupancies between t 4500 5000 time steps each case is explored with 100 replicates starting from different dispersal pathways in each replicate but keeping the network properties constant including the total number of patches and links and the degree distribution ultimately the average of these 100 replicates mean standard deviation sd yields the species patch occupancy at steady state with the model we investigate how different modes of patch removal affect the robustness of dispersal networks with contrasting heterogeneities to habitat loss 3 results we first test how varying the extinction to colonization ratio e c at fixed c 0 05 affects species persistence in different dispersal networks without patch loss fig 1f in general increasing e c results in a monotonic decline in species abundance irrespective of network heterogeneity yet more heterogeneous networks allow a species to persist at higher values of e c interestingly as e c increases the ranking of dispersal networks according to their ability to sustain metapopulation abundance undergoes a shift the regular network with the lowest heterogeneity can maintain the highest global patch occupancy but only at low levels of e c 0 e c 1 5 at high levels of e c e c 1 5 networks with greater heterogeneity sustain the higher species patch occupancy with the highest occupancy being reached in the scale free network highest heterogeneity moreover discrepancy in maintaining species occupancy among these networks enlarges with increasing e c 1 5 thus both network heterogeneity and species life history trait e c interact to determine metapopulation viability next we investigate whether patch removal in different ways alters species persistence in different dispersal networks fig 2 again by varying e c with increasing e c removing patches randomly or removing the least connected patches yields similar metapopulation patterns as shown in fig 1f that is species in more heterogeneous networks can tolerate much higher e c ratios however this outcome is completely overturned when removing the most connected patches fig 2c i e now less heterogeneous networks can maintain higher species occupancy in spite of variation in e c more specifically the regular network supports the highest species abundance while species in the scale free network are most sensitivity to an increase of e c thus different patch removal modes lead to contrasting metapopulation patterns depending on network heterogeneity in the regular network three types of patch removal expectedly yield the same species occupancy as e c increases fig s1 in appendix yet in the heterogeneous networks we observe that species can maintain the highest patch occupancy when the least connected patches are removed as opposed to the removal of most connected patches then we further systematically explore the effect of patch loss on metapopulation dynamics in different dispersal networks via random or selective removal fig 3 in general increasing patch loss results in a monotonic population decline irrespective of removal mode yet patch removal in different ways leads to different metapopulation patterns in different networks in regular networks species abundance is identical under different patch removal modes in heterogeneous networks including random exponential and scale free however global patch occupancy is highest when the least connected patches are removed first thereby maximizing species extinction thresholds in contrast when the most connected patches are removed first species are the most sensitive to patch loss and therefore go extinct soonest especially in the most heterogeneous networks i e scale free networks furthermore differences in sustaining species abundance under different modes of patch removal enlarge with increasing patch loss when comparing species persistence among different dispersal networks we observe that distinct patch removal ways lead to completely different species vulnerabilities to patch loss fig s2 in appendix to explain the above metapopulation patterns after patch loss we finally analyze the network structural properties including the largest cluster size s fraction of remaining links l cluster size distribution and average cluster size s figs 4 s3 s5 in appendix as patch loss f increases both the largest cluster size and fraction of remaining links decline monotonically while the average cluster size initially increases but then decreases peaking when the largest cluster size approaches zero compare figs 4 s5 however both spatial network heterogeneity and patch removal mode interact to modify these outcomes for example both network parameter values s and l overlap under different patch removal modes in the regular network yet in more heterogeneous networks removing the most connected patches leads to the rapidest decline in both the largest cluster size and the fraction of remaining patch links in contrast to the case of removing the least connected patches we further check the cluster size distribution by varying patch loss f 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 figs s3 s4 in appendix taking f 0 2 for example fig s3 we find that the cluster size distribution in the regular networks almost overlap among different patch removal modes in heterogeneous networks removing the most connected patches shapes a larger fraction of small clusters and consequently the largest cluster is much smaller than with other types of patch removal in contrast removing the least connected patches maximizes the largest cluster size 4 discussion in this study we find that species in more heterogeneous networks can persist across a wider range of extinction to colonization ratios e c i e network heterogeneity can greatly promote species persistence especially at higher e c ratios gilarranz and bascompte 2012 this suggests that previous models based on lattice structured or randomly structured networks may have overestimated species extinction risks as most species in nature display some degree of heterogeneity in dispersal networks rather than complete regularity or randomness furthermore the optimal dispersal heterogeneity for species viability is greatly mediated by life history trait e c specifically regular networks can maximize species abundance at low extinction probabilities whereas species with high extinction probabilities would perform better in more heterogeneous networks this can be explained from eq 1 each patch in regular networks has a high effective colonization probability at low e c ratios and all patches with an identical number of links have the same probability to support a population in heterogeneous networks the poorly connected patches have lower probabilities to be colonized than such patches in regular networks however as the extinction probability increases the highly connected patches in heterogeneous networks can be more easily occupied while the only four links of patches in regular networks are insufficient for establishment in other words increasing variation in patch links has a very strong positive effect on metapopulation capacity especially at high e c ratios in fact the effect of heterogeneity in connectivity can be analogous to the effect of heterogeneity in patch size or quality as species often prefer to colonize the large patches with good quality i e more connected patches while species in the small patches with poor quality i e less connected patches go extinct more easily as such species patch occupancy is a complex function of spatial network structure as well as species life history trait e c species can persist more easily in more heterogeneous networks with scale free exponential random regular yet whether this outcome still holds after patch loss is determined by patch removal mode figs 2 3 when removing patches randomly or removing the least connected patches we observe that species in more heterogeneous networks can tolerate much higher e c ratios in contrast to the case of removing the most connected patches fig 2 in addition more heterogeneous networks display stronger robustness to random patch loss fig 3 suggesting that previous models based on ideal regular or random dispersal networks may have underestimated species extinction thresholds however such strong tolerance to random removal comes at a high price in that these heterogeneous networks are extremely vulnerable to the removal of the most connected patches i e the keystone patches that play a vital role in preserving network connectivity as removing those most connected patches can directly lead to a rapid decline in the total number of connections among patches compared with other removal modes fig 4e h this does not occur in regular dispersal networks which are equally fragile whether patches are removed at random or in order of connectedness fig 3a as there is no initial variance in the number of links per patch following patch loss we further explore the underlying mechanism of metapopulation persistence by analyzing the network properties and find a strong positive correlation between overall metapopulation size and the largest cluster size fig 4 if we remove patches starting from the most connected ones the size of the largest cluster decreases more rapidly relative to other modes of patch removal though the average cluster size correspondingly increases to some degree fig s5 in appendix in such case these networks can quickly break into many small isolated clusters even when only a few of the most connected patches are lost figs s3 s4 in appendix given the possibility of local populations becoming extinct the ability of species to recolonize these extirpated patches via dispersal is critical to metapopulation viability yet the isolation between clusters can greatly decrease patch recolonization opportunities by impeding species movement across the entire network thereby reducing metapopulation persistence thus both the largest cluster size and the fraction of links remaining after patch removal determine the maximum population capacity in the whole network concerning species conservation and management the gain or loss of habitat patches is central to landscape change in general and land management in particular jordán et al 2007 vasas et al 2009 to date much effort has been put on increasing habitat connectivity and corridors to promote species persistence tischendorf and fahrig 2000 fahrig 2003 crooks and sanjayan 2006 however these actions do not explicitly include species dispersal networks with heterogeneity combining both network based and metapopulation approaches our findings suggest that we should focus on considering dispersal network structure e g linking heterogeneity among patches and on identifying a set of most preferential patches which are highly connected since these so called keystone patches could act as source patches for and thus connect the rest of a functional patch network urban and keitt 2001 kininmonth et al 2010 in addition the loss of these keystone patches would maximally disrupt dispersal interaction among patches and more easily drive species to extinction as such optimizing patch networks would be an effective conservation strategy for endangered species for instance phillips et al 2008 have already applied network optimization in the cape province of south africa to find the optimal connections between existing habitat patches for the flora however several limitations should be addressed when our model is applied to terrestrial ecosystems firstly although recently there have been a large number of studies on scale free networks actual patch mosaics seem to not quite fit the definitions of these well studied networks in particular the geography seems to constrain patch networks so that they tend to not include the extremely connected patches that characterize scale free networks urban et al 2009 secondly it may be inappropriate to apply a graph representation for some landscapes if habitat patches are poorly resolved spatially urban and keitt 2001 for example habitat quality varies continuously and subtly over the landscape thus aggregating this variability into discrete patches would be inappropriate e g liao et al 2013b combining metapopulation theory and network analysis we explore the responses of dispersal networks to both random and selective patch removal finding that heterogeneous networks are very robust against random removal but can be extremely fragile when selecting and removing the keystone patches this study thus provides a conceptual framework to quantify the robustness of a patchy population to habitat loss in heterogeneous networks indicating that preserving the keystone patches is critical to landscape connectivity and hence species persistence future work based on assembly models of multispecies dispersal networks

kininmonth et al 2010 we still lack a systematic comparative analysis on how these effects of patch loss transfer to metapopulation dynamics in spatial networks with contrasting heterogeneities defined as the extent of variation in patch linking degrees with larger variation in connectivity indicating higher dispersal heterogeneity in this study we construct a spatially explicit metapopulation model incorporating dispersal network structure cf gilarranz and bascompte 2012 so as to understand the underlying mechanism of metapopulation viability following patch loss in different heterogeneous networks this understanding relies on two aspects modeling metapopulation dynamics on these networks see figs 1 3 s1 s2 in appendix and describing the architecture of spatial dispersal networks after patch removal figs 4 s3 s4 in appendix we focus on four types of dispersal networks with contrasting linking heterogeneities illustrated in fig 1a d regular network bascompte and solé 1995 random network erdös and rényi 1959 watts and strogatz 1998 exponential network and scale free network barabási and albert 1999 at the same time three modes of patch loss are included random patch removal removing the most connected patches and the opposite with the model we thus attempt to predict under which circumstances a network of habitat patches will support a metapopulation and consequently the robustness of dispersal network structure to patch loss 2 methods 2 1 spatial dispersal networks similar to gilarranz and bascompte 2012 four architectures of dispersal networks are considered as represented in fig 1a d where each node denotes a suitable habitat patch linked with a number of other patches i e linking degree k and links among patches indicate species dispersal pathways i e functional connectivity among populations each network can be defined by its linking degree distribution fig 1a represents a regular network with each patch having four links to other patches k 4 this configuration characterizes a completely homogeneous network similar to the traditional lattice structured models with nearest neighbor dispersal under periodic boundary conditions bascompte and solé 1995 hiebeler 2000 fig 1b describes a randomly structured network in which patches are linked at random watts and strogatz 1998 this consequently brings variation in patch linking degrees which follow a poisson distribution with the variance equal to the average degree per patch k 4 erdös and rényi 1959 fig 1c displays an exponential network with the same k 4 but more variability in linking degrees i e higher heterogeneity than the random network fortuna et al 2006 we construct the exponential networks following the algorithm of barabási and albert 1999 see details therein with random attachment finally fig 1d shows a scale free network with extremely high heterogeneity but again keeping average patch linking degree at k 4 i e most patches have one or a few links while a few patches are extremely well connected following a power law degree distribution kininmonth et al 2010 this type of network is likewise constructed according to the algorithm by barabási and albert 1999 see details therein but now with preferential attachment species are assumed to disperse equally in all directions with no preference i e if patches i and j are connected dispersal can occur from either i to j or vice versa 2 2 metapopulation dynamics similar to gilarranz and bascompte 2012 we use a discrete time spatially explicit model to simulate metapopulation dynamics in the spatial dispersal networks described above for model simplicity we assume i no habitat difference among patches ii no effect of population emigration on source populations iii stable populations and iv a fixed maximum population capacity for occupied patches based on the premise that local population dynamic succession should be faster than patch colonization extinction dynamics each patch has two states occupied or empty in each time step every occupied patch becomes extinct with a probability e 0 1 while each empty patch is colonized by one of its directly connected occupied patches with an independent colonization probability c 0 1 thus the overall effective colonization probability for a given empty patch i should be 1 c i 1 1 c x i with xi being the number of occupied patches directly linked to the patch i xi ki k i the number of connected patches for the patch i 2 3 patch removal modes we begin with the entire dispersal network and remove patches in three ways i randomly irrespective of patch linking degree ii starting from highly connected patches to least connected patches that is we first remove the most connected patches and continue selecting and removing patches in decreasing order of their initial linking degree k iii from least connected patches to highly connected patches opposite to case ii after patch removal f fraction of removed patches we further analyze the structural properties of connected patches remaining in the network using three characteristic parameters more details seen in albert et al 2000 1 s the relative size of the largest cluster defined as the fraction of patches contained in the largest cluster that is s 1 if there is no patch loss 2 l the fraction of remaining links in the network 3 p s the cluster size distribution of the remaining network 4 s the average size of the isolated clusters i e all the clusters except the largest one thus we can explore the inner relationship between the network properties and metapopulation dynamics so as to explain the underlying mechanism of species persistence subject to habitat loss in heterogeneous dispersal networks 2 4 simulations using matlab r2018b we generate four types of dispersal networks with contrasting heterogeneities i a regular network based on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions bascompte and solé 1995 hiebeler 2000 ii a randomly structured network according to the algorithm of watts and strogatz 1998 iii an exponential network following the algorithm of barabási and albert 1999 with random attachment and iv a scale free network using the algorithm of barabási and albert 1999 with preferential attachment to reduce stochastic effects we model patch occupancy dynamics using large networks consisting of 1024 patches and 2048 undirected links cf gilarranz and bascompte 2012 as such all types of network have the same number of patches and links thereby allowing us to compare metapopulation dynamics in dispersal networks with contrasting heterogeneities see matlab codes for more details in appendix initially all patches within the network are assumed to be occupied within each time step we first remove a given fraction of patches f based on removal mode for example selective patch removal starting from the most or least connected according to the order of initial species linking degree in the intact network next we determine the local population extinction for each occupied patch with a given probability e finally according to eq 1 we compute the probability that an empty patch becomes occupied to determine patch recolonization opportunity we calculate species patch occupancy at each time step as the number of occupied patches divided by the total number of patches to find the steady state for a given system we initially run the simulations for a long time finding that 5000 time steps are sufficient to achieve system stability in each simulation we estimate species patch occupancy at steady state by averaging their patch occupancies between t 4500 5000 time steps each case is explored with 100 replicates starting from different dispersal pathways in each replicate but keeping the network properties constant including the total number of patches and links and the degree distribution ultimately the average of these 100 replicates mean standard deviation sd yields the species patch occupancy at steady state with the model we investigate how different modes of patch removal affect the robustness of dispersal networks with contrasting heterogeneities to habitat loss 3 results we first test how varying the extinction to colonization ratio e c at fixed c 0 05 affects species persistence in different dispersal networks without patch loss fig 1f in general increasing e c results in a monotonic decline in species abundance irrespective of network heterogeneity yet more heterogeneous networks allow a species to persist at higher values of e c interestingly as e c increases the ranking of dispersal networks according to their ability to sustain metapopulation abundance undergoes a shift the regular network with the lowest heterogeneity can maintain the highest global patch occupancy but only at low levels of e c 0 e c 1 5 at high levels of e c e c 1 5 networks with greater heterogeneity sustain the higher species patch occupancy with the highest occupancy being reached in the scale free network highest heterogeneity moreover discrepancy in maintaining species occupancy among these networks enlarges with increasing e c 1 5 thus both network heterogeneity and species life history trait e c interact to determine metapopulation viability next we investigate whether patch removal in different ways alters species persistence in different dispersal networks fig 2 again by varying e c with increasing e c removing patches randomly or removing the least connected patches yields similar metapopulation patterns as shown in fig 1f that is species in more heterogeneous networks can tolerate much higher e c ratios however this outcome is completely overturned when removing the most connected patches fig 2c i e now less heterogeneous networks can maintain higher species occupancy in spite of variation in e c more specifically the regular network supports the highest species abundance while species in the scale free network are most sensitivity to an increase of e c thus different patch removal modes lead to contrasting metapopulation patterns depending on network heterogeneity in the regular network three types of patch removal expectedly yield the same species occupancy as e c increases fig s1 in appendix yet in the heterogeneous networks we observe that species can maintain the highest patch occupancy when the least connected patches are removed as opposed to the removal of most connected patches then we further systematically explore the effect of patch loss on metapopulation dynamics in different dispersal networks via random or selective removal fig 3 in general increasing patch loss results in a monotonic population decline irrespective of removal mode yet patch removal in different ways leads to different metapopulation patterns in different networks in regular networks species abundance is identical under different patch removal modes in heterogeneous networks including random exponential and scale free however global patch occupancy is highest when the least connected patches are removed first thereby maximizing species extinction thresholds in contrast when the most connected patches are removed first species are the most sensitive to patch loss and therefore go extinct soonest especially in the most heterogeneous networks i e scale free networks furthermore differences in sustaining species abundance under different modes of patch removal enlarge with increasing patch loss when comparing species persistence among different dispersal networks we observe that distinct patch removal ways lead to completely different species vulnerabilities to patch loss fig s2 in appendix to explain the above metapopulation patterns after patch loss we finally analyze the network structural properties including the largest cluster size s fraction of remaining links l cluster size distribution and average cluster size s figs 4 s3 s5 in appendix as patch loss f increases both the largest cluster size and fraction of remaining links decline monotonically while the average cluster size initially increases but then decreases peaking when the largest cluster size approaches zero compare figs 4 s5 however both spatial network heterogeneity and patch removal mode interact to modify these outcomes for example both network parameter values s and l overlap under different patch removal modes in the regular network yet in more heterogeneous networks removing the most connected patches leads to the rapidest decline in both the largest cluster size and the fraction of remaining patch links in contrast to the case of removing the least connected patches we further check the cluster size distribution by varying patch loss f 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 figs s3 s4 in appendix taking f 0 2 for example fig s3 we find that the cluster size distribution in the regular networks almost overlap among different patch removal modes in heterogeneous networks removing the most connected patches shapes a larger fraction of small clusters and consequently the largest cluster is much smaller than with other types of patch removal in contrast removing the least connected patches maximizes the largest cluster size 4 discussion in this study we find that species in more heterogeneous networks can persist across a wider range of extinction to colonization ratios e c i e network heterogeneity can greatly promote species persistence especially at higher e c ratios gilarranz and bascompte 2012 this suggests that previous models based on lattice structured or randomly structured networks may have overestimated species extinction risks as most species in nature display some degree of heterogeneity in dispersal networks rather than complete regularity or randomness furthermore the optimal dispersal heterogeneity for species viability is greatly mediated by life history trait e c specifically regular networks can maximize species abundance at low extinction probabilities whereas species with high extinction probabilities would perform better in more heterogeneous networks this can be explained from eq 1 each patch in regular networks has a high effective colonization probability at low e c ratios and all patches with an identical number of links have the same probability to support a population in heterogeneous networks the poorly connected patches have lower probabilities to be colonized than such patches in regular networks however as the extinction probability increases the highly connected patches in heterogeneous networks can be more easily occupied while the only four links of patches in regular networks are insufficient for establishment in other words increasing variation in patch links has a very strong positive effect on metapopulation capacity especially at high e c ratios in fact the effect of heterogeneity in connectivity can be analogous to the effect of heterogeneity in patch size or quality as species often prefer to colonize the large patches with good quality i e more connected patches while species in the small patches with poor quality i e less connected patches go extinct more easily as such species patch occupancy is a complex function of spatial network structure as well as species life history trait e c species can persist more easily in more heterogeneous networks with scale free exponential random regular yet whether this outcome still holds after patch loss is determined by patch removal mode figs 2 3 when removing patches randomly or removing the least connected patches we observe that species in more heterogeneous networks can tolerate much higher e c ratios in contrast to the case of removing the most connected patches fig 2 in addition more heterogeneous networks display stronger robustness to random patch loss fig 3 suggesting that previous models based on ideal regular or random dispersal networks may have underestimated species extinction thresholds however such strong tolerance to random removal comes at a high price in that these heterogeneous networks are extremely vulnerable to the removal of the most connected patches i e the keystone patches that play a vital role in preserving network connectivity as removing those most connected patches can directly lead to a rapid decline in the total number of connections among patches compared with other removal modes fig 4e h this does not occur in regular dispersal networks which are equally fragile whether patches are removed at random or in order of connectedness fig 3a as there is no initial variance in the number of links per patch following patch loss we further explore the underlying mechanism of metapopulation persistence by analyzing the network properties and find a strong positive correlation between overall metapopulation size and the largest cluster size fig 4 if we remove patches starting from the most connected ones the size of the largest cluster decreases more rapidly relative to other modes of patch removal though the average cluster size correspondingly increases to some degree fig s5 in appendix in such case these networks can quickly break into many small isolated clusters even when only a few of the most connected patches are lost figs s3 s4 in appendix given the possibility of local populations becoming extinct the ability of species to recolonize these extirpated patches via dispersal is critical to metapopulation viability yet the isolation between clusters can greatly decrease patch recolonization opportunities by impeding species movement across the entire network thereby reducing metapopulation persistence thus both the largest cluster size and the fraction of links remaining after patch removal determine the maximum population capacity in the whole network concerning species conservation and management the gain or loss of habitat patches is central to landscape change in general and land management in particular jordán et al 2007 vasas et al 2009 to date much effort has been put on increasing habitat connectivity and corridors to promote species persistence tischendorf and fahrig 2000 fahrig 2003 crooks and sanjayan 2006 however these actions do not explicitly include species dispersal networks with heterogeneity combining both network based and metapopulation approaches our findings suggest that we should focus on considering dispersal network structure e g linking heterogeneity among patches and on identifying a set of most preferential patches which are highly connected since these so called keystone patches could act as source patches for and thus connect the rest of a functional patch network urban and keitt 2001 kininmonth et al 2010 in addition the loss of these keystone patches would maximally disrupt dispersal interaction among patches and more easily drive species to extinction as such optimizing patch networks would be an effective conservation strategy for endangered species for instance phillips et al 2008 have already applied network optimization in the cape province of south africa to find the optimal connections between existing habitat patches for the flora however several limitations should be addressed when our model is applied to terrestrial ecosystems firstly although recently there have been a large number of studies on scale free networks actual patch mosaics seem to not quite fit the definitions of these well studied networks in particular the geography seems to constrain patch networks so that they tend to not include the extremely connected patches that characterize scale free networks urban et al 2009 secondly it may be inappropriate to apply a graph representation for some landscapes if habitat patches are poorly resolved spatially urban and keitt 2001 for example habitat quality varies continuously and subtly over the landscape thus aggregating this variability into discrete patches would be inappropriate e g liao et al 2013b combining metapopulation theory and network analysis we explore the responses of dispersal networks to both random and selective patch removal finding that heterogeneous networks are very robust against random removal but can be extremely fragile when selecting and removing the keystone patches this study thus provides a conceptual framework to quantify the robustness of a patchy population to habitat loss in heterogeneous networks indicating that preserving the keystone patches is critical to landscape connectivity and hence species persistence future work based on assembly models of multispecies dispersal networks

24873,the new paradigm regarding the role of urban infrastructures related to the urban water cycle in cities is based on three strategies improving water use efficiency avoiding water contamination and restoring natural water streams achieving an improved water balance in cities is an ambitious objective that involves the naturalisation of cities and in the specific case of consolidated areas the multiplication of green spaces by developing green areas scattered by public roads the water in and out the city gardens is modelled for the first time by including the water necessities of the plants this work presents a methodology to assess new urbanistic projects by means of adapting the calculation of the water footprint developed by hoekstra and chapagain the latter is most commonly applied to the agricultural sector and it is adapted for the evaluation of a street project in seville spain the estimation of the water balance of an urban system in the presence of greenery with a biophysical perspective and a spatiotemporal scale based on the incorporation of local data and water consumption in the urban sector until now has been scarcely explored the model developed helps to differentiate urbanisation projects both to identify those alternatives that are best suited to each urban environment and to define specific objectives and subsequently to predict the resilience of solutions using the local scenarios keywords water footprint city gargden sustainable construction green water urbanization 1 introduction the foundations on which the current economic system is based are represented by the valuation of materials energy and water and their contribution to the welfare of society all this entails the need to consider the environmental dimension as a key element to give a sustainable approach to any economic activity through the introduction of environmental indicators that allow the quantification of the impact in the particular case of the construction sector it is responsible for the consumption of more than 40 of natural resources including a significant share of wood and water consumption in the world and 30 of energy while producing more than 30 of greenhouse gas emissions cuchí et al 2010 according to the united nations environment programme 2006 buildings and their associated industries consume 30 of the world s available freshwater despite a threefold increase in water abstraction over the past 50 years pnuma consumption by 2025 is expected to increase by 50 in developed countries and 18 in developing countries delgado ramos 2014 these consumption rates coupled with future climate change projections predict that by 2025 1 8 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity and two thirds of the population will live in water stressed conditions un water 2018 this situation is aggravated by increasing pollution which causes the quality of freshwater to decline another factor to be considered is the hydrological alteration due to the effect of climate change which results in modifications of freshwater location prediction models and historical trends estimate that by 2050 the availability of water will increase in high latitudes and tropical areas and decrease in mid latitudes and dry regions ipcc 2013 nelson et al 2010 analysing these problems from the urban metabolism perspective identified by wolman 1965 it is possible to deepen the paradigm of the urban sustainability of our cities this is closely linked to the pressure we exert on the natural environment and the search for a new urbanism that efficiently manages metabolic resources imitating the circular metabolism of nature where water can be recycled and reused breaking the cycle of the current and inefficient system based on linear metabolism in spain policies that contribute to a paradigm shift are developed in order to meet the objectives set by the water framework directive dma 2000 and the basin hydrological plans valid from 2015 to 2021 phc 2015 these objectives were set for the planning and proper management of water resources with guidelines aimed not only at satisfying the demand in sufficient quantities but also at improving the resource quality and guaranteeing future supply under criteria of sustainable development the objectives established in the hydrological plans together with the limitations presented by the traditional model of the urban water cycle uwc which is based on a linear design highlight the need to develop methodologies that make it possible to integrate into the evaluation indicators that take certain aspects into account such as the direct and indirect consumption of water the origin of the water consumed and the incorporation of a new asset grey and rainwater which reduce the demand for water by improving the efficiency of its use the paradigm shift in the relationship of urban infrastructure with uwc is based on three strategies improving water efficiency preventing water pollution and restoring natural waterways gaffron et al 2008 achieving the water balance of cities sarté 2010 is an ambitious objective that involves the naturalisation of cities and in the specific case of consolidated areas the multiplication of green spaces through the development of small green areas scattered by public roads although it is possible to apply various methodologies for the environmental assessment in the construction sector such as energy analysis meillaud et al 2005 and material flow analysis sinivuori and saari 2006 there is currently a tendency to use simpler methodologies so that society can easily understand them and thereby enhance their transfer cagiao et al 2011 these easy to understand methodologies include the well known carbon footprint cf which makes it possible to quantify the totality of greenhouse gases ghg emitted by the direct or indirect effect of a given activity its close relationship with the objectives of the kyoto protocol 1998 together with its ease of application in environmental decision making and policies bare et al 2000 have been key to the success of the indicator as for water analysis the concept of water footprint wf developed by hoekstra 2003 based on the concept of virtual water proposed by allan 1993 was formulated as an indicator of the water consumed directly and indirectly in any productive process it was developed and standardised following the publication of the standard calculation methodology hoekstra et al 2009 and the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 and disseminated by the water footprint network wfn the value of the wf indicator as a decision making tool is mainly recognised in productive sectors such as agriculture and livestock however few studies use this indicator in construction adapting the indicator to the construction sector can provide an instrument capable of predicting from the design phase the future environmental impact of the uwc infrastructure for its entire life cycle according to hoekstra and chapagain 2011 the water footprint of the growth of green areas must be estimated using the sum of its three components differentiated by colours green blue and grey these serve to distinguish water phases that are not entirely equal in terms of access potential use or quality the green component of the water footprint is the water used by plants from rainfall and stored in the soil the blue component is the fresh water groundwater and or irrigation consumed by plants and then transpired the grey component of the water footprint is the volume of water that is not used by the plants which becomes runoff reaching the urban sewer system both from rainfall and from the inefficiency of the irrigation method used hoekstra 2019 blue water resources are scarce and have higher costs than green water which has always been the reason for focusing all studies on blue water footprint accounting however green water resources are also finite and scarce which seems to be an important argument for not neglecting the green water footprint in addition depending on the use blue water can be replaced by green water especially in the case of the maintenance of green areas within the urban nucleus so that from the accounting of both a calculation can be obtained that helps to understand what could be done with this resource this is the argument for including the use of green water as an important production factor even though historically the engineering of blue water has underestimated green water falkenmark 2003 rockström 2001 examples of its calculation are generally in the agricultural sector at the national scale level rodríguez casado et al 2008 based on averages and at the hydrological basin scale level aldaya and llamas 2008 salmoral et al 2012 but on the local scale and specifically at the urban level there are no representative examples since there is no systematised information or it is incomplete on water consumption in the urban sector this makes it necessary to adopt a water balance method that is appropriate for the local level which also requires local input data that provide an accurate calculation the methodology developed by fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations allen et al 1998 incorporates different sources in order to adapt it in the best possible way to the actual green areas in the urban system and achieves precision in the results this methodological proposal for estimating water consumption in green areas is used for the particular case of an integral urban intervention project to optimise environmental urban health and social parameters within the framework of the integral water cycle in the unique setting of avenue el greco in seville spain carried out by public initiative for this the calculation of the water footprint developed by hoekstra and chapagain is used to estimate the water balance of the urban system in the presence of green areas with a biophysical perspective and a spatiotemporal scale based on the incorporation of local data this adds a degree of precision to the results on water consumption in the urban sector that until now has been scarcely explored and provides a measurable environmental indicator that helps to differentiate the possible interventions to be projected both to identify the alternatives that best adapt to each urban environment and to monitor compliance with the programmed objectives and subsequently to predict the resilience of the solutions evaluated by recreating local scenarios of climate change in the short medium and long term ipcc 2013 2 methodology in order to assess the water footprint of green areas a study of the system formed by soil and plants has been carried out in general the water inputs and outputs of the system over time are not constant and therefore the moisture content of the soil will change depending on the water balance water inflows are due to the natural supply of water through rain and the artificial supply of water through irrigation the outflows are due to the consumption of water that occurs during the process of growth and development of the plants the process of cooling or thermal regulation to adapt to changing climatic conditions runoff and deep filtration according to hoekstra and chapagain 2011 the water footprint of the growth of green areas must be estimated using the sum of its three components differentiated by colours green blue and grey eq 1 these serve to distinguish water phases that are not entirely equal in terms of access possibility of use or quality therefore the water footprint of the garden wfg or urban green area is estimated as follows 1 wfg wfg blue wfg green wfg grey wfg water footprint of a garden m3 wfg blue blue component of the water footprint of a garden m3 wfg green green component of the water footprint of a garden m3 wfg grey grey component of the water footprint of a garden m3 the green component of the water footprint of a garden or green area wfg green m3 m2 is the volume of water used by plants from rainfall and stored in the soil the blue component wfg blue m3 m2 is the volume of fresh water consumed by plants and then transpired from surface and groundwater sources irrigation the grey component of the water footprint of a garden or green area wfg grey m3 m2 is the volume of water that is not used by the plants which becomes runoff reaching the urban sewer system both from rainfall and from the inefficiency of the irrigation method used for a better understanding in fig 1 the model of the water balance of the soil and the water flowing in and out of the soil is presented for the case of a rain garden based on the accounting developed for crops hoekstra 2019 2 1 the demand for water plants absorb water mainly as a means of dilution and transportation of nutrients that exist in the soil only a small part almost insignificant of that water is retained and used for the realisation of photosynthesis and for the growth process of the plant mostly once it has performed its function in the transportation of nutrients and is eliminated by transpiration in addition from the most superficial layers of the soil the water that is present there evaporates into the atmosphere due to the difficulty of separately quantifying the water used in the processes of plant transpiration and soil evaporation both are usually considered together in what is known as evapotranspiration et the water demand of plants or actual evapotranspiration of green areas and crops is quantified using the procedure proposed by fao doorenbos et al 1976 who introduces the key concepts in the agricultural field crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration eq 2 the last are adapted to the city garden in the following equations 2 etc kc eto etc crop evapotranspiration kc coefficient specific to each crop eto evapotranspiration of a reference crop calculated for each area with an evaporation bucket class a alternative method to estimate the evapotranspiration of low cost and high diffusion within many production plots doorenbos and pruitt 1977 the crop coefficient kc is a corrective coefficient that encompasses the influence of the crop on evapotranspiration considering the effect of variations in the biophysical properties of the plant mainly height and soil cover throughout the growth cycle therefore this coefficient is not constant over time in agriculture the variations can be found in the amount of water consumed by the crops in each of the four phases of growth of the plant from sowing to harvesting and also in the concept of maximum productivity of the crop which translates into obtaining the maximum quantities and size of fruit 2 2 eto evapotranspiration of a reference crop the reference evapotranspiration eto which is expressed in millimetres of height of evapotranspirated water each day mm day captures the effect of the climate at a given point for an ideal crop it is used as a reference value and its estimation is made using meteorological information from the place of cultivation the reference evapotranspiration values eto have been calculated using the penman monteith method which is the most accepted by the scientific community for the estimation of crop evapotranspiration since it can be used without restrictions in all types of climates and is considered as a pattern souza et al 2014 in this case they were obtained from the cropwat program developed by fao climwat 2018 which allows to calculate the irrigation needs of crops based on soil climate and crop data and in case the water needed is not covered by rainfall inputs it is necessary to add irrigation climatic data are obtained from the statistics of institutes or agencies and from the data collected by the meteorological station closest to the study location to ensure greater accuracy the fao climwat database has been used for this purpose climwat 2018 weather stations are equipped with radiation humidity temperature and wind speed sensors which provide the necessary data for the eto calculation maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and duration of sunshine 2 3 adapting the crop coefficient to the garden coefficient the cropwat database provides crop coefficients based on data from fao publications however in this database not all crops are included nor is it suitable for green areas and gardens it is not possible to make precise calculations with this database because the conditions in a garden are very different from those existing in agriculture the main differences are firstly gardens and green areas are generally formed by more than one species and within the same landscaped area they are arranged at different heights trees shrubs and herbaceous each with its particular irrigation needs secondly the density of vegetation is not uniform in all areas producing greater losses of water in some areas than in others and they are also areas that are free of vegetation where soil evaporation increases and lastly in gardens and green areas there is a microclimate effect caused by their relative situation with respect to surrounding buildings that can produce shading predominance of winds location of paved areas road traffic etc on this basis the garden coefficient cg method is used the fundamentals of which are identical to the method described above but it introduces modifications to calculate the garden evapotranspiration etg expressed in eq 3 3 etg cg eto etg garden evapotranspiration cg specific coefficient for each garden eto evapotranspiration of a reference crop calculated for each the reference evapotranspiration eto in mm is the same used in the previous equation the coefficient of the garden cg is a correcting factor which takes into account the water needs of green areas and gardens so that they have a healthy appearance and adequate growth therefore the concept of maximum productivity is replaced by the concept of adequate aesthetics to achieve optimum results with minimum quantities of water and proportionally much lower than those applied to crops the species factor fs the density factor fd and the microclimate factor fm take these conditions into account eq 4 this garden coefficient describes the variations in the amount of water consumed by plants as they develop so it is not a constant this value can change depending on the stage of growth of the plant germination growth flowering pruning and end of its vegetative cycle the garden coefficient considered is an average calculated for an annual period 4 cg fs fd fm cg specific coefficient for each garden fs species factor fd density factor fm microclimate factor 2 4 species factor this coefficient includes the calculation of water requirements taking into account the particularities of each botanical species table 1 shows the intervals for each type of species depending on the water needs the species in ideal conditions for xero gardening or not requiring irrigation will have a value of fs within the very low range and in the case of species that require a continuous presence of water to maintain aesthetics a value of fs is applied and included within the high range as far as the acquisition of these data is concerned one can resort to a publication of costello s team carried out in 1999 with a list of 1800 species iii manual wucols water use classification of landscape species costello and jones 2000 when choosing the value of fs it should be borne in mind that this database refers to climatic zones in california and this means that it may have a different value of fs if it is found in our climatic zone of study or another one due to the fact that the same species depending on temperature may vary in terms of its water needs contreras et al 2006 once the methodology for calculating the fsi value of each species is determined the weighted average fs of the hydro zone is determined by taking into account the particularities of each garden the norm is that in the same location there will be a combination of similar species and water needs in the case of an area with several species and different water needs a value slightly lower than the highest fsi will be used to avoid damaging the species with the lowest needs and at the same time without significantly reducing the species with the highest water demand 2 5 density factor this coefficient encompasses the calculation of water requirements taking into account the grouping of plants so that the greater the density of the plant mass the greater the evaporation rate table 2 shows the intervals for each configuration their lowest application value corresponds to the case of species in isolation and up to the highest value for plantations grouped in several levels and high density coverage considering as such the massive presence of the three levels of vegetation defined in the fao land cover classification system lccs the arboreal shrub and herbaceous which are low medium and high respectively di gregorio 2005 2 6 microclimate factor this coefficient covers the calculation of water needs taking into account the urban microclimate and considering factors such as the shade of buildings the protection from the prevailing wind the presence of heat sources such as traffic and the massive presence of pavements its lowest value is 0 4 and is used in the case of protected areas covered by the shade cast by buildings and other green areas at its highest value it is 1 4 for plantations exposed to external sources of heat such as areas with a high level of traffic or exposed to inclement weather and away from the shelter of a building see table 3 2 7 effective rainfall with respect to rainfall we cannot consider the total monthly rainfall since all the rain that falls is not usable by the plants the concept of effective rainfall is therefore introduced which takes into account three factors first that if the rain is violent rain rate 60 mm per hour viñas et al 2015 then part of the water is percolated in depth and is not stored at root level second that if it is heavy rain rate is between 15 mm and 60 mm per hour part of it is not infiltrated and it is lost through runoff and finally if the precipitation flow is scarce moderate or light rate 15 mm per hour it evaporates at soil level rigorous determination of effective rainfall can be very complex so simplified methods are usually used in this case it was decided to use the simple method of curve number cn from the soil conservation service natural resources conservation service of usda of scs p nrcs 2004 whose model of the rainfall runoff relationship is very simple since it applies a reduction factor for different intervals of rainfall which was developed from records of rainfall and runoff in 24 hours and thus does not explicitly consider the temporal variation of the runoff 2 8 garden water requirements the irrigation water requirements of a crop or in our case of a green area or garden are determined by the water balance method proposed by fao which considers the losses and gains that exist in a crop in this case the simplifications applied mean that they are considered negligible water losses due to deep filtration runoff and gains from capillary water therefore in order to achieve water balance evapotranspiration losses must be compensated by the sum of rainfall and irrigation water eq 5 this simplification is also supported by the very definition that a well designed irrigation system is one in which there is neither runoff nor deep filtration 5 etg pef gwr etg garden evapotranspiration pef effective rainfall in the area mm gwr garden irrigation water requirement mm the resources to meet the water demand of a garden for evapotranspiration etg for a given period are first achieved through effective rainfall pef this fraction is called precipitation water available by the plant rwa rain water available on the one hand in periods where the difference between rainwater and evapotranspiration is positive there is a surplus of rainwater rws rain water surplus with respect to the amount that the plant does not use this amount of water that remains in the soil that is not usable by the plants or that reaches its withering point lanza espino 1999 becomes grey water or percolated water but it also creates an opportunity if it is used as a resource for other uses on the other hand in periods where the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration is negative the water deficit or water needs of the garden gwr garden water requirement can be covered by providing irrigation all the calculations can be made monthly every fortnight or every ten months 2 9 the application of irrigation water once the natural hydric balance of the system is known in order for the plants to evolve optimally and for the set to be maintained in the most suitable way it is necessary to know the best way to apply the irrigation of each hydro zone landscaped and delimited area with similar water requirements the most suitable moment and for this purpose the quantity of water required this is because in the same surroundings there are a series of external conditioning factors that can affect this quantification to a lesser or greater extent and can condition the need to provide an extra quantity of water when calculating gross water requirements nb at least two factors must be taken into account the fact that irrigation systems are not fully effective and the presence of salts to a large extent the percentage of water that the roots of the plants use in relation to the total applied depends on the method used and its efficiency it is not the same to apply the water in a localised and underground way as opposed to a superficial way the application efficiency coefficient ea takes into account both runoff filtration and evaporation of water attributed to the irrigation system used the following coefficients can be considered as values for the efficiency of the irrigation method used at guidance level as shown in table 4 making an adequate design of the irrigation system considering the percentage of water that plant roots use with respect to the total water applied provides different efficiency factors in gardening with surface irrigation the range of losses can reach up to 50 compared to localised underground irrigation where losses may not reach 5 another significant aspect is the irrigation water salinity if the soil is very salty it requires the contribution of an extra amount of water for washing salt and makes it necessary to consider a new calculation of irrigation water the washing fraction fl the value to choose is always that of the least salt tolerant species once both application efficiency and washing requirements are known the gross requirements are calculated using the expression of eq 6 6 nb gwr e a 1 f l 100 nb gross water requirement mm gwr garden irrigation water requirement or net irrigation requirement mm ea irrigation application efficiency factor in points to one fl washing fraction in points to one but as the water that is lost by deep filtration also undergoes a process of washing salts depending on the type of irrigation that is applied it may be the case that this expression may be greater furthermore since the goal is to quantify the minimum amount of irrigation needed to achieve a healthy looking garden depending on whether it is a localised or sprinkler system for localised irrigation eqs 7 and 8 7 wf grey i 1 n r w s i i 1 n i w s i 8 if e a 1 f l then nb g w r 1 f l 100 for sprinkler irrigation eqs 9 and 10 9 if e a 1 f l then nb g w r e

model considers obtaining all the necessary parameters precision is achieved with the help of existing literature and gardening databases then with this quantitative information different scenarios can be estimated to evaluate changes in water demand as well as the introduction of measures to be adopted which allows it to be considered as a valid tool for calculating water volumes associated with gardening green areas in urban areas next we apply the exposed model to the ten hydro zones described in the example in table 5 with their corresponding covered areas 3 model application case study it shows the applicability of the methodology described to a practical case for this purpose the renovation project of the sewerage facilities and supply in an avenue in the city of seville was chosen the avenue currently has garden areas with consolidated and large specimens and the project expands and rearranges these existing spaces by carrying out a complete transformation the pedestrian area will increase from 36 of the current surface area to 54 the shaded areas from 2685 m2 to 7821 m2 and the steelwork from 8952 m2 to 13 370 m2 fig 3 the size of the street is representative of spain urban landscape where small narrow streets are surrounded by a mix of business shops and housings the most characteristic constructions are four floor buildings mercader moyano 2010 the soil is of medium low permeability formed by topsoil 50 bark 21 white peat 20 pomace 5 and volcanic stone 4 on a base of vegetable soil 100 and a draining sub base formed by crushing aggregate 4 20 mm as described in the project documentation the infiltrated water and runoff are collected in buried tanks for later irrigation during dry seasons systems with sustainable drainage technology or areas designed to collect rainwater and runoff through sustainable urban drainage systems wsud bioswales areas and rain gardens have been incorporated the permeability of the soil reduces runoff volumes and peak flows as well as producing them at a slower rate while at the same time reducing the pollutant load of the runoff water the street belongs to a torrential rain collection zone which ends in storm tanks located on kansas city avenue the hydraulic design which includes bioswales evacuates excess rainwater a cross section is included in fig 3 the proposed model assesses ten hydro zones described in table 5 the plants come from local plantations in the province the selection is based on the local needs of the street such as reducing the effect of traffic species are used as a natural windbreak in order to reduce solar radiation on nearby buildings deciduous and evergreen species are alternated in general they are all native species autochthonous resistant to water stress other species are included for ornamental interest of the garden such as roses and kikuyo pennisetum clandestinum together with other pre existing invasive specimens preserved such as gaura lindheimeri and dipladenia sundeville the rooting layer of the plants is over an underground drainage system the depth of the roots establishes the depth of the drainage pipe collocation and the tolerance to flooding defines the slope of those pipelines its calculation has led to a variable average depth of the trench 0 60 to 1 00 m of soil and the arrangement is able to reduce 85 of the runoff the project extracts the data that define each of the green areas or hydro zones landscaped and delimited area with similar water requirements the varieties of species that compose it the configurations and densities of planting and the microclimate depending on its location and surroundings the conditioning factors for each case are determined and obtained by applying eq 4 the correction coefficient cg of the reference evapotranspiration eto so that they have a healthy appearance and adequate growth table 5 shows the calculated coefficients for the 10 differentiated hydro zones in the project for each hydro zone the corresponding garden coefficient is applied calculated to define its evapotranspiration etg taking into account that it is made up of numerous mixed species with different densities of vegetation and different microclimates due to the relative situation with respect to buildings and the paved areas in each case table 6 shows as an example the calculation of the garden evapotranspiration of hydro zone 1 for this study data from weather station no 1381 sevilla tablada is used see fig 4 the effective rainfall is obtained from the total monthly rainfall applying the simple method of curve number nrcs 2004 see table 7 the quantification of the flows of the system s natural water balance is obtained from the application of eq 5 table 8 shows the quantification of hydro zone 1 autochthonous mixed shrubs in intervals expressed by months graphically figs 5 6 and 7 represent h1 autochthonous mixed shrubs h5 ornamental rose bushes and h10 non autochthonous grasses respectively the effective annual rainfall green area the evapotranspiration of each monthly hydro zone green bars and the water requirements of the garden by months blue bars hydro zones take advantage of the rainfall that occurs from october to march requiring an input of irrigation water from april for ornamental plants hydro zone 5 from may for lawn areas hydro zone 10 and from june for areas with lower water demand hydro zone 1 all the irrigation ends in september also noteworthy is the high demand for water from some areas over others depending on the ability to resist high temperatures along with the periods of drought that occur during the summer season in seville once the gross water requirements are known it is possible to determine in a specific way at which times the irrigation will be carried out and the quantities of water that will be applied at each moment by means of a calendar for the whole year the results of h1 autochthonous mixed shrubs are shown in table 8 an automated irrigation system is installed organised in two independent sites although connected by means of a bypass that allows complete service to be provided in the event of a fault or lack of flow in any of them the irrigation network starts from an existing irrigation well that connects with two 120 m3 capacity cisterns that will each supply its area by means of an integrated self compensating drip system for both the flowerbeds in the northern area arboreal shrub and herbaceous and the bioswales on each side of the roadway and another drip system for the irrigation of the permeable pavement areas which also has a second complementary irrigation system or support by means of a network of adjustable emerging sprinklers a system of valves organises the irrigation by sectors allowing the adjustment of consumptions and pressures according to the demand 4 results 4 1 green water footprint the green water footprint of the garden wfg green is the volume of rainwater that is not converted into runoff so it is stored in the superficial permeable strata and thus satisfies the demand of the vegetation this shallow groundwater is what allows the existence of natural vegetation and returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration processes the results of eqs 11 and 12 are included in table 9 4 2 blue water footprint the blue water footprint of the garden wfg blue is the volume of fresh water extracted from a surface or groundwater source consumed to produce goods and services covering a demand for unsatisfied water due to a deficit in the availability of rainwater the eq 12 determines garden water requirements gwr of each hydro zone see table 9 in the project this demand will be met by the irrigation network which is supplied by two cisterns that store rainwater collected by drainage ditches rain gardens and wsud in addition the system has a water well for irrigation for those times when the cisterns do not reach the minimum level 4 3 grey water footprint the grey water footprint of the garden wfg grey is the volume of clean water necessary to dissolve the pollution in order to do not exceed the contamination thresholds in the water basin per current legislation it is calculated as the theoretical additional volume of water needed in the receiving body so it does not resort to generating new consumption but to reducing the volume of the pollutant in this section the return of irrigation water is quantified first which is conditioned by the efficiency of the irrigation system and the fraction of soil washing as well as the excess rainwater that the plant does not use this wastewater is the result of the sum of the products of the volumes of water from the excess rainwater rws and the returns of irrigation water iwr of each hydro zone multiplied by the corresponding surfaces occupied in both cases the quality of the water is considered the same so that the same treatment can be given either to allocate it to other uses not considered until now allowing the continued application of the water resource of other users or returning to the land what originally corresponds to it the quantification of this volume see table 9 and the quality index are the necessary parameters to quantify the volume of additional theoretical dilution water required for the calculation of the garden s grey footprint the distribution of the volumes calculated for each of the hydro zones fig 8 is taken from the example it is seen in the hydro zone where xero gardening is applied that the proportion of consumption of blue water or irrigation is minimal just as it does not need water from rainfall so the water not used by the system becomes wastewater and in turn it is an opportunity to study the minimum quality requirements for water reuse promoting the development of a circular economy and the recharge of aquifers on the other hand in the rest of the hydro zones the supply of irrigation water is essential especially in the summer period reducing the proportions of wastewater by the use that the plant makes of rainwater in winter in the case of valuing irrigation water in the event that there is no application of fertilisers or pesticides for the care of plants in urban green areas it will not be taken into account in the calculation of the grey footprint caused by diffuse pollution of the maintenance activity of hydro zones 5 conclusion the increase in green areas in the city implies an increase in water demand which is directly related to plant species density and relative disposition within the street with respect to existing buildings it is also related to the local climate and the availability of water resources the impossibility of irrigating green areas in periods of persistent drought and the effect of seasonality can influence the selection of vegetation resistant to water scarcity in this case the choice of autochthonous plants hydro zones 1 2 3 and 4 means that the plant does not require irrigation for much of the year and therefore there is a surplus of rainwater so the grey water footprint increases non native species hydro zones 5 7 and 8 need fresh water for irrigation i e the blue water footprint increases even the choice of grass hydro zone 10 given its high water requirements can determine a regressive dynamic including infrastructures that take advantage of rainwater for irrigation provides the necessary water resources for the conservation of these spaces in the case study the traditional impermeable pavement is reduced and replaced by a sustainable urban drainage system that allows rainwater to be collected for storage in cisterns and used to irrigate the landscaped areas of the street with efficient distribution systems according to the demand of the species present in each area and with the demand for water being reduced exclusively during the summer periods the volume of water relieved i e the precipitated water that is discharged into the sanitation network to leave the system in times of torrential rain is very high 89 it could be reduced by increasing the volume of storage capacity of the system but in this case the lack of space does not allow it a design based strategy has been employed to make maximum use of the water from rainfall collected in the area in order to reduce the contribution from fresh water to 50 the project alternates hydro zones with different demands and with it it is possible to distribute the available rainwater while compensating the surplus of the autochthonous species with the high water requirements of the ornamental species this is achieved with an irrigation system adapted and automated for each area thus reducing the blue and grey traces of the whole system the methodology proposed for the estimation of the water consumption of green areas is applied to an actual case study of an integral urban intervention project to optimise the environment and sanitation within the framework of the integral water cycle located in avenue el greco seville and a public initiative by emasesa public water company of seville the quantification of the water footprint of urban green areas in a consolidated landscape provides robust and locally based data for the technical assessment of new projects including the analysis of strategies in order to improve the management of the water urban cycle which takes into consideration the uncertainty associated with climate change large infrastructure projects based on conventional and intensive water management models can be assessed by incorporating decentralised calculations which include natural and artificial drainage systems and gardening nature is an indicative factor of urban quality and is therefore an important part of the political agenda of cities which leads to a growing concern of urban planning professionals to increase urban green infrastructure the analysis of the typologies of these infrastructures urban gardens parks squares landscaped roofs vertical gardens urban orchard gardens etc of the climatic characteristics temperatures rainfall evapotranspiration and of the characteristics of the gardens surface type and density of species allows studies to estimate the water needs of these new urban spaces and is of vital importance when planning the present and future water demand of cities this impact is accentuated if we are located in a region with scarce water resources and long periods of drought the model allows to incorporate future local climate data obtained by projecting climate evolutions for different gas emission scenarios which also makes it a valid tool for measuring sensitivity to climate change and therefore to assess impacts and vulnerability of systems related to the urban water cycle in future work climate change will be introduced in the estimation of temperature and rainfall in order to evaluate the impacts and vulnerability of each one of the

24873,the new paradigm regarding the role of urban infrastructures related to the urban water cycle in cities is based on three strategies improving water use efficiency avoiding water contamination and restoring natural water streams achieving an improved water balance in cities is an ambitious objective that involves the naturalisation of cities and in the specific case of consolidated areas the multiplication of green spaces by developing green areas scattered by public roads the water in and out the city gardens is modelled for the first time by including the water necessities of the plants this work presents a methodology to assess new urbanistic projects by means of adapting the calculation of the water footprint developed by hoekstra and chapagain the latter is most commonly applied to the agricultural sector and it is adapted for the evaluation of a street project in seville spain the estimation of the water balance of an urban system in the presence of greenery with a biophysical perspective and a spatiotemporal scale based on the incorporation of local data and water consumption in the urban sector until now has been scarcely explored the model developed helps to differentiate urbanisation projects both to identify those alternatives that are best suited to each urban environment and to define specific objectives and subsequently to predict the resilience of solutions using the local scenarios keywords water footprint city gargden sustainable construction green water urbanization 1 introduction the foundations on which the current economic system is based are represented by the valuation of materials energy and water and their contribution to the welfare of society all this entails the need to consider the environmental dimension as a key element to give a sustainable approach to any economic activity through the introduction of environmental indicators that allow the quantification of the impact in the particular case of the construction sector it is responsible for the consumption of more than 40 of natural resources including a significant share of wood and water consumption in the world and 30 of energy while producing more than 30 of greenhouse gas emissions cuchí et al 2010 according to the united nations environment programme 2006 buildings and their associated industries consume 30 of the world s available freshwater despite a threefold increase in water abstraction over the past 50 years pnuma consumption by 2025 is expected to increase by 50 in developed countries and 18 in developing countries delgado ramos 2014 these consumption rates coupled with future climate change projections predict that by 2025 1 8 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity and two thirds of the population will live in water stressed conditions un water 2018 this situation is aggravated by increasing pollution which causes the quality of freshwater to decline another factor to be considered is the hydrological alteration due to the effect of climate change which results in modifications of freshwater location prediction models and historical trends estimate that by 2050 the availability of water will increase in high latitudes and tropical areas and decrease in mid latitudes and dry regions ipcc 2013 nelson et al 2010 analysing these problems from the urban metabolism perspective identified by wolman 1965 it is possible to deepen the paradigm of the urban sustainability of our cities this is closely linked to the pressure we exert on the natural environment and the search for a new urbanism that efficiently manages metabolic resources imitating the circular metabolism of nature where water can be recycled and reused breaking the cycle of the current and inefficient system based on linear metabolism in spain policies that contribute to a paradigm shift are developed in order to meet the objectives set by the water framework directive dma 2000 and the basin hydrological plans valid from 2015 to 2021 phc 2015 these objectives were set for the planning and proper management of water resources with guidelines aimed not only at satisfying the demand in sufficient quantities but also at improving the resource quality and guaranteeing future supply under criteria of sustainable development the objectives established in the hydrological plans together with the limitations presented by the traditional model of the urban water cycle uwc which is based on a linear design highlight the need to develop methodologies that make it possible to integrate into the evaluation indicators that take certain aspects into account such as the direct and indirect consumption of water the origin of the water consumed and the incorporation of a new asset grey and rainwater which reduce the demand for water by improving the efficiency of its use the paradigm shift in the relationship of urban infrastructure with uwc is based on three strategies improving water efficiency preventing water pollution and restoring natural waterways gaffron et al 2008 achieving the water balance of cities sarté 2010 is an ambitious objective that involves the naturalisation of cities and in the specific case of consolidated areas the multiplication of green spaces through the development of small green areas scattered by public roads although it is possible to apply various methodologies for the environmental assessment in the construction sector such as energy analysis meillaud et al 2005 and material flow analysis sinivuori and saari 2006 there is currently a tendency to use simpler methodologies so that society can easily understand them and thereby enhance their transfer cagiao et al 2011 these easy to understand methodologies include the well known carbon footprint cf which makes it possible to quantify the totality of greenhouse gases ghg emitted by the direct or indirect effect of a given activity its close relationship with the objectives of the kyoto protocol 1998 together with its ease of application in environmental decision making and policies bare et al 2000 have been key to the success of the indicator as for water analysis the concept of water footprint wf developed by hoekstra 2003 based on the concept of virtual water proposed by allan 1993 was formulated as an indicator of the water consumed directly and indirectly in any productive process it was developed and standardised following the publication of the standard calculation methodology hoekstra et al 2009 and the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 and disseminated by the water footprint network wfn the value of the wf indicator as a decision making tool is mainly recognised in productive sectors such as agriculture and livestock however few studies use this indicator in construction adapting the indicator to the construction sector can provide an instrument capable of predicting from the design phase the future environmental impact of the uwc infrastructure for its entire life cycle according to hoekstra and chapagain 2011 the water footprint of the growth of green areas must be estimated using the sum of its three components differentiated by colours green blue and grey these serve to distinguish water phases that are not entirely equal in terms of access potential use or quality the green component of the water footprint is the water used by plants from rainfall and stored in the soil the blue component is the fresh water groundwater and or irrigation consumed by plants and then transpired the grey component of the water footprint is the volume of water that is not used by the plants which becomes runoff reaching the urban sewer system both from rainfall and from the inefficiency of the irrigation method used hoekstra 2019 blue water resources are scarce and have higher costs than green water which has always been the reason for focusing all studies on blue water footprint accounting however green water resources are also finite and scarce which seems to be an important argument for not neglecting the green water footprint in addition depending on the use blue water can be replaced by green water especially in the case of the maintenance of green areas within the urban nucleus so that from the accounting of both a calculation can be obtained that helps to understand what could be done with this resource this is the argument for including the use of green water as an important production factor even though historically the engineering of blue water has underestimated green water falkenmark 2003 rockström 2001 examples of its calculation are generally in the agricultural sector at the national scale level rodríguez casado et al 2008 based on averages and at the hydrological basin scale level aldaya and llamas 2008 salmoral et al 2012 but on the local scale and specifically at the urban level there are no representative examples since there is no systematised information or it is incomplete on water consumption in the urban sector this makes it necessary to adopt a water balance method that is appropriate for the local level which also requires local input data that provide an accurate calculation the methodology developed by fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations allen et al 1998 incorporates different sources in order to adapt it in the best possible way to the actual green areas in the urban system and achieves precision in the results this methodological proposal for estimating water consumption in green areas is used for the particular case of an integral urban intervention project to optimise environmental urban health and social parameters within the framework of the integral water cycle in the unique setting of avenue el greco in seville spain carried out by public initiative for this the calculation of the water footprint developed by hoekstra and chapagain is used to estimate the water balance of the urban system in the presence of green areas with a biophysical perspective and a spatiotemporal scale based on the incorporation of local data this adds a degree of precision to the results on water consumption in the urban sector that until now has been scarcely explored and provides a measurable environmental indicator that helps to differentiate the possible interventions to be projected both to identify the alternatives that best adapt to each urban environment and to monitor compliance with the programmed objectives and subsequently to predict the resilience of the solutions evaluated by recreating local scenarios of climate change in the short medium and long term ipcc 2013 2 methodology in order to assess the water footprint of green areas a study of the system formed by soil and plants has been carried out in general the water inputs and outputs of the system over time are not constant and therefore the moisture content of the soil will change depending on the water balance water inflows are due to the natural supply of water through rain and the artificial supply of water through irrigation the outflows are due to the consumption of water that occurs during the process of growth and development of the plants the process of cooling or thermal regulation to adapt to changing climatic conditions runoff and deep filtration according to hoekstra and chapagain 2011 the water footprint of the growth of green areas must be estimated using the sum of its three components differentiated by colours green blue and grey eq 1 these serve to distinguish water phases that are not entirely equal in terms of access possibility of use or quality therefore the water footprint of the garden wfg or urban green area is estimated as follows 1 wfg wfg blue wfg green wfg grey wfg water footprint of a garden m3 wfg blue blue component of the water footprint of a garden m3 wfg green green component of the water footprint of a garden m3 wfg grey grey component of the water footprint of a garden m3 the green component of the water footprint of a garden or green area wfg green m3 m2 is the volume of water used by plants from rainfall and stored in the soil the blue component wfg blue m3 m2 is the volume of fresh water consumed by plants and then transpired from surface and groundwater sources irrigation the grey component of the water footprint of a garden or green area wfg grey m3 m2 is the volume of water that is not used by the plants which becomes runoff reaching the urban sewer system both from rainfall and from the inefficiency of the irrigation method used for a better understanding in fig 1 the model of the water balance of the soil and the water flowing in and out of the soil is presented for the case of a rain garden based on the accounting developed for crops hoekstra 2019 2 1 the demand for water plants absorb water mainly as a means of dilution and transportation of nutrients that exist in the soil only a small part almost insignificant of that water is retained and used for the realisation of photosynthesis and for the growth process of the plant mostly once it has performed its function in the transportation of nutrients and is eliminated by transpiration in addition from the most superficial layers of the soil the water that is present there evaporates into the atmosphere due to the difficulty of separately quantifying the water used in the processes of plant transpiration and soil evaporation both are usually considered together in what is known as evapotranspiration et the water demand of plants or actual evapotranspiration of green areas and crops is quantified using the procedure proposed by fao doorenbos et al 1976 who introduces the key concepts in the agricultural field crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration eq 2 the last are adapted to the city garden in the following equations 2 etc kc eto etc crop evapotranspiration kc coefficient specific to each crop eto evapotranspiration of a reference crop calculated for each area with an evaporation bucket class a alternative method to estimate the evapotranspiration of low cost and high diffusion within many production plots doorenbos and pruitt 1977 the crop coefficient kc is a corrective coefficient that encompasses the influence of the crop on evapotranspiration considering the effect of variations in the biophysical properties of the plant mainly height and soil cover throughout the growth cycle therefore this coefficient is not constant over time in agriculture the variations can be found in the amount of water consumed by the crops in each of the four phases of growth of the plant from sowing to harvesting and also in the concept of maximum productivity of the crop which translates into obtaining the maximum quantities and size of fruit 2 2 eto evapotranspiration of a reference crop the reference evapotranspiration eto which is expressed in millimetres of height of evapotranspirated water each day mm day captures the effect of the climate at a given point for an ideal crop it is used as a reference value and its estimation is made using meteorological information from the place of cultivation the reference evapotranspiration values eto have been calculated using the penman monteith method which is the most accepted by the scientific community for the estimation of crop evapotranspiration since it can be used without restrictions in all types of climates and is considered as a pattern souza et al 2014 in this case they were obtained from the cropwat program developed by fao climwat 2018 which allows to calculate the irrigation needs of crops based on soil climate and crop data and in case the water needed is not covered by rainfall inputs it is necessary to add irrigation climatic data are obtained from the statistics of institutes or agencies and from the data collected by the meteorological station closest to the study location to ensure greater accuracy the fao climwat database has been used for this purpose climwat 2018 weather stations are equipped with radiation humidity temperature and wind speed sensors which provide the necessary data for the eto calculation maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and duration of sunshine 2 3 adapting the crop coefficient to the garden coefficient the cropwat database provides crop coefficients based on data from fao publications however in this database not all crops are included nor is it suitable for green areas and gardens it is not possible to make precise calculations with this database because the conditions in a garden are very different from those existing in agriculture the main differences are firstly gardens and green areas are generally formed by more than one species and within the same landscaped area they are arranged at different heights trees shrubs and herbaceous each with its particular irrigation needs secondly the density of vegetation is not uniform in all areas producing greater losses of water in some areas than in others and they are also areas that are free of vegetation where soil evaporation increases and lastly in gardens and green areas there is a microclimate effect caused by their relative situation with respect to surrounding buildings that can produce shading predominance of winds location of paved areas road traffic etc on this basis the garden coefficient cg method is used the fundamentals of which are identical to the method described above but it introduces modifications to calculate the garden evapotranspiration etg expressed in eq 3 3 etg cg eto etg garden evapotranspiration cg specific coefficient for each garden eto evapotranspiration of a reference crop calculated for each the reference evapotranspiration eto in mm is the same used in the previous equation the coefficient of the garden cg is a correcting factor which takes into account the water needs of green areas and gardens so that they have a healthy appearance and adequate growth therefore the concept of maximum productivity is replaced by the concept of adequate aesthetics to achieve optimum results with minimum quantities of water and proportionally much lower than those applied to crops the species factor fs the density factor fd and the microclimate factor fm take these conditions into account eq 4 this garden coefficient describes the variations in the amount of water consumed by plants as they develop so it is not a constant this value can change depending on the stage of growth of the plant germination growth flowering pruning and end of its vegetative cycle the garden coefficient considered is an average calculated for an annual period 4 cg fs fd fm cg specific coefficient for each garden fs species factor fd density factor fm

each type of species depending on the water needs the species in ideal conditions for xero gardening or not requiring irrigation will have a value of fs within the very low range and in the case of species that require a continuous presence of water to maintain aesthetics a value of fs is applied and included within the high range as far as the acquisition of these data is concerned one can resort to a publication of costello s team carried out in 1999 with a list of 1800 species iii manual wucols water use classification of landscape species costello and jones 2000 when choosing the value of fs it should be borne in mind that this database refers to climatic zones in california and this means that it may have a different value of fs if it is found in our climatic zone of study or another one due to the fact that the same species depending on temperature may vary in terms of its water needs contreras et al 2006 once the methodology for calculating the fsi value of each species is determined the weighted average fs of the hydro zone is determined by taking into account the particularities of each garden the norm is that in the same location there will be a combination of similar species and water needs in the case of an area with several species and different water needs a value slightly lower than the highest fsi will be used to avoid damaging the species with the lowest needs and at the same time without significantly reducing the species with the highest water demand 2 5 density factor this coefficient encompasses the calculation of water requirements taking into account the grouping of plants so that the greater the density of the plant mass the greater the evaporation rate table 2 shows the intervals for each configuration their lowest application value corresponds to the case of species in isolation and up to the highest value for plantations grouped in several levels and high density coverage considering as such the massive presence of the three levels of vegetation defined in the fao land cover classification system lccs the arboreal shrub and herbaceous which are low medium and high respectively di gregorio 2005 2 6 microclimate factor this coefficient covers the calculation of water needs taking into account the urban microclimate and considering factors such as the shade of buildings the protection from the prevailing wind the presence of heat sources such as traffic and the massive presence of pavements its lowest value is 0 4 and is used in the case of protected areas covered by the shade cast by buildings and other green areas at its highest value it is 1 4 for plantations exposed to external sources of heat such as areas with a high level of traffic or exposed to inclement weather and away from the shelter of a building see table 3 2 7 effective rainfall with respect to rainfall we cannot consider the total monthly rainfall since all the rain that falls is not usable by the plants the concept of effective rainfall is therefore introduced which takes into account three factors first that if the rain is violent rain rate 60 mm per hour viñas et al 2015 then part of the water is percolated in depth and is not stored at root level second that if it is heavy rain rate is between 15 mm and 60 mm per hour part of it is not infiltrated and it is lost through runoff and finally if the precipitation flow is scarce moderate or light rate 15 mm per hour it evaporates at soil level rigorous determination of effective rainfall can be very complex so simplified methods are usually used in this case it was decided to use the simple method of curve number cn from the soil conservation service natural resources conservation service of usda of scs p nrcs 2004 whose model of the rainfall runoff relationship is very simple since it applies a reduction factor for different intervals of rainfall which was developed from records of rainfall and runoff in 24 hours and thus does not explicitly consider the temporal variation of the runoff 2 8 garden water requirements the irrigation water requirements of a crop or in our case of a green area or garden are determined by the water balance method proposed by fao which considers the losses and gains that exist in a crop in this case the simplifications applied mean that they are considered negligible water losses due to deep filtration runoff and gains from capillary water therefore in order to achieve water balance evapotranspiration losses must be compensated by the sum of rainfall and irrigation water eq 5 this simplification is also supported by the very definition that a well designed irrigation system is one in which there is neither runoff nor deep filtration 5 etg pef gwr etg garden evapotranspiration pef effective rainfall in the area mm gwr garden irrigation water requirement mm the resources to meet the water demand of a garden for evapotranspiration etg for a given period are first achieved through effective rainfall pef this fraction is called precipitation water available by the plant rwa rain water available on the one hand in periods where the difference between rainwater and evapotranspiration is positive there is a surplus of rainwater rws rain water surplus with respect to the amount that the plant does not use this amount of water that remains in the soil that is not usable by the plants or that reaches its withering point lanza espino 1999 becomes grey water or percolated water but it also creates an opportunity if it is used as a resource for other uses on the other hand in periods where the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration is negative the water deficit or water needs of the garden gwr garden water requirement can be covered by providing irrigation all the calculations can be made monthly every fortnight or every ten months 2 9 the application of irrigation water once the natural hydric balance of the system is known in order for the plants to evolve optimally and for the set to be maintained in the most suitable way it is necessary to know the best way to apply the irrigation of each hydro zone landscaped and delimited area with similar water requirements the most suitable moment and for this purpose the quantity of water required this is because in the same surroundings there are a series of external conditioning factors that can affect this quantification to a lesser or greater extent and can condition the need to provide an extra quantity of water when calculating gross water requirements nb at least two factors must be taken into account the fact that irrigation systems are not fully effective and the presence of salts to a large extent the percentage of water that the roots of the plants use in relation to the total applied depends on the method used and its efficiency it is not the same to apply the water in a localised and underground way as opposed to a superficial way the application efficiency coefficient ea takes into account both runoff filtration and evaporation of water attributed to the irrigation system used the following coefficients can be considered as values for the efficiency of the irrigation method used at guidance level as shown in table 4 making an adequate design of the irrigation system considering the percentage of water that plant roots use with respect to the total water applied provides different efficiency factors in gardening with surface irrigation the range of losses can reach up to 50 compared to localised underground irrigation where losses may not reach 5 another significant aspect is the irrigation water salinity if the soil is very salty it requires the contribution of an extra amount of water for washing salt and makes it necessary to consider a new calculation of irrigation water the washing fraction fl the value to choose is always that of the least salt tolerant species once both application efficiency and washing requirements are known the gross requirements are calculated using the expression of eq 6 6 nb gwr e a 1 f l 100 nb gross water requirement mm gwr garden irrigation water requirement or net irrigation requirement mm ea irrigation application efficiency factor in points to one fl washing fraction in points to one but as the water that is lost by deep filtration also undergoes a process of washing salts depending on the type of irrigation that is applied it may be the case that this expression may be greater furthermore since the goal is to quantify the minimum amount of irrigation needed to achieve a healthy looking garden depending on whether it is a localised or sprinkler system for localised irrigation eqs 7 and 8 7 wf grey i 1 n r w s i i 1 n i w s i 8 if e a 1 f l then nb g w r 1 f l 100 for sprinkler irrigation eqs 9 and 10 9 if e a 1 f l then nb g w r e

model considers obtaining all the necessary parameters precision is achieved with the help of existing literature and gardening databases then with this quantitative information different scenarios can be estimated to evaluate changes in water demand as well as the introduction of measures to be adopted which allows it to be considered as a valid tool for calculating water volumes associated with gardening green areas in urban areas next we apply the exposed model to the ten hydro zones described in the example in table 5 with their corresponding covered areas 3 model application case study it shows the applicability of the methodology described to a practical case for this purpose the renovation project of the sewerage facilities and supply in an avenue in the city of seville was chosen the avenue currently has garden areas with consolidated and large specimens and the project expands and rearranges these existing spaces by carrying out a complete transformation the pedestrian area will increase from 36 of the current surface area to 54 the shaded areas from 2685 m2 to 7821 m2 and the steelwork from 8952 m2 to 13 370 m2 fig 3 the size of the street is representative of spain urban landscape where small narrow streets are surrounded by a mix of business shops and housings the most characteristic constructions are four floor buildings mercader moyano 2010 the soil is of medium low permeability formed by topsoil 50 bark 21 white peat 20 pomace 5 and volcanic stone 4 on a base of vegetable soil 100 and a draining sub base formed by crushing aggregate 4 20 mm as described in the project documentation the infiltrated water and runoff are collected in buried tanks for later irrigation during dry seasons systems with sustainable drainage technology or areas designed to collect rainwater and runoff through sustainable urban drainage systems wsud bioswales areas and rain gardens have been incorporated the permeability of the soil reduces runoff volumes and peak flows as well as producing them at a slower rate while at the same time reducing the pollutant load of the runoff water the street belongs to a torrential rain collection zone which ends in storm tanks located on kansas city avenue the hydraulic design which includes bioswales evacuates excess rainwater a cross section is included in fig 3 the proposed model assesses ten hydro zones described in table 5 the plants come from local plantations in the province the selection is based on the local needs of the street such as reducing the effect of traffic species are used as a natural windbreak in order to reduce solar radiation on nearby buildings deciduous and evergreen species are alternated in general they are all native species autochthonous resistant to water stress other species are included for ornamental interest of the garden such as roses and kikuyo pennisetum clandestinum together with other pre existing invasive specimens preserved such as gaura lindheimeri and dipladenia sundeville the rooting layer of the plants is over an underground drainage system the depth of the roots establishes the depth of the drainage pipe collocation and the tolerance to flooding defines the slope of those pipelines its calculation has led to a variable average depth of the trench 0 60 to 1 00 m of soil and the arrangement is able to reduce 85 of the runoff the project extracts the data that define each of the green areas or hydro zones landscaped and delimited area with similar water requirements the varieties of species that compose it the configurations and densities of planting and the microclimate depending on its location and surroundings the conditioning factors for each case are determined and obtained by applying eq 4 the correction coefficient cg of the reference evapotranspiration eto so that they have a healthy appearance and adequate growth table 5 shows the calculated coefficients for the 10 differentiated hydro zones in the project for each hydro zone the corresponding garden coefficient is applied calculated to define its evapotranspiration etg taking into account that it is made up of numerous mixed species with different densities of vegetation and different microclimates due to the relative situation with respect to buildings and the paved areas in each case table 6 shows as an example the calculation of the garden evapotranspiration of hydro zone 1 for this study data from weather station no 1381 sevilla tablada is used see fig 4 the effective rainfall is obtained from the total monthly rainfall applying the simple method of curve number nrcs 2004 see table 7 the quantification of the flows of the system s natural water balance is obtained from the application of eq 5 table 8 shows the quantification of hydro zone 1 autochthonous mixed shrubs in intervals expressed by months graphically figs 5 6 and 7 represent h1 autochthonous mixed shrubs h5 ornamental rose bushes and h10 non autochthonous grasses respectively the effective annual rainfall green area the evapotranspiration of each monthly hydro zone green bars and the water requirements of the garden by months blue bars hydro zones take advantage of the rainfall that occurs from october to march requiring an input of irrigation water from april for ornamental plants hydro zone 5 from may for lawn areas hydro zone 10 and from june for areas with lower water demand hydro zone 1 all the irrigation ends in september also noteworthy is the high demand for water from some areas over others depending on the ability to resist high temperatures along with the periods of drought that occur during the summer season in seville once the gross water requirements are known it is possible to determine in a specific way at which times the irrigation will be carried out and the quantities of water that will be applied at each moment by means of a calendar for the whole year the results of h1 autochthonous mixed shrubs are shown in table 8 an automated irrigation system is installed organised in two independent sites although connected by means of a bypass that allows complete service to be provided in the event of a fault or lack of flow in any of them the irrigation network starts from an existing irrigation well that connects with two 120 m3 capacity cisterns that will each supply its area by means of an integrated self compensating drip system for both the flowerbeds in the northern area arboreal shrub and herbaceous and the bioswales on each side of the roadway and another drip system for the irrigation of the permeable pavement areas which also has a second complementary irrigation system or support by means of a network of adjustable emerging sprinklers a system of valves organises the irrigation by sectors allowing the adjustment of consumptions and pressures according to the demand 4 results 4 1 green water footprint the green water footprint of the garden wfg green is the volume of rainwater that is not converted into runoff so it is stored in the superficial permeable strata and thus satisfies the demand of the vegetation this shallow groundwater is what allows the existence of natural vegetation and returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration processes the results of eqs 11 and 12 are included in table 9 4 2 blue water footprint the blue water footprint of the garden wfg blue is the volume of fresh water extracted from a surface or groundwater source consumed to produce goods and services covering a demand for unsatisfied water due to a deficit in the availability of rainwater the eq 12 determines garden water requirements gwr of each hydro zone see table 9 in the project this demand will be met by the irrigation network which is supplied by two cisterns that store rainwater collected by drainage ditches rain gardens and wsud in addition the system has a water well for irrigation for those times when the cisterns do not reach the minimum level 4 3 grey water footprint the grey water footprint of the garden wfg grey is the volume of clean water necessary to dissolve the pollution in order to do not exceed the contamination thresholds in the water basin per current legislation it is calculated as the theoretical additional volume of water needed in the receiving body so it does not resort to generating new consumption but to reducing the volume of the pollutant in this section the return of irrigation water is quantified first which is conditioned by the efficiency of the irrigation system and the fraction of soil washing as well as the excess rainwater that the plant does not use this wastewater is the result of the sum of the products of the volumes of water from the excess rainwater rws and the returns of irrigation water iwr of each hydro zone multiplied by the corresponding surfaces occupied in both cases the quality of the water is considered the same so that the same treatment can be given either to allocate it to other uses not considered until now allowing the continued application of the water resource of other users or returning to the land what originally corresponds to it the quantification of this volume see table 9 and the quality index are the necessary parameters to quantify the volume of additional theoretical dilution water required for the calculation of the garden s grey footprint the distribution of the volumes calculated for each of the hydro zones fig 8 is taken from the example it is seen in the hydro zone where xero gardening is applied that the proportion of consumption of blue water or irrigation is minimal just as it does not need water from rainfall so the water not used by the system becomes wastewater and in turn it is an opportunity to study the minimum quality requirements for water reuse promoting the development of a circular economy and the recharge of aquifers on the other hand in the rest of the hydro zones the supply of irrigation water is essential especially in the summer period reducing the proportions of wastewater by the use that the plant makes of rainwater in winter in the case of valuing irrigation water in the event that there is no application of fertilisers or pesticides for the care of plants in urban green areas it will not be taken into account in the calculation of the grey footprint caused by diffuse pollution of the maintenance activity of hydro zones 5 conclusion the increase in green areas in the city implies an increase in water demand which is directly related to plant species density and relative disposition within the street with respect to existing buildings it is also related to the local climate and the availability of water resources the impossibility of irrigating green areas in periods of persistent drought and the effect of seasonality can influence the selection of vegetation resistant to water scarcity in this case the choice of autochthonous plants hydro zones 1 2 3 and 4 means that the plant does not require irrigation for much of the year and therefore there is a surplus of rainwater so the grey water footprint increases non native species hydro zones 5 7 and 8 need fresh water for irrigation i e the blue water footprint increases even the choice of grass hydro zone 10 given its high water requirements can determine a regressive dynamic including infrastructures that take advantage of rainwater for irrigation provides the necessary water resources for the conservation of these spaces in the case study the traditional impermeable pavement is reduced and replaced by a sustainable urban drainage system that allows rainwater to be collected for storage in cisterns and used to irrigate the landscaped areas of the street with efficient distribution systems according to the demand of the species present in each area and with the demand for water being reduced exclusively during the summer periods the volume of water relieved i e the precipitated water that is discharged into the sanitation network to leave the system in times of torrential rain is very high 89 it could be reduced by increasing the volume of storage capacity of the system but in this case the lack of space does not allow it a design based strategy has been employed to make maximum use of the water from rainfall collected in the area in order to reduce the contribution from fresh water to 50 the project alternates hydro zones with different demands and with it it is possible to distribute the available rainwater while compensating the surplus of the autochthonous species with the high water requirements of the ornamental species this is achieved with an irrigation system adapted and automated for each area thus reducing the blue and grey traces of the whole system the methodology proposed for the estimation of the water consumption of green areas is applied to an actual case study of an integral urban intervention project to optimise the environment and sanitation within the framework of the integral water cycle located in avenue el greco seville and a public initiative by emasesa public water company of seville the quantification of the water footprint of urban green areas in a consolidated landscape provides robust and locally based data for the technical assessment of new projects including the analysis of strategies in order to improve the management of the water urban cycle which takes into consideration the uncertainty associated with climate change large infrastructure projects based on conventional and intensive water management models can be assessed by incorporating decentralised calculations which include natural and artificial drainage systems and gardening nature is an indicative factor of urban quality and is therefore an important part of the political agenda of cities which leads to a growing concern of urban planning professionals to increase urban green infrastructure the analysis of the typologies of these infrastructures urban gardens parks squares landscaped roofs vertical gardens urban orchard gardens etc of the climatic characteristics temperatures rainfall evapotranspiration and of the characteristics of the gardens surface type and density of species allows studies to estimate the water needs of these new urban spaces and is of vital importance when planning the present and future water demand of cities this impact is accentuated if we are located in a region with scarce water resources and long periods of drought the model allows to incorporate future local climate data obtained by projecting climate evolutions for different gas emission scenarios which also makes it a valid tool for measuring sensitivity to climate change and therefore to assess impacts and vulnerability of systems related to the urban water cycle in future work climate change will be introduced in the estimation of temperature and rainfall in order to evaluate the impacts and vulnerability of each one of the

24874,in this paper we develop an agent based model abm to simulate the sylvatic transmission of the parasite t cruzi causative agent of chagas disease also called american trypanosomiasis this abm incorporates host vector interactions demographical processes for both hosts and vectors and also vector and host dispersals we implement the abm under parameter values corresponding to real conditions in nature the abm simulations give quantitative results predicting the prevalence of the parasite t cruzi in both hosts and vectors the abundance of host and vector populations and numerical estimates of the probability of persistence for t cruzi population depending on different initial spatial distributions of infection further our study highlights the role of the host population as the determinant factor for infection transmission and parasite persistence and presents pictures showing the emergence of clusters of infection keywords chagas disease trypanosoma cruzi sylvatic transmission agent based model host vector interactions demographical process dispersal process simulations 1 introduction chagas disease or american trypanosomiasis is a vector borne disease caused by the flagellated protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi t cruzi this parasite can infect a broad range of mammalian hosts that includes humans domestic and wild animals the main mode of transmission is by contact with insect vectors known as triatominae or kissing bugs if these bugs live in shelters neighboring human habitations then they are said to be domestic if they live in the nests of nondomesticated mammals or birds they are said to be sylvatic in the typical infection cycle an infected triatomine takes a blood meal on a mammalian host and releases the parasite in its feces near the site of the bite wound the parasite enters the host through the wound or through intact mucosal membranes such as the conjunctiva this is called sterocorarian transmission an infected host also transmits the parasite to a healthy vector during bloodmeals and the parasite then resides in the vector s gut transmission in hosts can also occur via congenital from infected mother to child and oral routes blood transfusions are also responsible for several infections of humans in and out of the area of endemicity it has been estimated that chagas disease affects nearly 10 million people mostly in mexico central america and south america chagas disease was once entirely confined to the region of the americas principally latin america but it has now spread to non endemic regions such as canada parts of europe principally spain and many asian countries e g japan this is due mainly to population mobility between latin america and the rest of the world tanowitz et al 2011 the majority of research on the transmission and control of the parasite t cruzi has been devoted to domestic and peridomestic cycles in which the parasite can be transmitted to humans causing chagas disease see for instance castanera et al 2003 cecere et al 2004 2006 clauson et al 2012 cohen and gurtler 2001 costa and peterson 2012 cruz pacheco et al 2012 delgado et al 2011 dias et al 2002 dumonteil et al 2013 feliciangeli et al 2003 gurtler et al 1991 2005 and the elimination of domestic populations of triatomines by insecticide spraying and housing improvement has been the main objective of vector control programs in many countries these actions have led to a large reduction in house infestation by triatomines and a reduction in vector borne transmission bern et al 2011 bommel et al 2015 despite this success the disease has re emerged and there is increasing evidence from several countries e g bolivia matias et al 2003 noireau et al 1994 1995 ecuador guhl and aufduheide 2010 brazil bommel et al 2015 argentina dujardin et al 2000 that some sylvatic vector species frequently colonize human habitats and may play a key role in the transmission cycle of t cruzi indeed the parasite t cruzi is maintained primarily in sylvatic cycles and non domiciliated vectors are able to disperse from peridomestic and or sylvatic sites to occasionally infest or re infest houses it is also assumed that a domestic transmission cycle can be established as the result of the colonization or invasion of human dwellings by infected vectors or mammals pinho et al 2000 thus the non domiciliated vector species require novel control strategies to efficiently control chagas disease transmission and a thorough understanding of sylvatic t cruzi transmission cycles is critical to any long term disease control plans the different processes involved in sylvatic t cruzi transmission are very complex and in most cases are not captured by means of laboratory studies stochastic events also play an important role in the sylvatic cycle of t cruzi recently many biological works for instance pinho et al 2000 pointed from observations to the need to take ecological factors into account in the study of any host parasite interaction knowledge of factors such as host population density habitats and dynamics as well as peculiarities of the parasite with its reservoir hosts is a basic requirement for understanding the epidemiology of parasite disease it is well known that naturally infected mammals and bugs can be found in almost any sylvatic ecotope but very little is known about the kinetics of the transmission of t cruzi among its hosts in the natural environment jansen et al 1999 t cruzi in the wild can circulate in multiple hosts and vector species which vary throughout regions in northern mexico and the southern most part of texas the main t cruzi vector is triatoma gerstaeckeri associated in sylvatic settings with the southern plains woodrat eads et al 1963 kjos et al 2009 pippin 1970 in the eastern portion of texas into the southeast united states the predominant vector is triatoma sanguisuga ibarra cerdeña et al 2009 sarkar et al 2010 and is commonly associated with raccoons and opossums pung et al 1995 in north america the parasite is transmitted between triatoma vectors and reservoir hosts mainly raccoons procyon lotor opossums didelphis virginiana and several species of woodrat namely the southern plains woodrat neotoma micropus roellig et al 2009 large infected wild populations of triatoma infestans have been detected south of the amazon in south america and elsewhere in argentina paraguay and chile several modeling approaches have been used to gain insights into the biology and ecology of t cruzi and a good review on the mathematical models of chagas disease can be found in nouvellet et al 2015 in the case of t cruzi sylvatic cycles dynamical and differential systems have been used to study alternative modes of transmission and contact process saturation kribs zaleta 2006 kribs zaleta 2010b 2010c pelosse and kribs zaleta 2012 steindorf and maidana 2019 kribs zaleta other approaches such as metapopulation models crawford and kribs zaleta 2014 cellular automata crawford and kribs zaleta 2013 crawford et al 2013 and structured integro difference equations mahdjoub and kribs 2020 mesk et al 2016 were applied to study dispersal and invasion of triatominae or t cruzi barbu et al 2010 combine an extensive spatio temporal data set describing house infestation dynamics by triatome dimidiata within a village and spatial population dynamics models in a selection model approach to improve the understanding of non domiciliated vectors dispersal our aim in this work is to study the sylvatic transmission of t cruzi through an agent based model abm we recall that abms are models that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple entities in an attempt to re create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena these entities called agents or objects correspond to real biological actors with attributes restricted to those relevant to their evolution and interactions in the model the spatial location scalability links and aggregation are represented as well the aim of this new approach is to observe populations based upon hypothesis regarding individuals their relationships and their evolution over time abms are particularly suited for modeling complex systems because they present a high flexibility which can be observed along multiple dimensions fundamentally stochastic abms allow one to work at the level of the individual and account for individual variations they easily incorporate time and space heterogeneity in ways which classical models such as differential equations cannot the agent based approach has recently been used in modelling chagas disease but almost all the models developed were dedicated to the study of t cruzi transmission to humans for instance galvao and miranda 2010 developed a spatial three dimensional multi agent based computational within host model for the evolution of chagas disease this model permits to understand the participation of different types of cells in the cardiac tissue in the development of chagas disease devillers et al 2008 derived an agent based model abm to better understand the transmission process of two t cruzi strains and their competition for hosts which are humans their abm permits the prediction of the prevalence of the two t cruzi strains during single and mixed infections and shows that sylvatic reservoir hosts were necessary for obtaining realistic simulation results of the prevalence of the two strains we stress the fact that in the literature on chagas disease and t cruzi there are only two abms dealing with the sylvatic cycle of t cruzi transmission the first one is that of yong et al 2015 which was devoted to quantifying the rate of contacts between different host and vector species native to texas the second one is the work of figueroa et al 2009 whose goal is the study of the competition between two t cruzi strains using first ordinary differential equations ode and then an agent based model the latter created as a discrete stochastic version of the ode s including space and randomness focuses on matching precisely the rates in the differential equation model so that the two can be compared this abm models host vector interactions and growth of both hosts and vectors in a sylvatic setting however neither species of hosts and vectors are specified nor their behavior in the spatial domain further the spatial component has not been introduced in modeling host and vector behavior and their interactions space was considered only to observe a crowding out effect the broader lack of abms applied to sylvatic transmission cycles of t cruzi is what motivated this study so in this work we propose to build an individual based model that incorporates vector and host dispersal demography in vectors and hosts and host vector interactions to mimic a typical sylvatic cycle of t cruzi we implement and simulate this abm under different initial conditions to analyze the parasite transmission process in both hosts and vectors and visualize the spatial spread of infection in particular our abm simulates the introduction phase of t cruzi into a new geographical area like any biological invasion this phase can lead to the persistence or extinction of the parasite population sakai et al 2001 the main objective of this work is therefore to quantify the probability of persistence of the population of t cruzi depending on the initial conditions set in the case of the persistence of the t cruzi population we will focus on the study of initial evolutions of the processes of spatial dispersion infection and demography in vectors and hosts in order to highlight the life history traits that will support the proliferation of t cruzi the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we first present the biological background and the hypothesis under which we construct our abm then we describe the model construction the last part of this section is devoted to the simulator description and its internal structure in section 3 we present the different simulations to be tested section 4 summarizes the simulations results these correspond to the following issues 1 persistence extincion of t cruzi population and patterns of the spatial spread 2 parasite prevalences in hosts and vectors 3 host population abundance 4 vector population abundance 5 persistence of t cruzi population relative to the host and vector populations evolution section 5 offers a discussion of the results and a conclusion 2 the agent based model of t cruzi sylvatic transmission 2 1 biological background and hypothesis in a t cruzi sylvatic cycle the main mode of parasite transmission to hosts is by contact with the faeces of the vectors stercorarian transmission gourbiere et al 2012 wood 1951 and to vectors by feeding on infected hosts blood meal stevens et al 2013 in hosts congenital howard et al 2014 and oral transmissions shikanai yasuda and carvalho 2012 also contribute to the spread of the pathogen rabinovich and nieves 2011 but oral transmission is neglected in this work in vectors the rate of congenital transmission also called vertical transmission is null drees and jackman 1999 that is newborns of infected vectors are susceptible while in hosts vertical transmission affects a proportion of newborns the rate at which vertical transmission occurs in hosts remains unknown a probability of 0 1 for vertical transmission was given in moreno et al for wistar rats moreno et al 2003 by sanchez negrette et al for humans sánchez negrette et al 2005 and by kribs in kribs zaleta 2010c for raccoons while some experimental studies have confirmed much higher rates of vertical transmission that can attain 0 98 in mice and lemurs andrade 1982 hall et al 2007 triatomines life cycle is composed of seven stages an egg stage five instars and an adult stage but for simplification we consider vectors in only two stages juveniles and adults this simplification can be justified by the fact that the important distinctions between juvenile and adult vectors involve mobility and fertility which do not differ among instar stages hosts instars interactions necessary to pass from one stage to another such as blood meals are simplified by considering a probability of maturing for surviving individuals if a juvenile vector survives it can mature and transits with a certain probability to the adult stage this transition depends strongly on food availability and both intrinsic and environmental conditions fecundity is a major life history trait in triatomines it is initiated after a blood meal vectors feed on hosts females lay eggs after they have been fertilized by a male and after they have taken a blood meal from a host grundemann 1947 olsen et al 1966 and hays 1965 reported an average of 711 eggs laid per female t sanguisuga under laboratory conditions and an average hatching percentage of 77 3 but these quantities may be lower in the wild as reported in kribs zaleta 2010a they would be in average in the order of 465 eggs laid in a year of which only 279 60 0 hatch this gives a number of 5 36 eggs per week laid by a t sanguisuga female reproduction in hosts varies with the different species of hosts for example it has been reported in nebraska a state that lies both in the great plains and in the midwestern united states an average size of 4 young per litter born to racoon females more than a year old and an average of 3 3 young per litter born to yearling females 2 2 the agent based model description in this section we formulate the agent based model of t cruzi transmission corresponding to the biological information quoted above for this purpose we consider a population composed of adult vectors juvenile vectors and hosts dispersing in a natural landscape of 1 km 2 represented by a 100 100 grid cell with a cell representing a real area of size 10m 10m we denote a vector by v and a host by h each vector v has the following attributes v s e x m male or f female a g e j juvenile or a adult s t a t e s susceptible or i infected while a host is characterized only by its sex and its infection state h s e x m male or f female s t a t e s susceptible or i infected juvenile vectors and adult vectors males and females survive respectively with survival probabilities σj and σa if a juvenile vector survives it can mature to the adult stage with a probability of transition τ also called maturation probability a host male or female survives with probability σh a female host and an adult female vector reproduce respectively with probabilities p r e p h and p r e p v the model simplifies host reproduction by modelling new hosts only when they are old enough to reproduce for female and to travel and forage independently of their mothers after which point hosts live alone for simplification all the probabilities σj σa σh τ p r e p h and p r e p v are assumed constant in time so that they lead to exponential distributions of waiting times this corresponds closely to the distribution yielded by a classical deterministic dynamical system and reflects realistic variation about the mean infection is considered to affect neither demographic parameters of vectors and hosts nor the survival and transition probabilities indeed as is common with many enzootic infections customary hosts and vectors which are really just carriers do not die or recover from the pathogen t cruzi the parasite continues to replicate in the gut of a vector but does not kill it in hosts the parasite seeks the tissue of vital organs where it replicates but typically sylvatic hosts die of natural causes long before the parasite can cause organ failure all the vectors males and females juveniles and adults are haematophagous and feed on hosts by having blood meals the blood meal digestion time in vectors which corresponds to the minimum time between two consecutive contacts with hosts is 1 week yong et al 2015 from this we choose a time step δt 1 week in our modelling at time t 0 the population of vectors and hosts is randomly distributed in the space where each agent v or h has its position x y during each time step δt 1 week three processes succeed in a natural order these processes are 1 contacts between vectors and hosts through blood meals which can lead to infecting bites and hence a transmission of the infection 2 the demographical process in hosts and vectors and development in juveniles 3 the dispersal process in vectors and hosts corresponding respectively to the search of blood meals for vectors and food for hosts 1 the contact process bite and blood meal in a sylvatic setting contacts between vectors and hosts hold in dens and at night indeed vectors live in dens of hosts and bites hold at the nights in the dens where hosts sleep to avoid the difficulty of creating permanent dens in space an average of 9 25 dens raccoon within its territory according to yong et al 2015 and all the resulting complexity our model considered space homogeneous in this sense and models contacts through the local interacting distance between hosts and vectors space is used to locate vectors and hosts in cells and to define distances between them hence the contact between a vector and a host is described as follows every vector v searches the nearest host in his cell and bites it if no host is available in his cell in the considered time step the vector v has no blood meal if an infected vector v bites a susceptible host h the latter will be infected via the stercorarian route with probability λ if a susceptible vector v bites an infected host h then v will be surely infected such modelling integrating space through local interactions has never been considered in earlier models devillers et al 2008 has considered space as one patch where all hosts have the same risk to be bitten and in figueroa et al 2009 the authors poll a set of the agents who may have an interaction and then find the closest agent for the first agent to interact with avoiding the difficulty of the problem of interaction based on an interacting distance 2 survival maturation and reproduction processes survival maturation and reproduction processes are implemented following these rules each adult male vector vma has a survival probability σa if it does not die in the time step δt there is no change in its attributes if it dies it is removed from the system each juvenile vector vj has a survival probability σj if it does not die in the time step δt it develops and transits to the adult stage it becomes va with probability τ if it dies it is removed from the system each adult female vector vfa has a survival probability σa if it dies it is removed from the system if it does not die in the time step δt it gives birth with probability p r e p v to 4 susceptible juvenile vectors with sex ratio 1 1 there is no vertical transmission in vectors these newborns are added in the system and placed near the mother in the same grid cell each male host hm has a survival probability σh if it does not die in the time step δt there is no change in its attributes if it dies it is removed from the system each susceptible female host hfs has a survival probability σh if it dies it is removed from the system if it does not die in the time step δt it gives birth with probability p r e p h to 4 susceptible hosts with sex ratio 1 1 the 4 newborn hosts are added in the system and placed near the mother in the same grid cell each infected female host hfi has a survival probability σh if it dies it is removed from the system if it does not die in the time step δt it gives birth with probability p r e p h to 4 hosts with the sex ratio 1 1 each of the 4 newborn hosts is infected with probability λ the vertical transmission probability the 4 newborn hosts are added in the system and placed near the mother in the same grid cell 3 dispersal the dispersal process is essentially linked to foraging in many works it has been reported that primary hosts such as raccoons and opossums move within their home range either to forage or to defend themselves by leaving their dens when the latter are occupied by many vectors in turn vectors disperse in search of hosts or new hosts to feed on rabinowitz and pelton 1986 shirer and fitch 1970 yong et al 2015 in this study we assume that all agents are concerned by the dispersal process hosts disperse to feed and vectors disperse in search of hosts on which to feed the spatial dispersal process for all species is modelled by a two dimensional random walk this random distribution is appropriate for hosts and vectors since space is assumed homogeneous we assume that dispersal capacities in juvenile vectors are lower than those of adult vectors juen 1981 although the dispersal distance for both hosts and adult vectors is about the same see yong et al 2015 hosts and vectors disperse differently during a week time step the hosts disperse nearly daily from one den to another lotze and anderson 1979 urban 1970 while the vectors disperse at most once to feed mesk et al 2016 it will be assumed in order to avoid an invasion situation on the part of the host population that the weekly displacements balance sheet of an individual does not take it far from its starting point so we consider that during a time step hosts and adult vectors move by 2 cells in the space grid while juvenile vectors move by only one cell this means that dispersal distance for adult vectors and hosts is of 20m per week which corresponds to a small and local dispersal some works reported considerably larger distances lotze and anderson 1979 urban 1970 yong et al 2015 2 3 internal structure and interface of the abm the abm conceived in this study is a tool of experiments intended to represent virtually t cruzi sylvatic transmission through host vector interactions it is developed in order to describe the spatio temporal spread of t cruzi as well as predict the prevalences of the parasite in vector and host populations and their abundance in space and time we use the platform cormas to implement it bommel et al 2015 cormas for common pool resources and multi agent systems is a generic agent based modeling platform dedicated to common pool resources management it is a framework that proposes predefined classes and a set of visualization tools to facilitate the implementation of abm and analysis of simulation scenarios it uses visualworks a programming environment based on smalltalk one of the first purely object oriented languages goldberg and robson 1983 generally cormas describes models by spatial entities to represent the geographic space social entities to describe the actors and passive entities for the rest of the model elements in our study social entities are vectors and hosts and spatial entities are cells of the grid representing the environment the simulator is provided with a three windows interface i the first window allows the user the set up of the global variables and parameters ii the second window allows one to initialize run and visualize evolution of the vector and host populations and their infection prevalences iii the third window opens on a spatial grid showing the virtual landscape and the agents in time the spatial grid consists of 100 100 cells where each cell represents a unit of space in a cell a host is represented by a yellow filled triangle while a vector is represented by a purple filled circle cells that contain infected agents are colored red 3 model parameters and scenarios tested in this section we propose to implement and simulate the abm under different initial conditions in order to analyze the infection process in both hosts and vectors and visualize the spatial spread of the parasite in this study the considered region is the southeastern us and the chosen species are raccoons for hosts and t sanguisuga for vectors raccoons are the primary sylvatic hosts in the southeastern us and t sanguisuga are the predominant vectors in this region the different scenarios to be tested are given in table 1 they correspond to the different initial conditions for vector and host populations in term of the infection state the first four scenarios will be tested in order to examine and quantify the effect and impact of introducing one or two t cruzi infected agents in an initially safe population while the last five scenarios will be run with the goal of exploring the evolution and the fate of the infection process in vector and host populations for different initial numbers of infected hosts and vectors in order to quantify the effect of the vertical transmission in hosts on the t cruzi persistence we propose to test scenario 7 in which infected hosts are male and female with sex ratio 1 1 to be compared to scenario 7 in which all infected hosts are female the outputs of the abm are prevalences for hosts and vectors in time time evolution of vector and host populations time evolution of infected vectors and infected hosts and pictures showing the spatial spread of t cruzi the nine scenarios above are all performed under the initial numbers of hosts and vectors n h 10 and n v 10000 which due to the limited capacity of our simulator are slightly reduced from real densities of vectors and hosts observed in southeastern u s there were about 20 raccoons for 31600 t sanguisuga km 2 in kribs zaleta 2010c the natural environment is considered as a closed 100 100 grid representing an area of 1 km 2 where each grid cell is a square of size 10m 10m as the time step δ t 1 week we convert the daily survival probabilities for the natural t sanguisuga and raccoons given in yong et al 2015 and hence obtain the respective survival probabilities per week for juvenile vectors adult vectors and hosts σ j 0 987 σ a 0 986 and σ h 0 992 probability of reproduction in hosts is also converted to a weekly probability from the daily probability of reproduction for raccoons given by yong et al 2015 we obtain p r e p h 0 017 for vectors the daily reproduction probability proposed for natural t sanguisuga in yong et al 2015 yields to a weekly probability p r e p v 0 646 we point that all the daily probabilities given by yong et al 2015 are obtained from the conversion of the baseline event rates rates of birth death and maturation for raccoons and vectors to probabilities using the deterministic exponential growth model for more detail see appendix a 4 in yong et al 2015 for the infection probability from a vector to a host we take λ 0 06 rabinovich et al 2001 it is the only probability of infection in the literature available for wild host and it has been obtained from opossums we suppose that it can also be applied to raccoons in vectors the probability of maturation and transition per week from juvenile stage to adult stage is τ 0 008 as considered for t sanguisuga in yong et al 2015 host and vector populations are both considered with a female sex ratio p s e x 1 1 mesk et al 2016 braun and mares 1989 that is n h f n h m 5 and n v m n v f 5000 in the vector population we consider that juveniles represent the half 1 2 of the total number of vectors and we assume that the female sex ratio in this subpopulation of vectors is 1 1 that is n v f j n v m j 2500 table 2 summarizes the values of the parameters used in the abm 4 simulation results in our study each of the nine scenarios described in the earlier section has been simulated 100 times to damp out randomness embodied in the simulator we point out that all the numerical results presented below are averages of the number of repetitions 4 1 persistence extincion of t cruzi population and patterns of the spatial spread table 3 gives the frequencies of obtaining persistence of the population of t cruzi over 100 repetitions of the numerical simulations carried out for each of the 9 considered scenarios to simplify the presentation of the obtained results we will call these frequencies persistence frequencies in contrast the frequencies of getting extinction of the population of t cruzi will be called extinction frequencies when starting with only one infected agent that is a female host scenario 1 table 3 shows the extinction of the parasite t cruzi in the 90 of the simulations while the 10 other simulations of the same scenario show the persistence of the parasite the spatial distribution obtained in this latter case is illustrated by fig 1 which shows the spread of the parasite among other agents in space it should be noted that the t cruzi population extinction 90 of the simulations occurs after a fairly long time generally almost 7 years 362 time steps see 1a in figure 5 all the simulations 100 of scenario 2 only a single adult female vector is infected show the parasite s extinction see table 3 in a very short time less than 50 weeks see 2a in figure 5 fig 2 illustrates the spatial distribution obtained in this case the initial condition of scenario 3 in addition to having an infected female host as in scenario 1 we also have an infected female vector quadrupled the persistence of t cruzi population relative to scenario 1 the persistence frequency passes from 10 to 40 of simulations see table 3 table 3 shows that when the values of the initial conditions are doubled scenarios 6 and 7 for hosts and scenarios 5 and 8 for vectors the persistence frequency is multiplied by 2 33 for hosts from 30 to 70 and by 6 for vectors it goes from 10 to 60 this shows the sensitivity of the persistence to initial conditions figs 3 and 4 illustrating the spatial structure obtained for respectively scenarios 7 and 8 show the formation of clusters of infection when t cruzi persists the most likely cases of t cruzi persistence are obtained in scenarios 7 and 8 respectively 70 and 60 persistence frequencies and persistence is more frequent when the initial infected agents are hosts rather than vectors table 3 also shows that the greater the percentage of females in infected hosts the greater the frequency of t cruzi persistence scenario 7 70 persistence frequency vs scenario 7 30 persistence frequency this result is due to the vertical transmission of the parasite by an infected female host 4 2 host and vector infection prevalences fig 5 summarizes time evolution of prevalences in hosts and vectors for the nine studied scenarios graphics 2a and 4a in figure 5 corresponding respectively to scenarios 2 and 4 show that starting from very low initial values in vectors 2 10 4 for scenario 2 and 4 10 4 for scenario 4 the prevalence decreases rapidly towards zero which means that an extinction of t cruzi s population takes place in the first time steps of the simulations the extinction cases in scenarios 1 3 5 6 7 7 and 8 see graphics 1a 3a 5a 6a 7a 7 a and 8a in fig 5 show that host prevalence dominates vector prevalence although the initial conditions of scenarios 5 and 8 induce a significant initial prevalence in vectors the vector prevalence then decays rapidly to be dominated by host prevalence until the extinction of the t cruzi population the pattern of the time evolution of the prevalence in the cases of t cruzi persistence remains identical to the cases of the extinction until near the 400th week prevailing prevalence in the hosts during the last 100 time steps all the persistence graphs show a reversal of the situation the infection is more carried by the vectors than the hosts and for these latters the prevalence seems to stabilize finally it should be noted that juvenile vector prevalence remains lower than adults in all the tested scenarios table 4 adult vectors having greater displacement ability than juveniles will increase of course their contact probability via blood meals 4 3 host abundance the time evolution of the host population density in the 9 studied scenarios is represented in fig 6 the simulations show that for the same scenario persistence of t cruzi takes place in runs wherein the host population grows well and rapidly fig 6 shows clearly that the density of the hosts in the case of the persistence of t cruzi is always greater than in the case of extinction this result can be explained by the fact that more survival and good reproduction in hosts promote the contacts with vectors and infection which leads to the persistence of t cruzi otherwise if more hosts die including infected hosts and reproduction is weak it would force the infection to go extinct we specify that differences in host population densities are only due to the stochasticity of the host dynamics through survival and reproduction probabilities infection has no effect on the abundance of host population since it does not affect host demographical parameters notice that the host population grows exponentially this is due to the use of unbalanced host demographical parameters see section 3 to stabilize host population density around the values observed in ecological literature probabilities of reproduction and survival given in yong et al 2015 must be adjusted 4 4 vector abundance figure 7 shows the time evolution of the vector density in the 9 studied scenarios in both persistence and extinction cases in all the scenarios the evolution curves have the same pattern an exponential initial growth to reach quickly a maximum value in less than 50 weeks then a regular decrease in continued decay in figs 8 and 9 which give the time evolutions of juvenile and adult vectors respectively the juvenile curve fig 8 shows in the early first stages less than 50 weeks an important exponential growth to reach a maximum value that exceeds 30000 juvenile vectors and just after a regular decrease while the adult curve shows a significant decay in the first steps less than 50 weeks and then a regular decrease the juvenile population growth observed in the first steps stems from to the reproduction process in adults p r e p h 0 646 which gives birth to new juvenile vectors while the adult density only decreases because of the very low value of the maturation probability τ 0 008 so no transitions from the juvenile stage to adult take place during the 50 first weeks only deaths occur as a result the significant decrease in the adult population decreases the juvenile density after the 50 first weeks since the reproduction process becomes weaker when the number of vector adults diminishes the continued exponential decay observed in juvenile adult and vector populations is due to the use of unbalanced vector demographical parameters survival probabilities of juvenile and adult vectors must be adjusted to stabilize the vector density as in nature 4 5 persistence of t cruzi population relative to the host and vector populations evolution fig 10 shows the time evolution of the infected populations hosts and vectors for the nine scenarios in scenarios in which the parasite t cruzi is initially carried by only a small number of adult vectors scenarios 2 and 4 the population of t cruzi decreases rapidly towards extinction see graphs 2a and 4a in fig 10 all remaining scenarios show that persistence of t cruzi in vectors depends on its persistence in host population that is persistence occurs with the growth of the infected host population otherwise there is extinction of the parasite in the case of t cruzi persistence the density of infected vectors is higher than that of infected hosts this is essentially due to the initial density of vectors which is 1000 times greater than that of hosts there are 10 hosts for 10000 vectors in the considered area on the other hand fig 11 shows that the time evolution of infected host population is positively correlated to both the time evolution of host population and the number of initially infected hosts indeed table 5 which gives the final numbers of hosts vectors infected hosts and infected vectors in case of persistence shows that the highest number of infected hosts which is 639 66 is obtained in scenario 7 in which the initial number of infected hosts is the higher among all scenarios 50 of hosts are infected and the host population grows the more 2367 hosts after 500 time steps notice that the highest number of infected vectors is also observed in this scenario scenario 7 table 5 this observation confirms the result quoted in the precedent paragraph namely that the infection process in vectors is strongly linked to the infected host population evolution 5 discussion as earlier mentioned the purpose of this work is to study through an agent based approach the persistence of the parasite t cruzi in a sylvatic population of hosts and vectors the agent based model abm we conceived describes qualitatively and quantitatively vector host interactions in a sylvatic environment the abm includes demographical processes and spatial dispersals for both vectors and hosts on one hand in our model vector and host populations evolve in space and time according to the survival demographical and dispersal parameters encoding host and vector population dynamics on the other hand contrarily to devillers et al 2008 who did not consider the spatial component of the habitat and then each host had the same risk to be bitten by a vector our abm integrated the spatial component by allowing hosts and vectors positions in space and the contact process takes place or not according to a local interacting distance between hosts and vectors such features have not been used in previous abm dealing with t cruzi transmission devillers et al 2008 figueroa et al 2009 and to our knowledge no study before has attempted to model t cruzi transmission dynamics in a sylvatic setting using such an abm the abm simulations of this study have been devoted to test effect and impact of introducing spatially randomly distributed proportions of t cruzi infected agents hosts and or vectors in a safe susceptible population of hosts and vectors in all the simulations initial sizes of host and vector populations have been fixed with survival demographical and infection parameters taken from the literature kribs zaleta 2010c mesk et al 2016 rabinovich and nieves 2011 yong et al 2015 braun and mares 1989 it should be noted that while our simulations are specific to the particular area southeastern u s where the considered hosts are raccoons associated to the vector species t sanguisuga our abm can be applied to other host and vector species simply by adjusting parameter values to be appropriate to those species nine scenarios were considered they correspond to t cruzi parasite invasion situations when carried by 1 the vectors alone scenarios 2 4 5 and 8 2 the hosts alone scenarios 1 6 7 and 7 and 3 hosts and vectors together scenario 3 in the first and second cases different initial values were taken to test the sensitivity of the obtained results to the initial conditions our first result is that t cruzi s geographical expansion has a non zero probability of aborting indeed the extinction frequencies of the t cruzi population vary according to the considered scenarios and reach the maximum value of 100 when a very small number of vectors are initially infected scenarios 2 and 4 we must go to an initial situation where a quarter of the vector population is infected scenario 5 to reduce the probability of extinction to 90 this result is analogous to the case where only one female host is initially infected scenario 1 the extinction frequency is lowest 30 in the case where 50 of the hosts are initially infected and all of them are females scenario 7 when the biological invasion takes place our numerical simulations highlight in most cases the formation of clusters of infection the clusters formation can be explained by the fact that when a susceptible vector carries out its blood meal on an infected host the probability of transmission of the parasite is maximum and equal to 1 0 06 in the inverse case rabinovich et al 2001 as we do not consider the fact that the host has the opportunity to defend himself when stung the situation where several vectors can feed on the same infected host remains possible in addition our abm allows the hosts a displacement identical to that of the adult vectors 2 cells unit of time this hypothesis may be another factor favoring the formation of clusters in cases where there is parasite persistence the study of the temporal evolution of the infection shows the existence of two distinct phases the first phase is characterized by a prevailing prevalence in the hosts except for scenarios 5 and 8 where due to initial conditions the initial prevalences of the vectors are higher than those of the hosts but decrease rapidly during the first stages of the infection the second phase occurs later after 400 time steps in average in this phase vector prevalence becomes dominant and remains increasing over time until the end of the simulations 500 weeks indicating that the infection is carried more clearly by the vectors while the prevalence among hosts is stabilizing around the average value of 0 2 the appearance of these phases is explained in part by the very low ratio of host vector densities 10 3 in the case of initial densities when introducing the parasite t cruzi in hosts the prevalence in hosts starts from the minimum value of 0 1 to grow through the blood meal of infected vectors on the one hand and the process of vertical transmission on the other hand remember that on 40 newborn hosts stemed from 10 infected host mothers 4 are infected with sex ratio 1 1 however among vectors in the most favorable case corresponding to scenario 8 the prevalence starts from 0 5 but because of the rapid decline of the number of infected vectors in the first few steps due to the scarcity of infected hosts and given the exponential growth of the vector population this prevalence decreases rapidly it is only in the vicinity of the 200th time from which the number of infected hosts starts to show some increase that the parasite begins to proliferate in the vector population and then to exceed the prevalence in the hosts the main result of this study is that infection in hosts and evolution of host population constitute together the determining factor for the persistence of the t cruzi population the presence of t cruzi in only vectors is not enough for parasite transmission and its spatial spread even if initially there is a huge number of infected vectors in this case the parasite can be extinct if the transmission of t cruzi from infected vectors to hosts is rare and that host population growth is weak a small number of hosts and or infected hosts makes the contact process between vectors and hosts less frequent which limits transmission of t cruzi among hosts and vectors the presence of infected hosts is thus necessary for the transmission of infection among both hosts and vectors and a good evolution of host population is essential for the persistence of the parasite these two factors combined is what truly triggers the t cruzi transmission in vectors and increase vector infection prevalences whether there was an initial infection in vectors or not thus we can claim that this work highlights the role of host population as the only source of infection for vectors and as the determinant factor for the parasite maintenance this result agrees well with the conclusions obtained from the biological experiments in gottdenker et al 2012 in which the authors have shown the importance of host reproductive rates as an important determinant of vector infection hence it is suggested that further research on host life history would be needed to improve knowledge on t cruzi epidemiology further the role of the vertical transmission process in hosts on the persistence of t cruzi population is quantitatively highlighted through the persistence frequencies scenarios 7 and 7 by this the absence of vertical transmission in vectors is identified as a limiting factor for t cruzi transmission in vectors the simulations have also highlighted the effect of the maturation probability from juvenile stage to adult stage on the vectors population evolution the small value for the maturation probability τ 0 008 week leads to a decline of the adult vector population therefore the juvenile vector population while beginning exponentially growing high probability of reproduction p r e p v 0 646 week decreases rapidly and likewise for the total vector population from several simulations that we do not present here we point out that increasing the maturation probability from 0 008 to 0 01 leads to an important increase of vector population the latter goes to explosion at long run from this study we can see that the control of the geographical expansion of chagas disease in the sylvatic setting should not be limited to the insecticidal control of triatomines as currently planned in endemic countries hosts also play a key role in the successful biological invasion of t cruzi and as a result control is required as the disease evolves into clusters it is important that the fight would be geographically targeted finally we claim that our abm is a first step in the incremental process dedicated to the comprehension of the complexity of t cruzi infection in wild it is based on many simplifying hypothesis we intend in a future work to improve this ibm by introducing spatial heterogeneities through the creation of permanent host dens and extend our study by including diverse host species associated with several vector species and environmental effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financialinterestsor personal relationships that could have appeared to

24874,in this paper we develop an agent based model abm to simulate the sylvatic transmission of the parasite t cruzi causative agent of chagas disease also called american trypanosomiasis this abm incorporates host vector interactions demographical processes for both hosts and vectors and also vector and host dispersals we implement the abm under parameter values corresponding to real conditions in nature the abm simulations give quantitative results predicting the prevalence of the parasite t cruzi in both hosts and vectors the abundance of host and vector populations and numerical estimates of the probability of persistence for t cruzi population depending on different initial spatial distributions of infection further our study highlights the role of the host population as the determinant factor for infection transmission and parasite persistence and presents pictures showing the emergence of clusters of infection keywords chagas disease trypanosoma cruzi sylvatic transmission agent based model host vector interactions demographical process dispersal process simulations 1 introduction chagas disease or american trypanosomiasis is a vector borne disease caused by the flagellated protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi t cruzi this parasite can infect a broad range of mammalian hosts that includes humans domestic and wild animals the main mode of transmission is by contact with insect vectors known as triatominae or kissing bugs if these bugs live in shelters neighboring human habitations then they are said to be domestic if they live in the nests of nondomesticated mammals or birds they are said to be sylvatic in the typical infection cycle an infected triatomine takes a blood meal on a mammalian host and releases the parasite in its feces near the site of the bite wound the parasite enters the host through the wound or through intact mucosal membranes such as the conjunctiva this is called sterocorarian transmission an infected host also transmits the parasite to a healthy vector during bloodmeals and the parasite then resides in the vector s gut transmission in hosts can also occur via congenital from infected mother to child and oral routes blood transfusions are also responsible for several infections of humans in and out of the area of endemicity it has been estimated that chagas disease affects nearly 10 million people mostly in mexico central america and south america chagas disease was once entirely confined to the region of the americas principally latin america but it has now spread to non endemic regions such as canada parts of europe principally spain and many asian countries e g japan this is due mainly to population mobility between latin america and the rest of the world tanowitz et al 2011 the majority of research on the transmission and control of the parasite t cruzi has been devoted to domestic and peridomestic cycles in which the parasite can be transmitted to humans causing chagas disease see for instance castanera et al 2003 cecere et al 2004 2006 clauson et al 2012 cohen and gurtler 2001 costa and peterson 2012 cruz pacheco et al 2012 delgado et al 2011 dias et al 2002 dumonteil et al 2013 feliciangeli et al 2003 gurtler et al 1991 2005 and the elimination of domestic populations of triatomines by insecticide spraying and housing improvement has been the main objective of vector control programs in many countries these actions have led to a large reduction in house infestation by triatomines and a reduction in vector borne transmission bern et al 2011 bommel et al 2015 despite this success the disease has re emerged and there is increasing evidence from several countries e g bolivia matias et al 2003 noireau et al 1994 1995 ecuador guhl and aufduheide 2010 brazil bommel et al 2015 argentina dujardin et al 2000 that some sylvatic vector species frequently colonize human habitats and may play a key role in the transmission cycle of t cruzi indeed the parasite t cruzi is maintained primarily in sylvatic cycles and non domiciliated vectors are able to disperse from peridomestic and or sylvatic sites to occasionally infest or re infest houses it is also assumed that a domestic transmission cycle can be established as the result of the colonization or invasion of human dwellings by infected vectors or mammals pinho et al 2000 thus the non domiciliated vector species require novel control strategies to efficiently control chagas disease transmission and a thorough understanding of sylvatic t cruzi transmission cycles is critical to any long term disease control plans the different processes involved in sylvatic t cruzi transmission are very complex and in most cases are not captured by means of laboratory studies stochastic events also play an important role in the sylvatic cycle of t cruzi recently many biological works for instance pinho et al 2000 pointed from observations to the need to take ecological factors into account in the study of any host parasite interaction knowledge of factors such as host population density habitats and dynamics as well as peculiarities of the parasite with its reservoir hosts is a basic requirement for understanding the epidemiology of parasite disease it is well known that naturally infected mammals and bugs can be found in almost any sylvatic ecotope but very little is known about the kinetics of the transmission of t cruzi among its hosts in the natural environment jansen et al 1999 t cruzi in the wild can circulate in multiple hosts and vector species which vary throughout regions in northern mexico and the southern most part of texas the main t cruzi vector is triatoma gerstaeckeri associated in sylvatic settings with the southern plains woodrat eads et al 1963 kjos et al 2009 pippin 1970 in the eastern portion of texas into the southeast united states the predominant vector is triatoma sanguisuga ibarra cerdeña et al 2009 sarkar et al 2010 and is commonly associated with raccoons and opossums pung et al 1995 in north america the parasite is transmitted between triatoma vectors and reservoir hosts mainly raccoons procyon lotor opossums didelphis virginiana and several species of woodrat namely the southern plains woodrat neotoma micropus roellig et al 2009 large infected wild populations of triatoma infestans have been detected south of the amazon in south america and elsewhere in argentina paraguay and chile several modeling approaches have been used to gain insights into the biology and ecology of t cruzi and a good review on the mathematical models of chagas disease can be found in nouvellet et al 2015 in the case of t cruzi sylvatic cycles dynamical and differential systems have been used to study alternative modes of transmission and contact process saturation kribs zaleta 2006 kribs zaleta 2010b 2010c pelosse and kribs zaleta 2012 steindorf and maidana 2019 kribs zaleta other approaches such as metapopulation models crawford and kribs zaleta 2014 cellular automata crawford and kribs zaleta 2013 crawford et al 2013 and structured integro difference equations mahdjoub and kribs 2020 mesk et al 2016 were applied to study dispersal and invasion of triatominae or t cruzi barbu et al 2010 combine an extensive spatio temporal data set describing house infestation dynamics by triatome dimidiata within a village and spatial population dynamics models in a selection model approach to improve the understanding of non domiciliated vectors dispersal our aim in this work is to study the sylvatic transmission of t cruzi through an agent based model abm we recall that abms are models that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple entities in an attempt to re create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena these entities called agents or objects correspond to real biological actors with attributes restricted to those relevant to their evolution and interactions in the model the spatial location scalability links and aggregation are represented as well the aim of this new approach is to observe populations based upon hypothesis regarding individuals their relationships and their evolution over time abms are particularly suited for modeling complex systems because they present a high flexibility which can be observed along multiple dimensions fundamentally stochastic abms allow one to work at the level of the individual and account for individual variations they easily incorporate time and space heterogeneity in ways which classical models such as differential equations cannot the agent based approach has recently been used in modelling chagas disease but almost all the models developed were dedicated to the study of t cruzi transmission to humans for instance galvao and miranda 2010 developed a spatial three dimensional multi agent based computational within host model for the evolution of chagas disease this model permits to understand the participation of different types of cells in the cardiac tissue in the development of chagas disease devillers et al 2008 derived an agent based model abm to better understand the transmission process of two t cruzi strains and their competition for hosts which are humans their abm permits the prediction of the prevalence of the two t cruzi strains during single and mixed infections and shows that sylvatic reservoir hosts were necessary for obtaining realistic simulation results of the prevalence of the two strains we stress the fact that in the literature on chagas disease and t cruzi there are only two abms dealing with the sylvatic cycle of t cruzi transmission the first one is that of yong et al 2015 which was devoted to quantifying the rate of contacts between different host and vector species native to texas the second one is the work of figueroa et al 2009 whose goal is the study of the competition between two t cruzi strains using first ordinary differential equations ode and then an agent based model the latter created as a discrete stochastic version of the ode s including space and randomness focuses on matching precisely the rates in the differential equation model so that the two can be compared this abm models host vector interactions and growth of both hosts and vectors in a sylvatic setting however neither species of hosts and vectors are specified nor their behavior in the spatial domain further the spatial component has not been introduced in modeling host and vector behavior and their interactions space was considered only to observe a crowding out effect the broader lack of abms applied to sylvatic transmission cycles of t cruzi is what motivated this study so in this work we propose to build an individual based model that incorporates vector and host dispersal demography in vectors and hosts and host vector interactions to mimic a typical sylvatic cycle of t cruzi we implement and simulate this abm under different initial conditions to analyze the parasite transmission process in both hosts and vectors and visualize the spatial spread of infection in particular our abm simulates the introduction phase of t cruzi into a new geographical area like any biological invasion this phase can lead to the persistence or extinction of the parasite population sakai et al 2001 the main objective of this work is therefore to quantify the probability of persistence of the population of t cruzi depending on the initial conditions set in the case of the persistence of the t cruzi population we will focus on the study of initial evolutions of the processes of spatial dispersion infection and demography in vectors and hosts in order to highlight the life history traits that will support the proliferation of t cruzi the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we first present the biological background and the hypothesis under which we construct our abm then we describe the model construction the last part of this section is devoted to the simulator description and its internal structure in section 3 we present the different simulations to be tested section 4 summarizes the simulations results these correspond to the following issues 1 persistence extincion of t cruzi population and patterns of the spatial spread 2 parasite prevalences in hosts and vectors 3 host population abundance 4 vector population abundance 5 persistence of t cruzi population relative to the host and vector populations evolution section 5 offers a discussion of the results and a conclusion 2 the agent based model of t cruzi sylvatic transmission 2 1 biological background and hypothesis in a t cruzi sylvatic cycle the main mode of parasite transmission to hosts is by contact with the faeces of the vectors stercorarian transmission gourbiere et al 2012 wood 1951 and to vectors by feeding on infected hosts blood meal stevens et al 2013 in hosts congenital howard et al 2014 and oral transmissions shikanai yasuda and carvalho 2012 also contribute to the spread of the pathogen rabinovich and nieves 2011 but oral transmission is neglected in this work in vectors the rate of congenital transmission also called vertical transmission is null drees and jackman 1999 that is newborns of infected vectors are susceptible while in hosts vertical transmission affects a proportion of newborns the rate at which vertical transmission occurs in hosts remains unknown a probability of 0 1 for vertical transmission was given in moreno et al for wistar rats moreno et al 2003 by sanchez negrette et al for humans sánchez negrette et al 2005 and by kribs in kribs zaleta 2010c for raccoons while some experimental studies have confirmed much higher rates of vertical transmission that can attain 0 98 in mice and lemurs andrade 1982 hall et al 2007 triatomines life cycle is composed of seven stages an egg stage five instars and an adult stage but for simplification we consider vectors in only two stages juveniles and adults this simplification can be justified by the fact that the important distinctions between juvenile and adult vectors involve mobility and fertility which do not differ among instar stages hosts instars interactions necessary to pass from one stage to another such as blood meals are simplified by considering a probability of maturing for surviving individuals if a juvenile vector survives it can mature and transits with a certain probability to the adult stage this transition depends strongly on food availability and both intrinsic and environmental conditions fecundity is a major life history trait in triatomines it is initiated after a blood meal vectors feed on hosts females lay eggs after they have been fertilized by a male and after they have taken a blood meal from a host grundemann 1947 olsen et al 1966 and hays 1965 reported an average of 711 eggs laid per female t sanguisuga under laboratory conditions and an average hatching percentage of 77 3 but these quantities may be lower in the wild as reported in kribs zaleta 2010a they would be in average in the order of 465 eggs laid in a year of which only 279 60 0 hatch this gives a number of 5 36 eggs per week laid by a t sanguisuga female reproduction in hosts varies with the different species of hosts for example it has been reported in nebraska a state that lies both in the great plains and in the midwestern united states an average size of 4 young per litter born to racoon females more than a year old and an average of 3 3 young per litter born to yearling females 2 2 the agent based model description in this section we formulate the agent based model of t cruzi transmission corresponding to the biological information quoted above for this purpose we consider a population composed of adult vectors juvenile vectors and hosts dispersing in a natural landscape of 1 km 2 represented by a 100 100 grid cell with a cell representing a real area of size 10m 10m we denote a vector by v and a host by h each vector v has the following attributes v s e x m male or f female a g e j juvenile or a adult s t a t e s susceptible or i infected while a host is characterized only by its sex and its infection state h s e x m male or f female s t a t e s susceptible or i infected juvenile vectors and adult vectors males and females survive respectively with survival probabilities σj and σa if a juvenile vector survives it can mature to the adult stage with a probability of transition τ also called maturation probability a host male or female survives with probability σh a female host and an adult female vector reproduce respectively with probabilities p r e p h and p r e p v the model simplifies host reproduction by modelling new hosts only when they are old enough to reproduce for female and to travel and forage independently of their mothers after which point hosts live alone for simplification all the probabilities σj σa σh τ p r e p h and p r e p v are assumed constant in time so that they lead to exponential distributions of waiting times this corresponds closely to the distribution yielded by a classical deterministic dynamical system and reflects realistic variation about the mean infection is considered to affect neither demographic parameters of vectors and hosts nor the survival and transition probabilities indeed as is common with many enzootic infections customary hosts and vectors which are really just carriers do not die or recover from the pathogen t cruzi the parasite continues to replicate in the gut of a vector but does not kill it in hosts the parasite seeks the tissue of vital organs where it replicates but typically sylvatic hosts die of natural causes long before the parasite can cause organ failure all the vectors males and females juveniles and adults are haematophagous and feed on hosts by having blood meals the blood meal digestion time in vectors which corresponds to the minimum time between two consecutive contacts with hosts is 1 week yong et al 2015 from this we choose a time step δt 1 week in our modelling at time t 0 the population of vectors and hosts is randomly distributed in the space where each agent v or h has its position x y during each time step δt 1 week three processes succeed in a natural order these processes are 1 contacts between vectors and hosts through blood meals which can lead to infecting bites and hence a transmission of the infection 2 the demographical process in hosts and vectors and development in juveniles 3 the dispersal process in vectors and hosts corresponding respectively to the search of blood meals for vectors and food for hosts 1 the contact process bite and blood meal in a sylvatic setting contacts between vectors and hosts hold in dens and at night indeed vectors live in dens of hosts and bites hold at the nights in the dens where hosts sleep to avoid the difficulty of creating permanent dens in space an average of 9 25 dens raccoon within its territory according to yong et al 2015 and all the resulting complexity our model considered space homogeneous in this sense and models contacts through the local interacting distance between hosts and vectors space is used to locate vectors and hosts in cells and to define distances between them hence the contact between a vector and a host is described as follows every vector v searches the nearest host in his cell and bites it if no host is available in his cell in the considered time step the vector v has no blood meal if an infected vector v bites a susceptible host h the latter will be infected via the stercorarian route with probability λ if a susceptible vector v bites an infected host h then v will be surely infected such modelling integrating space through local interactions has never been considered in earlier models devillers et al 2008 has considered space as one patch where all hosts have the same risk to be bitten and in figueroa et al 2009 the authors poll a set of the agents who may have an interaction and then find the closest agent for the first agent to interact with avoiding the difficulty of the problem of interaction based on an interacting distance 2 survival maturation and reproduction processes survival maturation and reproduction processes are implemented following these rules each adult male vector vma has a survival probability σa if it does not die in the time step δt there is no change in its attributes if it dies it is removed from the system each juvenile vector vj has a survival probability σj if it does not die in the time step δt it develops and transits to the adult stage it becomes va with probability τ if it dies it is removed from the system each adult female vector vfa has a survival probability σa if it dies it is removed from the system if it does not die in the time step δt it gives birth with probability p r e p v to 4 susceptible juvenile vectors with sex ratio 1 1 there is no vertical transmission in vectors these newborns are added in the system and placed near the mother in the same grid cell each male host hm has a survival probability σh if it does not die in the time step δt there is no change in its attributes if it dies it is removed from the system each susceptible female host hfs has a survival probability σh if it dies it is removed from the system if it does not die in the time step δt it gives birth with probability p r e p h to 4 susceptible hosts with sex ratio 1 1 the 4 newborn hosts are added in the system and placed near the mother in the same grid cell each infected female host hfi has a survival probability σh if it dies it is removed from the system if it does not die in the time step δt it gives birth with probability p r e p h to 4 hosts with the sex ratio 1 1 each of the 4 newborn hosts is infected with probability λ the vertical transmission probability the 4 newborn hosts are added in the system and placed near the mother in the same grid cell 3 dispersal the dispersal process is essentially linked to foraging in many works it has been reported that primary hosts such as raccoons and opossums move within their home range either to forage or to defend themselves by leaving their dens when the latter are occupied by many vectors in turn vectors disperse in search of hosts or new hosts to feed on rabinowitz and pelton 1986 shirer and fitch 1970 yong et al 2015 in this study we assume that all agents are concerned by the dispersal process hosts disperse to feed and vectors disperse in search of hosts on which to feed the spatial dispersal process for all species is modelled by a two dimensional random walk this random distribution is appropriate for hosts and vectors since space is assumed homogeneous we assume that dispersal capacities in juvenile vectors are lower than those of adult vectors juen 1981 although the dispersal distance for both hosts and adult vectors is about the same see yong et al 2015 hosts and vectors disperse differently during a week time step the hosts disperse nearly daily from one den to another lotze and anderson 1979 urban 1970 while the vectors disperse at most once to feed mesk et al 2016 it will be assumed in order to avoid an invasion situation on the part of the host population that the weekly displacements balance sheet of an individual does not take it far from its starting point so we consider that during a time step hosts and adult vectors move by 2 cells in the space grid while juvenile vectors move by only one cell this means that dispersal distance for adult vectors and hosts is of 20m per week which corresponds to a small and local dispersal some works reported considerably larger distances lotze and anderson 1979 urban 1970 yong et al 2015 2 3 internal structure and interface of the abm the abm conceived in this study is a tool of experiments intended to represent virtually t cruzi sylvatic transmission through host vector interactions it is developed in order to describe the spatio temporal spread of t cruzi as well as predict the prevalences of the parasite in vector and host populations and their abundance in space and time we use the platform cormas to implement it bommel et al 2015 cormas for common pool resources and multi agent systems is a generic agent based modeling platform dedicated to common pool resources management it is a framework that proposes predefined classes and a set of visualization tools to facilitate the implementation of abm and analysis of simulation scenarios it uses visualworks a programming environment based on smalltalk one of the first purely object oriented languages goldberg and robson 1983 generally cormas describes models by spatial entities to represent the geographic space social entities to describe the actors and passive entities for the rest of the model elements in our study social entities are vectors and hosts and spatial entities are cells of the grid representing the environment the simulator is provided with a three windows interface i the first window allows the user the set up of the global variables and parameters ii the second window allows one to initialize run and visualize evolution of the vector and host populations and their infection prevalences iii the third window opens on a spatial grid showing the virtual landscape and the agents in time the spatial grid consists of 100 100 cells where each cell represents a unit of space in a cell a host is represented by a yellow filled triangle while a vector is represented by a purple filled circle cells that contain infected agents are colored red 3 model parameters and scenarios tested in this section we propose to implement and simulate the abm under different initial conditions in order to analyze the infection process in both hosts and vectors and visualize the spatial spread of the parasite in this study the considered region is the southeastern us and the chosen species are raccoons for hosts and t sanguisuga for vectors raccoons are the primary sylvatic hosts in the southeastern us and t sanguisuga are the predominant vectors in this region the different scenarios to be tested are given in table 1 they correspond to the different initial conditions for vector and host populations in term of the infection state the first four scenarios will be tested in order to examine and quantify the effect and impact of introducing one or two t cruzi infected agents in an initially safe population while the last five scenarios will be run with the goal of exploring the evolution and the fate of the infection process in vector and host populations for different initial numbers of infected hosts and vectors in order to quantify the effect of the vertical transmission in hosts on the t cruzi persistence we propose to test scenario 7 in which infected hosts are male and female with sex ratio 1 1 to be compared to scenario 7 in which all infected hosts are female the outputs of the abm are prevalences for hosts and vectors in time time evolution of vector and host populations time evolution of infected vectors and infected hosts and pictures showing the spatial spread of t cruzi the nine scenarios above are all performed under the initial numbers of hosts and vectors n h 10 and n v 10000 which due to the limited capacity of our simulator are slightly reduced from real densities of vectors and hosts observed in southeastern u s there were about 20 raccoons for 31600 t sanguisuga km 2 in kribs zaleta 2010c the natural environment is considered as a closed 100 100 grid representing an area of 1 km 2 where each grid cell is a square of size 10m 10m as the time step δ t 1 week we convert the daily survival probabilities for the natural t sanguisuga and raccoons given in yong et al 2015 and hence obtain the respective survival probabilities per week for juvenile vectors adult vectors and hosts σ j 0 987 σ a 0 986 and σ h 0 992 probability of reproduction in hosts is also converted to a weekly probability from the daily probability of reproduction for raccoons given by yong et al 2015 we obtain p r e p h 0 017 for vectors the daily reproduction probability proposed for natural t sanguisuga in yong et al 2015 yields to a weekly probability p r e p v 0 646 we point that all the daily probabilities given by yong et al 2015 are obtained from the conversion of the baseline event rates rates of birth death and maturation for raccoons and vectors to probabilities using the deterministic exponential growth model for more detail see appendix a 4 in yong et al 2015 for the infection probability from a vector to a host we take λ 0 06 rabinovich et al 2001 it is the only probability of infection in the literature available for wild host and it has been obtained from opossums we suppose that it can also be applied to raccoons in vectors the probability of maturation and transition per week from juvenile stage to adult stage is τ 0 008 as considered for t sanguisuga in yong et al 2015 host and vector populations are both considered with a female sex ratio p s e x 1 1 mesk et al 2016 braun and mares 1989 that is n h f n h m 5 and n v m n v f 5000 in the vector population we consider that juveniles represent the half 1 2 of the total number of vectors and we assume that the female sex ratio in this subpopulation of vectors is 1 1 that is n v f j n v m j 2500 table 2 summarizes the values of the parameters used in the abm 4 simulation results in our study each of the nine scenarios described in the earlier section has been simulated 100 times to damp out randomness embodied in the simulator we point out that all the numerical results presented below are averages of the number of repetitions 4 1 persistence extincion of t cruzi population and patterns of the spatial spread table 3 gives the frequencies of obtaining persistence of the population of t cruzi over 100 repetitions of the numerical simulations carried out for each of the 9 considered scenarios to simplify the presentation of the obtained results we will call these frequencies persistence frequencies in contrast the frequencies of getting extinction of the population of t cruzi will be called extinction frequencies when starting with only one infected agent that is a female host scenario 1 table 3 shows the extinction of the parasite t cruzi in the 90 of the simulations while the 10 other simulations of the same scenario show the persistence of the parasite the spatial distribution obtained in this latter case is illustrated by fig 1 which shows the spread of the parasite among other agents in space it should be noted that the t cruzi population extinction 90 of the simulations occurs after a fairly long time generally almost 7 years 362 time steps see 1a in figure 5 all the simulations 100 of scenario 2 only a single adult female vector is infected show the parasite s extinction see table 3 in a very short time less than 50 weeks see 2a in figure 5 fig 2 illustrates the spatial distribution obtained in this case the initial condition of scenario 3 in addition to having an infected female host as in scenario 1 we also have an infected female vector quadrupled the persistence of t cruzi population relative to scenario 1 the persistence frequency passes from 10 to 40 of simulations see table 3 table 3 shows that when the values of the initial conditions are doubled scenarios 6 and 7 for hosts and scenarios 5 and 8 for vectors the persistence frequency is multiplied by 2 33 for hosts from 30 to 70 and by 6 for vectors it goes from 10 to 60 this shows the sensitivity of the persistence to initial conditions figs 3 and 4 illustrating the spatial structure obtained for respectively scenarios 7 and 8 show the formation of clusters of infection when t cruzi persists the most likely cases of t cruzi persistence are obtained in scenarios 7 and 8 respectively 70 and 60 persistence frequencies and persistence is more frequent when the initial infected agents are hosts rather than vectors table 3 also shows that the greater the percentage of females in infected hosts the greater the frequency of t cruzi persistence scenario 7 70 persistence frequency vs scenario 7 30 persistence frequency this result is due to the vertical transmission of the parasite by an infected female host 4 2 host and vector infection prevalences fig 5 summarizes time evolution of prevalences in hosts and vectors for the nine studied scenarios graphics 2a and 4a in figure 5 corresponding respectively to scenarios 2 and 4 show that starting from very low initial values in vectors 2 10 4 for scenario 2 and 4 10 4 for scenario 4 the prevalence decreases rapidly towards zero which means that an extinction of t cruzi s population takes place in the first time steps of the simulations the extinction cases in scenarios 1 3 5 6 7 7 and 8 see graphics 1a 3a 5a 6a 7a 7 a and 8a in fig 5 show that host prevalence dominates vector prevalence although the initial conditions of scenarios 5 and 8 induce a significant initial prevalence in vectors the vector prevalence then decays rapidly to be dominated by host prevalence until the extinction of the t cruzi population the pattern of the time evolution of the prevalence in the cases of t cruzi persistence remains identical to the cases of the extinction until near the 400th week prevailing prevalence in the hosts during the last 100 time steps all the persistence graphs show a reversal of the situation the infection is more carried by the vectors than the hosts and for these latters the prevalence seems to stabilize finally it should be noted that juvenile vector prevalence remains lower than adults in all the tested scenarios table 4 adult vectors having greater displacement ability than juveniles will increase of course their contact probability via blood meals 4 3 host abundance the time evolution of the host population density in the 9 studied scenarios is represented in fig 6 the simulations show that for the same scenario persistence of t cruzi takes place in runs wherein the host population grows well and rapidly fig 6 shows clearly that the density of the hosts in the case of the persistence of t cruzi is always greater than in the case of extinction this result can be explained by the fact that more survival and good reproduction in hosts promote the contacts with vectors and infection which leads to the persistence of t cruzi otherwise if more hosts die including infected hosts and reproduction is weak it would force the infection to go extinct we specify that differences in host population densities are only due to the stochasticity of the host dynamics through survival and reproduction probabilities infection has no effect on the abundance of host population since it does not affect host demographical parameters notice that the host population grows exponentially this is due to the use of unbalanced host demographical parameters see section 3 to stabilize host population density around the values observed in ecological literature probabilities of reproduction and survival given in yong et al 2015 must be adjusted 4 4 vector abundance figure 7 shows the time evolution of the vector density in the 9 studied scenarios in both persistence and extinction cases in all the scenarios the evolution curves have the same pattern an exponential initial growth to reach quickly a maximum value in less than 50 weeks then a regular decrease in continued decay in figs 8 and 9 which give the time evolutions of juvenile and adult vectors respectively the juvenile curve fig 8 shows in the early first stages less than 50 weeks an important exponential growth to reach a maximum value that exceeds 30000 juvenile vectors and just after a regular decrease while the adult curve shows a significant decay in the first steps less than 50 weeks and then a regular decrease the juvenile population growth observed in the first steps stems from to the reproduction process in adults p r e p h 0 646 which gives birth to new juvenile vectors while the adult density only decreases because of the very low value of the maturation probability τ 0 008 so no transitions from the juvenile stage to adult take place during the 50 first weeks only deaths occur as a result the significant decrease in the adult population decreases the juvenile density after the 50 first weeks since the reproduction process becomes weaker when the number of vector adults diminishes the continued exponential decay observed in juvenile adult and vector populations is due to the use of unbalanced vector demographical parameters survival probabilities of juvenile and adult vectors must be adjusted to stabilize the vector density as in nature 4 5 persistence of t cruzi population relative to the host and vector populations evolution fig 10 shows the time evolution of the infected populations hosts and vectors for the nine scenarios in scenarios in which the parasite t cruzi is initially carried by only a small number of adult vectors scenarios 2 and 4 the population of t cruzi decreases rapidly towards extinction see graphs 2a and 4a in fig 10 all remaining scenarios show that persistence of t cruzi in vectors depends on its persistence in host population that is persistence occurs with the growth of the infected host population otherwise there is extinction of the parasite in the case of t cruzi persistence the density of infected vectors is higher than that of infected hosts this is essentially due to the initial density of vectors which is 1000 times greater than that of hosts there are 10 hosts for 10000 vectors in the considered area on the other hand fig 11 shows that the time evolution of infected host population is positively correlated to both the time evolution of host population and the number of initially infected hosts indeed table 5 which gives the final numbers of hosts vectors infected hosts and infected vectors in case of persistence shows that the highest number of infected hosts which is 639 66 is obtained in scenario 7 in which the initial number of infected hosts is the higher among all scenarios 50 of hosts are infected and the host population grows the more 2367 hosts after 500 time steps notice that the highest number of infected vectors is also observed in this scenario scenario 7 table 5 this observation confirms the result quoted in the precedent paragraph namely that the infection process in vectors is strongly linked to the infected host population evolution 5 discussion as earlier mentioned the purpose of this work is to study through an agent based approach the persistence of the parasite t cruzi in a sylvatic population of hosts and vectors the agent based model abm we conceived describes qualitatively and quantitatively vector host interactions in a sylvatic environment the abm includes demographical processes and spatial dispersals for both vectors and hosts on one hand in our model vector and host populations evolve in space and time according to the survival demographical and dispersal parameters encoding host and vector population dynamics on the other hand contrarily to devillers et al 2008 who did not consider the spatial component of the habitat and then each host had the same risk to be bitten by a vector our abm integrated the spatial component by allowing hosts and vectors positions in space and the contact process takes place or not according to a local interacting distance between hosts and vectors such features have not been used in previous abm dealing with t cruzi transmission devillers et al 2008 figueroa et al 2009 and to our knowledge no study before has attempted to model t cruzi transmission dynamics in a sylvatic setting using such an abm the abm simulations of this study have been devoted to test effect and impact of introducing spatially randomly distributed proportions of t cruzi infected agents hosts and or vectors in a safe susceptible population of hosts and vectors in all the simulations initial sizes of host and vector populations have been fixed with survival demographical and infection parameters taken from the literature kribs zaleta 2010c mesk et al 2016 rabinovich and nieves 2011 yong et al 2015 braun and mares 1989 it should be noted that while our simulations are specific to the particular area southeastern u s where the considered hosts are raccoons associated to the vector species t sanguisuga our abm can be applied to other host and vector species simply by adjusting parameter values to be appropriate to those species nine scenarios were considered they correspond to t cruzi parasite invasion situations when carried by 1 the vectors alone scenarios 2 4 5 and 8 2 the hosts alone scenarios 1 6 7 and 7 and 3 hosts and vectors together scenario 3 in the first and second cases different initial values were taken to test the sensitivity of the obtained results to the initial conditions our first result is that t cruzi s geographical expansion has a non zero probability of aborting indeed the extinction frequencies of the t cruzi population vary according to the considered scenarios and reach the maximum value of 100 when a very small number of vectors are initially infected scenarios 2 and 4 we must go to an initial situation where a quarter of the vector population is infected scenario 5 to reduce the probability of extinction to 90 this result is analogous to the case where only one female host is initially infected scenario 1 the extinction frequency is lowest 30 in the case where 50 of the hosts are initially infected and all of them are females scenario 7 when the biological invasion takes place our numerical simulations highlight in most cases the formation of clusters of infection the clusters formation can be explained by the fact that when a susceptible vector carries out its blood meal on an infected host the probability of transmission of the parasite is maximum and equal to 1 0 06 in the inverse case rabinovich et al 2001 as we do not consider the fact that the host has the opportunity to defend himself when stung the situation where several vectors can feed on the same infected host remains possible in addition our abm allows the hosts a displacement identical to that of the adult vectors 2 cells unit of time this hypothesis may be another factor favoring the formation of clusters in cases where there is parasite persistence the study of the temporal evolution of the infection shows the existence of two distinct phases the first phase is characterized by a prevailing prevalence in the hosts except for scenarios 5 and 8 where due to initial conditions the initial prevalences of the vectors are higher than those of the hosts but decrease rapidly during the first stages of the infection the second phase occurs later after 400 time steps in average in this phase vector prevalence becomes dominant and remains increasing over time until the end of the simulations 500 weeks indicating that the infection is carried more clearly by the vectors while the prevalence among hosts is stabilizing around the average value of 0 2 the appearance of these phases is explained in part by the very low ratio of host vector densities 10 3 in the case of initial densities when introducing the parasite t cruzi in hosts the prevalence in hosts starts from the minimum value of 0 1 to grow through the blood meal of infected vectors on the one hand and the process of vertical transmission on the other hand remember that on 40 newborn hosts stemed from 10 infected host mothers 4 are infected with sex ratio 1 1 however among vectors in the most favorable case corresponding to scenario 8 the prevalence starts from 0 5 but because of the rapid decline of the number of infected vectors in the first few steps due to the scarcity of infected hosts and given the exponential growth of the vector population this prevalence decreases rapidly it is only in the vicinity of the 200th time from which the number of infected hosts starts to show some increase that the parasite begins to proliferate in the vector population and then to exceed the prevalence in the hosts the main result of this study is that infection in hosts and evolution of host population constitute together the determining factor for the persistence of the t cruzi population the presence of t cruzi in only vectors is not enough for parasite transmission and its spatial spread even if initially there is a huge number of infected vectors in this case the parasite can be extinct if the transmission of t cruzi from infected vectors to hosts is rare and that host population growth is weak a small number of hosts and or infected hosts makes the contact process between vectors and hosts less frequent which limits transmission of t cruzi among hosts and vectors the presence of infected hosts is thus necessary for the transmission of infection among both hosts and vectors and a good evolution of host population is essential for the persistence of the parasite these two factors combined is what truly triggers the t cruzi transmission in vectors and increase vector infection prevalences whether there was an initial infection in vectors or not thus we can claim that this work highlights the role of host population as the only source of infection for vectors and as the determinant factor for the parasite maintenance this result agrees well with the conclusions obtained from the biological experiments in gottdenker et al 2012 in which the authors have shown the importance of host reproductive rates as an important determinant of vector infection hence it is suggested that further research on host life history would be needed to improve knowledge on t cruzi epidemiology further the role of the vertical transmission process in hosts on the persistence of t cruzi population is quantitatively highlighted through the persistence frequencies scenarios 7 and 7 by this the absence of vertical transmission in vectors is identified as a limiting factor for t cruzi transmission in vectors the simulations have also highlighted the effect of the maturation probability from juvenile stage to adult stage on the vectors population evolution the small value for the maturation probability τ 0 008 week leads to a decline of the adult vector population therefore the juvenile vector population while beginning exponentially growing high probability of reproduction p r e p v 0 646 week decreases rapidly and likewise for the total vector population from several simulations that we do not present here we point out that increasing the maturation probability from 0 008 to 0 01 leads to an important increase of vector population the latter goes to explosion at long run from this study we can see that the control of the geographical expansion of chagas disease in the sylvatic setting should not be limited to the insecticidal control of triatomines as currently planned in endemic countries hosts also play a key role in the successful biological invasion of t cruzi and as a result control is required as the disease evolves into clusters it is important that the fight would be geographically targeted finally we claim that our abm is a first step in the incremental process dedicated to the comprehension of the complexity of t cruzi infection in wild it is based on many simplifying hypothesis we intend in a future work to improve this ibm by introducing spatial heterogeneities through the creation of permanent host dens and extend our study by including diverse host species associated with several vector species and environmental effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financialinterestsor personal relationships that could have appeared to
