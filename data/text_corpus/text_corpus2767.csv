13835,the objective of this study was to develop a two layer cloth filtration system to remove standard plate count spc bacteria from surface water having low turbidity 10 ntu using m oleifera seeds as a coagulant during pretreatment in the first part of this study 1 μm polystyrene particle was chosen as a surrogate for bacteria and the effects of the type of cloth combination of cloth and m oleifera seed powder dosage on filtration performance were investigated it was found that without coagulation pretreatment the removal efficiency of the particles was less than 40 however coagulation pretreatment significantly improved the efficiency to higher than 99 for the tightest cloth it was also observed that the two layer cloth filtration was effective in preventing the decrease in water permeability caused by the deposition of m oleifera seed powder on the cloth in the second part of this study several coagulation filtration treatment conditions that demonstrated good filtration performance in the first part of this study were applied to the treatment of pond water to remove spc bacteria experimental data showed that the two layer cloth filtration with m oleifera seeds used as coagulant was capable of removing bacteria below 100 cfu ml 1 which is an acceptable drinking water quality criterion recommended by the world health organization who in addition it was successfully demonstrated that m oleifera seed powder that was deposited on the filter cloth could be easily removed by gentle surface scrubbing after which the filter cloth recovered its water permeability keywords developing countries drinking water natural coagulant moringa oleifera cloth filtration 1 introduction the primary goal of drinking water treatment in developing countries is to remove pathogenic microorganisms that cause waterborne diseases to achieve this primary goal developing countries use filtration technologies including sand filtration 1 2 mineral pot filters 3 and ceramic silver impregnated pot filters 4 7 although these filtration technologies act as effective barriers against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms their implementation requires manufacturing and continued maintenance of the system hence cloth filtration has recently gained interest as it is a simple low maintenance easy to implement technology at the household level in previous literature folded cotton sari cloth 2 8 9 and denim fabric 10 were chosen as filtration media and they demonstrated the effective removal of pathogenic microorganisms from lake water given that the pore size of the cloth is significantly larger than the typical sizes of bacteria e g 0 5 2 μm for e coli physical removal of free bacteria is unlikely to contribute to the effectiveness of cloth filtration in addition in contrast to sand filtration cloth filtration is incapable of removing bacteria by adsorption due to its low surface area therefore adsorption of bacteria to particulate matter that are larger than the effective pore size of the cloth and the subsequent physical sieving of the large particulate matter is the dominant bacteria removal mechanism with respect to cloth filtration consequently the application of cloth filtration technology is limited to surface waters with relatively high turbidity because a majority of bacteria in surface waters with low turbidity are present as free bacteria without adsorbing to particulate matter given the limitation of the present cloth filtration system and its requirement to be more versatile the objective of this study was to develop a cloth filtration system that would be an effective barrier against bacteria in surface water with relatively low turbidity 10 ntu this was achieved by introducing two concepts to existing cloth filtration systems the first concept was coagulation pretreatment before the use of cloth filtration the coagulant used in this study was moringa oleifera m oleifera seed powder m oleifera is one of the most widespread moringa species and grows quickly in tropical belts the usage of m oleifera as a natural coagulant has been studied over the past two decades and been demonstrated that the coagulation activity is comparable to conventional chemical coagulants 11 19 in addition most parts of m oleifera are edible and rich in nutrients 20 22 given these advantages the world health organization who promotes the cultivation of m oleifera however m oleifera coagulation pretreatment before filtration leads to the deposition of m oleifera seed powder on the cloth leading to a corresponding decrease in water permeability to mitigate this undesired phenomenon a second concept was introduced a two layer filtration system using two cloths having different pore sizes thus this study demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating the decrease in water permeability in the first part of this study 1 μm polystyrene particle functionalized with a fluorescence substance was chosen as a surrogate for bacteria and the influence of the type of cloth combination of the cloth and m oleifera seed powder dosage on filtration performance were investigated in the second part of this study several coagulation filtration treatment conditions that demonstrated good filtration performance in the first part of this study were applied to the treatment of pond waters with low turbidity 10 ntu to remove the standard plate count spc bacteria therefore the insights obtained from this study provide useful information on the physical structure of cloth filtration media that can simultaneously achieve high removal efficiencies against bacteria and low fouling propensity 2 materials and methods two types of coagulation filtration experiments each aimed at removing different targets were performed in this study the procedures for each experiment are described below all aqueous solutions were prepared using distilled water di water wa200 yamato scientific co ltd tokyo japan dry m oleifera seeds that were harvested in republic of mozambique were purchased from feel our soil an online seed distributor the bark enveloping the seeds was removed and bare seeds ca 5 mm in diameter were ground to powder particle size distribution of the obtained powder of m oleifera seeds was 27 0 45 μm 28 45 100 μm 31 100 250 μm and 14 250 500 μm with respect to the cloths used in this study one type of nylon bolting cloth with a pore size of 48 μm tokyo screen co ltd tokyo japan and six types of polypropylene filter cloths with different water permeability ohtsuka jitsugyo co ltd tochigi japan were used it is difficult to determine the pore size distribution of polypropylene filter cloths because they are made by weaving yarns which are in turn made using a bundle of filaments representative scanning electron microscopy sem images are shown in fig 1 nonetheless based on the sem images shown in fig 1 as well as the capability to physically remove 1 μm particles as later shown in fig 2 it is reasonable to conclude that these filter cloths have significantly smaller pores than the 48 μm nylon bolting cloth fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc labeled polystyrene nanoparticles that were 1 μm in size polydispersity index 0 2 were purchased from merck chimie sas paris france unless otherwise stated other chemicals used in this study were reagent grade quality and were obtained from nacalai tesque inc kyoto japan or fujifilm wako pure chemical corp osaka japan and used without further purification 2 1 experiments for 1 μm polystyrene particle removal before performing experiments to target the spc bacteria in pond water experiments were performed using di water containing 1 μm polystyrene particles 1 μm polystyrene particle was chosen to be a surrogate of particle contaminants including bacteria because i the typical size of bacteria is of the order of microns and ii like most particles in the environment polystyrene particles are negatively charged due to residual surface sulfate 50 ml of di water containing approximately 1 5 107 ml 1 of 1 μm polystyrene particle was measured in a 50 ml polypropylene tube a predetermined amount of m oleifera seed powder was added after shaking the tube for 30 s by hand the whole mixture was poured into a uhp 43 k stirred cell advantec toyo co ltd tokyo japan then the filtration experiment was started at 0 2 mpa by mixing the contents of the cell using a built in floating magnetic stirrer at 500 rpm average water permeability was calculated according to the time required to filter 50 ml of the mixture as described above the experimental factor investigated in this study included the type of filter cloth and the combination of these bolting cloths with a nylon bolting cloth pore size of 48 μm therefore cloth filtration conditions are denoted as 48 μm bolting cloth the type of filter cloth for instance 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth a denotes the filtration condition that the 48 μm bolting cloth was on top of the filter cloth a 2 2 experiments for removal of spc bacteria from pond water feed water was collected from a concrete pond in the campus of faculty of engineering of yamaguchi university this pond does not have a natural surface water inlet or outlet except rainfall and evaporation the ph turbidity and spc bacteria concentration of corrected feed water were found to be in the range of 5 3 6 0 3 9 ntu and 900 2410 cfu ml 1 respectively coagulation pretreatment and subsequent filtration treatment were conducted in the same way as described in section 2 1 and the cfu concentrations of spc bacteria in treated water were analyzed experiments that simulated the realistic daily use conditions were performed by repeatedly treating 50 ml of pond water with filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b in this experiment after completely filtering 50 ml of pond water coagulated with 100 mg of m oleifera seed powder the filter cloths were detached from the cell after which wet m oleifera seed powder deposited on the cloths were removed by gently scrubbing the surface with a toothbrush the cleaned cloths were re attached to the cell and the filtration process of 50 ml of coagulated pond water was repeated 2 3 analytical methods solution ph values were measured using a ph meter hm 30 p dkk toa corp tokyo japan turbidity was measured using a turbidimeter tn 100 eutech instruments pte ltd il usa the concentration of fitc labeled polystyrene 1 μm particle was measured using an accuri c6 flow

determined in terms of cfus using a test kit for spc bacteria compactdry tc nissui pharmaceutical co ltd osaka japan all filtration experiments were performed in duplicate and the values reported in this study used the mean of the two measurements the reproducibility expressed as relative duplicate errors of particle concentrations for 1 μm particles and cfu concentrations for spc bacteria were

using an upright microscope eclipse fn1 nikon corp tokyo japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of 1 μm particle by a single layer filter cloth without coagulation pretreatment filtration experiments were first performed without coagulation pretreatment to evaluate the physical sieving ability of the six types of filter cloths the obtained results are shown in fig 2 removal efficiency of 1 μm particle by bolting cloth having a pore size of 48 μm is not shown in fig 2 because no removal was observed removal efficiencies of 1 μm particle gradually increased for filter cloths with lower water permeability and reached 81 for filter cloth f which was the tightest one this indicated that proper selection of filter cloth aids in the removal of free bacteria in the feed water without coagulation pretreatment however this approach was not used in this study because the water permeabilities of filter cloths showing high levels of 1 μm particle removal efficiencies were too low to apply to water treatment in developing countries specifically if the filtration treatment was performed by wringing water using the tightest filter cloth filter cloth f at a pressure corresponding to 0 2 mpa and with an effective filter cloth area of 100 cm2 it would have to be continuously squeezed for more than 2 h to obtain 1 l of treated water accordingly we selected the three loosest filter cloths showing the highest water permeability filter cloths a c and filtration experiments were performed with coagulation pretreatment 3 2 removal of 1 μm particle by a single layer cloth with coagulation pretreatment the influence of m oleifera seed powder dosage and the type of cloth on 1 μm particle removal efficiency are shown in fig 3 a values in parentheses in fig 3 a represent the dosage mg 50 ml 1 of m oleifera seed powder also shown in fig 3 a is a representative sem image of filter cloth b indicated by an arrow after the filtration experiment the particle removal efficiency gradually increased with an increase in m oleifera dosage for all types of cloths and reached 99 for the tightest filter cloth that is filter cloth c however except for the 48 μm bolting cloth water permeability averaged value during 50 ml filtration gradually decreased with an increase in m oleifera dosage this is due to the formation of a deposition layer of m oleifera seed powder during filtration on top of filter cloth see sem image in fig 3 a on the other hand water permeability of 48 μm bolting cloth did not decrease even for the highest dosage of m oleifera seed powder i e 100 mg 50 ml 1 it should be noted that 73 wt of m oleifera seed powder was larger than 45 μm see materials and methods meaning that approximately 73 wt of m oleifera seed powder was removed by the 48 μm bolting cloth and was deposited on it therefore the observed non decrease in water permeability for the 48 μm bolting cloth indicates that the water resistance of a deposition layer consisting of large particles i e 48 μm was marginal due to its highly porous structure consequently there was no significant impact on water permeability with respect to the 48 μm bolting cloth 3 3 removal of 1 μm particle by two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment using a two layer cloth filter which consisted of a stack a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloths a c filtration experiments with coagulation pretreatment were performed the results obtained are shown in fig 3 b in the same way as fig 3 a values in parentheses in fig 3 b represent the dosage mg 50 ml 1 of m oleifera seed powder the comparison between fig 3 a and fig 3 b clarifies the impact of the 48 μm bolting cloth on filtration performance first when coagulation pretreatment was not performed the average water permeability during the 50 ml filtration did not decrease with the addition of the 48 μm bolting cloth for instance if filter cloth b was used as an example the average water permeability would be approximately 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 for both filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b this result is not surprising considering that water permeability of a 48 μm bolting cloth is much higher than that of the filter cloths thus an increase in water resistance by using a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloths was supposed to be negligible second more importantly for this study the addition of a 48 μm bolting cloth prevented the decrease in average water permeability for filter cloths a and b even with the highest m oleifera dosage thus introducing a two layer cloth filtration system kept water permeability at the same level during the 50 ml filtration based on these results we conclude that the concept of a two layer cloth filtration system is effective in improving fouling propensity and can be applied to remove the spc bacteria in pond waters having low turbidity 10 ntu 3 4 removal of spc bacteria by the two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment concentrations of spc bacteria in pond waters after the two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment are shown in fig 4 as water permeabilities did not change before and after 50 ml filtration of pond water data on water permeabilities are not shown in fig 4 the decrease in water permeability by repeated treatment of pond water is discussed in section 3 5 as shown in fig 4 cloth filtration without m oleifera coagulation pretreatment was not effective in removing bacteria however the concentration of spc bacteria in treated water gradually decreased with increasing m oleifera dosage as a result although the spc bacteria concentration did not meet the who recommendation i e 100 cfu ml 1 even for the highest m oleifera dosage for filter cloth a when filter cloths b or c were used the treated water was observed to meet the who recommendation for all three feed waters at a m oleifera dosage of 50 mg 50 ml 1 or at least 100 mg 50 ml 1 based on these results we selected filter cloth b and a m oleifera dosage of 100 mg 50 ml 1 and 50 ml of pond water was repeatedly treated using the aforementioned treatment conditions 3 5 repeated treatment of pond water by the two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment fig 5 shows the results of the experiments that simulated realistic daily use conditions by repeatedly treating 50 ml of pond water at a m oleifera dosage of 100 mg 50 ml 1 and subsequently used filter cloth b or 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b similar to the results shown in fig 4 for 1 μm particle 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b provided approximately four times higher water permeability than filter cloth b moreover the effectiveness was maintained during treatment cycles adding a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloth b did not have a positive nor negative influence on the removal efficiencies of spc bacteria and their concentrations were under 100 cfu ml 1 furthermore water permeability did not significantly decrease with increasing number of treatment cycles although a slight decreasing trend was observed as expected from the sem images showing there are remaining m oleifera seed powders between the filaments as well as yarns this result indicated that the majority of the m oleifera seed powder that was deposited on filter cloth b was removed by gently scrubbing it using a toothbrush in fact di water permeabilities of filter cloths b were measured after scrubbing the sem images are inserted in fig 6 and compared with that of virgin filter cloth b the result showed that in both instances the decrease in di water permeability was less than 10 for filter cloth b providing a direct evidence to this indication 3 6 discussion experimental results shown in figs 3 and 5 demonstrate that adding a 48 μm bolting cloth to filter cloth b can effectively inhibit a rapid decrease in water permeability caused by the deposition of m oleifera seed powder in this section we consider two phenomena illustrated in fig 6 as potential mechanisms underlying this positive influence obtained by adding a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloth b and discuss the plausible mechanism the first potential mechanism illustrated in fig 6 shows that the separation of large and small particles by a 48 μm bolting cloth results in a significant decrease in the overall water resistance even though the total mass deposited on the two layer cloth is the same in other words decrease in water permeability observed in fig 3 a for single layer cloth filtrations is the result of the formation of a m oleifera seed powder deposition layer with high water resistance which is caused by the co existence of small and large particles the second potential mechanism is that the 48 μm bolting cloth acts like a feed channel spacer in spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane element by creating turbulence in the feed water resulting in the inhabitation of m oleifera seed powder deposition on cloths to test these two potential mechanisms two additional experiments were performed first we performed experiments similar to those shown in fig 3 however before pouring into a stirred cell we filtered the mixture of the feed solution and m oleifera seed powder through a 48 μm bolting cloth the filtered feed solution was filtered again using filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b to measure water permeability this was done for two reasons 1 if the first possibility was the responsible mechanism given that we removed m oleifera seed powder larger than 48 μm in advance using a bolting cloth the structure of the deposition layer should be the same for these two filtration conditions resulting in same water permeabilities 2 if the second possibility is the responsible mechanism 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b should provide higher water permeability than filter cloth b because a 48 μm bolting cloth agitates the feed solution during filtration experimental results showed that water permeabilities of these two conditions were the same that is about 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 thus supporting the validity of first potential mechanism a consistent conclusion was obtained from the second additional experiment wherein di water permeabilities were tested with filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b obtained from fig 3 specifically after finishing the experiments shown in fig 3 di water was slowly added to the cell with utmost care and attention so as to not disturb the deposition of m oleifera seed powder on cloths di water permeabilities were measured without using a built in floating magnetic stirrer if the first possibility is the responsible mechanism di water permeability of the fouled 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b should be higher than that of fouled filter cloth b because the stratified structure of m oleifera seed powder deposition remains during di water filtration on the other hand if the second possibility is the responsible mechanism the di water permeabilities of these two fouled cloths should not be significantly different because 100 mg of m oleifera seed powder is already deposited on the cloths at the beginning of di water filtration in both cases experimental results showed that the di water permeabilities of these cloths were 11 0 and 145 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 for filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b respectively this large discrepancy revealed that water resistance of m oleifera seed powder significantly decreased after the separation of large and small particles by adding a 48 μm bolting cloth thereby additionally supporting the validity of first potential mechanism in summary both additional experiments consistently showed that the decrease in water permeability observed for single layer cloth filtration fig 3 a was a result of the formation of a m oleifera seed powder deposition layer with high water resistance which was caused by the presence of small and large particles furthermore the separation of large and small particles by adding a 48 μm bolting cloth decreased the overall water resistance of the m oleifera seed powder deposition interestingly the water permeability of 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b did not increase even after the removal of m oleifera seed powder larger than 48 μm in advance using a bolting cloth but continued to remain at about 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 compare the result for 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b in fig 3 b and the result of first additional experiment therefore water resistance of the m oleifera deposition layer on a 48 μm bolting cloth was negligible however where smaller m oleifera seed powder co existed the mixed layer provided high water resistance finally it is important to provide a rough idea about the water flux obtained in this study by calculating the time required to obtain 1 l of treated water the water permeability obtained using 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b was found to be approximately 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 if we assume an effective filter cloth area of 100 cm2 and an applied pressure of 0 2 mpa only 16 s are required to filter 1 l of feed water therefore the system is capable of producing drinking water at the household level whenever required although the data obtained in this study demonstrates the validity of our strategy they also indicate the need for further research these include the optimization of the physical structure of the two layer cloth filtration and the development a cloth filtration apparatus that has a large surface filter cloth area to allow water to be squeezed out at a relatively low pressure another important aspect that needs to be tackled is the potential increase in dissolved organic carbon and corresponding enhancement of remaining bacteria regrowth which has been recognized as one of major drawbacks associated with using m oleifera seed for drinking water production 12 13 16 19 4 conclusions in this study a two layer cloth filtration system using m oleifera for coagulation pretreatment was studied as a simple water treatment system with respect to its effectiveness against spc bacteria in pond waters with low turbidity experimental results showed that the system was capable of reducing spc bacteria below 100 cfu ml 1 with a m oleifera dosage of 50 mg 50 ml 1 or at least 100 mg 50 ml 1 the two layer filtration system 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloth was found to be effective in avoiding a decrease in water permeability caused by the formation of m oleifera seed powder deposition with high water resistance the deposition layer of m oleifera seed powder was also easily removed by scrubbing the surface with a toothbrush declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

powder i e 100 mg 50 ml 1 it should be noted that 73 wt of m oleifera seed powder was larger than 45 μm see materials and methods meaning that approximately 73 wt of m oleifera seed powder was removed by the 48 μm bolting cloth and was deposited on it therefore the observed non decrease in water permeability for the 48 μm bolting cloth indicates that the water resistance of a deposition layer consisting of large particles i e 48 μm was marginal due to its highly porous structure consequently there was no significant impact on water permeability with respect to the 48 μm bolting cloth 3 3 removal of 1 μm particle by two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment using a two layer cloth filter which consisted of a stack a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloths a c filtration experiments with coagulation pretreatment were performed the results obtained are shown in fig 3 b in the same way as fig 3 a values in parentheses in fig 3 b represent the dosage mg 50 ml 1 of m oleifera seed powder the comparison between fig 3 a and fig 3 b clarifies the impact of the 48 μm bolting cloth on filtration performance first when coagulation pretreatment was not performed the average water permeability during the 50 ml filtration did not decrease with the addition of the 48 μm bolting cloth for instance if filter cloth b was used as an example the average water permeability would be approximately 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 for both filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b this result is not surprising considering that water permeability of a 48 μm bolting cloth is much higher than that of the filter cloths thus an increase in water resistance by using a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloths was supposed to be negligible second more importantly for this study the addition of a 48 μm bolting cloth prevented the decrease in average water permeability for filter cloths a and b even with the highest m oleifera dosage thus introducing a two layer cloth filtration system kept water permeability at the same level during the 50 ml filtration based on these results we conclude that the concept of a two layer cloth filtration system is effective in improving fouling propensity and can be applied to remove the spc bacteria in pond waters having low turbidity 10 ntu 3 4 removal of spc bacteria by the two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment concentrations of spc bacteria in pond waters after the two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment are shown in fig 4 as water permeabilities did not change before and after 50 ml filtration of pond water data on water permeabilities are not shown in fig 4 the decrease in water permeability by repeated treatment of pond water is discussed in section 3 5 as shown in fig 4 cloth filtration without m oleifera coagulation pretreatment was not effective in removing bacteria however the concentration of spc bacteria in treated water gradually decreased with increasing m oleifera dosage as a result although the spc bacteria concentration did not meet the who recommendation i e 100 cfu ml 1 even for the highest m oleifera dosage for filter cloth a when filter cloths b or c were used the treated water was observed to meet the who recommendation for all three feed waters at a m oleifera dosage of 50 mg 50 ml 1 or at least 100 mg 50 ml 1 based on these results we selected filter cloth b and a m oleifera dosage of 100 mg 50 ml 1 and 50 ml of pond water was repeatedly treated using the aforementioned treatment conditions 3 5 repeated treatment of pond water by the two layer cloth filtration with coagulation pretreatment fig 5 shows the results of the experiments that simulated realistic daily use conditions by repeatedly treating 50 ml of pond water at a m oleifera dosage of 100 mg 50 ml 1 and subsequently used filter cloth b or 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b similar to the results shown in fig 4 for 1 μm particle 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b provided approximately four times higher water permeability than filter cloth b moreover the effectiveness was maintained during treatment cycles adding a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloth b did not have a positive nor negative influence on the removal efficiencies of spc bacteria and their concentrations were under 100 cfu ml 1 furthermore water permeability did not significantly decrease with increasing number of treatment cycles although a slight decreasing trend was observed as expected from the sem images showing there are remaining m oleifera seed powders between the filaments as well as yarns this result indicated that the majority of the m oleifera seed powder that was deposited on filter cloth b was removed by gently scrubbing it using a toothbrush in fact di water permeabilities of filter cloths b were measured after scrubbing the sem images are inserted in fig 6 and compared with that of virgin filter cloth b the result showed that in both instances the decrease in di water permeability was less than 10 for filter cloth b providing a direct evidence to this indication 3 6 discussion experimental results shown in figs 3 and 5 demonstrate that adding a 48 μm bolting cloth to filter cloth b can effectively inhibit a rapid decrease in water permeability caused by the deposition of m oleifera seed powder in this section we consider two phenomena illustrated in fig 6 as potential mechanisms underlying this positive influence obtained by adding a 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloth b and discuss the plausible mechanism the first potential mechanism illustrated in fig 6 shows that the separation of large and small particles by a 48 μm bolting cloth results in a significant decrease in the overall water resistance even though the total mass deposited on the two layer cloth is the same in other words decrease in water permeability observed in fig 3 a for single layer cloth filtrations is the result of the formation of a m oleifera seed powder deposition layer with high water resistance which is caused by the co existence of small and large particles the second potential mechanism is that the 48 μm bolting cloth acts like a feed channel spacer in spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane element by creating turbulence in the feed water resulting in the inhabitation of m oleifera seed powder deposition on cloths to test these two potential mechanisms two additional experiments were performed first we performed experiments similar to those shown in fig 3 however before pouring into a stirred cell we filtered the mixture of the feed solution and m oleifera seed powder through a 48 μm bolting cloth the filtered feed solution was filtered again using filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b to measure water permeability this was done for two reasons 1 if the first possibility was the responsible mechanism given that we removed m oleifera seed powder larger than 48 μm in advance using a bolting cloth the structure of the deposition layer should be the same for these two filtration conditions resulting in same water permeabilities 2 if the second possibility is the responsible mechanism 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b should provide higher water permeability than filter cloth b because a 48 μm bolting cloth agitates the feed solution during filtration experimental results showed that water permeabilities of these two conditions were the same that is about 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 thus supporting the validity of first potential mechanism a consistent conclusion was obtained from the second additional experiment wherein di water permeabilities were tested with filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b obtained from fig 3 specifically after finishing the experiments shown in fig 3 di water was slowly added to the cell with utmost care and attention so as to not disturb the deposition of m oleifera seed powder on cloths di water permeabilities were measured without using a built in floating magnetic stirrer if the first possibility is the responsible mechanism di water permeability of the fouled 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b should be higher than that of fouled filter cloth b because the stratified structure of m oleifera seed powder deposition remains during di water filtration on the other hand if the second possibility is the responsible mechanism the di water permeabilities of these two fouled cloths should not be significantly different because 100 mg of m oleifera seed powder is already deposited on the cloths at the beginning of di water filtration in both cases experimental results showed that the di water permeabilities of these cloths were 11 0 and 145 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 for filter cloth b and 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b respectively this large discrepancy revealed that water resistance of m oleifera seed powder significantly decreased after the separation of large and small particles by adding a 48 μm bolting cloth thereby additionally supporting the validity of first potential mechanism in summary both additional experiments consistently showed that the decrease in water permeability observed for single layer cloth filtration fig 3 a was a result of the formation of a m oleifera seed powder deposition layer with high water resistance which was caused by the presence of small and large particles furthermore the separation of large and small particles by adding a 48 μm bolting cloth decreased the overall water resistance of the m oleifera seed powder deposition interestingly the water permeability of 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b did not increase even after the removal of m oleifera seed powder larger than 48 μm in advance using a bolting cloth but continued to remain at about 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 compare the result for 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b in fig 3 b and the result of first additional experiment therefore water resistance of the m oleifera deposition layer on a 48 μm bolting cloth was negligible however where smaller m oleifera seed powder co existed the mixed layer provided high water resistance finally it is important to provide a rough idea about the water flux obtained in this study by calculating the time required to obtain 1 l of treated water the water permeability obtained using 48 μm bolting cloth filter cloth b was found to be approximately 192 ml mpa 1 min 1 cm 2 if we assume an effective filter cloth area of 100 cm2 and an applied pressure of 0 2 mpa only 16 s are required to filter 1 l of feed water therefore the system is capable of producing drinking water at the household level whenever required although the data obtained in this study demonstrates the validity of our strategy they also indicate the need for further research these include the optimization of the physical structure of the two layer cloth filtration and the development a cloth filtration apparatus that has a large surface filter cloth area to allow water to be squeezed out at a relatively low pressure another important aspect that needs to be tackled is the potential increase in dissolved organic carbon and corresponding enhancement of remaining bacteria regrowth which has been recognized as one of major drawbacks associated with using m oleifera seed for drinking water production 12 13 16 19 4 conclusions in this study a two layer cloth filtration system using m oleifera for coagulation pretreatment was studied as a simple water treatment system with respect to its effectiveness against spc bacteria in pond waters with low turbidity experimental results showed that the system was capable of reducing spc bacteria below 100 cfu ml 1 with a m oleifera dosage of 50 mg 50 ml 1 or at least 100 mg 50 ml 1 the two layer filtration system 48 μm bolting cloth on filter cloth was found to be effective in avoiding a decrease in water permeability caused by the formation of m oleifera seed powder deposition with high water resistance the deposition layer of m oleifera seed powder was also easily removed by scrubbing the surface with a toothbrush declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13836,a novel thin film nanocomposite tfn forward osmosis fo membrane with a positively charged and nanofunctional substrate layer has been developed for effective heavy metal ions removal the substrate layer is constructed by adding titania nanotubes and magnetite oxide hybrid nanoparticles tnt fe3o4 in the polysulfone psf matrix the introduction of nanoparticles endowed the substrate layer with improved hydrophilicity and loose structure the modified substrate layer also improved the affinity between the nanofillers and polymer matrix hence maintaining the selectivity of membrane compared to pristine thin film composite tfc membrane the tfn with 0 5 wt nanofillers loading showed enhanced water flux from 1 63 to 2 82 l m 2 h 1 without losing its selectivity in terms of js jv ratio when operated in fo mode the enhancement was mainly attributed to the improved substrate hydrophilicity which has effectively reduced the internal polarization concentration icp the best performing tfn 0 5 membrane increased the water flux with 73 compared to tfc and exhibited a high cd2 and pb2 heavy metal ion rejection of 98 by designing the substrate layer this study demonstrated the feasibility of enhancing the performance of fo membrane for treating heavy metal wastewater through a simple and efficient method keywords forward osmosis heavy metal ions titania nanotubes magnetite oxide 1 introduction heavy metal contamination is a critical environmental issue that caused by the uncontrolled discharge of heavy metal the electronics electroplating machinery manufacturing and metallurgy industries have produced an extensive amount of wastewater containing heavy metals which is eventually discharged into water bodies consumption of water body containing trace amount of heavy metals is enough to severely threaten the health of human metal ions tend to penetrate inside human body through accumulation pathway and cause severe health effects and body dysfunction because it is unable to be metabolized by human body or decomposed easily 1 although heavy metal ions could be eliminated from wastewater by several conventional methods including adsorption chemical precipitation and ion exchange 2 the major issues with these technologies are their effectiveness energy consumption and long term sustainability forward osmosis fo has gained interest as a membrane based water treatment alternative owing to its low membrane fouling tendency and low energy consumption compared to other pressure driven membrane techniques 3 4 however the common issue encountered by most tfc fo membranes is the icp 5 the reverse diffusion of salt and the intrinsically porous structure of the substrate layer are the major contributors to icp icp results in the decrease in the effective driving force and eventually declines the water flux the most common and effective strategy to reduce the icp phenomenon in fo membrane involves the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles to alter the membrane substrate properties 6 the incorporated nanoparticles also transfer their essential properties to the membrane which maintain the membrane performance while addressing the icp issue 7 currently the inorganic nanomaterials that have been most widely used for fo membrane modification include zeolite graphene oxide go carbon nanotube cnt and metal oxides such as titanium dioxide tio2 8 these nanomaterials are introduced into polymeric membranes matrices to improve the membrane hydrophilicity and reduce the surface roughness 9 10 magnetite oxide fe3o4 is one of the widely explored nanomaterials for wastewater treatment as it is cheaply and easily available low in toxicity and highly hydrophilic 7 11 darabi et al 12 were the first to add fe3o4 nanoparticles in polyethersulfone pes substrate to mitigate icp the results revealed that the porosity and the hydrophilicity of the pes substrate were improved after the addition of fe3o4 hence leading to lower structural parameter s and enhanced water flux as both hydrophilicity and icp are equally important factors to be considered for a high performance fo membrane it is necessary to fabricate a membrane that can simultaneously address both issues nevertheless most of the efforts in fo membrane modification were focused on using single nanomaterial to bring about the desired properties for desalination and wastewater treatment although the large specific surface area ssa of fe3o4 endowed the material with good adsorptivity towards heavy metal it also led to the high agglomeration tendency of the nanoparticle 13 14 hybridization of two geometrically different nanoparticles has been reported to effectively avoided this agglomeration issue 6 15 to this end titania nanotube tnt could serve as a great deposition platform for the fe3o4 particles apart from possessing all the beneficial characteristics of tio2 such as good hydrophilicity and high ssa the fine aperture of the tubular tnt which is saturated with oxygen functional groups could favour the diffusion of water through the nanotube leading to high water flux of the resultant nanocomposite 16 all these features encouraged the employment of tnt fe3o4 hybrid to improve the performance of polymeric membrane for water separation application currently there are still limited studies on the synthesis of hybrid nanoparticles used for the modification of fo membrane substrate to mitigate icp issue and improve the membrane performance sirinupong et al 17 developed a tfn fo desalination membrane in which its psf substrate incorporated with the hybrid of tio2 go the roles of hybrid nanoparticles were discussed in their study and significant improvement in the performance of tfn fo membrane was observed the tfn fo membrane incorporated with tio2 go hybrid nanoparticles achieved a higher water flux of 23 l m 2 h 1 compared to that of incorporated with single tio2 18 l m 2 h 1 or go 10 l m 2 h 1 nanoparticles all the membranes showed salt rejection of over 90 the great potential of synergizing multiple nanomaterials to improve membrane permeability and mitigate icp can be achieved via nanomaterial hybridization approach this study aims to determine the roles of synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles performance to mitigate icp of fo membranes when they were incorporated into the membrane substrate the loading of hybrid nanoparticles was optimized to achieve the best separation performance finally the membrane regeneration capability and the leaching tendency of nanoparticles were also studied to give a general idea on the practical usage of the fabricated tfn 2 experimental 2 1 materials titanium dioxide p25 ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o 98 merck

dissolved in 200 ml distilled water then 1 g of tnt was added the amount of iron precursors needed was calculated based on stoichiometric equation as shown in equation 1 19 1 fecl2 2 fecl3 8nh4oh

the zeta potential analysis was determined in ph range of 0 10 by using hcl and naoh to adjust the ph 2 4 membrane preparation psf was used due to its hydrophilicity and good mechanical strength n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp was the organic solvent used while polyvinylpyrrodine pvp was used as the membrane pore former the mixture was physically stirred until homogenous dope solution was obtained

analysis of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles fig 3 shows the fesem and tem images as well as edx analysis of the synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid comprised of a mixture of tubular and spherical nanoparticles which were similar to the structures of the tnt and fe3o4 synthesized by raeisi et al 28 and taufik et al 29 respectively this confirmed that the tnt

titanium ti 12 5 were detected confirming the formation of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the edx elemental mapping in fig 3 c further confirmed that the tnt successfully hybridized with fe3o4 fig 3 b show the tem images of the synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the tnt synthesized by padaki et al 30 showed a long cylindrical structure with multilayer walls and open ended lumen with diameter around 20 40 nm arshad et al 11 reported that fe3o4 comprised of spherical particle with average sizes around 6 20 nm based on tem images in fig 3 b the average diameters of tnts and fe3o4 was 19 85 nm and 7 71 nm which are similar to that synthesized by padaki et al 30 and arshad et al 11 respectively chen et al 20 reported that the formation of tnt fe3o4 tio2 composite and observed the coexistence of fe3o4 and tio2 components on the surface of tnt fig 3 b also shows the deposition of spherical shape particles on the cylindrical shape particle hence it can be deduced that fe3o4 has been successfully deposited on the tnt surface to form the desired hybrid nanoparticles 3 1 2 crystallinity analysis of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the xrd patterns of tnt fe3o4 hybrid tnts and fe3o4 were depicted in fig 4 the three peaks at 2θ of 10 48 24 76 and 48 58 were corresponded to the crystal structure of tnts which existed in anatase phase as reported by subramaniam et al 18 the

34 0 mv 7 93 mv to 24 9 mv and 7 37 mv to 26 8 mv for tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 respectively past studies revealed that tnt and fe3o4 were negatively charged at ph range of 3 to 7 31 and 4 to 12 15 respectively the three types of nanoparticles prepared in this study were negatively charged in the studied ph range the value of zeta potentials of nanomaterial become negative when the solution ph is larger than its point of zero charge pzc and vice versa 32 pzc refers to the ph value at which the particles surface carries net charge of 0 mv the pzc of tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles was located at ph 0 427 ph 1 53 and ph 0 352 respectively all the synthesized nanoparticles with negative charge on their surface were expected to show good adsorptivity toward cationic compounds in aqueous solution 15 the negative surface charge implied that the nanoparticles possessed excessive negatively groups deposited to their surfaces xiong et al 2016 nanoparticles with absolute zeta potentials values of 30 70 mv could form stable dispersions in aqueous solutions of different ph at room temperature since the zeta potentials of tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 were 24 9 mv 34 0 mv and 26 8 mv respectively all the synthesized nanoparticles could form stable dispersions in aqueous solutions 3 2 characterization of tfn fo membrane 3 2 1 morphological analysis of tfn fo membranes fig 5 b c and f show the sem cross sectional images of tfns incorporated with 0 5 wt of tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles respectively it is noticed that all the membranes formed finger like pore structures without any trace of nanoparticles similar to that of reported by chai et al 14 moreover tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 showed long finger like voids extended from the top to the bottom while the tfc and tfn tnt fe3o4 showed short finger like structures in between the dense layer and a macrovoid filled sublayer the formation of long finger like voids was attributed to the presence of hydrophilic nanofillers in the dope solution which facilitated water diffusion into the casted polymer film and induced faster solvent nmp and non solvent water exchange during phase inversion process 17 from the cross sectional morphologies in fig 5 d g tfns incorporated with different tnt fe3o4 loading also consisted of finger like pores and macrovoids alam et al 33 reported that the growth of macrovoids could be encouraged by the addition of low fe3o4 concentration but quickly suppressed at high fe3o4 concentration on the other hand increasing the amount of tnt would lead to formation of larger finger like pores while supressing the formation of horizontal macrovoids 30 it is observed that tfn 0 1 fig 5 d showed large macrovoids underneath while the tfn 0 7 fig 5 g represented the suppression of finger like structure hence it can be deduced that the synergy effects of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles could significantly modify the pores structure of membrane it is observed that the thickness of psf nanocomposite substrate increased as the loading of nanoparticles increased the thickness of the substrates in the range of 98 6 133 μm showed close agreement to the previous study lau et al 34 reported the thickness of pa layer of tfns ranged from 88 5 nm to 114 nm the overall thickness of all membranes is not much different and have most similar finger like structure due to the same preparation method the surface morphologies of all psf substrates fabricated in this study were shown in figure s1 3 2 2 surface properties and overall porosity of tfn fo membranes the top surface morphological structure of tfns were examined by 3d afm images as shown in figure s2 the changes in roughness was investigated in term of mean roughness ra and root mean square of roughness rrms from table 2 it was observed that all the tfns have a ridge and valley structure pa which distributed throughout the plane this morphology has been commonly observed in previous 35 it is noticed that incorporation of nanoparticles into polymeric substrate increased the surface roughness of the membranes the r a value of tfn fe3o4 tfn 0 5 and tfn tnt is 46 71 nm 50 32 nm and 68 11 nm respectively moreover tfn tnt obtained the roughest surface compared to tfn fe3o4 and tfn 0 5 all the tfn membrane incorporated with tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles showed greater surface roughness compared to that of tfc membrane 17 with the increasing loading of tnt fe3o4 the r a value of the tfns gradually increased from 37 93 nm for tfn 0 1 to 67 24 nm for tfn 0 7 this trend was aligned with the observation from past study 36 and was ascribed to the formation of nodular structures when nanoparticles were incorporated in the substrate matrix 37 theoretically the increase in surface roughness would increase the area available for the water transport 12 all the tfns were expected to obtain higher flux in fo process compared to tfc the wca of psf nanocomposite substrates embedded different nanoparticles which decreased from fe3o4 tnt fe3o4 and tnt is 68 7 66 1 and 64 1 respectively in respect to hydrophilicity all the psf nanocomposite substrate exhibited lower wca compared to neat psf substrate with 69 4 this is in good agreement with previous study 17 the reduction in wca was attributed to the presence of water affinitive groups on the nanoparticles which led to the formation of hydrophilic channels within the substrate matrix 12 28 the increase in hydrophilicity of psf nanocomposite substrates by increasing the loading of tnt fe3o4 nanoparticles from 0 1 wt to 0 7 wt which was indicated by the decrease in wca from 74 2 to 62 9 and was illustrated in figure s3 this trend is aligned with observation from previous study 33 there is a significant difference in the wca of tfns after the formation of a thin film pa layer on the top surface of the psf nanocomposite substrate all tfns exhibited hydrophilic surface with wca falls in the range of 58 6 to 39 8 the results revealed that tfn 0 5 exhibited the lowest surface wca while tfc showed the highest surface wca which is 39 8 and 59 8 respectively in comparison the water contact angle of tfn 0 7 only slightly reduced from 62 9 to 58 6 after formation of pa layer lau et al 34 reported that the physical and chemical characteristics of psf based substrate could induce the formation of pa layers with different water permeability and morphology it was suggested that more hydrophilic pa layers could be produced using hydrophobic substrate with larger surface pores as less pa will be yielded within the substrate pores during ip and led to formation of thinner thin film layer this eventually reduced the resistant toward water molecules transport and lowered the water contact angle measurement in the case of tfn 0 7 the comparatively lower hydrophilicity of its psf nanocomposite substrate compared to the substrates of other tfns induced formation of pa within the substrate pores which significantly lowered the membrane permeability 38 hence lower wca measurement was observed from table 2 and figure s4 it is observed that the overall porosity of psf nanocomposite substrates incorporated with different types of nanoparticles exhibited increased porosity within the range of 75 3 78 4 compared to neat psf substrate with porosity of 74 5 in fact the psf nanocomposite substrates incorporated with tnt had the largest porosity which is 78 4 this indicates that the incorporation of hydrophilic tnt nanoparticles could foster the solvent nonsolvent exchange rate and prompts to improvement in overall porosity of the membranes moreover the results revealed that the porosity of psf nanocomposite substrates increased from 72 2 to 77 3 as the loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles increased from 0 1 wt to 0 7 wt this range has been commonly observed in previous study 33 however it is noticed that the overall porosity of tfns were slightly lower than that of psf nanocomposite substrate this is due to the formation of a dense pa layer within the pore of substrate the dense pa layer on substrate layer would increase the resistance to water transport in ro process 39 the surface zeta potential of all tfns is in the range of 17 4 mv to 25 8 mv at ph 9 it is noticed that all the membranes demonstrated negative surface charge at ph 6 0 principally due to the typical characteristics of pa layer tfc is typically negatively charged due to the hydrolysis of residual acid chloride groups following ip which forms carboxyl groups on the surface and within the pa film 40 moreover the surface charge of all membranes is not much different regardless of the type of nanoparticles incorporated into the substrate hence it is deduced that the surface charge of all membranes is mainly contributed by the pa layer fig 6 shows the isoelectric point iep of pa layer at which the membrane obtained zero charge the iep change may also play significant role in the selectivity of ions it is likely that amine or carboxylic groups enrichment would strongly alter specific selectivities for cations or anions by changing the overall material charge and iep reis et al 2017 the initial ph of 10 ppm cd2 and pb2 were ph 5 55 and ph 5 47 respectively 3 3 thin film nanocomposite forward osmosis membrane performance 3 3 1 effect of various nanoparticles on tfn fo membrane fig 7 presents the fo water flux jv and reverse solute flux js of tfns incorporated with different types of nanoparticles for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal the performance of membranes was evaluated by crossflow fo in al fs orientation the experiments were performed using 10 ppm of cd no3 2 and pb no3 2 as feed solution and 1 m of nacl as draw solution with the crossflow rate 300 rpm at room temperature for both feed and draw solutions in order to provide insight into the synergistic effects and roles of the hybrid nanoparticles the performances of four types of membrane were compared i e tfc tfn tnt tfn fe3o4 and tfn 0 5 through the embedment of various nanoparticles into the substrate the water fluxes of all three tfns were significantly different compared to that of tfc membrane fig 7 a shows that tfn 0 5 exhibited the highest jv of 2 82 l m 2 h 1 compared to other membranes in cd2 removal due to the synergistic effects of tnt fe3o4 hybrid this improvement was associated to the increased membrane hydrophilicity with the incorporation of tnt and fe3o4 nanoparticles as evidenced in the decrease in water contact angle in the case of pb2 removal although the results revealed that the tfn 0 5 exhibited higher jv compared to tfc control which was 2 54 l m 2 h 1 and 2 45 l m 2 h 1 respectively the jv was slightly lower compared to tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 which was 2 78 l m 2 h 1 and 2 74 l m 2 h 1 respectively this observation was due to the increase in surface roughness of tfn tnt which in turn increased the area available for the water transport overall all membranes showed much higher jv in pb2 removal compared to cd2 removal the increase in water flux with the concentration of draw solution was mainly due to the elevated osmotic pressure 41 the cd2 and pb2 heavy metals used as the feed solution in this study is characterized by osmotic pressure of 0 0016 π and 0 0015 π respectively while the osmotic pressure of nacl is 48 9 π since greater difference in osmotic pressure between feed and draw solution will be generated when pb2 instead of cd2 was used as feed the resulted driving force for the transport of water across the membranes was also greater fig 7 presents the js of all tfns for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal the results revealed that the tfns exhibited significantly lower js in range from 0 13 g m 2 h 1 0 19 g m 2 h 1 for both heavy metals removal when compared to jv table 3 shows the comparison of js jv value of tfns for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal it is observed that the tfns showed decreasing trend of js jv value in the range from 0 09 g l to 0 05 g l for both heavy metals removal these results are aligned with the study performed by zhao et al 42 who fabricated fo membrane consisting of cnt sublayer they revealed that the decrease in js jv value indicated enhancement in the selectivity of the prepared fo membranes this implied that the separation performance of tfns fabricated in this study are satisfactory and better than tfc especially in cadmium removal fig 8 shows the heavy metals rejection of all prepared tfns the results revealed that all the membranes achieved much higher rejection over 98 for both cd2 and pb2 heavy metals according to the theoretical transport model the selectivity of membrane is based on mechanism such as sieving and charge repulsion 43 in particular the rejection of heavy metals by tfns was contributed by the pa layer the charges on the surface and pore structure of the pa layer are generated from the dissociation and protonation of active functional groups such as amine groups these charges enhance the separation performance through electrostatic charge repulsion between the membrane surface and co ionic species 44 moreover the tfns incorporated with tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles exhibited the highest rejection of cd2 and pb2 heavy metals which was 99 81 and 98 84 respectively tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 showed the moderate rejection of cd2 heavy metal compared to that of tfn 0 5 99 64 tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 achieved 98 72 and 98 74 rejection of pb2 heavy metal these data confirmed that the synthesized hybrid nanoparticles improved the water fluxes and the heavy metal rejection of the resulted membrane when incorporated into the pa layer generally the mechanism of tfn for heavy metal rejection is dominated by charge repulsion apart from the membrane chemical and physical properties the surface charge of pa layer is a main factor affecting the removal of pollutants especially positive charge species 25 it has been explained in previous section that when the ph of solution is lower than the pzc the zeta potential values will be shifted to more positively charged zone considering that the heavy metals feed solution was acidic which resulted in an overall positive zeta potential of the tfns fig 6 charge repulsion mechanism significantly induced the rejection for positively charged of heavy metals in this has been commonly observed in previous study 45 fig 8 shows that all membranes exhibited higher rejection for cd2 compared to that of pb2 the lower rejection of pb2 compared with cd2 in the tfc was due to the diffusion coefficient of pb2 in aqueous solution 1 89 10 5 that is higher than that of cd2 1 44 10 5 26 3 3 2 effect of different loading of tnt fe3o4 on tfn fig 9 a and fig 9 b present the fo water flux jv and reverse solute flux js of tfns incorporated with different loadings of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal respectively it was noticed that tfn 0 5 exhibited the highest jv which is 2 82 l m 2 h 1 in cd2 removal compared to other membranes on the other hand the tfn 0 3 showed the highest jv of 3 05 l m 2 h 1 compared to other membranes in pb2 removal all the membranes exhibited better permeability compared to tfc membranes which exhibited permeability of 1 63 l m 2 h 1 and 2 45 l m 2 h 1 for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal respectively however the tfn 0 7 exhibited the lowest jv in both heavy metals removal it is observed that the jv dropped in tfn 0 7 due to the decrease in porosity of the membrane raeisi et al 28 pointed out that the agglomeration of tnt nanoparticles at higher loadings could affect the formation of the free pores and voids in the substrate layer darabi et al 12 also reported that pore blockage and decrease in porosity of membrane could attributed to lower jv at higher loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles based on the findings from these two works although no visible agglomeration was observed in the membrane characterization the separation results indicated that the loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles beyond 0 5 wt was detrimental to the jv for cd2 removal the jv of membrane was significantly improved by incorporating 0 1 wt to 0 5 wt loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles where the jv was increased from 1 63 l m 2 h 1 to 2 82 l m 2 h 1 however the jv dropped to 1 21 l m 2 h 1 with the incorporation of 0 7 wt tnt fe3o4 it has also shown that tfn 0 5 that embedded with tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles in the substrate significantly improved the performance of tfn membrane as it gave the highest improvement towards the jv when compared to other membranes similar trend has been observed in past studies by he et al 46 and emadzadeh et al 23 who reported the optimal nanoparticles loading of 0 5 wt and 0 6 wt respectively to achieve enhancement in water flux without compromising the tfn separation efficiency for pb2 removal the jv of membrane was significantly improved by incorporating 0 1 wt to 0 3 wt tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles where jv was increased from 2 85 l m 2 h 1 to 3 05 l m 2 h 1 nevertheless the jv dropped to 2 14 l m 2 h 1 with the incorporation of 0 7 wt of nanoparticles by comparison tfn 0 5 achieved the highest water flux in cd2 removal while tfn 0 3 achieved the highest flux in pb2 removal all the tfns exhibited significantly lower reverse solute flux in the range of 0 11 g m 2 h 1 0 21 g m 2 h 1 for both heavy metals removal the range of js is in good agreement with the previous study 26 table 4 shows the comparison ratio of js jv of tfns for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal it is observed that all the tfns incorporated different loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles show lower value of js jv in range from 0 06 g l 0 10 g l for both heavy metals removal reported for cd2 removal the decrease in the js jv value of tfn 0 1 tfn 0 3 and tfn 0 5 in comparison to tfc indicated an improvement in cd2 removal efficiency but the membrane selectivity was compromised when the tnt fe3o4 loading reached 0 7 wt due to the aforementioned defects formation 47 on the other hand varying the loading of tnt fe3o4 did not affect the removal efficiency of pb2 as the js jv values remained constant fig 10 shows the heavy metals rejection of all prepared tfns it is noticed that all membranes exhibited significant improvement in the separation of cd2 and pb2 heavy metals as a result all the membranes achieved over 98 rejection for both heavy metals the rejection of heavy metals by tfns embedded with different loadings of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles into substrate was found to be improved compared to tfc the incorporation of 0 1 0 5 wt tnt fe3o4 into the substrate of tfns led to the enhancement in cd2 rejection by 0 58 0 72 respectively compared to tfc in the case of for pb2 removal tfns exhibited enhancement in rejection by 0 38 0 59 through the incorporation of 0 1 0 5 wt tnt fe3o4 respectively tfn 0 5 achieved the highest cd2 and pb2 rejection of 99 81 and 99 84 respectively the improved performance of tfn 0 5 was attributed to the synergistic effects of the hybrid that contribute to enhanced properties for heavy metal removal on the other hand it is observed that all the membranes have better rejection for cd2 compared to pb2 heavy metals the difference in the ionic radius of ions cd2 with 0 95 å smaller than pb2 with 1 19 å metal ions with smaller ionic radius tend to be strongly attached to water molecules and hold their hydration shell thus more rejected by the membrane 26 hence pb2 can easily diffuse through the tfc liu et al 41 found that the metal ions transport across lbl assembled fo membrane usually follows solution diffusion mechanism the heavy metal ions with relatively large hydrated radius exhibited decreased diffusivity hence could be easily rejected the difference in the hydrated radius of ions for cd2 is smaller than pb2 which is 4 26 å and 4 01 å respectively hence cd2 ions can be more easily rejected by the membrane while pb2 ions can easily diffuse through the tfc membrane 3 3 3 regeneration properties of tfn fo membrane the regeneration of tfns incorporated with different types of nanoparticles was studies through a prolonged filtration process fig 11 shows the water flux profile of cd2 rejection over a period of 8 hours filtration process consisting of four cycles 10 ppm of cd no3 2 was used as feed solution while 1 m nacl as draw solution after each filtration the membrane was regenerated by washing with distilled water for 5 minutes before repeating the filtration regeneration cycle it can be observed that all membranes were able to recover their water flux to the level similar to that of first cycle moreover it can be observed that all the membranes achieved over 99 of cd2 rejection at each cycle currently there is still no comprehensive standard method for testing leaching of nanoparticles from the tfn 48 leaching test was performed by determining the amount of titanium and iron that were presence in draw solution after each cycle of regeneration performance test to determine the stability of nanoparticles embedment in tfn 0 5 the results were tabulated in table 5 the concentration of nanoparticles leaching out in permeate was detected by the icp ms and aas instrument the world health organization organization 49 has set the acceptable level iron concentration in drinking water to 300 ppb from the leaching result around 120 430 ppb of iron was leaching from tfn 0 5 during each regeneration cycle which was very close to the allowable limit for safe drinking on the other hand only trace amount of titanium 3 5 ppb was leached during the experiment this implied that the tnt component of the hybrid nanoparticles was able to anchor firmly within the psf matrix due to its long few μm tubular shape while the fine 20 nm spherical fe3o4 could easily dislodge from the polymeric matrix this was to be expected as the sub micron pores of psf substrate would not be able to prevent the water flowing across the membrane from carrying the nano sized particles away and toward the draw solution however it should be noted that the level of nanoparticle leaching into the feed solution was very much lower than that detected from the draw solution as the dense pa layer served as an excellent barrier that block the nanoparticles from leaving the membrane matrix future work on tnt fe3o4 incorporated tfn for fo application should focus on improving the interaction of polymer matrix with the tnt and fe3o4 in order to address the issue related to nanomaterials leaching 3 3 4 intrinsic properties and structural parameter of tfn fo membrane table 6 summarizes the intrinsic properties and structural parameters of all the fabricated tfns it is noticed that all the tfn membranes exhibited much higher salt permeability b and higher salt rejection r values compared to the tfc the excellent separation performance of tfns was attributed to the presence of nanomaterials and the formation of defect free pa layer in particular the tfn 0 5 exhibited 90 48 higher water permeability 3 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared to tfc 1 89 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the improvement in water permeability was associated to the properties of membrane such as increased hydrophilicity porosity and surface roughness compared to the tfc as a result tfn 0 5 also exhibited 5 15 higher salt rejection than tfc the dilutive icp effect is significant in al fs orientation as it could decrease the net osmotic pressure across the membrane substrate and suppress the transportation of water molecules 6 it is observed that the tfn fo membrane incorporated with fe3o4 in the substrate layer promotes water transport as it provides extra water pathways in the substrate layer and consequently increased mass transfer coefficient of the support layer 12 table 6 shows an increasing trend in the water permeability of tfn fo membranes the structural parameter s is a typical parameter to characterize the icp effect of tfn fo membranes commonly a lower s value indicates the suppression of icp impact and improvement of water flux the psf substrate of tfn 0 5 had the much higher porosity 75 7 compared to that of tfn tnt 78 4 and tfn fe3o4 75 2 emadzadeh et al 23 reported the increase of the overall porosity of the substrate layers could be the main factor contributing to the smaller s value of tfn membrane compared to tfc the s value of tfn 0 5 membrane was 1 45 mm in cd2 and 1 60 mm in pb2 heavy metals removal hence the results obtained in this study proved that the addition of tnt fe3o4 into the psf substrate layer improves fo water flux performance through improving membrane permeability and minimizing the dilutive icp phenomenon inside the substrate layer compared to some recently published tfn such as the tfn modified with metal organic framework and polydopamine 45 50 the tfns prepared in this study have demonstrated better heavy metal rejection ability indicating the feasibility of using bimetallic oxide to improve the fo performances of the tfn membranes 3 3 5 performance benchmarking based on the data tabulated in table 7 the heavy metal rejection capability of tfn 0 5 was on par with many of the similar composite membranes developed by past studies in addition the relatively lower srsf of tfn 0 5 compared to other membranes especially those with nanofillers incorporated into the thin film layer indicated better salt selectivity of the former the integrity of the thin film played a critical role in determining the selectivity of the resulted composite membrane since the pa layer fabricated via ip is often 200 nm thick it is challenging to ensure defect free selective film formation when incorporating nanomaterials especially 3d particulates into the pa matrix moreover the incompatibility between the inorganic nanomaterial with the organic polymer matrix could result in the formation of interfacial gaps which negatively affected the crosslinking of the pa network these are believed to be the reasons for the lower selectivity of the tfn fabricated by qiu et al 45 he et al 46 and rezaei dashtarzhandi et al 51 which were incorporated with zif 8 mof 801 and ncc respectively compared to tfn 0 5 prepared in this study in contrast the tfn fabricated by saeedi jurkuyeh et al 26 that was incorporated with go displayed good selectivity due to the 2d sheet like geometry of the nanomaterial the nanometer thick go sheet was easily deposited into the pa layer with negligible risk of protruding from the film surface moreover go is renowned for its barrier property which could improve the sieving capability of the host polymeric matrix hence a low srsf of 0 03 g l was observed from the membrane in term of water flux it is noted that the membrane fabricated in this study was less permeable compared to that of literatures this could be related to the formulation of hand casted substrate employed in this study even though the incorporation of nanomaterials was able to enhance the performance of the tfn the overall output of the membrane is still largely governed by the properties of the polymeric matrix from table 7 it can be noted that regardless of the nanofiller employed when conventional asymmetric support was used for the fabrication of fo tfn tfc the achievable water flux was between 20 30 l m 2 h 1 however when glass nanofiber support was used zhao et al 52 were able to produce tfc that exhibited water flux of over 50 l m 2 h 1 this was attributed to the high porosity of up to 95 and a low s value of 119 μm of the substrate which enabled virtually friction free water permeation across the layer with little tendency of icp therefore considering the low porosity of 76 and a high s value of 1500 μm of the substrate fabricated in this study it is unsurprising that the tfn 0 5 exhibited comparatively poor water flux our future work will be focused on improving the structure and icp resistance of the substrate layer 4 conclusion in summary a novel tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticle was synthesized through hydrothermal and co precipitation method that incorporated into membrane substrate tfn fo membrane had been developed via phase inversion to cast the membrane substrate which incorporated tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles and the formation of polyamide layer on the substrate through interfacial polymerization method for heavy metal removal an optimized substrate layer was designed by adding tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles into substrate to improve the water flux and separation efficiency the introduction of nanoparticles endows the substrate layer with improve hydrophilicity and loose structure moreover the modified substrate layer has improved the affinity between the nanofillers and polymer matrix hence maintaining the selectivity of membrane tfn 0 5 membrane achieved the highest water flux with 2 82 l m 2 h 1 and 2 54 l m 2 h 1 for cd2 and pb2 removal respectively compared to tfc with 1 63 l m 2 h 1 and 2 45 l m 2 h 1 for cd2 and pb2 removal respectively the water flux was improved by 73 and 3 67 for cd2 and pb2 removal respectively furthermore this membrane exhibits high rejection to heavy metal ions 98 in fo mode the promising performance of these membranes highlights their potential

13836,a novel thin film nanocomposite tfn forward osmosis fo membrane with a positively charged and nanofunctional substrate layer has been developed for effective heavy metal ions removal the substrate layer is constructed by adding titania nanotubes and magnetite oxide hybrid nanoparticles tnt fe3o4 in the polysulfone psf matrix the introduction of nanoparticles endowed the substrate layer with improved hydrophilicity and loose structure the modified substrate layer also improved the affinity between the nanofillers and polymer matrix hence maintaining the selectivity of membrane compared to pristine thin film composite tfc membrane the tfn with 0 5 wt nanofillers loading showed enhanced water flux from 1 63 to 2 82 l m 2 h 1 without losing its selectivity in terms of js jv ratio when operated in fo mode the enhancement was mainly attributed to the improved substrate hydrophilicity which has effectively reduced the internal polarization concentration icp the best performing tfn 0 5 membrane increased the water flux with 73 compared to tfc and exhibited a high cd2 and pb2 heavy metal ion rejection of 98 by designing the substrate layer this study demonstrated the feasibility of enhancing the performance of fo membrane for treating heavy metal wastewater through a simple and efficient method keywords forward osmosis heavy metal ions titania nanotubes magnetite oxide 1 introduction heavy metal contamination is a critical environmental issue that caused by the uncontrolled discharge of heavy metal the electronics electroplating machinery manufacturing and metallurgy industries have produced an extensive amount of wastewater containing heavy metals which is eventually discharged into water bodies consumption of water body containing trace amount of heavy metals is enough to severely threaten the health of human metal ions tend to penetrate inside human body through accumulation pathway and cause severe health effects and body dysfunction because it is unable to be metabolized by human body or decomposed easily 1 although heavy metal ions could be eliminated from wastewater by several conventional methods including adsorption chemical precipitation and ion exchange 2 the major issues with these technologies are their effectiveness energy consumption and long term sustainability forward osmosis fo has gained interest as a membrane based water treatment alternative owing to its low membrane fouling tendency and low energy consumption compared to other pressure driven membrane techniques 3 4 however the common issue encountered by most tfc fo membranes is the icp 5 the reverse diffusion of salt and the intrinsically porous structure of the substrate layer are the major contributors to icp icp results in the decrease in the effective driving force and eventually declines the water flux the most common and effective strategy to reduce the icp phenomenon in fo membrane involves the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles to alter the membrane substrate properties 6 the incorporated nanoparticles also transfer their essential properties to the membrane which maintain the membrane performance while addressing the icp issue 7 currently the inorganic nanomaterials that have been most widely used for fo membrane modification include zeolite graphene oxide go carbon nanotube cnt and metal oxides such as titanium dioxide tio2 8 these nanomaterials are introduced into polymeric membranes matrices to improve the membrane hydrophilicity and reduce the surface roughness 9 10 magnetite oxide fe3o4 is one of the widely explored nanomaterials for wastewater treatment as it is cheaply and easily available low in toxicity and highly hydrophilic 7 11 darabi et al 12 were the first to add fe3o4 nanoparticles in polyethersulfone pes substrate to mitigate icp the results revealed that the porosity and the hydrophilicity of the pes substrate were improved after the addition of fe3o4 hence leading to lower structural parameter s and enhanced water flux as both hydrophilicity and icp are equally important factors to be considered for a high performance fo membrane it is necessary to fabricate a membrane that can simultaneously address both issues nevertheless most of the efforts in fo membrane modification were focused on using single nanomaterial to bring about the desired properties for desalination and wastewater treatment although the large specific surface area ssa of fe3o4 endowed the material with good adsorptivity towards heavy metal it also led to the high agglomeration tendency of the nanoparticle 13 14 hybridization of two geometrically different nanoparticles has been reported to effectively avoided this agglomeration issue 6 15 to this end titania nanotube tnt could serve as a great deposition platform for the fe3o4 particles apart from possessing all the beneficial characteristics of tio2 such as good hydrophilicity and high ssa the fine aperture of the tubular tnt which is saturated with oxygen functional groups could favour the diffusion of water through the nanotube leading to high water flux of the resultant nanocomposite 16 all these features encouraged the employment of tnt fe3o4 hybrid to improve the performance of polymeric membrane for water separation application currently there are still limited studies on the synthesis of hybrid nanoparticles used for the modification of fo membrane substrate to mitigate icp issue and improve the membrane performance sirinupong et al 17 developed a tfn fo desalination membrane in which its psf substrate incorporated with the hybrid of tio2 go the roles of hybrid nanoparticles were discussed in their study and significant improvement in the performance of tfn fo membrane was observed the tfn fo membrane incorporated with tio2 go hybrid nanoparticles achieved a higher water flux of 23 l m 2 h 1 compared to that of incorporated with single tio2 18 l m 2 h 1 or go 10 l m 2 h 1 nanoparticles all the membranes showed salt rejection of over 90 the great potential of synergizing multiple nanomaterials to improve membrane permeability and mitigate icp can be achieved via nanomaterial hybridization approach this study aims to determine the roles of synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles performance to mitigate icp of fo membranes when they were incorporated into the membrane substrate the loading of hybrid nanoparticles was optimized to achieve the best separation performance finally the membrane regeneration capability and the leaching tendency of nanoparticles were also studied to give a general idea on the practical usage of the fabricated tfn 2 experimental 2 1 materials titanium dioxide p25 ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o 98 merck

and ph 10 using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh 24 2 6 membrane performance evaluation the water permeability a l m 2 h 1 bar 1 salt permeability b l m 2 h 1 and salt rejection r of the tfc and tfn fo membranes were determined by testing the fabricated membranes in a pressurized lab scale cross flow ro unit all membranes were pre compacted for 30 min under 2 bars the experiment was conducted at 1

structural parameter were determined this study was conducted with the active layer of the membrane facing the feed solution al fs mode as shown in fig 2 the feed solution and draw solution as circulated using two peristaltic pumps at 300 rpm during the experiment solution of 10 ppm cd no3 2 or pb no3 2 was used as feed solution while solution of 1 m nacl was used as draw solution the concentration of feed solution was selected based on literature which has been optimized to maximize the difference in osmotic pressure between the feed and draw solutions 26 the initial ph of 10 ppm cd2 and pb2 was 5 55 and 5 47 respectively the temperature of the feed and draw solutions was fixed at room temperature condition the draw solution tank was placed on a digital weight balance to precisely detect the changes in mass of the draw solution which can be used to calculate the water flux jv using equation 6 25 27 6 j v δ v feed a m δt δ m feed a m δt ρ h 2 o where δvfeed is the

aas perkin elmer usa 25 each fo test was operated for 150 min and liquid samples were collected from the feed and draw tanks every 15 min to observe the trend of water flux and heavy metal rejection the regeneration of tfn fo membrane was conducted for four cycles and each cycle last for 120 min the leaching test was performed to determine the nanoparticles leaching out from the membrane into the permeate stream the concentration of nanoparticles leaching out in permeate was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms perkin elmer usa and aas based on the aas results the

analysis of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles fig 3 shows the fesem and tem images as well as edx analysis of the synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid comprised of a mixture of tubular and spherical nanoparticles which were similar to the structures of the tnt and fe3o4 synthesized by raeisi et al 28 and taufik et al 29 respectively this confirmed that the tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles exhibited combination physical morphology of their pure counterparts based on the edx spectra in fig 3 d peaks corresponded to the element of iron fe 43 1 oxygen o 44 4 and titanium ti 12 5 were detected confirming the formation of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the edx elemental mapping in fig 3 c further confirmed that the tnt successfully hybridized with fe3o4 fig 3 b show the tem images of the synthesized tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the tnt synthesized by padaki et al 30 showed a long cylindrical structure with multilayer walls and open ended lumen with diameter around 20 40 nm arshad et al 11 reported that fe3o4 comprised of spherical particle with average sizes around 6 20 nm based on tem images in fig 3 b the average diameters of tnts and fe3o4 was 19 85 nm and 7 71 nm which are similar to that synthesized by padaki et al 30 and arshad et al 11 respectively chen et al 20 reported that the formation of tnt fe3o4 tio2 composite and observed the coexistence of fe3o4 and tio2 components on the surface of tnt fig 3 b also shows the deposition of spherical shape particles on the cylindrical shape particle hence it can be deduced that fe3o4 has been successfully deposited on the tnt surface to form the desired hybrid nanoparticles 3 1 2 crystallinity analysis of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the xrd patterns of tnt fe3o4 hybrid tnts and fe3o4 were depicted in fig 4 the three peaks at 2θ of 10 48 24 76 and 48 58 were corresponded to the crystal structure of tnts which existed in anatase phase as reported by subramaniam et al 18 the xrd results also confirmed that hydrogen titanate nanotubes h2ti3o7 were formed the peaks at 2θ of 30 03 35 50 43 13 53 50 57 03 and 62 85 in xrd pattern matched well with the structure of cubic magnetite fe3o4 phase 20 additionally the characteristic peaks of fe3o4 at 2θ of 35 50 was clearly observed in the xrd spectrum of tnt fe3o4 hybrid which indicated the successful hybridization of tnt with fe3o4 despite the decrease in overall crystallinity several fingerprint peaks of tnt fe3o4 are still visible in the spectrum the crystallite size of nanoparticles was estimated using debye scherrer equation shown below and the results were tabulated in table s1 12 crystallite size 0 9 λ xrd fwhm cos θ λxrd nm refers to the wavelength of the xrd irradiation fwhm radian is the full width of peak at half maximum and θ is the diffraction angle corresponded to the most intense characteristic peak 3 1 3 zeta potential analysis of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles the zeta potential analysis of tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles was performed to identify their surface charge with varying medium ph when the medium ph changed from 0 to 10 the zeta potential changed from 8 87 mv to 34 0 mv 7 93 mv to 24 9 mv and 7 37 mv to 26 8 mv for tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 respectively past studies revealed that tnt and fe3o4 were negatively charged at ph range of 3 to 7 31 and 4 to 12 15 respectively the three types of nanoparticles prepared in this study were negatively charged in the studied ph range the value of zeta potentials of nanomaterial become negative when the solution ph is larger than its point of zero charge pzc and vice versa 32 pzc refers to the ph value at which the particles surface carries net charge of 0 mv the pzc of tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles was located at ph 0 427 ph 1 53 and ph 0 352 respectively all the synthesized nanoparticles with negative charge on their surface were expected to show good adsorptivity toward cationic compounds in aqueous solution 15 the negative surface charge implied that the nanoparticles possessed excessive negatively groups deposited to their surfaces xiong et al 2016 nanoparticles with absolute zeta potentials values of 30 70 mv could form stable dispersions in aqueous solutions of different ph at room temperature since the zeta potentials of tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 were 24 9 mv 34 0 mv and 26 8 mv respectively all the synthesized nanoparticles could form stable dispersions in aqueous solutions 3 2 characterization of tfn fo membrane 3 2 1 morphological analysis of tfn fo membranes fig 5 b c and f show the sem cross sectional images of tfns incorporated with 0 5 wt of tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles respectively it is noticed that all the membranes formed finger like pore structures without any trace of nanoparticles similar to that of reported by chai et al 14 moreover tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 showed long finger like voids extended from the top to the bottom while the tfc and tfn tnt fe3o4 showed short finger like structures in between the dense layer and a macrovoid filled sublayer the formation of long finger like voids was attributed to the presence of hydrophilic nanofillers in the dope solution which facilitated water diffusion into the casted polymer film and induced faster solvent nmp and non solvent water exchange during phase inversion process 17 from the cross sectional morphologies in fig 5 d g tfns incorporated with different tnt fe3o4 loading also consisted of finger like pores and macrovoids alam et al 33 reported that the growth of macrovoids could be encouraged by the addition of low fe3o4 concentration but quickly suppressed at high fe3o4 concentration on the other hand increasing the amount of tnt would lead to formation of larger finger like pores while supressing the formation of horizontal macrovoids 30 it is observed that tfn 0 1 fig 5 d showed large macrovoids underneath while the tfn 0 7 fig 5 g represented the suppression of finger like structure hence it can be deduced that the synergy effects of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles could significantly modify the pores structure of membrane it is observed that the thickness of psf nanocomposite substrate increased as the loading of nanoparticles increased the thickness of the substrates in the range of 98 6 133 μm showed close agreement to the previous study lau et al 34 reported the thickness of pa layer of tfns ranged from 88 5 nm to 114 nm the overall thickness of all membranes is not much different and have most similar finger like structure due to the same preparation method the surface morphologies of all psf substrates fabricated in this study were shown in figure s1 3 2 2 surface properties and overall porosity of tfn fo membranes the top surface morphological structure of tfns were examined by 3d afm images as shown in figure s2 the changes in roughness was investigated in term of mean roughness ra and root mean square of roughness rrms from table 2 it was observed that all the tfns have a ridge and valley structure pa which distributed throughout the plane this morphology has been commonly observed in previous 35 it is noticed that incorporation of nanoparticles into polymeric substrate increased the surface roughness of the membranes the r a value of tfn fe3o4 tfn 0 5 and tfn tnt is 46 71 nm 50 32 nm and 68 11 nm respectively moreover tfn tnt obtained the roughest surface compared to tfn fe3o4 and tfn 0 5 all the tfn membrane incorporated with tnt fe3o4 and tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles showed greater surface roughness compared to that of tfc membrane 17 with the increasing loading of tnt fe3o4 the r a value of the tfns gradually increased from 37 93 nm for tfn 0 1 to 67 24 nm for tfn 0 7 this trend was aligned with the observation from past study 36 and was ascribed to the formation of nodular structures when nanoparticles were incorporated in the substrate matrix 37 theoretically the increase in surface roughness would increase the area available for the water transport 12 all the tfns were expected to obtain higher flux in fo process compared to tfc the wca of psf nanocomposite substrates embedded different nanoparticles which decreased from fe3o4 tnt fe3o4 and tnt is 68 7 66 1 and 64 1 respectively in respect to hydrophilicity all the psf nanocomposite substrate exhibited lower wca compared to neat psf substrate with 69 4 this is in good agreement with previous study 17 the reduction in wca was attributed to the presence of water affinitive groups on the nanoparticles which led to the formation of hydrophilic channels within the substrate matrix 12 28 the increase in hydrophilicity of psf nanocomposite substrates by increasing the loading of tnt fe3o4 nanoparticles from 0 1 wt to 0 7 wt which was indicated by the decrease in wca from 74 2 to 62 9 and was illustrated in figure s3 this trend is aligned with observation from previous study 33 there is a significant difference in the wca of tfns after the formation of a thin film pa layer on the top surface of the psf nanocomposite substrate all tfns exhibited hydrophilic surface with wca falls in the range of 58 6 to 39 8 the results revealed that tfn 0 5 exhibited the lowest surface wca while tfc showed the highest surface wca which is 39 8 and 59 8 respectively in comparison the water contact angle of tfn 0 7 only slightly reduced from 62 9 to 58 6 after formation of pa layer lau et al 34 reported that the physical and chemical characteristics of psf based substrate could induce the formation of pa layers with different water permeability and morphology it was suggested that more hydrophilic pa layers could be produced using hydrophobic substrate with larger surface pores as less pa will be yielded within the substrate pores during ip and led to formation of thinner thin film layer this eventually reduced the resistant toward water molecules transport and lowered the water contact angle measurement in the case of tfn 0 7 the comparatively lower hydrophilicity of its psf nanocomposite substrate compared to the substrates of other tfns induced formation of pa within the substrate pores which significantly lowered the membrane permeability 38 hence lower wca measurement was observed from table 2 and figure s4 it is observed that the overall porosity of psf nanocomposite substrates incorporated with different types of nanoparticles exhibited increased porosity within the range of 75 3 78 4 compared to neat psf substrate with porosity of 74 5 in fact the psf nanocomposite substrates incorporated with tnt had the largest porosity which is 78 4 this indicates that the incorporation of hydrophilic tnt nanoparticles could foster the solvent nonsolvent exchange rate and prompts to improvement in overall porosity of the membranes moreover the results revealed that the porosity of psf nanocomposite substrates increased from 72 2 to 77 3 as the loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles increased from 0 1 wt to 0 7 wt this range has been commonly observed in previous study 33 however it is noticed that the overall porosity of tfns were slightly lower than that of psf nanocomposite substrate this is due to the formation of a dense pa layer within the pore of substrate the dense pa layer on substrate layer would increase the resistance to water transport in ro process 39 the surface zeta potential of all tfns is in the range of 17 4 mv to 25 8 mv at ph 9 it is noticed that all the membranes demonstrated negative surface charge at ph 6 0 principally due to the typical characteristics of pa layer tfc is typically negatively charged due to the hydrolysis of residual acid chloride groups following ip which forms carboxyl groups on the surface and within the pa film 40 moreover the surface charge of all membranes is not much different regardless of the type of nanoparticles incorporated into the substrate hence it is deduced that the surface charge of all membranes is mainly contributed by the pa layer fig 6 shows the isoelectric point iep of pa layer at which the membrane obtained zero charge the iep change may also play significant role in the selectivity of ions it is likely that amine or carboxylic groups enrichment would strongly alter specific selectivities for cations or anions by changing the overall material charge and iep reis et al 2017 the initial ph of 10 ppm cd2 and pb2 were ph 5 55 and ph 5 47 respectively 3 3 thin film nanocomposite forward osmosis membrane performance 3 3 1 effect of various nanoparticles on tfn fo membrane fig 7 presents the fo water flux jv and reverse solute flux js of tfns incorporated with different types of nanoparticles for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal the performance of membranes was evaluated by crossflow fo in al fs orientation the experiments were performed using 10 ppm of cd no3 2 and pb no3 2 as feed solution and 1 m of nacl as draw solution with the crossflow rate 300 rpm at room temperature for both feed and draw solutions in order to provide insight into the synergistic effects and roles of the hybrid nanoparticles the performances of four types of membrane were compared i e tfc tfn tnt tfn fe3o4 and tfn 0 5 through the embedment of various nanoparticles into the substrate the water fluxes of all three tfns were significantly different compared to that of tfc membrane fig 7 a shows that tfn 0 5 exhibited the highest jv of 2 82 l m 2 h 1 compared to other membranes in cd2 removal due to the synergistic effects of tnt fe3o4 hybrid this improvement was associated to the increased membrane hydrophilicity with the incorporation of tnt and fe3o4 nanoparticles as evidenced in the decrease in water contact angle in the case of pb2 removal although the results revealed that the tfn 0 5 exhibited higher jv compared to tfc control which was 2 54 l m 2 h 1 and 2 45 l m 2 h 1 respectively the jv was slightly lower compared to tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 which was 2 78 l m 2 h 1 and 2 74 l m 2 h 1 respectively this observation was due to the increase in surface roughness of tfn tnt which in turn increased the area available for the water transport overall all membranes showed much higher jv in pb2 removal compared to cd2 removal the increase in water flux with the concentration of draw solution was mainly due to the elevated osmotic pressure 41 the cd2 and pb2 heavy metals used as the feed solution in this study is characterized by osmotic pressure of 0 0016 π and 0 0015 π respectively while the osmotic pressure of nacl is 48 9 π since greater difference in osmotic pressure between feed and draw solution will be generated when pb2 instead of cd2 was used as feed the resulted driving force for the transport of water across the membranes was also greater fig 7 presents the js of all tfns for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal the results revealed that the tfns exhibited significantly lower js in range from 0 13 g m 2 h 1 0 19 g m 2 h 1 for both heavy metals removal when compared to jv table 3 shows the comparison of js jv value of tfns for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal it is observed that the tfns showed decreasing trend of js jv value in the range from 0 09 g l to 0 05 g l for both heavy metals removal these results are aligned with the study performed by zhao et al 42 who fabricated fo membrane consisting of cnt sublayer they revealed that the decrease in js jv value indicated enhancement in the selectivity of the prepared fo membranes this implied that the separation performance of tfns fabricated in this study are satisfactory and better than tfc especially in cadmium removal fig 8 shows the heavy metals rejection of all prepared tfns the results revealed that all the membranes achieved much higher rejection over 98 for both cd2 and pb2 heavy metals according to the theoretical transport model the selectivity of membrane is based on mechanism such as sieving and charge repulsion 43 in particular the rejection of heavy metals by tfns was contributed by the pa layer the charges on the surface and pore structure of the pa layer are generated from the dissociation and protonation of active functional groups such as amine groups these charges enhance the separation performance through electrostatic charge repulsion between the membrane surface and co ionic species 44 moreover the tfns incorporated with tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles exhibited the highest rejection of cd2 and pb2 heavy metals which was 99 81 and 98 84 respectively tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 showed the moderate rejection of cd2 heavy metal compared to that of tfn 0 5 99 64 tfn tnt and tfn fe3o4 achieved 98 72 and 98 74 rejection of pb2 heavy metal these data confirmed that the synthesized hybrid nanoparticles improved the water fluxes and the heavy metal rejection of the resulted membrane when incorporated into the pa layer generally the mechanism of tfn for heavy metal rejection is dominated by charge repulsion apart from the membrane chemical and physical properties the surface charge of pa layer is a main factor affecting the removal of pollutants especially positive charge species 25 it has been explained in previous section that when the ph of solution is lower than the pzc the zeta potential values will be shifted to more positively charged zone considering that the heavy metals feed solution was acidic which resulted in an overall positive zeta potential of the tfns fig 6 charge repulsion mechanism significantly induced the rejection for positively charged of heavy metals in this has been commonly observed in previous study 45 fig 8 shows that all membranes exhibited higher rejection for cd2 compared to that of pb2 the lower rejection of pb2 compared with cd2 in the tfc was due to the diffusion coefficient of pb2 in aqueous solution 1 89 10 5 that is higher than that of cd2 1 44 10 5 26 3 3 2 effect of different loading of tnt fe3o4 on tfn fig 9 a and fig 9 b present the fo water flux jv and reverse solute flux js of tfns incorporated with different loadings of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal respectively it was noticed that tfn 0 5 exhibited the highest jv which is 2 82 l m 2 h 1 in cd2 removal compared to other membranes on the other hand the tfn 0 3 showed the highest jv of 3 05 l m 2 h 1 compared to other membranes in pb2 removal all the membranes exhibited better permeability compared to tfc membranes which exhibited permeability of 1 63 l m 2 h 1 and 2 45 l m 2 h 1 for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal respectively however the tfn 0 7 exhibited the lowest jv in both heavy metals removal it is observed that the jv dropped in tfn 0 7 due to the decrease in porosity of the membrane raeisi et al 28 pointed out that the agglomeration of tnt nanoparticles at higher loadings could affect the formation of the free pores and voids in the substrate layer darabi et al 12 also reported that pore blockage and decrease in porosity of membrane could attributed to lower jv at higher loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles based on the findings from these two works although no visible agglomeration was observed in the membrane characterization the separation results indicated that the loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles beyond 0 5 wt was detrimental to the jv for cd2 removal the jv of membrane was significantly improved by incorporating 0 1 wt to 0 5 wt loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles where the jv was increased from 1 63 l m 2 h 1 to 2 82 l m 2 h 1 however the jv dropped to 1 21 l m 2 h 1 with the incorporation of 0 7 wt tnt fe3o4 it has also shown that tfn 0 5 that embedded with tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles in the substrate significantly improved the performance of tfn membrane as it gave the highest improvement towards the jv when compared to other membranes similar trend has been observed in past studies by he et al 46 and emadzadeh et al 23 who reported the optimal nanoparticles loading of 0 5 wt and 0 6 wt respectively to achieve enhancement in water flux without compromising the tfn separation efficiency for pb2 removal the jv of membrane was significantly improved by incorporating 0 1 wt to 0 3 wt tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles where jv was increased from 2 85 l m 2 h 1 to 3 05 l m 2 h 1 nevertheless the jv dropped to 2 14 l m 2 h 1 with the incorporation of 0 7 wt of nanoparticles by comparison tfn 0 5 achieved the highest water flux in cd2 removal while tfn 0 3 achieved the highest flux in pb2 removal all the tfns exhibited significantly lower reverse solute flux in the range of 0 11 g m 2 h 1 0 21 g m 2 h 1 for both heavy metals removal the range of js is in good agreement with the previous study 26 table 4 shows the comparison ratio of js jv of tfns for cd2 and pb2 heavy metals removal it is observed that all the tfns incorporated different loading of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles show lower value of js jv in range from 0 06 g l 0 10 g l for both heavy metals removal reported for cd2 removal the decrease in the js jv value of tfn 0 1 tfn 0 3 and tfn 0 5 in comparison to tfc indicated an improvement in cd2 removal efficiency but the membrane selectivity was compromised when the tnt fe3o4 loading reached 0 7 wt due to the aforementioned defects formation 47 on the other hand varying the loading of tnt fe3o4 did not affect the removal efficiency of pb2 as the js jv values remained constant fig 10 shows the heavy metals rejection of all prepared tfns it is noticed that all membranes exhibited significant improvement in the separation of cd2 and pb2 heavy metals as a result all the membranes achieved over 98 rejection for both heavy metals the rejection of heavy metals by tfns embedded with different loadings of tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles into substrate was found to be improved compared to tfc the incorporation of 0 1 0 5 wt tnt fe3o4 into the substrate of tfns led to the enhancement in cd2 rejection by 0 58 0 72 respectively compared to tfc in the case of for pb2 removal tfns exhibited enhancement in rejection by 0 38 0 59 through the incorporation of 0 1 0 5 wt tnt fe3o4 respectively tfn 0 5 achieved the highest cd2 and pb2 rejection of 99 81 and 99 84 respectively the improved performance of tfn 0 5 was attributed to the synergistic effects of the hybrid that contribute to enhanced properties for heavy metal removal on the other hand it is observed that all the membranes have better rejection for cd2 compared to pb2 heavy metals the difference in the ionic radius of ions cd2 with 0 95 å smaller than pb2 with 1 19 å metal ions with smaller ionic radius tend to be strongly attached to water molecules and hold their hydration shell thus more rejected by the membrane 26 hence pb2 can easily diffuse through the tfc liu et al 41 found that the metal ions transport across lbl assembled fo membrane usually follows solution diffusion mechanism the heavy metal ions with relatively large hydrated radius exhibited decreased diffusivity hence could be easily rejected the difference in the hydrated radius of ions for cd2 is smaller than pb2 which is 4 26 å and 4 01 å respectively hence cd2 ions can be more easily rejected by the membrane while pb2 ions can easily diffuse through the tfc membrane 3 3 3 regeneration properties of tfn fo membrane the regeneration of tfns incorporated with different types of nanoparticles was studies through a prolonged filtration process fig 11 shows the water flux profile of cd2 rejection over a period of 8 hours filtration process consisting of four cycles 10 ppm of cd no3 2 was used as feed solution while 1 m nacl as draw solution after each filtration the membrane was regenerated by washing with distilled water for 5 minutes before repeating the filtration regeneration cycle it can be observed that all membranes were able to recover their water flux to the level similar to that of first cycle moreover it can be observed that all the membranes achieved over 99 of cd2 rejection at each cycle currently there is still no comprehensive standard method for testing leaching of nanoparticles from the tfn 48 leaching test was performed by determining the amount of titanium and iron that were presence in draw solution after each cycle of regeneration performance test to determine the stability of nanoparticles embedment in tfn 0 5 the results were tabulated in table 5 the concentration of nanoparticles leaching out in permeate was detected by the icp ms and aas instrument the world health organization organization 49 has set the acceptable level iron concentration in drinking water to 300 ppb from the leaching result around 120 430 ppb of iron was leaching from tfn 0 5 during each regeneration cycle which was very close to the allowable limit for safe drinking on the other hand only trace amount of titanium 3 5 ppb was leached during the experiment this implied that the tnt component of the hybrid nanoparticles was able to anchor firmly within the psf matrix due to its long few μm tubular shape while the fine 20 nm spherical fe3o4 could easily dislodge from the polymeric matrix this was to be expected as the sub micron pores of psf substrate would not be able to prevent the water flowing across the membrane from carrying the nano sized particles away and toward the draw solution however it should be noted that the level of nanoparticle leaching into the feed solution was very much lower than that detected from the draw solution as the dense pa layer served as an excellent barrier that block the nanoparticles from leaving the membrane matrix future work on tnt fe3o4 incorporated tfn for fo application should focus on improving the interaction of polymer matrix with the tnt and fe3o4 in order to address the issue related to nanomaterials leaching 3 3 4 intrinsic properties and structural parameter of tfn fo membrane table 6 summarizes the intrinsic properties and structural parameters of all the fabricated tfns it is noticed that all the tfn membranes exhibited much higher salt permeability b and higher salt rejection r values compared to the tfc the excellent separation performance of tfns was attributed to the presence of nanomaterials and the formation of defect free pa layer in particular the tfn 0 5 exhibited 90 48 higher water permeability 3 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared to tfc 1 89 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the improvement in water permeability was associated to the properties of membrane such as increased hydrophilicity porosity and surface roughness compared to the tfc as a result tfn 0 5 also exhibited 5 15 higher salt rejection than tfc the dilutive icp effect is significant in al fs orientation as it could decrease the net osmotic pressure across the membrane substrate and suppress the transportation of water molecules 6 it is observed that the tfn fo membrane incorporated with fe3o4 in the substrate layer promotes water transport as it provides extra water pathways in the substrate layer and consequently increased mass transfer coefficient of the support layer 12 table 6 shows an increasing trend in the water permeability of tfn fo membranes the structural parameter s is a typical parameter to characterize the icp effect of tfn fo membranes commonly a lower s value indicates the suppression of icp impact and improvement of water flux the psf substrate of tfn 0 5 had the much higher porosity 75 7 compared to that of tfn tnt 78 4 and tfn fe3o4 75 2 emadzadeh et al 23 reported the increase of the overall porosity of the substrate layers could be the main factor contributing to the smaller s value of tfn membrane compared to tfc the s value of tfn 0 5 membrane was 1 45 mm in cd2 and 1 60 mm in pb2 heavy metals removal hence the results obtained in this study proved that the addition of tnt fe3o4 into the psf substrate layer improves fo water flux performance through improving membrane permeability and minimizing the dilutive icp phenomenon inside the substrate layer compared to some recently published tfn such as the tfn modified with metal organic framework and polydopamine 45 50 the tfns prepared in this study have demonstrated better heavy metal rejection ability indicating the feasibility of using bimetallic oxide to improve the fo performances of the tfn membranes 3 3 5 performance benchmarking based on the data tabulated in table 7 the heavy metal rejection capability of tfn 0 5 was on par with many of the similar composite membranes developed by past studies in addition the relatively lower srsf of tfn 0 5 compared to other membranes especially those with nanofillers incorporated into the thin film layer indicated better salt selectivity of the former the integrity of the thin film played a critical role in determining the selectivity of the resulted composite membrane since the pa layer fabricated via ip is often 200 nm thick it is challenging to ensure defect free selective film formation when incorporating nanomaterials especially 3d particulates into the pa matrix moreover the incompatibility between the inorganic nanomaterial with the organic polymer matrix could result in the formation of interfacial gaps which negatively affected the crosslinking of the pa network these are believed to be the reasons for the lower selectivity of the tfn fabricated by qiu et al 45 he et al 46 and rezaei dashtarzhandi et al 51 which were incorporated with zif 8 mof 801 and ncc respectively compared to tfn 0 5 prepared in this study in contrast the tfn fabricated by saeedi jurkuyeh et al 26 that was incorporated with go displayed good selectivity due to the 2d sheet like geometry of the nanomaterial the nanometer thick go sheet was easily deposited into the pa layer with negligible risk of protruding from the film surface moreover go is renowned for its barrier property which could improve the sieving capability of the host polymeric matrix hence a low srsf of 0 03 g l was observed from the membrane in term of water flux it is noted that the membrane fabricated in this study was less permeable compared to that of literatures this could be related to the formulation of hand casted substrate employed in this study even though the incorporation of nanomaterials was able to enhance the performance of the tfn the overall output of the membrane is still largely governed by the properties of the polymeric matrix from table 7 it can be noted that regardless of the nanofiller employed when conventional asymmetric support was used for the fabrication of fo tfn tfc the achievable water flux was between 20 30 l m 2 h 1 however when glass nanofiber support was used zhao et al 52 were able to produce tfc that exhibited water flux of over 50 l m 2 h 1 this was attributed to the high porosity of up to 95 and a low s value of 119 μm of the substrate which enabled virtually friction free water permeation across the layer with little tendency of icp therefore considering the low porosity of 76 and a high s value of 1500 μm of the substrate fabricated in this study it is unsurprising that the tfn 0 5 exhibited comparatively poor water flux our future work will be focused on improving the structure and icp resistance of the substrate layer 4 conclusion in summary a novel tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticle was synthesized through hydrothermal and co precipitation method that incorporated into membrane substrate tfn fo membrane had been developed via phase inversion to cast the membrane substrate which incorporated tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles and the formation of polyamide layer on the substrate through interfacial polymerization method for heavy metal removal an optimized substrate layer was designed by adding tnt fe3o4 hybrid nanoparticles into substrate to improve the water flux and separation efficiency the introduction of nanoparticles endows the substrate layer with improve hydrophilicity and loose structure moreover the modified substrate layer has improved the affinity between the nanofillers and polymer matrix hence maintaining the selectivity of membrane tfn 0 5 membrane achieved the highest water flux with 2 82 l m 2 h 1 and 2 54 l m 2 h 1 for cd2 and pb2 removal respectively compared to tfc with 1 63 l m 2 h 1 and 2 45 l m 2 h 1 for cd2 and pb2 removal respectively the water flux was improved by 73 and 3 67 for cd2 and pb2 removal respectively furthermore this membrane exhibits high rejection to heavy metal ions 98 in fo mode the promising performance of these membranes highlights their potential

13837,in this work a simple method was used for the preparation of cuo activated carbon ac composite for peroxydisulfate pds activation to treat a real textile wastewater for the first time the characteristics of the catalyst were determined by several methods the performance of various processes was evaluated on total organic carbon toc removal from the textile wastewater around 61 of toc was eliminated under the conditions of pds 7 mm cuo ac 1 g l ph 7 and 60 min reaction time other parameters were also studied indicating that 95 of color 72 of cod chemical oxygen demand and 70 of bod biochemical oxygen demand were removed during treatment process kinetic studies showed that pseudo first order was well fitted for color cod bod and toc removals with obtained rate constants of 0 054 0 023 0 021 and 0 018 min 1 respectively the reusability and stability of cuo ac catalyst were tested the results demonstrated that three cycles of catalyst use were acceptable and copper leaching was negligible acute toxicity of raw and treated wastewater was also evaluated by daphnia magna according to acute toxicity results pds cuo ac process removed the toxicity of textile wastewater significantly as a conclusion pds cuo ac process can be applied for real wastewater treatment and detoxification this process can be an alternative oxidation process for the degradation of organic pollutants keywords peroxydisulfate textile wastewater copper oxide cuo activated carbon sulfate radicals 1 introduction textile industry is one of the most water consumption industries utilizing large amount of dyes organic and inorganic chemicals and additives in the production process therefore produced wastewater is a highly colored effluent due to the presence of dyes 1 textile wastewater usually has high organic compounds and contains a wide variety of organic pollutants make a high chemical oxygen demand cod 2 these pollutants are often resistant to biodegradation in which it has been reported that some of reactive dye can remain in the environment under natural conditions for 40 years 1 2 the presence of dyes in textile wastewater has become ecological concern in which toxic compounds may be accumulated in foods these toxic compounds are limiting factors for the use of biological treatment of textile wastewater since microorganism culture may be disturbed due to the toxicity of dyes 3 4 several physico chemical processes have been conducted for textile wastewater treatment coagulation and adsorption are conventional methods for the treatment of textile wastewater but these processes are not able to mineralize organic compounds and only separate organic pollutants from water environment 5 6 indeed they convert aqueous pollution to solid pollution membrane processes suffers from the production of a concentrate liquid of pollutants which needs further treatment 3 advanced oxidation processes aops are effective methods for the treatment of textile wastewater organic pollutants containing textile wastewater are degraded by highly reactive agents which are produced using aops these processes usually generate hydroxyl radicals with high redox potential e0 2 8 v 7 8 in last decade researchers have focused on the generation of sulfate radicals so4 for the degradation of organic pollutants sulfate radicals based aops sr aops have received a great attention from water and wastewater professionals sulfate radicals have demonstrated a supremacy compared to hydroxyl radicals ho longer half life 30 40 μs for so4 vs 20 ns for ho selectivity in the reaction with organic pollutants applicable in a wide range of ph and higher redox potential e0 2 5 3 1 v are advantages of sr aops against hydroxyl radicals 9 11 to produce sulfate radicals peroxydisulfate anions pds s2o8 2 can be used along with an activator pds can be activated by several procedures including transition metals 12 carbon catalyst 13 uv irradiation 14 ultrasound us 15 heat 16 electrochemical process 10 and base 17 transition metals have been demonstrated as efficient catalyst for pds activation however homogenous use of transition metals is limited to difficult recovery and regeneration to lower valance similar to fenton reactions 18 19 hereupon the heterogeneous catalyst was considered for pds activation to generate sulfate radicals several studies focused on the synthesis of nanoparticles of transition metals to activate pds 20 however the use of nanoparticles suffers from escape of nanoparticles from the reactor hence researchers have recommended a support for deposition of nanoparticles to stabilize nanoparticles and consequently increase of surface area to enhance surface reactions of pds with transition metals 21 in recent years copper oxide cuo showed a high ability for activation of pds for degradation of organic pollutants several supports have been used for cuo for activation of peroxygens 20 22 activated carbon ac is a versatile matter for environmental remediation in which it has been used for adsorption process as media for biological process and soil remediation regarding the low cost of ac non toxicity and high surface area its application is increasing in the world for other utilizations 23 24 many studies have applied ac as support for different nanoparticles of transition metals i e fe co and mn 25 27 however few studies have focused on cuo ac for degradation of organic pollutants 28 29 all studies have been conducted on synthetic solutions in which only one organic pollutant is considered for treatment process some studies have explored the treatment of actual textile effluent by cuo nanoparticles in this manner cuo cu oh 2 nanostructures 30 cu zno 31 and cuo carbon nanotubes 32 have been used as photocatalyst for actual textile wastewater treatment on the other hand zno pds in the presence of uv and us has been exerted for treating real textile wastewater 33 however no study has been done on real wastewater by pds cuo ac so far this study wants to elucidate the progress of sr aops application for real wastewater treatment in this study a simple method was used for preparation of cuo ac catalyst its catalytic activity was evaluated on pds decomposition for the removal of total organic carbon toc from a real textile wastewater the kinetic study was also assessed for this process afterward the reusability and stability of catalyst was tested the performance of pds cuo ac was evaluated on treatment of textile wastewater in terms of organic compounds removal and decolorization finally the detoxification of effluent was studied by daphnia magna as acute toxicity test 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals activated carbon and copper ntrate cu no3 2 3h2o 99 were purchased from merck company sulfuric acid h2so4 96 silver sulfate ag2so4 99 mercury sulfate hgso4 99 sodium hydroxide naoh 99 and ammonia solution nh4oh 37 were supplied from samchun company real textile wastewater was collected from a textile factory which is located at markazi province iran the characteristics of the wastewater is presented in table 1 2 2 cuo ac composite preparation the cuo ac composite was synthesized using deposition precipitation method 34 briefly ac was washed by hno3 5 and washed by deionized water for ten times firstly 10 g of ac was introduced to a 250 ml beaker two grams of copper cu no3 2 3h2o was mixed in the 50 ml deionized water and added to the beaker the mixture was mixed for 3 h after that ammonia solution was dropwisely added to the mixture until solution ph reach 10 4 afterward the precipitate was filtrated and separated from the solution the obtained product was washed by water for several times the resulting samples were dried at 120 c overnight and subsequently calcined at 300 for 3 h cuo nanoparticles were synthesized as well as the catalyst without ac 2 3 wastewater treatment by pds cuo ac process 100 ml of the wastewater was added to an erlenmeyer flask 250 ml the ph of wastewater was adjusted by sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide 0 1 m amount of the cuo ac catalyst was added to the wastewater and then a certain amount of pds was introduced to the wastewater the wastewater was mixed by a shaker with 250 rpm to form radical reactions for degradation of organic compounds at determined interval time 2 ml of sample was taken the samples were quenched by thiosulfate solution to stop reaction the effect of ph in range of 3 11 pds dosage 3 9 mm and the catalyst dosage 0 25 1 25 g l were studied on toc removal the performance of each constituent pds and cuo ac was evaluated at the same conditions the reusability experiments were conducted for cuo ac catalyst in a way that after each experiment cuo ac was centrifuged and separated from the solution and then cuo ac was washed and dried at 80 for further cycle of reusability experiments 2 4 analytical methods toc values of the wastewater and samples were analyzed by toc analyzer shimatzu japan cod chemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand chloride ions and total dissolved solids tds were determined based on standard methods 35 color of the wastewater was determined by american dye manufacture institute admi method by a spectrophotometer hach dr5000 this method is preference for real wastewater which is independent of hue copper ions were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas analytik jena novaa 800 d the morphology of ac cuo catalyst was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem using mira3 tescan x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis was used for phase identification of crystalline of cuo ac by a d8 bruker advanced diffractometer with cu kα radiation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was applied to identify organic and inorganic bond using a vertex 70 spectrophotometer bruker germany with a resolution of 2 cm 1 acute toxicity was examined on real wastewater and treated real wastewater using daphnia magna neonates as the test species based standard methods 35 raw wastewater and treated wastewater were sampled and exposed to the daphnia magna the residual of oxidant after reaction time was removed by na2so3 and any remaining so3 2 was eliminated by oxygen the ph of the raw and treated samples was adjusted to ph 8 0 the tests were set with a 16 h light 8 h dark light cycle using 980 1050 lux fluorescent lamps the tests were carried out by 10 number of daphnia magna in 50 ml beakers at ph 8 0 with 6 mg l dissolved oxygen do the lc50 values lethal concentration causing 50 death of the wastewater samples were calculated and reported 36 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ac cuo catalyst the morphology of cuo ac catalyst was determined by fesem images fig 1 a shows composited catalyst of cuo ac as can be seen cuo nanoparticles loaded on ac a red arrow shows the bed of ac while cuo nanoparticles are determined by a yellow arrow at closer view fig 1 b cuo nanoparticles were loaded as sphere like and bar like on ac the range of cuo nanoparticles were approximately 30 80 nm moreover this figure showed that cuo nanoparticles were agglomerated on together fig 1 c depicts xrd spectrum of cuo ac nanoparticles two mild peaks were observed at 23 18 and 44 13 which were corresponded to activated carbon on the other hand two sharps peaks of 35 51 and 38 9 were appeared which were corresponded to cuo the peaks at 48 85 58 32 61 56 66 08 68 1 and 72 56 were also related to cuo nanoparticles with reference code 98 002 8584 the results were confirmed that cuo nanoparticles were well loaded on ac fig 1 d shows ftir spectra of cuo ac composite ftir spectrum of cuo ac in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 was recorded and it was seen that there was a large broad band at 3700 3200 cm 1 which is corresponded to oh bond stretching of activated carbon surface the peak at 1097 cm 1 is related to the vibrational mode of hoh and hoh bending was seen at 1633 cm 1 37 a high stretching was observed at 492 cm 1 which was associated with cuo bond indicating that this composite was well synthesized 3 2 the comparison of the different constituents on toc removal from textile wastewater fig 2 shows toc removal by pds cuo ac pds ac pds cuo pds cu2 and pds ac processes as can be seen sole application of pds ac cuo ac and cuo was ineffective for toc removal pds application could not generate free radicals to degrade of organic compounds moreover the adsorption capacity of ac and cuo ac was little in which around 13 of toc was adsorbed and cuo can adsorb only 5 of toc during 60 min reaction time on the other hand applying pds ac can enhance toc removal to 23 compared to low efficiency of pds and ac it has been reported that ac can activate pds for the generation of free radicals according to following reactions 13 38 indeed oxygen functional groups ooh and oh on surfaces of activated carbon function as an activator mediates election transfer to generate sulfate radicals 1 s 2 o 8 2 a c s u r f a c e o o h s o 4 a c s u r f a c e o o h s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 a c s u r f a c e o h s o 4 a c s u r f a c e o h s o 4 pds cuo showed high efficiency for toc removal 50 1 of toc was eliminated during 60 min reaction time revealing that cuo catalyst was effective for pds activation the pds was activated by cu ii according to eq 3 the chain reactions continued to be consumed totally pds by copper sulfate radicals generated can decompose organic compounds in textile wastewater on the other hand formed cu iii at reaction 3 can oxidize water to hydroxyl radicals accelerating the degradation of organic compounds moreover regarding cu iii cu ii cycle and its high redox potential 2 3 v 39 cu iii is able to oxidize organics 40 hence cuo process seems to be an effective catalyst for pds activation in a real matrix 3 c u i i s 2 o 8 2 c u i i i s o 4 s o 4 2 4 c u i i i s 2 o 8 2 c u i i s 2 o 8 5 c u i i i h 2 o c u i i h o h the main system pds cuo ac showed the highest efficiency for toc removal as can be seen around 61 of toc was eliminated during 60 min ac and cuo supply both above mechanisms for pds activation therefore there was an enhanced activation for pds to more degrade organic pollutants in this way the composite not only had the highest efficiency for toc removal but it also prevailed escape of cuo from the reactor compared to cuo the presence of ac lowers the distance between the produced sulfate radicals and the organic pollutants in cuo ac composite due to its adsorption property in which the possibility of reaction of generated sulfate radical with the pollutants increased at the surface of the cuo ac homogeneous pds cu2 system was applied to compare with heterogeneous system the results showed that cu2 catalyzed pds in which 37 of toc was removed during 60 min reaction time this indicated that copper in homogeneous and heterogeneous modes can activate pds to generate sulfate radicals however homogenous systems showed low efficiency compared to heterogeneous form confirming that homogeneous systems are under influence of water constituents such as anions and organic compounds besides the regeneration of cu2 is limited in the homogeneous systems reduces the pds activation in the solution 3 3 the effect of ph pds and cuo ac dosage on toc removal fig 3 a demonstrates toc removal at different ph values under conditions of pds 5 mm 1 g l cuo ac and 60 min reaction time higher and lower solution ph showed the lowest efficiency for toc removal at acidic conditions the presence of high concentration of protons can suppress the function of pds cuo ac process through scavenging of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals as some studies have been stated this phenomenon 41 42 at alkali solution ph a decrease in toc removal was observed in which toc removal reached 42 although it has been seen that pds can be activated by base redox potential of hydroxyl radicals is significantly reduced at alkali condition 43 the solution ph of 7 0 was desirable ph for pds cuo ac process with 50 efficiency for toc removal this is an invaluable result since it is close to natural ph 7 6 of the textile wastewater and natural water resources the effect of pds dosage was studied on toc removal under the conditions of ph 7 0 cuo ac 1 g l and 60 min reaction time and the results are depicted in fig 3 b with increase in pds dosage enhanced toc removal gradually in which increase of pds dosage from 3 mm to 7 mm increased toc removal from 41 to 60 8 excess pds dosage did not change toc removal significantly higher pds concentration naturally results in more production of sulfate radicals and consequently more degradation of organic pollutants in order to reduce chemicals and optimization of pds dosage pds dosage of 7 mm was selected as the best conditions the effect of the catalyst dosage was studied on toc removal at fixed conditions of the ph 7 0 pds 7 mm and 60 min reaction time according to the fig 3 c toc removals were 42 54 4 60 8 and 58 9 for 0 5 0 75 1 and 1 25 g l respectively increase in catalyst dosage increased active sites of cuo to enhance pds activation and more degradation of organic compounds occurred as can be seen 1 g l of cuo ac catalyst provided the best condition for pds cuo ac process 3 4 kinetic studies for toc cod bod and color removals textile wastewater treatment was evaluated by cod bod toc and color removals by pds cuo ac process under optimum conditions of ph 7 pds 7 mm and 1 g l of the catalyst fig 4 a displays removal efficiencies of organic compounds based on cod toc bod and color as shown in this figure color removal rate was faster than other parameters 95 of color was removed during 60 min reaction time it can be optimistically stated that complete decolorization occurred for the textile wastewater which is worthwhile in term of aesthetic aspect cod and bod removals obtained were 72 1 and 70 respectively while 60 8 of toc was eliminated over 60 min in order to study the kinetic model for cod toc bod and color the pseudo first order kinetic model was used based on following equation 6 ln c 0 c t k t where c0 and ct are initial values of cod toc bod and color and the values of cod toc bod and color at t time respectively the k min 1 and t min are the rate constant of the pseudo first order kinetic model and reaction time respectively to achieve the rate constants of each parameter ln c0 c against the reaction time was plotted the obtained slop represents the rate constant k fig 4 b demonstrates that the pseudo first order kinetic model was well fitted for all four parameters the rate constants and half life and r squared are presented in table 2 as can be seen the highest rate constant was corresponded to the decolorization 0 054 min 1 while the rate constants for cod bod and toc were 0 023 0 021 and 0 018 min 1 respectively the half life t1 2 of each parameter were calculated based on following equation 7 t 1 2 l n 2 k indeed half life indicates that to reach 50 degradation needs what reaction time as can be seen half life for color cod bod and toc were obtained as 12 8 30 1 33 1 and 41 2 min respectively 3 5 reusability and stability of cuo ac for textile wastewater the reusability of cuo ac catalyst was tested for four cycles of catalyst use at the same conditions fig 5 a shows toc removal of textile wastewater after each cycle under the conditions of ph 7 pds 7 mm 1 g l cuo ac and 60 min this figure indicated that catalytic activity of cuo ac was kept for three cycles toc removal were reduced from 60 8 55 4 after three cycles of cuo ac usage while forth cycle of the catalyst removed only 41 2 of toc in fact around one third 33 of the performance of fresh cuo ac was reduced after four times use 61 removal vs 41 removal the main reason for the reduction of performance is poisoning of the catalyst surface through deposition of some of oxidized compounds on the catalyst surface as a matter of fact active sites of cuo ac for pds activation were occupied with other organic compounds stability of the catalyst was studied by the measurement of copper leached into solution after each experiment fig 5 b shows the amount of copper leaching during cyclic experiments as can be seen the copper concentrations after each experiment were approximately the same the concentrations of copper were 0 4 0 44 0 51 and 0 33 mg l for first second third and fourth cycles respectively these results showed that amount of copper leaching is negligible hence the efficiency reduction after four cycle cannot be related to lost copper from the composite as the main agent of pds activation actually the surface of the catalyst was contaminated by oxidized compounds or other organic inorganic compounds 3 6 the toxicity evaluation of textile wastewater the acute toxicity of raw textile wastewater and treated textile wastewater was evaluated by bioassay by daphnia magnaand the results are presentd in fig 6 as control experiment the toxicity of 1 g l cuo ac was also evaluated no toxicity was observed for the composite lc50 of the raw textile wastewater was 20 6 v v indicating that raw textile wastewater was toxic treated textile wastewater was assessed during 60 min reaction time as can be seen with increase of reaction time decreased toxicity of treated textile wastewater in a way that lc50 reached 62 4 v v this result showed that pds cuo ac process can detoxify the textile wastewater significantly however it should be noted that treated wastewater is still relatively toxic therefore the wastewater needs further treatment for complete detoxification and mineralization 3 7 comparison of pds cuo ac with other studies the obtained results in this study were compared to other studies based on real textile wastewater treatment by various aops in recent five years and their succinct are presented in table 3 an overview on these processes with focus on the efficiency cost and environmental impacts was conducted generally pds cuo ac benefits from high efficiency for the mineralization while residual sulfate ion is the most important problem of pds based processes photocatalysis processes are relatively inefficient in dark wastewater due to absorption of photons by high color and suspended solids however a planer falling film reactor can be an option for reducing reaction path in photocatalysis in homogeneous fenton based processes residual iron and providing acidic conditions should be considered when high concentration of oxidant and ferrous ions are applied 3 44 on the other hand sonolysis activated oxidants seem to be an unrealistic effort for large scale due to difficulty in scale up and high energy consumption chlorine based processed suffer from producing chlorinated organic compounds as toxic substances however it effectively decolorizes textile effluents 43 the production of sludge in coagulation and electrocoagulation ec processes is always a big challenge for water and wastewater engineers 45 howbeit they have been considered thanks to high efficiency and low cost electro fenton ef processes have demonstrated high

13837,in this work a simple method was used for the preparation of cuo activated carbon ac composite for peroxydisulfate pds activation to treat a real textile wastewater for the first time the characteristics of the catalyst were determined by several methods the performance of various processes was evaluated on total organic carbon toc removal from the textile wastewater around 61 of toc was eliminated under the conditions of pds 7 mm cuo ac 1 g l ph 7 and 60 min reaction time other parameters were also studied indicating that 95 of color 72 of cod chemical oxygen demand and 70 of bod biochemical oxygen demand were removed during treatment process kinetic studies showed that pseudo first order was well fitted for color cod bod and toc removals with obtained rate constants of 0 054 0 023 0 021 and 0 018 min 1 respectively the reusability and stability of cuo ac catalyst were tested the results demonstrated that three cycles of catalyst use were acceptable and copper leaching was negligible acute toxicity of raw and treated wastewater was also evaluated by daphnia magna according to acute toxicity results pds cuo ac process removed the toxicity of textile wastewater significantly as a conclusion pds cuo ac process can be applied for real wastewater treatment and detoxification this process can be an alternative oxidation process for the degradation of organic pollutants keywords peroxydisulfate textile wastewater copper oxide cuo activated carbon sulfate radicals 1 introduction textile industry is one of the most water consumption industries utilizing large amount of dyes organic and inorganic chemicals and additives in the production process therefore produced wastewater is a highly colored effluent due to the presence of dyes 1 textile wastewater usually has high organic compounds and contains a wide variety of organic pollutants make a high chemical oxygen demand cod 2 these pollutants are often resistant to biodegradation in which it has been reported that some of reactive dye can remain in the environment under natural conditions for 40 years 1 2 the presence of dyes in textile wastewater has become ecological concern in which toxic compounds may be accumulated in foods these toxic compounds are limiting factors for the use of biological treatment of textile wastewater since microorganism culture may be disturbed due to the toxicity of dyes 3 4 several physico chemical processes have been conducted for textile wastewater treatment coagulation and adsorption are conventional methods for the treatment of textile wastewater but these processes are not able to mineralize organic compounds and only separate organic pollutants from water environment 5 6 indeed they convert aqueous pollution to solid pollution membrane processes suffers from the production of a concentrate liquid of pollutants which needs further treatment 3 advanced oxidation processes aops are effective methods for the treatment of textile wastewater organic pollutants containing textile wastewater are degraded by highly reactive agents which are produced using aops these processes usually generate hydroxyl radicals with high redox potential e0 2 8 v 7 8 in last decade researchers have focused on the generation of sulfate radicals so4 for the degradation of organic pollutants sulfate radicals based aops sr aops have received a great attention from water and wastewater professionals sulfate radicals have demonstrated a supremacy compared to hydroxyl radicals ho longer half life 30 40 μs for so4 vs 20 ns for ho selectivity in the reaction with organic pollutants applicable in a wide range of ph and higher redox potential e0 2 5 3 1 v are advantages of sr aops against hydroxyl radicals 9 11 to produce sulfate radicals peroxydisulfate anions pds s2o8 2 can be used along with an activator pds can be activated by several procedures including transition metals 12 carbon catalyst 13 uv irradiation 14 ultrasound us 15 heat 16 electrochemical process 10 and base 17 transition metals have been demonstrated as efficient catalyst for pds activation however homogenous use of transition metals is limited to difficult recovery and regeneration to lower valance similar to fenton reactions 18 19 hereupon the heterogeneous catalyst was considered for pds activation to generate sulfate radicals several studies focused on the synthesis of nanoparticles of transition metals to activate pds 20 however the use of nanoparticles suffers from escape of nanoparticles from the reactor hence researchers have recommended a support for deposition of nanoparticles to stabilize nanoparticles and consequently increase of surface area to enhance surface reactions of pds with transition metals 21 in recent years copper oxide cuo showed a high ability for activation of pds for degradation of organic pollutants several supports have been used for cuo for activation of peroxygens 20 22 activated carbon ac is a versatile matter for environmental remediation in which it has been used for adsorption process as media for biological process and soil remediation regarding the low cost of ac non toxicity and high surface area its application is increasing in the world for other utilizations 23 24 many studies have applied ac as support for different nanoparticles of transition metals i e fe co and mn 25 27 however few studies have focused on cuo ac for degradation of organic pollutants 28 29 all studies have been conducted on synthetic solutions in which only one organic pollutant is considered for treatment process some studies have explored the treatment of actual textile effluent by cuo nanoparticles in this manner cuo cu oh 2 nanostructures 30 cu zno 31 and cuo carbon nanotubes 32 have been used as photocatalyst for actual textile wastewater treatment on the other hand zno pds in the presence of uv and us has been exerted for treating real textile wastewater 33 however no study has been done on real wastewater by pds cuo ac so far this study wants to elucidate the progress of sr aops application for real wastewater treatment in this study a simple method was used for preparation of cuo ac catalyst its catalytic activity was evaluated on pds decomposition for the removal of total organic carbon toc from a real textile wastewater the kinetic study was also assessed for this process afterward the reusability and stability of catalyst was tested the performance of pds cuo ac was evaluated on treatment of textile wastewater in terms of organic compounds removal and decolorization finally the detoxification of effluent was studied by daphnia magna as acute toxicity test 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals activated carbon and copper ntrate cu no3 2 3h2o 99 were purchased from merck company sulfuric acid h2so4 96 silver sulfate ag2so4 99 mercury sulfate hgso4 99 sodium hydroxide naoh 99 and ammonia solution nh4oh 37 were supplied from samchun company real textile wastewater was collected from a textile factory which is located at markazi province iran the characteristics of the wastewater is presented in table 1 2 2 cuo ac composite preparation the cuo ac composite was synthesized using deposition precipitation method 34 briefly ac was washed by hno3 5 and washed by deionized water for ten times firstly 10 g of ac was introduced to a 250 ml beaker two grams of copper cu no3 2 3h2o was mixed in the 50 ml deionized water and added to the beaker the mixture was mixed for 3 h after that ammonia solution was dropwisely added to the mixture until solution ph reach 10 4 afterward the precipitate was filtrated and separated from the solution the obtained product was washed by water for several times the resulting samples were dried at 120 c overnight and subsequently calcined at 300 for 3 h cuo nanoparticles were synthesized as well as the catalyst without ac 2 3 wastewater treatment by pds cuo ac process 100 ml of the wastewater was added to an erlenmeyer flask 250 ml the ph of wastewater was adjusted by sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide 0 1 m amount of the cuo ac catalyst was added to the wastewater and then a certain amount of pds was introduced to the wastewater the wastewater was mixed by a shaker with 250 rpm to form radical reactions for degradation of organic compounds at determined interval time 2 ml of sample was taken the samples were quenched by thiosulfate solution to stop reaction the effect of ph in range of 3 11 pds dosage 3 9 mm and the catalyst dosage 0 25 1 25 g l were studied on toc removal the performance of each constituent pds and cuo ac was evaluated at the same conditions the reusability experiments were conducted for cuo ac catalyst in a way that after each experiment cuo ac was centrifuged and separated from the solution and then cuo ac was washed and dried at 80 for further cycle of reusability experiments 2 4 analytical methods toc values of the wastewater and samples were analyzed by toc analyzer shimatzu japan cod chemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand chloride ions and total dissolved solids tds were determined based on standard methods 35 color of the wastewater was determined by american dye manufacture institute admi method by a spectrophotometer hach dr5000 this method is preference for real wastewater which is independent of hue copper ions were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas analytik jena novaa 800 d the morphology of ac cuo catalyst was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem using mira3 tescan x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis was used for phase identification of crystalline of cuo ac by a d8 bruker advanced diffractometer with cu kα radiation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was applied to identify organic and inorganic bond using a vertex 70 spectrophotometer bruker germany with a resolution of 2 cm 1 acute toxicity was examined on real wastewater and treated real wastewater using daphnia magna neonates as the test species based standard methods 35 raw wastewater and treated wastewater were sampled and exposed to the daphnia magna the residual of oxidant after reaction time was removed by na2so3 and any remaining so3 2 was eliminated by oxygen the ph of the raw and treated samples was adjusted to ph 8 0 the tests were set with a 16 h light 8 h dark light cycle using 980 1050 lux fluorescent lamps the tests were carried out by 10 number of daphnia magna in 50 ml beakers at ph 8 0 with 6 mg l dissolved oxygen do the lc50 values lethal concentration causing 50 death of the wastewater samples were calculated and reported 36 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ac cuo catalyst the morphology of cuo ac catalyst was determined by fesem images fig 1 a shows composited catalyst of cuo ac as can be seen cuo nanoparticles loaded on ac a red arrow shows the bed of ac while cuo nanoparticles are determined by a yellow arrow at closer view fig 1 b cuo nanoparticles were loaded as sphere like and bar like on ac the range of cuo nanoparticles were approximately 30 80 nm moreover this figure showed that cuo nanoparticles were agglomerated on together fig 1 c depicts xrd spectrum of cuo ac nanoparticles two mild peaks were observed at 23 18 and 44 13 which were corresponded to activated carbon on the other hand two sharps peaks of 35 51 and 38 9 were appeared which were corresponded to cuo the peaks at 48 85 58 32 61 56 66 08 68 1 and 72 56 were also related to cuo nanoparticles with reference code 98 002 8584 the results were confirmed that cuo nanoparticles were well loaded on ac fig 1 d shows ftir spectra of cuo ac composite ftir spectrum of cuo ac in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 was recorded and it was seen that there was a large broad band at 3700 3200 cm 1 which is corresponded to oh bond stretching of activated carbon surface the peak at 1097 cm 1 is related to the vibrational mode of hoh and hoh bending was seen at 1633 cm 1 37 a high stretching was observed at 492 cm 1 which was associated with cuo bond indicating that this composite was well synthesized 3 2 the comparison of the different constituents on toc removal from textile wastewater fig 2 shows toc removal by pds cuo ac pds ac pds cuo pds cu2 and pds ac processes as can be seen sole application of pds ac cuo ac and cuo was ineffective for toc removal pds application could not generate free radicals to degrade of organic compounds moreover the adsorption capacity of ac and cuo ac was little in which around 13 of toc was adsorbed and cuo can adsorb only 5 of toc during 60 min reaction time on the other hand applying pds ac can enhance toc removal to 23 compared to low efficiency of pds and ac it has been reported that ac can activate pds for the generation of free radicals according to following reactions 13 38 indeed oxygen functional groups ooh and oh on surfaces of activated carbon function as an activator mediates election transfer to generate sulfate radicals 1 s 2 o 8 2 a c s u r f a c e o o h s o 4 a c s u r f a c e o o h s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 a c s u r f a c e o h s o 4 a c s u r f a c e o h s o 4 pds cuo showed high efficiency for toc removal 50 1 of toc was eliminated during 60 min reaction time revealing that cuo catalyst was effective for pds activation the pds was activated by cu ii according to eq 3 the chain reactions continued to be consumed totally pds by copper sulfate radicals generated can decompose organic compounds in textile wastewater on the other hand formed cu iii at reaction 3 can oxidize water to hydroxyl radicals accelerating the degradation of organic compounds moreover regarding cu iii cu ii cycle and its high redox potential 2 3 v 39 cu iii is able to oxidize organics 40 hence cuo process seems to be an effective catalyst for pds activation in a real matrix 3 c u i i s 2 o 8 2 c u i i i s o 4 s o 4 2 4 c u i i i s 2 o 8 2 c u i i s 2 o 8 5 c u i i i h 2 o c u i i h o h the main system pds cuo ac showed the highest efficiency for toc removal as can be seen around 61 of toc was eliminated during 60 min ac and cuo supply both above mechanisms for pds activation therefore there was an enhanced activation for pds to more degrade organic pollutants in this way the composite not only had the highest efficiency for toc removal but it also prevailed escape of cuo from the reactor compared to cuo the presence of ac lowers the distance between the produced sulfate radicals and the organic pollutants in cuo ac composite due to its adsorption property in which the possibility of reaction of generated sulfate radical with the pollutants increased at the surface of the cuo ac homogeneous pds cu2 system was applied to compare with heterogeneous system the results showed that cu2 catalyzed pds in which 37 of toc was removed during 60 min reaction time this indicated that copper in homogeneous and heterogeneous modes can activate pds to generate sulfate radicals however homogenous systems showed low efficiency compared to heterogeneous form confirming that homogeneous systems are under influence of water constituents such as anions and organic compounds besides the regeneration of cu2 is limited in the homogeneous systems reduces the pds activation in the solution 3 3 the effect of ph pds and cuo ac dosage on toc removal fig 3 a demonstrates toc removal at different ph values under conditions of pds 5 mm 1 g l cuo ac and 60 min reaction time higher and lower solution ph showed the lowest efficiency for toc removal at acidic conditions the presence of high concentration of protons can suppress the function of pds cuo ac process through scavenging of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals as some studies have been stated this phenomenon 41 42 at alkali solution ph a decrease in toc removal was observed in which toc removal reached 42 although it has been seen that pds can be activated by base redox potential of hydroxyl radicals is significantly reduced at alkali condition 43 the solution ph of 7 0 was desirable ph for pds cuo ac process with 50 efficiency for toc removal this is an invaluable result since it is close to natural ph 7 6 of the textile wastewater and natural water resources the effect of pds dosage was studied on toc removal under the conditions of ph 7 0 cuo ac 1 g l and 60 min reaction time and the results are depicted in fig 3 b with increase in pds dosage enhanced toc removal gradually in which increase of pds dosage from 3 mm to 7 mm increased toc removal from 41 to 60 8 excess pds dosage did not change toc removal significantly higher pds concentration naturally results in more production of sulfate radicals and consequently more degradation of organic pollutants in order to reduce chemicals and optimization of pds dosage pds dosage of 7 mm was selected as the best conditions the effect of the catalyst dosage was studied on toc removal at fixed conditions of the ph 7 0 pds 7 mm and 60 min reaction time according to the fig 3 c toc removals were 42 54 4 60 8 and 58 9 for 0 5 0 75 1 and 1 25 g l respectively increase in catalyst dosage increased active sites of cuo to enhance pds activation and more degradation of organic compounds occurred as can be seen 1 g l of cuo ac catalyst provided the best condition for pds cuo ac process 3 4 kinetic studies for toc cod bod and color removals textile wastewater treatment was evaluated by cod bod toc and color removals by pds cuo ac process under optimum conditions of ph 7 pds 7 mm and 1 g l of the catalyst fig 4 a displays removal efficiencies of organic compounds based on cod toc bod and color as shown in this figure color removal rate was faster than other parameters 95 of color was removed during 60 min reaction time it can be optimistically stated that complete decolorization occurred for the textile wastewater which is worthwhile in term of aesthetic aspect cod and bod removals obtained were 72 1 and 70 respectively while 60 8 of toc was eliminated over 60 min in order to study the kinetic model for cod toc bod and color the pseudo first order kinetic model was used based on following equation 6 ln c 0 c t k t where c0 and ct are initial values of cod toc bod and color and the values of cod toc bod and color at t time respectively the k min 1 and t min are the rate constant of the pseudo first order kinetic model and reaction time respectively to achieve the rate constants of each parameter ln c0 c against the reaction time was plotted the obtained slop represents the rate constant k fig 4 b demonstrates that the pseudo first order kinetic model was well fitted for all four parameters the rate constants and half life and r squared are presented in table 2 as can be seen the highest rate constant was corresponded to the decolorization 0 054 min 1 while the rate constants for cod bod and toc were 0 023 0 021 and 0 018 min 1 respectively the half life t1 2 of each parameter were calculated based on following equation 7 t 1 2 l n 2 k indeed half life indicates that to reach 50 degradation needs what reaction time as can be seen half life for color cod bod and toc were obtained as 12 8 30 1 33 1 and 41 2 min respectively 3 5 reusability and stability of cuo ac for textile wastewater the reusability of cuo ac catalyst was tested for four cycles of catalyst use at the same conditions fig 5 a shows toc removal of textile wastewater after each cycle under the conditions of ph 7 pds 7 mm 1 g l cuo ac and 60 min this figure indicated that catalytic activity of cuo ac was kept for three cycles toc removal were reduced from 60 8 55 4 after three cycles of cuo ac usage while forth cycle of the catalyst removed only 41 2 of toc in fact around one third 33 of the performance of fresh cuo ac was reduced after four times use 61 removal vs 41 removal the main reason for the reduction of performance is poisoning of the catalyst surface through deposition of some of oxidized compounds on the catalyst surface as a matter of fact active sites of cuo ac for pds activation were occupied with other organic compounds stability of the catalyst was studied by the measurement of copper leached into solution after each experiment fig 5 b shows the amount of copper leaching during cyclic experiments as can be seen the copper concentrations after each experiment were approximately the same the concentrations of copper were 0 4 0 44 0 51 and 0 33 mg l for first second third and fourth cycles respectively these results showed that amount of copper leaching is negligible hence the efficiency reduction after four cycle cannot be related to lost copper from the composite as the main agent of pds activation actually the surface of the catalyst was contaminated by oxidized compounds or other organic inorganic compounds 3 6 the toxicity evaluation of textile wastewater the acute toxicity of raw textile wastewater and treated textile wastewater was evaluated by bioassay by daphnia magnaand the results are presentd in fig 6 as control experiment the toxicity of 1 g l cuo ac was also evaluated no toxicity was observed for the composite lc50 of the raw textile wastewater was 20 6 v v indicating that raw textile wastewater was toxic treated textile wastewater was assessed during 60 min reaction time as can be seen with increase of reaction time decreased toxicity of treated textile wastewater in a way that lc50 reached 62 4 v v this result showed that pds cuo ac process can detoxify the textile wastewater significantly however it should be noted that treated wastewater is still relatively toxic therefore the wastewater needs further treatment for complete detoxification and mineralization 3 7 comparison of pds cuo ac with other studies the obtained results in this study were compared to other studies based on real textile wastewater treatment by various aops in recent five years and their succinct are presented in table 3 an overview on these processes with focus on the efficiency cost and environmental impacts was conducted generally pds cuo ac benefits from high efficiency for the mineralization while residual sulfate ion is the most important problem of pds based processes photocatalysis processes are relatively inefficient in dark wastewater due to absorption of photons by high color and suspended solids however a planer falling film reactor can be an option for reducing reaction path in photocatalysis in homogeneous fenton based processes residual iron and providing acidic conditions should be considered when high concentration of oxidant and ferrous ions are applied 3 44 on the other hand sonolysis activated oxidants seem to be an unrealistic effort for large scale due to difficulty in scale up and high energy consumption chlorine based processed suffer from producing chlorinated organic compounds as toxic substances however it effectively decolorizes textile effluents 43 the production of sludge in coagulation and electrocoagulation ec processes is always a big challenge for water and wastewater engineers 45 howbeit they have been considered thanks to high efficiency and low cost electro fenton ef processes have demonstrated high yields for mineralization of organic pollutants but electrical energy consumption and needing to a catalyst limits its application in industrial scale recently electro peroxone ep has been suggested by wang research group in which high efficiency was obtained at short reaction time without any activator 46 47 however the cost of electrical energy ozone generator and the electrodes are still controversial to scale up that finally in addition to the efficiency the process cost and environmental impacts should be considered to select a process to treat industrial wastewater therefore we cannot warrant any processes to reach mentioned the criteria 4 conclusion textile wastewater is a complex aquatic matrix which is considered as high organic wastewater sr aops have been widely used for synthetic pollutants in this work a nanocomposite was prepared for pds activation pds cuo ac process was evaluated on the treatment of a real textile wastewater under optimum conditions of ph 7 pds 7 mm 1 g l cuo ac and 60 min reaction time 95 of color 72 of cod 70 of bod and 61 of toc were removed pseudo first order was well fitted for organic indices the obtained half life for color cod

13838,investigation of a new low cost safe and highly efficient water disinfection alternative to conventional methods has prime importance this study aims to develop silver nanowire decorated glass fiber agnw gf filters for the removal of e coli from water this is the first study to fabricate a novel agnw gf filter and to investigate its use for point of use pou water disinfection to this purpose the effects of flow rate agnw loading and influent e coli concentration on the removal efficiency of e coli and ag release from agnw gf filters were investigated effect of filtrate volume on ag release was also analyzed disk diffusion tests revealed that agnw gf filters with different agnw loadings had antibacterial effects against e coli at a concentration range of 103 108 cfu ml flow tests were conducted in order to investigate optimal conditions at which agnw gf filters achieved the highest e coli removal efficiency optimal flow rate agnw loading and influent e coli concentration were found out as 1 ml min 9 9 mg g and 103 cfu ml respectively the highest removal efficiency was obtained as 2 12 log after two stage serial filtration under optimal conditions the released ag amounts were all below the limit value of 100 ppb for potable water under determined optimal conditions agnw gf filter was found as a promising alternative for pou water disinfection method to be used in contaminated natural water 103 cfu ml keywords silver nanowires glass fiber filter antibacterial performance silver release water disinfection e coli 1 introduction today there are serious problems in supplying clean water in many parts of the world this situation has fatal consequences for human health increasing drought and human population make it more difficult to supply clean and safe water 1 world health organization who 2 estimates that about 842 000 people most of which are children aged under five years die each year from diarrheal diseases resulting from unsafe drinking water hand hygiene and inadequate sanitation everyone has the right to access safe and reliable water for personal and domestic use however it is a great challenge to supply clean water in undeveloped or developing regions especially in rural areas by 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas 2 several methods such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet treatment have been proven for their high disinfection efficiencies against pathogens however these conventional methods have several drawbacks in today s standards although chlorination is one of the most preferred disinfection methods it produces carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps 3 4 besides chlorination high energy use and cost of ultraviolet uv and ozone disinfection limit the widespread use of these methods reverse osmosis membrane is another method used for water disinfection which is very costly and prone to fouling 5 therefore investigation of a new low cost safe and highly efficient disinfection route as an alternative to conventional methods to overcome aforementioned problems has prime importance 6 with the developments in nanotechnology utilization of nanomaterials is being investigated in the field of environmental engineering for various purposes such as the removal of pesticides chemical and biological substances and salt to obtain fresh water 1 7 silver and silver compounds are the most effective bactericides known since ancient times 8 9 nanosilver shows higher antibacterial activity compared to the conventional silver bactericides 8 accordingly the number of studies conducted using silver nanoparticles agnps and silver nanowires agnws have increased in the last 10 years and have shown positive results in the point of use pou disinfection of water 7 10 pou disinfection systems are efficient due to their low energy consumption easy to use and portable nature they are installed at specific water supply points such as at tap faucet or bottling from river 11 nanosilver is found to be effective against both gram positive bacteria bacillus clostridium enterococcus listeria staphylococcus and streptococcus etc and gram negative bacteria acinetobacter escherichia pseudomonas salmonella and vibrio etc 9 besides several studies show that nanosilver has an antiviral effect on bacteriophage ms2 9 12 13 and antifungal effect on spergillus niger candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae etc 9 they are non toxic at minute concentrations who specified allowable silver concentration in water as 0 1 mg l 100 ppb 14 compared to conventional disinfection methods the use of agnps and agnws are highly promising since they do not lead to the formation of carcinogenic dbps require less energy free of clogging problem and show high efficiency on a wide range of organisms 15 16 despite of many reported advantages of silver nanosilver use in water disinfection and especially its potential use in pou water disinfection the research on the topic is still in the development stage although there are studies conducted using ag nanomaterials few are specifically conducted with agnws for pou water disinfection purposes 4 12 16 21 studies revealed that agnws have much less environmental toxicity compared to the ag nanostructures of other shapes cubes particles etc 22 23 besides as indicated in the review study of bahcelioglu et al 24 understanding of factors such as flow rate ag concentration microbial concentration etc is highly important to develop an alternative pou water disinfection method it is also indicated that the investigation of ag release from the material is crucial to develop a reliable nanosilver based water disinfection alternative in terms of both the environment and human health studies for which are limited in the literature 24 yet there are some conflicts in literature about the factors affecting the removal efficiency and ag release such as scaffold material ag concentration microbial concentration and flow rate the use of agnw decorated glass fiber agnw gf filters for water disinfection has remained elusive this research aims to develop unique agnw gf filters for the removal of escherichia coli i e e coli from water considering the effect of flow rate e coli concentration and agnw loading and its ag release in detail this research is the first study to fabricate a novel agnw gf filter and to investigate its use for pou water disinfection without any bias it is believed that the results presented in this paper would provide a roadmap for the other researches in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the glass fiber filters gf a grade used in the experiments were obtained from whatmanntm the diameter thickness and mean pore size for the glass fiber gf filters were 150 mm 0 26 mm and 1 6 μm respectively the calculated average grammage was 5 3 mg cm2 polyvnylpyrrolidone pvp mw 55 000 ethylene glycol eg silver nitrate agno3 and sodium chloride nacl used for agnw synthesis were purchased from sigma aldrich nutrient broth and mueller hinton mh agar used for antibacterial tests were purchased from merck ultra pure water was obtained by milliq water purification system e coli culture which was already isolated from chicken manure was used in the experiments 2 2 synthesis of agnw agnws were synthesized via polyol method as described by coskun et al 25 this process is based on the reduction of an inorganic salt by a polyol at an elevated temperature here ethylene glycol eg was used as both solvent and reducing agent pvp was used as a stabilizing agent and agno3 was used as a ag source following synthesis the agnws were purified by washing several times with ethanol and centrifuging following purification agnws were suspended in ethanol 2 3 fabrication of agnw gf filters for the fabrication of agnw decorated glass fiber filters agnw gf filters a gf filter sheet was coated with agnw via simple dip and dry method first a sheet of clean whatmanntm gf filter with a diameter of 150 mm was cleaned by immersing into absolute ethanol solution within an ultrasonic cleaner for 5 minutes then the gf filters were dried at 120 for 10 min the concentration of agnws in ethanol solution used in fabrication of agnw gf filters was recorded as 0 5 mg ml a cleaned sheet of gf filter was immersed into the diluted agnw solution for 10 min then it was dried at 120 for 10 min this procedure was repeated 4 6 or 10 times in order to obtain different agnw loadings in order to produce control filters bare gf filters with no agnw loading a sheet of gf filters was immersed in only ethanol solution i e containing no agnw and dried under the same conditions 120 10 min prior to the experiments each side of the agnw gf filters and control filters was kept under the uv light for 30 min for both sterilization and removal of residual pvp 2 4 characterization of fabricated agnw gf filters length distribution of synthesized agnw was evaluated via imagej software using scanning electron microscope sem images the optical properties absorption spectra of agnw solutions which were used for coating of gf filters were analyzed by uv visible absorption spectrophotometer hach lange dr39000 over the wavelength range of 320 800 nm concentration of agnw in ethanol solutions was recorded via exstar sii tg dta 7300 in order to understand the structure of the agnw gf filters sem analyses using fei nova nano sem 430 microscope fei hillsboro or were performed a thin gold layer 5 10 nm was deposited onto the fibers prior to sem analysis electrical resistance ohm sq of agnw gf filters was measured at 10 different points on both sides of the agnws gf filters using resistivity probe signatone connected to a keithley 2400 sourcemeter the average values with standard deviations are reported in the corresponding figures and tables in order to understand the exact ag amount i e ag loading decorated on agnw gf filters inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was used 2 5 antibacterial testing the antibacterial performance of agnw gf filters and control gf filters was tested against gram negative e coli e coli is one of the most important indicator organisms and well represents the fecal contamination in water 26 28 in order to investigate antibacterial effect disk diffusion tests and flow tests were conducted mentioned antibacterial tests were conducted in a laminar flow cabinet in order to obtain a sterile environment unless otherwise specified 2 5 1 preparation of standard e coli solution gram negative e coli which was isolated from chicken manure was used for the antibacterial tests to prepare standard e coli solution a colony of e coli cultivated on differential emb agar was added onto a 100 ml of nutrient broth solution autoclaved at 121 for 15 min the suspension was incubated overnight 18 h in a shaker incubator at 37 and 160 rpm 2 5 2 disk diffusion test in order to evaluate the effect of both bacterial concentration and agnw loading on antibacterial performance of the fabricated agnw gf filters disk diffusion tests were initially conducted mh agar medium was poured on plastic sterilized petri dishes and then solidified disk diffusion test was performed by uniformly spreading 100 μl of e coli solution 105 107 and 109 cfu ml over the agar medium in petri dishes one cm diameter of circular bare gf filter piece as control and agnw gf filter pieces with different agnw loadings were placed over the agar gel petri dishes were incubated at 37 for 24 h after the incubation period the diameter of the inhibition zone developed around the pieces was measured with a ruler 2 5 3 flow test in order to investigate e coli removal efficiency of the agnw gf filters from water flow tests were conducted to this purpose circular agnw gf filter pieces with a diameter of 4 cm were placed into gravity filtration unit see figure s1 supplementary file overnight grown e coli solution was initially centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min at 4 then the centrifuge was re suspended with pbs and diluted with ultra pure water milli q water to represent the model contaminated water e coli contaminated water a 100 ml of this model contaminated water was passed through agnw gf filter via gravity filtration unit with constant inflow rate the viable e coli amount in the influent water and effluent water filtrate was counted by spread plate method the removal efficiency was calculated as given in equation 1 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y i n f l u e n t e c o l i c f u m l e f f l u e n t e c o l i c f u m l i n f l u e n t e c o l i c f u m l 100 the effects of flow rate agnw loading and e coli concentration on removal efficiency were investigated via flow tests initially the effect of flow rate was investigated the flow rate resulting in the highest removal efficiency was used in the following flow tests then the optimal agnw loading which results in the highest removal efficiency was determined and used in the following flow tests for determination not only the removal efficiency but also the ag release value is another important factor finally the influent e coli concentration at which the agnw gf filters perform with the highest efficiency was determined all these tests were performed in duplicate and the average values of the results as removal and log removal are reported more details for flow tests are given in the supplementary file table s1 pearson correlation coefficient factors r were calculated to assess the correlation of antibacterial performance of agnw gf filters with flow rate agnw loading and e coli concentration finally the effect of two stage serial filtration with agnw gf filters on e coli removal from water was investigated to this purpose the flow test was conducted with two similar agnw gf filters the model e coli solution was first filtered through an agnw gf filter and then the collected filtrate was passed through a second agnw gf filter in this part of the work as flow rate agnw loading and e coli concentration the predetermined optimum values resulting in the highest removal efficiencies were used 2 6 fixation for sem analysis sem analyses were performed to investigate bacterial attachment on the agnw gf filters after flow tests in order to analyze the agnw gf filters via sem a fixation method mentioned by doganay et al 21 was used this method is known to prevent deformation of the e coli containing filters due to vacuum and voltage applications in this method each agnw gf filter used is initially immersed into a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution in pbs for 30 min which is followed by the immersion into graded ethanol series 60 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol pbs solutions for 10 min each 2 7 silver release analyses in order to investigate the trends in ag release from the agnw gf filters ag release analyses were conducted for the effluents of each flow test performed with different flow rates agnw loadings and e coli concentrations the tests were performed in duplicate and the average values of the results are reported the released ag concentrations were analyzed via icp ms ag release analyses were also conducted to investigate the effects of the filtrate volume on ag release for long term operations one liter of ultra pure water was passed through the agnw gf filter with agnw loading of 9 9 mg g the flow rate was adjusted to 1 ml min filtrate samples were collected at each 100 ml for the analyses 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of agnws and agnw gf filters the morphology and optical properties of agnws were analyzed and shown in fig 1 fig 1 a shows the sem image of agnw based on the sem images agnw length distribution analysis is shown in fig 1 b the average diameter and length of agnws utilized in this work was found as 0 1 μm and 8 1 4 7 μm respectively fig 1 c shows the absorption spectra of agnws in ethanol solution the spectrum has two characteristic absorption peaks at 350 nm and 385 nm these absorption peaks are associated with typical surface plasmon resonance spr of agnws 30 33 the former and latter peaks generally correspond to longitudinal plasmon resonance and transverse plasmon resonance respectively 34 presence of two peaks in the absorption spectrum is due to the low symmetry of the pentagonal cross section of agnws 35 four sheets of agnw gf filters were fabricated f1 f4 for antibacterial tests table 1 gives the electrical resistance values and corresponding agnw loading as mg g and as wt values of agnw gf filters f4 has the highest agnw loading which is 9 9 mg g agnw loading of f1 f2 and f3 were calculated as 0 95 4 5 and 4 8 mg g respectively as expected as agnw loading increases electrical resistance decreases f1 was non conductive since agnws were not percolative fig 2 shows the photos and sem images of both bare gf filters and agnw gf filters agnw decoration onto gfs can be seen in fig 2 d it should be noted that agnws surround the glass fibers and are likely not to affect the pore size and or structure of gfs sem images of each fabricated agnw gf filter f1 f4 are given in figure s2 in the supplementary file 3 2 results of antibacterial testing 3 2 1 disk diffusion tests fig 3 shows the disk diffusion tests results overall the disk diffusion tests results for agnw gf filters indicated that the diameter of inhibition zones were in the range of 1 15 1 35 cm control gf filters did not show any inhibition zone at any of the e coli concentrations studied this reveals that agnw gf filters show antibacterial efficacy on e coli whereas control gf filters does not inhibition zones caused by f1 filter with the lowest agnw loading of 0 95 mg g were observed as 1 20 cm 1 30 cm and 1 35 cm for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml respectively for f2 agnw gf filter with a agnw loading of 4 5 mg g inhibition zone diameters were measured as 1 15 cm 1 20 cm and 1 25 cm for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml respectively for agnw gf filter with a agnw loading of 4 8 mg g f3 for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml inhibition zone diameters were measured as 1 20 cm 1 25 cm and 1 30 cm respectively for agnw gf filter with the highest agnw loading of 9 9 mg g f4 inhibition zone diameters were measured as 1 17 cm 1 25 cm and 1 30 cm for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml respectively it was observed that the decrease in e coli concentration resulted in an increase in the inhibition zone diameters of all agnw gf filters e coli concentration and inhibition zone diameter for each agnw gf filter were inversely correlated r 0 87 0 95 this inverse correlation was also mentioned in literature 12 36 agnw loading on the other hand might not be affecting the inhibition zone diameters as much as e coli concentration interestingly among agnw gf filters f1 which had the lowest agnw loading showed the highest inhibition zone diameter at equal e coli concentrations correlation between agnw loading and inhibition zone diameters was not remarkable r 0 39 0 44 for all e coli concentrations studied yet hong et al 12 suggests that the higher agnw concentration results in larger inhibition zone diameter on the other hand similar to the current work doganay et al 29 and shameli et al 37 did not find any dependency of inhibition zone diameter on agnw loading it should be noted that disk diffusion test results are highly dependent on physico chemical composition of the agar gel which could influence the ag ion release as well as ion diffusion 38 therefore different agar mediums used in different studies might result in the contradictory results in literature regarding to this there is still a room to reveal the effect of ag concentration and also a potential combined effect of other factors with ag concentration on the disinfection performance investigated via disk diffusion test 3 3 flow tests 3 3 1 effect of flowrate agnw loading and e coli concentration the effects of flow rate agnw loading and influent e coli concentration on e coli removal efficiency for both control gf filters and agnw gf filters are provided in fig 4 the difference between the removal efficiencies of agnw gf filters and corresponding control gf filters observed in all flow tests performed was attributed to both the antibacterial activity of agnw and the potential increase in the filtration capacity of agnw gf filter due to the hydrophobic part of pvp which was discussed below the former was also verified by the disk diffusion test fig 3 fig 4 a shows the changes in the e coli removal efficiencies under different flow rates no significant relation between flow rate and removal efficiency r 0 42 was observed for the control gf filter on the other hand a negative relation between flow rate and removal efficiency for agnw gf filter r 0 86 was observed as flow rate increased from 1 to 2 5 ml min e coli removal efficiency decreased significantly by 23 the further increase in the flow rate from 2 5 to 5 ml min resulted in a slight decrease in removal efficiency only 4 in other words the removal efficiency at 1 ml min was 0 37 log higher almost doubled than the removal efficiency at 2 5 ml min however there was only 0 04 log difference between the removal efficiencies at flow rates of 2 5 ml min and 5 ml min these results revealed that maximum removal efficiency was obtained at the lowest flow rate investigated which was 1 ml min the similar negative relation was reported by hong et al 12 and wen et al 17 in both studies the removal efficiencies decreased almost 0 5 1 log 68 90 at 6 v when flow rate was increased from 2 ml min to 4 ml min the reason behind this situation was not clear and not explained in the literature it might depend on contact time which decreases as flow rate increases less contact time high flow rate would lead to less antibacterial performance fig 4 b shows the changes in e coli removal efficiencies under different agnw loadings disk diffusion tests showed weak correlation between agnw loading and the corresponding antibacterial performance inhibition zone diameters fig 3 on the other hand agnw loading and antibacterial performance were found to be highly correlated in the conducted flow tests as seen in fig 4 b flow tests revealed that e coli removal efficiency might depend on agnw loading of the filters r 0 95 as agnw loading increased e coli removal efficiency also increased among the three agnw gf filters f1 f3 and f4 and agnw loadings tried f4 achieved the highest removal efficiency of 89 0 there are studies explaining the relation between nanosilver concentration and e coli inactivation as a nanosilver concentration dependent manner 8 12 39 zhang et al 2016 observed a 5 fold increase in inactivation of e coli when nanosilver dose increased by 8 fold similarly song et al 8 and hong et al 12 reported an increase in the bactericidal effect of nanosilver containing materials as ag content increased blotting paper impregnated with agnps achieved 4 5 7 5 log removal for contaminated water containing e coli concentration of 109 cfu ml which was directly correlated with ag content of the papers 40 udekwu et al 41 clarify the reason behind this relation as the reduction in ratio of available antimicrobial molecules per target organisms due to the reduced effective antimicrobial concentration this explanation might also clarify the contradiction in the results of disk diffusion tests and flow tests observed in our study flow test due to the nature of the test might result in increased contact area between the microorganism and the agnw while water passes through the agnw filter yet disk diffusion test is limited to disk surface area and ag release around the disks that is a two dimensional effect limited surface contact area would mean less antimicrobial molecules per target organisms which will make it independent of the agnw loading in disk diffusion tests fig 4 c and d show the changes in e coli removal efficiencies of f4 agnw gf filter at different influent e coli concentrations displaying the results only in percent removals as shown in fig 4 c was not descriptive enough to compare the results properly especially for such high influent bacterial concentrations studied since the percent removals were close therefore in order to better examine the changes in removal efficiencies at different influent e coli concentrations removal efficiencies were also expressed in log removal basis fig 4 d similar to the inhibition zones observed in the disk diffusion tests fig 3 removal efficiency of flow tests increased as the influent e coli concentration decreased r 0 88 among all influent e coli concentrations studied in the tests with agnw gf filters the highest removal efficiency 99 0 was achieved at 103 cfu ml hong and his colleagues 12 reported a significant decrease in the antibacterial performance of agnw carbon fiber cloth at e coli concentrations greater than 106 cfu ml tan and colleagues 4 also discussed the concentration dependent results they found a 10 increase in the removal efficiency of e coli when the influent e coli concentration decreased to 103 cfu ml from 105 cfu ml this can be explained by minimum inhibitory concentration mic value mic value depends on bacteria concentration 40 42 as bacteria concentration increases resistance to antibacterial material also increases 42 besides decreasing the concentration of target organism e coli might lead to an increase in ratio of available antimicrobial molecules per target organisms i e effective antimicrobial concentration 41 similar to the agnw gf filters e coli removal efficiency of control gf filters also increased as the influent e coli concentration decreased r 0 98 the highest removal efficiency 61 5 0 41 log removal was also obtained at 103 cfu ml fig 4 c and d however it should be noted that this value is almost 40 lower 1 6 log removal difference than that of its agnw gf filter counterpart besides as influent e coli concentration increased from 103 cfu ml to 108 cfu ml only a 10 reduction in the removal efficiency was seen for agnw gf filter while a 34 reduction was calculated for the control gf filter these results together with the inhibition zone results of control and agnw filters are indicative of both potential antimicrobial effect and improved filtration capacity of the latter sem images of control gf filter and agnw gf filter after a flow test are given in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively it should be noted that fig 5 a and 5 b do not belong to the same filter that is they are not the before and after agnw coating filtration images yet these sem images still confirm the attachment of larger number of cells on agnw gf filter than that of control gf filter and in turn the improved filtration capacity of agnw gf filter as mentioned before the potential increase in filtration capacity of agnw gf filter might be attributed to the presence of pvp on nanowires during agnw coating 41 jiang and teng 43 suggested that hydrophobic part of pvp molecule on agnws enables interaction of agnws with the bacterial cells thus cells attach to the agnw surface the high attachment of bacterial cells on agnw gf filter and the release of silver ions of high concentration near the film surface might cause high toxicity to settled bacterial cells 43 therefore it seems that the hydrophobic part of pvp on agnw not only improves the filtration capacity of agnw gf filters but also its antibacterial performance for settled attached bacteria 3 4 effect of two stage serial filtration finally two stage serial filtration was performed in order to investigate the further improvement on e coli removal efficiency of f4 agnw gf filters at 1 ml min of flow rate and influent e coli concentration of 103 cfu ml results are provided in fig 6 it was observed that log removals were approximately doubled for both control gf and agnw gf filters however the removal efficiency of control gf filters was 0 88 log for the second filtration which was still lower than that of agnw gf filters after the first filtration 1 08 log by two stage serial filtration the removal efficiency increased from 1 08 to 2 12 log removal under optimal conditions agnw gf filters fabricated in this study achieved 2 12 log removal efficiency at most this performance is comparable to the results in the literature agnps attached to a porous carbon foam developed by karumuri et al 44 also achieved 2 log removal for 103 cfu ml e coli concentration schoen et al 16 found less than 1 0 log inactivation for 103 cfu ml e coli concentration at 3 0 v voltage application compared to schoen et al 16 agnw gf filters developed have superior performance over agnw cnt coated cotton filters even without biasing on the other hand agnw pan tpu membrane 4 and pan pani agnw cc 17 achieved 100 removal efficiencies for e coli concentration of 103 105 cfu ml yet this high performance was attributed to the attachment of e coli on the membrane filters i e by filtration due to small pore size 4 17 compared to the literature agnw gf filters fabricated in this study are likely to achieve a promising performance for pou water disinfection 3 5 silver release analyses 3 5 1 silver release in flow tests the amount of ag released to the filtrate will definitely alter the quality of the drinking water who 14 and usepa 45 set that the maximum ag content in drinking water should not be more than 100 ppb to prevent possible negative health effects of ag therefore filtrates collected from each flow test were analyzed in order to investigate the effect of i flow rate ii agnw loading iii e coli concentration and iv two stage serial filtration on ag release from agnw gf filter figure 7 shows the ag release values analyzed in each flow test at all flow tests ag amounts released to the filtrates were below the limit value 100 ppb thus ag release from agnw gf filters to the effluent water was evaluated as safe for drinking water the analyzed average ag release values in the filtrates were found as 47 0 ppb 42 5 ppb and 43 0 ppb at 1 ml min 2 5 ml min and 5 ml min respectively fig 7 a first ag release value decreased by 4 5 ppb when flow rate was increased from 1 ml min to 2 5 ml min then it was mildly increased by 0 5 ppb when the flow rate was further increased to 5 ml min for the synthesis of agnws pvp was used as a stabilizing agent h zhang 46 mentioned less ag release from pvp stabilized agnps however water dissolves pvp 47 therefore the slower flow rates increase the contact time of water with agnw gf filter which would result in more ag release due to pvp dissolution the higher ag release at lower flow rates was also indicated by gemici et al 48 and akhigbe et al 49 on the other hand according to hong et al 12 ag release at 5 ml min would not be expected to be higher than that of at 2 5 ml min agnws on gf filter might have been washed out at 5 ml min flow rate due to the higher velocity and shear effect of water while passing through the agnw gf filters this hypothesis should be investigated kinetically in more detail the effect of agnw loading on ag release is provided in fig 7 b ag release was found to increase with agnw loading r 0 93 similar to what has been reported by hong et al 12 mpenyana monyatsi et al 50 praveena et al 51 and tan et al 4 here the important point is f4 agnw gf filter 9 9 mg g agnw loading with the highest removal efficiency among the others but also the highest ag release 62 5 ppb the more agnw loading might cause the higher ag release than the limit value 100 ppb since the ag release is directly related to the agnw loading therefore not only removal efficiency but also ag release is an important factor to choose the optimal agnw loading besides the more agnw loading means the higher cost of fabrication therefore f4 agnw gf filter no more or no less is the most convenient one in terms of the removal efficiency ag release and the potential cost fig 7 c shows the effect of influent e coli concentration on ag release as seen in the figure the difference between ag release at 103 and 105 cfu ml is negligible on the other hand ag release significantly increased by 46 ppb when influent e coli concentration was increased from 105 to 108 cfu ml quang et al 52 similarly found that ag release is considerably higher when e coli contaminated water is filtered compared to the clean water filtered ag release after filtration of 3 liters of clean water was not detectable while filtering of water contaminated with e coli about 106 cfu ml resulted in 0 01 mg l and 0 17 mg l after treating 0 5 liters and 2 liters water respectively clean water resulted in ag release of 0 04 mg l only after filtration of high volumes of water 12 liters release of ag from agnw gf filters would not only occur during the passage of water through the filters ag might be also entrapped by bacterial cells during percolation of model contaminated water through the filters as suggested by dankovich and gray 40 dankovich and gray 40 found out that half of the ag released to the filtrate was resultant of ag that was absorbed into the cells thus a higher number of bacteria containing water might lead to higher amount of ag released into the filtrate the bacteria that absorb ag and pass through the filters without being captured would result in higher ag release in the filtrate which might be the case for 108 cfu ml e coli concentration where removal efficiency is the lowest among others fig 4 d it should be noted that the researches on ag release were generally conducted with pure water or deionized water without any bacterial contamination therefore the relationship between ag release and bacteria concentration and the mechanism behind should be investigated in detail the amount of ag released in the filtrates of the flow test conducted with two stage serial filtration was also analyzed for both the 1st and 2nd stages the results are presented in fig 8 agnw gf filters used in both stages had similar characteristics yet the increase in the amount of ag release via the application of 2nd stage was only 9 ppb which was less than the amount released after 1st stage 13 ppb this might be due to the removal of e coli concentration after the 1st stage as mentioned earlier the decrease in influent e coli concentration might decrease the ag release after 1st stage filtration 1 08 log removal was achieved fig 7 c thus a decrease in ag release was expected after 2nd stage filtration another reason of the observed decrease in released ag amount might be the 2nd stage agnw gf filter the agnw gf filter at the 2nd stage might act as a barrier via capturing the ag released to the filtrate of 1st stage thus leading to a lower ag amount released 22 ppb than the summation of ag amount released from two agnw gf filters 26 ppb 3 5 2 long term operation a final flow test was conducted in order to investigate the ag release in long term operation fig 9 shows ag release at each 100 ml filtrate and the cumulative ag release as seen in the figure the release rate gradually decreased as volume of filtrate increased until 300 ml of filtrate volume after passing 300 ml of water ag release rate became relatively constant until the end of operation this result was compatible with the studies by quang et al 52 and biswas and bandyopadhyaya 5 quang et al 52 described the higher release rate at the early stages of filtration they suggest that nanosilver which has weak attraction with the substrate materials was likely to release first in this study the cumulative ag release after 1 liter of ultra pure water filtration was 46 7 ppb which was less than half of the limit value 100 ppb ag release is not only important for possible human health issues but also affects the lifespan of the ag containing materials the calculation of the agnw gf filters lifespan was done according to the equation 2 to this purpose the ag analyses results of the flow tests conducted at 1 ml min with agnw loading of 9 9 mg g 0 053 mg cm2 and 103 cfu ml influent e coli concentration were used accordingly the released ag amount from agnw gf filter was 16 4 3 ppb after percolation of 100 ml contaminated water which was equal to only 0 2 of the total ag of the filter it should be noted that the calculated lifespan is the minimum period possible to observe at the given highest ag release rate as seen in fig 9 in long term operation the release rate decreases after filtering 300 ml of water therefore considering the reduction in ag release rate with the increase in volume of the filtrated water the lifespan of the developed agnw gf filter might increase in long term operations after filtration of 300 ml of water through the agnw gf filter the ag amount released after each 100 ml of filtered water decreased to less than 3 3 ppb thus as the ag release rate decreases the lifespan of the agnw gf filter might increase from 42 liters to about 245 liters which is even more than the lifespan of the materials 50 148 liters estimated in literature 4 12 53 2 r e l e a s e o f a g a g r e l e a s e i n 100 m l μ g a v e r a g e a g n w l o a d i n g μ g c m 2 f i l t r a t i o n a r e a c m 2 100 4 conclusion a novel agnw gf filter was fabricated and found to be promising for safe in terms of ag release and highly efficient for pou water disinfection to be used for contaminated natural water in particular for waters with e coli concentration less than 103 cfu ml the agnw gf filters at optimum operating conditions achieved 2 12 log removal for 103 cfu ml e coli contaminated water via two stage serial filtration control gf filter on the other hand achieved only 0 88 log removal for identical conditions there were appreciable differences between antibacterial results of agnw gf filter and control gf filters revealing that the fabricated agnw gf filter removes bacteria not only via filtration but also via antibacterial activity of agnw in order to understand which mechanisms dominate the removal further studies should be conducted ag release from the developed agnw gf filters was found to be below the recommended value of 100 ppb and thus be safe for using drinking water purposes for pou water treatment cost is an important consideration for possible uses of the materials on site 54 especially for undeveloped and developing regions the filtration system with agnw gf filters does not require any power source for filtration but only gravity thus this will lower the treatment cost of pou application compared to the conventional methods however the fabrication cost and corresponding lifetime of agnw gf filters should be investigated and optimized if required considering the high antibacterial performance low ag release amounts and no energy need agnw gf filters have a great potential to be used in undeveloped or developing regions especially in rural areas in order to supply clean water declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13838,investigation of a new low cost safe and highly efficient water disinfection alternative to conventional methods has prime importance this study aims to develop silver nanowire decorated glass fiber agnw gf filters for the removal of e coli from water this is the first study to fabricate a novel agnw gf filter and to investigate its use for point of use pou water disinfection to this purpose the effects of flow rate agnw loading and influent e coli concentration on the removal efficiency of e coli and ag release from agnw gf filters were investigated effect of filtrate volume on ag release was also analyzed disk diffusion tests revealed that agnw gf filters with different agnw loadings had antibacterial effects against e coli at a concentration range of 103 108 cfu ml flow tests were conducted in order to investigate optimal conditions at which agnw gf filters achieved the highest e coli removal efficiency optimal flow rate agnw loading and influent e coli concentration were found out as 1 ml min 9 9 mg g and 103 cfu ml respectively the highest removal efficiency was obtained as 2 12 log after two stage serial filtration under optimal conditions the released ag amounts were all below the limit value of 100 ppb for potable water under determined optimal conditions agnw gf filter was found as a promising alternative for pou water disinfection method to be used in contaminated natural water 103 cfu ml keywords silver nanowires glass fiber filter antibacterial performance silver release water disinfection e coli 1 introduction today there are serious problems in supplying clean water in many parts of the world this situation has fatal consequences for human health increasing drought and human population make it more difficult to supply clean and safe water 1 world health organization who 2 estimates that about 842 000 people most of which are children aged under five years die each year from diarrheal diseases resulting from unsafe drinking water hand hygiene and inadequate sanitation everyone has the right to access safe and reliable water for personal and domestic use however it is a great challenge to supply clean water in undeveloped or developing regions especially in rural areas by 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas 2 several methods such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet treatment have been proven for their high disinfection efficiencies against pathogens however these conventional methods have several drawbacks in today s standards although chlorination is one of the most preferred disinfection methods it produces carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps 3 4 besides chlorination high energy use and cost of ultraviolet uv and ozone disinfection limit the widespread use of these methods reverse osmosis membrane is another method used for water disinfection which is very costly and prone to fouling 5 therefore investigation of a new low cost safe and highly efficient disinfection route as an alternative to conventional methods to overcome aforementioned problems has prime importance 6 with the developments in nanotechnology utilization of nanomaterials is being investigated in the field of environmental engineering for various purposes such as the removal of pesticides chemical and biological substances and salt to obtain fresh water 1 7 silver and silver compounds are the most effective bactericides known since ancient times 8 9 nanosilver shows higher antibacterial activity compared to the conventional silver bactericides 8 accordingly the number of studies conducted using silver nanoparticles agnps and silver nanowires agnws have increased in the last 10 years and have shown positive results in the point of use pou disinfection of water 7 10 pou disinfection systems are efficient due to their low energy consumption easy to use and portable nature they are installed at specific water supply points such as at tap faucet or bottling from river 11 nanosilver is found to be effective against both gram positive bacteria bacillus clostridium enterococcus listeria staphylococcus and streptococcus etc and gram negative bacteria acinetobacter escherichia pseudomonas salmonella and vibrio etc 9 besides several studies show that nanosilver has an antiviral effect on bacteriophage ms2 9 12 13 and antifungal effect on spergillus niger candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae etc 9 they are non toxic at minute concentrations who specified allowable silver concentration in water as 0 1 mg l 100 ppb 14 compared to conventional disinfection methods the use of agnps and agnws are highly promising since they do not lead to the formation of carcinogenic dbps require less energy free of clogging problem and show high efficiency on a wide range of organisms 15 16 despite of many reported advantages of silver nanosilver use in water disinfection and especially its potential use in pou water disinfection the research on the topic is still in the development stage although there are studies conducted using ag nanomaterials few are specifically conducted with agnws for pou water disinfection purposes 4 12 16 21 studies revealed that agnws have much less environmental toxicity compared to the ag nanostructures of other shapes cubes particles etc 22 23 besides as indicated in the review study of bahcelioglu et al 24 understanding of factors such as flow rate ag concentration microbial concentration etc is highly important to develop an alternative pou water disinfection method it is also indicated that the investigation of ag release from the material is crucial to develop a reliable nanosilver based water disinfection alternative in terms of both the environment and human health studies for which are limited in the literature 24 yet there are some conflicts in literature about the factors affecting the removal efficiency and ag release such as scaffold material ag concentration microbial concentration and flow rate the use of agnw decorated glass fiber agnw gf filters for water disinfection has remained elusive this research aims to develop unique agnw gf filters for the removal of escherichia coli i e e coli from water considering the effect of flow rate e coli concentration and agnw loading and its ag release in detail this research is the first study to fabricate a novel agnw gf filter and to investigate its use for pou water disinfection without any bias it is believed that the results presented in this paper would provide a roadmap for the other researches in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the glass fiber filters gf a grade used in the experiments were obtained from whatmanntm the diameter thickness and

nitrate agno3 and sodium chloride nacl used for agnw synthesis were purchased from sigma aldrich nutrient broth and mueller hinton mh agar used for antibacterial tests were purchased from merck ultra pure water was obtained by milliq water purification system e coli culture which was already isolated from chicken manure was used in the experiments 2 2 synthesis of agnw agnws were synthesized via polyol method as described by coskun et al 25 this process is based on the reduction of an inorganic salt by a polyol at an elevated temperature here ethylene glycol eg was used as both solvent and reducing agent pvp was used as a stabilizing agent and agno3 was used as a ag source following synthesis the agnws were purified by washing several times with ethanol and centrifuging following purification agnws were suspended in ethanol 2 3 fabrication of agnw gf filters for the fabrication of agnw decorated glass fiber filters agnw gf filters a gf filter sheet was coated with agnw via simple dip and dry method first a sheet of clean whatmanntm gf filter with a diameter of 150 mm was cleaned by immersing into absolute ethanol solution within an ultrasonic cleaner for 5 minutes then the gf filters were dried at 120 for 10 min the concentration of agnws in ethanol solution used in fabrication of agnw gf filters was recorded as 0 5 mg ml a cleaned sheet of gf filter was immersed into the diluted agnw solution for 10 min then it was dried at 120 for 10 min this procedure was repeated 4 6 or 10 times in order to obtain different agnw loadings in order to produce control filters bare gf filters with no agnw loading a sheet of gf filters was immersed in only ethanol solution i e containing no agnw and dried under the same conditions 120 10 min prior to the experiments each side of the agnw gf filters and control filters was kept under the uv light for 30 min for both sterilization and removal of residual pvp 2 4 characterization of fabricated agnw gf filters length distribution of synthesized agnw was evaluated via imagej software using scanning electron microscope sem images the optical properties absorption spectra of agnw solutions which were used for coating of gf filters were analyzed by uv visible absorption spectrophotometer hach lange dr39000 over the wavelength range of 320 800 nm concentration of agnw in ethanol solutions was recorded via exstar sii tg dta 7300 in order to understand the structure of the agnw gf filters sem analyses using fei nova nano sem 430 microscope fei hillsboro or were performed a thin gold layer 5 10 nm was deposited onto the fibers prior to sem analysis electrical resistance ohm sq of agnw gf filters was measured at 10 different points on both sides of the agnws gf filters using resistivity probe signatone connected to a keithley 2400 sourcemeter the average values with standard deviations are reported in the corresponding figures and tables in order to understand the exact ag amount i e ag loading decorated on agnw gf filters inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was used 2 5 antibacterial testing the antibacterial performance of agnw gf filters and control gf filters was tested against gram negative e coli e coli is one of the most important indicator organisms and well represents the fecal contamination in water 26 28 in order to investigate antibacterial effect disk diffusion tests and flow tests were conducted mentioned antibacterial tests were conducted in a laminar flow cabinet in order to obtain a sterile environment unless otherwise specified 2 5 1 preparation of standard e coli solution gram negative e coli which was isolated from chicken manure was used for the antibacterial tests to prepare standard e coli solution a colony of e coli cultivated on differential emb agar was added onto a 100 ml of nutrient broth solution autoclaved at 121 for 15 min the suspension was incubated overnight 18 h in a shaker incubator at 37 and 160 rpm 2 5 2 disk diffusion test in order to evaluate the effect of both bacterial concentration and agnw loading on antibacterial performance of the fabricated agnw gf filters disk diffusion tests were initially conducted mh agar medium was poured on plastic sterilized petri dishes and then solidified disk diffusion test was performed by uniformly spreading 100 μl of e coli solution 105 107 and 109 cfu ml over the agar medium in petri dishes one cm diameter of circular bare gf filter piece as control and agnw gf filter pieces with different agnw loadings were placed over the agar gel petri dishes were incubated at 37 for 24 h after the incubation period the diameter of the inhibition zone developed around the pieces was measured with a ruler 2 5 3 flow test in order to investigate e coli removal efficiency of the agnw gf filters from water flow tests were conducted to this purpose circular agnw gf filter pieces with a diameter of 4 cm were placed into gravity filtration unit see figure s1 supplementary file overnight grown e coli solution was initially centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min at 4 then the centrifuge was re suspended with pbs and diluted with ultra pure water milli q water to represent the model contaminated water e coli contaminated water a 100 ml of this model contaminated water was passed through agnw gf filter via gravity filtration unit with constant inflow rate the viable e coli amount in the influent water and effluent water filtrate was counted by spread plate method the removal efficiency was calculated as given in equation 1 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y i n f l u e n t e c o l i c f u m l e f f l u e n t e c o l i c f u m l i n f l u e n t e c o l i c f u m l 100 the effects of flow rate agnw loading and e coli concentration on removal efficiency were investigated via flow tests initially the effect of flow rate was investigated the flow rate resulting in the highest removal efficiency was used in the following flow tests then the optimal agnw loading which results in the highest removal efficiency was determined and used in the following flow tests for determination not only the removal efficiency but also the ag release value is another important factor finally the influent e coli concentration at which the agnw gf filters perform with the highest efficiency was determined all these tests were performed in duplicate and the average values of the results as removal and log removal are reported more details for flow tests are given in the supplementary file table s1 pearson correlation coefficient factors r were calculated to assess the correlation of antibacterial performance of agnw gf filters with flow rate agnw loading and e coli concentration finally the effect of two stage serial filtration with agnw gf filters on e coli removal from water was investigated to this purpose the flow test was conducted with two similar agnw gf filters the model e coli solution was first filtered through an agnw gf filter and then the collected filtrate was passed through a second agnw gf filter in this part of the work as flow rate agnw loading and e coli concentration the predetermined optimum values resulting in the highest removal efficiencies were used 2 6 fixation for sem analysis sem analyses were performed to investigate bacterial attachment on the agnw gf filters after flow tests in order to analyze the agnw gf filters via sem a fixation method mentioned by doganay et al 21 was used this method is known to prevent deformation of the e coli containing filters due to vacuum and voltage applications in this method each agnw gf filter used is initially immersed into a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution in pbs for 30 min which is followed by the immersion into graded ethanol series 60 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol pbs solutions for 10 min each 2 7 silver release analyses in order to investigate the trends in ag release from the agnw gf filters ag release analyses were conducted for the effluents of each flow test performed with different flow rates agnw loadings and e coli concentrations the tests were performed in duplicate and the average values of the results are reported the released ag concentrations were analyzed via icp ms ag release analyses were also conducted to investigate the effects of the filtrate volume on ag release for long term operations one liter of ultra pure water was passed through the agnw gf filter with agnw loading of 9 9 mg g the flow rate was adjusted to 1 ml min filtrate samples were collected at each 100 ml for the analyses 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of agnws and agnw gf filters the morphology and optical properties of agnws were analyzed and shown in fig 1 fig 1 a shows the sem image of agnw based on the sem images agnw length distribution analysis is shown in fig 1 b the average diameter and length of agnws utilized in this work was found as 0 1 μm and 8 1 4 7 μm respectively fig 1 c shows the absorption spectra of agnws in ethanol solution the spectrum has two characteristic absorption peaks at 350 nm and 385 nm these absorption peaks are associated with typical surface plasmon resonance spr of agnws 30 33 the former and latter peaks generally correspond to longitudinal plasmon resonance and transverse plasmon resonance respectively 34 presence of two peaks in the absorption spectrum is due to the low symmetry of the pentagonal cross section of agnws 35 four sheets of agnw gf filters were fabricated f1 f4 for antibacterial tests table 1 gives the electrical resistance values and corresponding agnw loading as mg g and as wt values of agnw gf filters f4 has the highest agnw loading which is 9 9 mg g agnw loading of f1 f2 and f3 were calculated as 0 95 4 5 and 4 8 mg g respectively as expected as agnw loading increases electrical resistance decreases f1 was non conductive since agnws were not percolative fig 2 shows the photos and sem images of both bare gf filters and agnw gf filters agnw decoration onto gfs can be seen in fig 2 d it should be noted that agnws surround the glass fibers and are likely not to affect the pore size and or structure of gfs sem images of each fabricated agnw gf filter f1 f4 are given in figure s2 in the supplementary file 3 2 results of antibacterial testing 3 2 1 disk diffusion tests fig 3 shows the disk diffusion tests results overall the disk diffusion tests results for agnw gf filters indicated that the diameter of inhibition zones were in the range of 1 15 1 35 cm control gf filters did not show any inhibition zone at any of the e coli concentrations studied this reveals that agnw gf filters show antibacterial efficacy on e coli whereas control gf filters does not inhibition zones caused by f1 filter with the lowest agnw loading of 0 95 mg g were observed as 1 20 cm 1 30 cm and 1 35 cm for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml respectively for f2 agnw gf filter with a agnw loading of 4 5 mg g inhibition zone diameters were measured as 1 15 cm 1 20 cm and 1 25 cm for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml respectively for agnw gf filter with a agnw loading of 4 8 mg g f3 for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml inhibition zone diameters were measured as 1 20 cm 1 25 cm and 1 30 cm respectively for agnw gf filter with the highest agnw loading of 9 9 mg g f4 inhibition zone diameters were measured as 1 17 cm 1 25 cm and 1 30 cm for e coli concentrations of 2 61e 09 cfu ml 2 61e 07 cfu ml and 2 61e 05 cfu ml respectively it was observed that the decrease in e coli concentration resulted in an increase in the inhibition zone diameters of all agnw gf filters e coli concentration and inhibition zone diameter for each agnw gf filter were inversely correlated r 0 87 0 95 this inverse correlation was also mentioned in literature 12 36 agnw loading on the other hand might not be affecting the inhibition zone diameters as much as e coli concentration interestingly among agnw gf filters f1 which had the lowest agnw loading showed the highest inhibition zone diameter at equal e coli concentrations correlation between agnw loading and inhibition zone diameters was not remarkable r 0 39 0 44 for all e coli concentrations studied yet hong et al 12 suggests that the higher agnw concentration results in larger inhibition zone diameter on the other hand similar to the current work doganay et al 29 and shameli et al 37 did not find any dependency of inhibition zone diameter on agnw loading it should be noted that disk diffusion test results are highly dependent on physico chemical composition of the agar gel which could influence the ag ion release as well as ion diffusion 38 therefore different agar mediums used in different studies might result in the contradictory results in literature regarding to this there is still a room to reveal the effect of ag concentration and also a potential combined effect of other factors with ag concentration on the disinfection performance investigated via disk diffusion test 3 3 flow tests 3 3 1 effect of flowrate agnw loading and e coli concentration the effects of flow rate agnw loading and influent e coli concentration on e coli removal efficiency for both control gf filters and agnw gf filters are provided in fig 4 the difference between the removal efficiencies of agnw gf filters and corresponding control gf filters observed in all flow tests performed was attributed to both the antibacterial activity of agnw and the potential increase in the filtration capacity of agnw gf filter due to the hydrophobic part of pvp which was discussed below the former was also verified by the disk diffusion test fig 3 fig 4 a shows the changes in the e coli removal efficiencies under different flow rates no significant relation between flow rate and removal efficiency r 0 42 was observed for the control gf filter on the other hand a negative relation between flow rate and removal efficiency for agnw gf filter r 0 86 was observed as flow rate increased from 1 to 2 5 ml min e coli removal efficiency decreased significantly by 23 the further increase in the flow rate from 2 5 to 5 ml min resulted in a slight decrease in removal efficiency only 4 in other words the removal efficiency at 1 ml min was 0 37 log higher almost doubled than the removal efficiency at 2 5 ml min however there was only 0 04 log difference between the removal efficiencies at flow rates of 2 5 ml min and 5 ml min these results revealed that maximum removal efficiency was obtained at the lowest flow rate investigated which was 1 ml min the similar negative relation was reported by hong et al 12 and wen et al 17 in both studies the removal efficiencies decreased almost 0 5 1 log 68 90 at 6 v when flow rate was increased from 2 ml min to 4 ml min the reason behind this situation was not clear and not explained in the literature it might depend on contact time which decreases as flow rate increases less contact time high flow rate would lead to less antibacterial performance fig 4 b shows the changes in e coli removal efficiencies under different agnw loadings disk diffusion tests showed weak correlation between agnw loading and the corresponding antibacterial performance inhibition zone diameters fig 3 on the other hand agnw loading and antibacterial performance were found to be highly correlated in the conducted flow tests as seen in fig 4 b flow tests revealed that e coli removal efficiency might depend on agnw loading of the filters r 0 95 as agnw loading increased e coli removal efficiency also increased among the three agnw gf filters f1 f3 and f4 and agnw loadings tried f4 achieved the highest removal efficiency of 89 0 there are studies explaining the relation between nanosilver concentration and e coli inactivation as a nanosilver concentration dependent manner 8 12 39 zhang et al 2016 observed a 5 fold increase in inactivation of e coli when nanosilver dose increased by 8 fold similarly song et al 8 and hong et al 12 reported an increase in the bactericidal effect of nanosilver containing materials as ag content increased blotting paper impregnated with agnps achieved 4 5 7 5 log removal for contaminated water containing e coli concentration of 109 cfu ml which was directly correlated with ag content of the papers 40 udekwu et al 41 clarify the reason behind this relation as the reduction in ratio of available antimicrobial molecules per target organisms due to the reduced effective antimicrobial concentration this explanation might also clarify the contradiction in the results of disk diffusion tests and flow tests observed in our study flow test due to the nature of the test might result in increased contact area between the microorganism and the agnw while water passes through the agnw filter yet disk diffusion test is limited to disk surface area and ag release around the disks that is a two dimensional effect limited surface contact area would mean less antimicrobial molecules per target organisms which will make it independent of the agnw loading in disk diffusion tests fig 4 c and d show the changes in e coli removal efficiencies of f4 agnw gf filter at different influent e coli concentrations displaying the results only in percent removals as shown in fig 4 c was not descriptive enough to compare the results properly especially for such high influent bacterial concentrations studied since the percent removals were close therefore in order to better examine the changes in removal efficiencies at different influent e coli concentrations removal efficiencies were also expressed in log removal basis fig 4 d similar to the inhibition zones observed in the disk diffusion tests fig 3 removal efficiency of flow tests increased as the influent e coli concentration decreased r 0 88 among all influent e coli concentrations studied in the tests with agnw gf filters the highest removal efficiency 99 0 was achieved at 103 cfu ml hong and his colleagues 12 reported a significant decrease in the antibacterial performance of agnw carbon fiber cloth at e coli concentrations greater than 106 cfu ml tan and colleagues 4 also discussed the concentration dependent results they found a 10 increase in the removal efficiency of e coli when the influent e coli concentration decreased to 103 cfu ml from 105 cfu ml this can be explained by minimum inhibitory concentration mic value mic value depends on bacteria concentration 40 42 as bacteria concentration increases resistance to antibacterial material also increases 42 besides decreasing the concentration of target organism e coli might lead to an increase in ratio of available antimicrobial molecules per target organisms i e effective antimicrobial concentration 41 similar to the agnw gf filters e coli removal efficiency of control gf filters also increased as the influent e coli concentration decreased r 0 98 the highest removal efficiency 61 5 0 41 log removal was also obtained at 103 cfu ml fig 4 c and d however it should be noted that this value is almost 40 lower 1 6 log removal difference than that of its agnw gf filter counterpart besides as influent e coli concentration increased from 103 cfu ml to 108 cfu ml only a 10 reduction in the removal efficiency was seen for agnw gf filter while a 34 reduction was calculated for the control gf filter these results together with the inhibition zone results of control and agnw filters are indicative of both potential antimicrobial effect and improved filtration capacity of the latter sem images of control gf filter and agnw gf filter after a flow test are given in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively it should be noted that fig 5 a and 5 b do not belong to the same filter that is they are not the before and after agnw coating filtration images yet these sem images still confirm the attachment of larger number of cells on agnw gf filter than that of control gf filter and in turn the improved filtration capacity of agnw gf filter as mentioned before the potential increase in filtration capacity of agnw gf filter might be attributed to the presence of pvp on nanowires during agnw coating 41 jiang and teng 43 suggested that hydrophobic part of pvp molecule on agnws enables interaction of agnws with the bacterial cells thus cells attach to the agnw surface the high attachment of bacterial cells on agnw gf filter and the release of silver ions of high concentration near the film surface might cause high toxicity to settled bacterial cells 43 therefore it seems that the hydrophobic part of pvp on agnw not only improves the filtration capacity of agnw gf filters but also its antibacterial performance for settled attached bacteria 3 4 effect of two stage serial filtration finally two stage serial filtration was performed in order to investigate the further improvement on e coli removal efficiency of f4 agnw gf filters at 1 ml min of flow rate and influent e coli concentration of 103 cfu ml results are provided in fig 6 it was observed that log removals were approximately doubled for both control gf and agnw gf filters however the removal efficiency of control gf filters was 0 88 log for the second filtration which was still lower than that of agnw gf filters after the first filtration 1 08 log by two stage serial filtration the removal efficiency increased from 1 08 to 2 12 log removal under optimal conditions agnw gf filters fabricated in this study achieved 2 12 log removal efficiency at most this performance is comparable to the results in the literature agnps attached to a porous carbon foam developed by karumuri et al 44 also achieved 2 log removal for 103 cfu ml e coli concentration schoen et al 16 found less than 1 0 log inactivation for 103 cfu ml e coli concentration at 3 0 v voltage application compared to schoen et al 16 agnw gf filters developed have superior performance over agnw cnt coated cotton filters even without biasing on the other hand agnw pan tpu membrane 4 and pan pani agnw cc 17 achieved 100 removal efficiencies for e coli concentration of 103 105 cfu ml yet this high performance was attributed to the attachment of e coli on the membrane filters i e by filtration due to small pore size 4 17 compared to the literature agnw gf filters fabricated in this study are likely to achieve a promising performance for pou water disinfection 3 5 silver release analyses 3 5 1 silver release in flow tests the amount of ag released to the filtrate will definitely alter the quality of the drinking water who 14 and usepa 45 set that the maximum ag content in drinking water should not be more than 100 ppb to prevent possible negative health effects of ag therefore filtrates collected from each flow test were analyzed in order to investigate the effect of i flow rate ii agnw loading iii e coli concentration and iv two stage serial filtration on ag release from agnw gf filter figure 7 shows the ag release values analyzed in each flow test at all flow tests ag amounts released to the filtrates were below the limit value 100 ppb thus ag release from agnw gf filters to the effluent water was evaluated as safe for drinking water the analyzed average ag release values in the filtrates were found as 47 0 ppb 42 5 ppb and 43 0 ppb at 1 ml min 2 5 ml min and 5 ml min respectively fig 7 a first ag release value decreased by 4 5 ppb when flow rate was increased from 1 ml min to 2 5 ml min then it was mildly increased by 0 5 ppb when the flow rate was further increased to 5 ml min for the synthesis of agnws pvp was used as a stabilizing agent h zhang 46 mentioned less ag release from pvp stabilized agnps however water dissolves pvp 47 therefore the slower flow rates increase the contact time of water with agnw gf filter which would result in more ag release due to pvp dissolution the higher ag release at lower flow rates was also indicated by gemici et al 48 and akhigbe et al 49 on the other hand according to hong et al 12 ag release at 5 ml min would not be expected to be higher than that of at 2 5 ml min agnws on gf filter might have been washed out at 5 ml min flow rate due to the higher velocity and shear effect of water while passing through the agnw gf filters this hypothesis should be investigated kinetically in more detail the effect of agnw loading on ag release is provided in fig 7 b ag release was found to increase with agnw loading r 0 93 similar to what has been reported by hong et al 12 mpenyana monyatsi et al 50 praveena et al 51 and tan et al 4 here the important point is f4 agnw gf filter 9 9 mg g agnw loading with the highest removal efficiency among the others but also the highest ag release 62 5 ppb the more agnw loading might cause the higher ag release than the limit value 100 ppb since the ag release is directly related to the agnw loading therefore not only removal efficiency but also ag release is an important factor to choose the optimal agnw loading besides the more agnw loading means the higher cost of fabrication therefore f4 agnw gf filter no more or no less is the most convenient one in terms of the removal efficiency ag release and the potential cost fig 7 c shows the effect of influent e coli concentration on ag release as seen in the figure the difference between ag release at 103 and 105 cfu ml is negligible on the other hand ag release significantly increased by 46 ppb when influent e coli concentration was increased from 105 to 108 cfu ml quang et al 52 similarly found that ag release is considerably higher when e coli contaminated water is filtered compared to the clean water filtered ag release after filtration of 3 liters of clean water was not detectable while filtering of water contaminated with e coli about 106 cfu ml resulted in 0 01 mg l and 0 17 mg l after treating 0 5 liters and 2 liters water respectively clean water resulted in ag release of 0 04 mg l only after filtration of high volumes of water 12 liters release of ag from agnw gf filters would not only occur during the passage of water through the filters ag might be also entrapped by bacterial cells during percolation of model contaminated water through the filters as suggested by dankovich and gray 40 dankovich and gray 40 found out that half of the ag released to the filtrate was resultant of ag that was absorbed into the cells thus a higher number of bacteria containing water might lead to higher amount of ag released into the filtrate the bacteria that absorb ag and pass through the filters without being captured would result in higher ag release in the filtrate which might be the case for 108 cfu ml e coli concentration where removal efficiency is the lowest among others fig 4 d it should be noted that the researches on ag release were generally conducted with pure water or deionized water without any bacterial contamination therefore the relationship between ag release and bacteria concentration and the mechanism behind should be investigated in detail the amount of ag released in the filtrates of the flow test conducted with two stage serial filtration was also analyzed for both the 1st and 2nd stages the results are presented in fig 8 agnw gf filters used in both stages had similar characteristics yet the increase in the amount of ag release via the application of 2nd stage was only 9 ppb which was less than the amount released after 1st stage 13 ppb this might be due to the removal of e coli concentration after the 1st stage as mentioned earlier the decrease in influent e coli concentration might decrease the ag release after 1st stage filtration 1 08 log removal was achieved fig 7 c thus a decrease in ag release was expected after 2nd stage filtration another reason of the observed decrease in released ag amount might be the 2nd stage agnw gf filter the agnw gf filter at the 2nd stage might act as a barrier via capturing the ag released to the filtrate of 1st stage thus leading to a lower ag amount released 22 ppb than the summation of ag amount released from two agnw gf filters 26 ppb 3 5 2 long term operation a final flow test was conducted in order to investigate the ag release in long term operation fig 9 shows ag release at each 100 ml filtrate and the cumulative ag release as seen in the figure the release rate gradually decreased as volume of filtrate increased until 300 ml of filtrate volume after passing 300 ml of water ag release rate became relatively constant until the end of operation this result was compatible with the studies by quang et al 52 and biswas and bandyopadhyaya 5 quang et al 52 described the higher release rate at the early stages of filtration they suggest that nanosilver which has weak attraction with the substrate materials was likely to release first in this study the cumulative ag release after 1 liter of ultra pure water filtration was 46 7 ppb which was less than half of the limit value 100 ppb ag release is not only important for possible human health issues but also affects the lifespan of the ag containing materials the calculation of the agnw gf filters lifespan was done according to the equation 2 to this purpose the ag analyses results of the flow tests conducted at 1 ml min with agnw loading of 9 9 mg g 0 053 mg cm2 and 103 cfu ml influent e coli concentration were used accordingly the released ag amount from agnw gf filter was 16 4 3 ppb after percolation of 100 ml contaminated water which was equal to only 0 2 of the total ag of the filter it should be noted that the calculated lifespan is the minimum period possible to observe at the given highest ag release rate as seen in fig 9 in long term operation the release rate decreases after filtering 300 ml of water therefore considering the reduction in ag release rate with the increase in volume of the filtrated water the lifespan of the developed agnw gf filter might increase in long term operations after filtration of 300 ml of water through the agnw gf filter the ag amount released after each 100 ml of filtered water decreased to less than 3 3 ppb thus as the ag release rate decreases the lifespan of the agnw gf filter might increase from 42 liters to about 245 liters which is even more than the lifespan of the materials 50 148 liters estimated in literature 4 12 53 2 r e l e a s e o f a g a g r e l e a s e i n 100 m l μ g a v e r a g e a g n w l o a d i n g μ g c m 2 f i l t r a t i o n a r e a c m 2 100 4 conclusion a novel agnw gf filter was fabricated and found to be promising for safe in terms of ag release and highly efficient for pou water disinfection to be used for contaminated natural water in particular for waters with e coli concentration less than 103 cfu ml the agnw gf filters at optimum operating conditions achieved 2 12 log removal for 103 cfu ml e coli contaminated water via two stage serial filtration control gf filter on the other hand achieved only 0 88 log removal for identical conditions there were appreciable differences between antibacterial results of agnw gf filter and control gf filters revealing that the fabricated agnw gf filter removes bacteria not only via filtration but also via antibacterial activity of agnw in order to understand which mechanisms dominate the removal further studies should be conducted ag release from the developed agnw gf filters was found to be below the recommended value of 100 ppb and thus be safe for using drinking water purposes for pou water treatment cost is an important consideration for possible uses of the materials on site 54 especially for undeveloped and developing regions the filtration system with agnw gf filters does not require any power source for filtration but only gravity thus this will lower the treatment cost of pou application compared to the conventional methods however the fabrication cost and corresponding lifetime of agnw gf filters should be investigated and optimized if required considering the high antibacterial performance low ag release amounts and no energy need agnw gf filters have a great potential to be used in undeveloped or developing regions especially in rural areas in order to supply clean water declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13839,the aim of this study was to compared the effect of two plasma gases argon ar and carbon dioxide co2 in the acrylic acid aac grafting modification of a commercial cellulose triacetate cta membrane to improve water flux and anti protein fouling properties in forward osmosis fo for protein recovery application the successful grafting polymerization was evaluated by measuring the grafting yield and water contact angle x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir analysis the contact angle of the cta membrane was decreased from 64 0 to 37 1 and 36 4 by co2 and ar plasma gas treatment respectively which indicated an increase in hydrophilicity the fo experiments were carried out in a lab scale filtration apparatus the effects of interfacial characteristics between membrane surfaces and model protein and polysaccharide foulants on flux decline and reversibility of foulants were compared ar gas was able to provide more free radicals and plasma electrons on the membrane surfaces thus it was more effective than co2 in increasing water flux and also decreased reverse salt flux and fouling tendency the modified membranes had excellent anti protein fouling properties which makes them suitable for protein recovery applications using the ar plasma modified membranes tuna protein was concentrated from 4 5 to 10 7 and excellent maintenance of water flux was achieved keywords cta membrane fo process surface modification grafting polymerization protein adsorption 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is an emerging membrane separation process that operates based on the differences in chemical concentrations or osmotic pressure 1 2 compared to reverse osmosis ro membrane processes fo membrane processes are more advantageous as they exhibit a lower degree of membrane fouling and require significantly lower energy consumption 1 2 numerous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of the fo membrane process for various applications including food processing 3 desalination 4 wastewater treatment 5 and power generation 6 nevertheless fo membranes still suffer from several drawbacks that make them less competitive in comparison to more widely used membrane technologies one of the main disadvantages of fo membrane processes is that it is necessary to use highly concentrated draw solutions that can generate high osmotic pressure which can lead to high salt leakage the fo process could be beneficial for recovering protein from whey protein 7 or tuna processing by products 8 the by products from the tuna canning process is comprised of 4 protein and 0 45 salt globally the market of canned tuna is growing annually at a rate of 2 3 and is forecast to reach up to 4672 4 million us in 2024 9 the fo process is one of many processes including precipitation ion exchange gel filtration chromatography freeze drying spray drying and evaporation that can be used to recover protein from tuna processing by products 8 the protein compounds in tuna processing by products can be recovered and concentrated by up to 9 by fo processes 8 however when 5 51 proteins tuna process by products were in the feed side and 2 m nacl was used as the draw solution the permeate flux of membranes in such processes was low 2 54 l m2 h and tended to decrease due to fouling from soluble organic and inorganic compounds thus fo membranes with greater water flux and less fouling are desired for protein recovery in tuna processing by products one of the techniques used to enhance fo membrane water flux is membrane surface modification increasing surface hydrophilicity can enhance not only membrane water flux but also decrease the propensity for membrane fouling various approaches have been used previously to improve the surface hydrophilicity of fo membranes including surface coating by inorganic nanoparticles 10 grafting with the hydrophilic monomers 11 12 and surface cross linking using hydrophilic polymers 11 among these approaches grafting has been identified as the most effective method grafting with a plasma treatment was also attempted to introduce specific functional groups e g carboxyl groups onto the surface of membranes to enhance the degree of hydrophilicity 12 13 it was demonstrated that lower fouling was experienced upon membrane surface modification plasma grafting polymerization involved activation of gas plasma on the membrane surface substrate with varied energy and exposure time then the activated membrane was exposed to air for a peroxide group to form the monomers formed on the membrane surface were either hydroxyl amine or carboxyl groups 12 in a previous study polydopamine pd coating and polyethylene glycol grafting pd g peg were used to modify cellulose triacetate cta fo membranes to improve their antifouling ability by changing their surface morphology and chemistry 14 layer by layer lbl surface modification using sodium alginate chitosan was also able to limit fouling and biofilm formation on ca membrane surface 15 previous studies 12 16 have used acrylic acid aac for membrane surface modification and positive features that could improve surface hydrophilicity due to a significant amount of carboxyl groups that was created on the membrane surface were reported generally the plasma process for modifying membrane surfaces is divided into two types depending on the plasma gas used the first type is non polymerizing plasma or plasma treatment typical gases such as argon ar carbon tetrachloride ccl4 nitrogen n2 helium he oxygen o2 and carbon dioxide co2 are utilized for plasma treatment the other type is polymerizing plasma or plasma polymerization with monomers like aac allylamine polyethylene glycol peg and vinyl acetic acid the plasma polymerization can create a thin solid polymer film on the substrate membranes with hydrophilic grafting materials containing carboxyl and amine functional groups which is ideal to improve the antifouling characteristic of membranes 12 overall reviewing these previous studies indicates a potential approach of using aac plasma polymerization with different type of plasma gases for fo membrane surface modification to improve the membrane properties the aim of this study was to compared the effect of two plasma gases ar and co2 in the aac grafting modification of a commercial cta membrane to improve water flux and anti protein fouling properties for tuna protein recovery application the membrane surfaces were characterized for surface hydrophilicity surface topology and chemical composition in addition to the performance of the membrane in term of water flux and reverse salt flux flux decline and fouling reversibility was investigated throughout with model foulants then the performance of the membranes was evaluated with tuna processing by products obtained from real scale tuna canning factory the modified membrane developed herein achieved greater protein recovery while still maintaining its low fouling properties thus has a potential to become a sustainable alternative for protein recovery in the tuna canning industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 plasma grafting polymerization the cellulose triacetate cta membrane used in this study was obtained from hti albany or usa the direct current dc plasma treatment was carried out following the method reported in the work by hidzir et al 11 primarily the pristine cta membrane was placed on a glass plate using double sided cellophane tape exposing the membrane to the atmosphere at room temperature 25 0 5 c then the plasma induced graft polymerization process was conducted using either co2 or ar gas in a plasma reactor at different exposure times 5 20 s the optimum plasma treatment condition of co2 and ar was previously determined to be 20 w and 0 25 mbar 1 after the plasma treatment the membrane was exposed to ambient air for 30 min for the peroxide to form then was immersed in a 10 w v acrylic acid aac solution at 60 c for 30 min the sample was then soaked in 50 ml of methanol at 50 c and stirring was performed for 60 min 11 finally the membrane samples were rinsed with deionized di water and dried overnight the pristine cta membrane sample was named untreated while aac co2 and aac ar corresponded to the cta membranes treated by aac grafting with co2 and ar gas respectively 2 2 characterizations of the modified membranes surface hydrophilicity of the membranes before and after plasma grafting polymerization was measured using sessile drop observation for each measurement the contact angle was calculated from an average of ten different locations of one microliter sessile drops of water on the 0 5 0 5 cm2 membrane surface specific functional groups of membranes were analyzed by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir tensor 27 bruker us the surface chemical compositions of the membrane samples were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra dld krotos analytical ltd uk surface topology and roughness of the samples were obtained using an atomic force microscope afm nanosurfeasyscan2 switzerland afm measurement was performed in a non contact mode and the average root mean square rms roughness was calculated from five different measurements from different locations plasma graft yield was determined from the initial and final weight of the samples the grafting yield gy can be defined with the following expression 17 1 g y w a w b a where w a and w b are weights of the pristine and the modified membranes respectively and a is the area of the membrane sample 2 3 evaluation of membrane performance to evaluate the performance of the untreated and modified fo membranes water and salt permeability coefficients water flux and reverse salt flux were determined the water permeability coefficient a lm 2 h 1 bar 1 referred to lmh bar 1 and the salt permeability coefficient b lm 2 h 1 referred to lmh were determined in ro mode di water and 10 mm nacl solution were used as feed to determine the water permeability and salt permeability coefficients respectively 18 19 the water permeability coefficient a was calculated using the following equation 2 a j w δ p where a corresponds to the water permeability coefficient lmh bar 1 jw is the volumetric flux of permeate water lmh and δp bar corresponds to the difference in operating pressure across the membrane respectively the salt permeability coefficient b lmh was calculated using the following equation 3 b a δ p δ π 1 r r where r is salt rejection and δπ bar corresponds to the difference in osmotic pressure across the membrane the lab scale fo apparatus used in this study is illustrated in fig 1 the membrane channel had a dimension of 20 10 0 3 cm3 length width depth the effective membrane surface area was 0 02 m2 for fo experiments to determine water flux jw lmh and reverse salt flux rsf js distilled water was used as a feed solution fs and 2 m nacl solution purity 99 9 ajax finechem pty ltd australia was used as a draw solution ds the velocities of fs and ds were kept constant at 100 ml min in a co current mode using two separate peristaltic pumps eyela mp 3 n japan jw lmh was determined based on the volume of permeate using digital weight balance and gf 3000 japan and was calculated according to the following equation 4 j w w ρ a t where w l is the volume of permeate at time t h ρ unitless is relative density and a m2 corresponds to membrane surface area js gm 2 h 1 referred to gmh was obtained from conductivity measurement with a conductivity meter mettler inpro7100 and volume of feed side at the beginning and the end of the experiments js can be calculated using the following equation as presented in a previous study 20 5 j s c f v f c i v i a t where ci and cf g l are the initial and final salt concentrations of the feed solution vi and vf l are the initial and final volumes of the feed solution and t h is the time interval during the experiments 2 4 fo experiments and fouling behavior investigation the fouling behavior observed on the membranes was investigated in terms of permeate flux decline foulant reversibility and protein absorption flux decline of the membranes was evaluated according to a previously reported protocol 21 with minor modifications bovine serum albumin bsa purity 98 sigma aldrich and sodium alginate sigma aldrich chemie gmbh uk were selected as model foulants to represent fouling from proteins and polysaccharides respectively as the membrane was modified for use with tuna protein concentrations in mind fouling from humic substances and metal ions were not evaluated an aqueous solution containing 1 g l of either bsa or sodium alginate was used as feed solutions of the fo membrane at a constant pressure of 0 3 kpa and permeate water flux jw was monitored and recorded over time fouling behavior was investigated in the multi cycle fo filtration experiments following protocols previously described by maknakorn et al 20 fo experiments were operated for 3 cycles consecutively at the end of the first cycle when a normalized permeate flux jw jo reached 0 5 8 the fouled membrane was flushed on both sides using di water then at the end of the second cycle a chemical cleaning using 1 citric acid followed by 0 5 naoh was performed each step of cleaning lasted 30 min with a controlled velocity of 0 07 m s at both sides of the membrane after each cleaning procedure the jw of the cleaned membranes were measured in order to determine flux recovery efficacy the resistance in the series model 8 14 22 was used to investigate fouling characteristics and to quantify the degree of fouling total resistance rt can be expressed as 6 r t r m r r e r i r r e δ p μ j w where δp is transmembrane pressure kpa and μ is the viscosity of water pa s rm m 1 is defined as the sum of the intrinsic resistance of the pristine membrane and internal concentration polarization of draw solution rre and rirre are defined as physically reversible and irreversible fouling resistances respectively after the membranes were physically cleaned jw was again obtained then rre could be calculated by subtracting the remaining rm and physically irreversible fouling resistance rirre from total fouling resistance the protein adsorption experiments were conducted using the method described by zhao and chen 23 using bsa as a model protein foulant the untreated and modified membranes each had the same area of 3 6 cm2 were both submerged into anhydrous ethanol followed by a 0 9 nacl solution for 30 min then the membranes were exposed to a 0 5 mg ml bsa solution in a volume of 3 ml in a shaker incubator at 25 c for 22 h the membranes with protein adsorbed on the surfaces were dried at room temperature for 24 h the concentration of bsa solutions before and after membrane adsorption test was measured using the lowry method using a uv spectrophotometer at 750 nm the amount of protein adsorbed on the membranes was determined by the difference in protein concentrations in the solutions before and after the experiment 23 and the weight of protein gained on the membrane after the experiments 17 the performance in protein recovery and fouling behavior of the membranes were also evaluated with a lab scale fo apparatus using tuna processing by products as fs and 2 m nacl as ds 200 l of tuna processing by products as in tuna cooking juice were obtained from a tuna canning factory in hat yai thailand tuna cooking juice contains proteins in a group of sarcoplasmic protein which is water soluble and can be hydrolyzed to peptides 24 coarse materials were removed by fabric filter then the samples were kept frozen at 20 c then thawed to 25 1 c before the fo filtration experiments the tuna solution had a ph of 5 79 chemical oxygen demand cod of 23 280 mg l and a protein concentration of 4 5 as bsa measured by lowry method using bsa as a protein standard the fo filtration experiments for tuna protein recovery were conducted under the same protocol with bsa and alginate filtration experiments the protein concentration of the solution was measured every 30 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characteristic 3 1 1 membrane surface hydrophilicity surface contact angles of the cta membranes treated by co2 aac co2 and ar aac ar were measured at different exposure times fig 2 without plasma treatment exposure time 0 s untreated cta membrane untreated exhibited low hydrophilicity with the water contact angle of 64 0 which corresponds with previous research 22 25 reporting cta membranes in the range of 63 91 after 10 s plasma exposure time the contact angle of aac co2 and aac ar membranes decreased to 37 14 and 36 44 respectively statistical t tests were conducted to compare contact angles of aac co2 and aac ar membranes at each exposure time the results indicate that aac ar membranes exhibited higher hydrophilic properties lower contact angle compared to aac co2 membranes p value always 0 05 the greater hydrophilicity of aac ar membranes was due to an inert characteristic of ar gas which obtains more free polar radicals for reactions on the membrane surface compared to co2 gas the decreased contact angle suggests that high surface hydrophilicity of cta membranes can be achieved with plasma induced graft polymerization process using ar gas the decreased contact angle by the ar gas could be explained by higher negative ion capacity of ar thus higher activity at the membrane surface compared to co2 ar is an inert gas whereas co2 is considered an oxidative gas inert gas plasma can significantly enhance membrane hydrophilicity by etching polar peroxide functional groups after treatment and oxygen exposure as an oxidative gas co2 plasma changed the physical structure of the membrane by enlarging the pore size for hydrophilicity enhance 26 moreover ionization energy of ar is greater than that of co2 27 thus membranes treated with ar plasma showed greater hydrophilicity with a lower contact angle by prolonging plasma treatment longer than 10 s the contact angle of the modified membrane increased this behavior was previously observed by khongnakorn et al 1 and sem image showed that higher power discharge and longer plasma exposure time could destroy etch and crack the membrane surfaces liu et al 28 also reported that cta membrane surfaces were damaged after gamma ray irradiation as the membrane surface layer was cracked and peeled off its support layer the results in fig 2 indicate that increasing exposure time did not always result in increasing in hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces hence the optimum exposure time of the plasma grafting process was determined to be 10 s and cta membranes treated at this exposure time were selected for further experiments plasma grafting yield gy of both aac co2 and aac ar membranes increased during 5 10 s of exposure time fig 3 gy of the aac ar membrane was always higher than that of the aac co2 membrane for the aac ar membrane gy at 5 and 10 s were 12 43 and 12 66 μg cm2 respectively however prolonging plasma exposure time to 15 and 20 s resulted in a slight decrease in gy of the two membranes an increase in aac gy was due to an increase in the degree of polymerization of grafted chains with a longer treatment time which also explained the higher hydrophilicity of the plasma treated membrane 17 gy depends on exposure time monomer type and monomer content type of plasma gas and membrane materials 29 30 various gy values were reported in previous studies for example gy of of 88 and 203 μg cm2 was reported for carboxybetaine polymers grafted onto polyethylene microfiltration mf membranes 30 and gy of 20 150 μg cm2 was found for poly lysine methacrylamide grafted pvdf mf membrane 29 we found that gy of the modified membranes increased and reached the equilibrium at 5 s and no increase was observed after this point a similar behavior has been reported in the grafting of the n hydroxymethyl acrylamide hmaam onto poly ethylene terephthalate pet fibers 31 membranes with high gy exhibited higher hydrophilicity and enhanced anti protein fouling properties 17 29 30 however increasing in gy could lead to a formation of polymerized layer on the top layer of the membranes which would impact the layer thickness and consequently water flux 32 compared to previous studies gy observed in this study was lower as we used different monomer and shorter exposure time on different type of membrane material the modified membranes will be evaluated for its protein adsorption and fouling propensity in section 3 3 3 1 2 membrane surface chemistry functional groups of membranes before and after 10 s plasma grafting polymerization treatment were investigated using ftir atr and the results are shown in fig 4 the untreated membrane displayed strong peak bands at 1042 1233 1742 and 3371 cm 1 which are corresponded to co stretching cco stretching co stretching and oh stretching respectively the peaks appeared between 3100 cm 1 and 3600 cm 1 were previously determined as carboxylic acid oh stretching vibration for the cta membrane 28 upon plasma grafting with ar gas the aac ar membrane showed strong peak bands of carboxylic group including oh bond at 3472 cm 1 and co stretching 1734 cm 1 1 among the three membranes investigated the greatest intensity of the oh functional group on the membrane surfaces was observed in the aac ar membrane which indicated that peroxide groups were formed on the membrane surfaces with the plasma treatment and the exposure to the atmosphere the presence of the oh functional group suggested that the grafting and polymerization reactions could be achieved more effectively on the aac ar membranes compared to the aac co2 membranes the ar plasma treatment created free radicals a few nanometers on the membrane surface subsequently hydroxyl functional groups were formed once the surfaces were exposed to the atmosphere the increase in the intensity of the hydroxyl oh and carboxyl groups co indicated the successful aac grafting on the cta membrane which led to the formation of free radicals such as cooh and oh functional groups 27 28 increased adhesion of o2 which generated carboxyl groups and carboxylic acid on cta membrane surfaces was attributed to the degree of the hydrogen bond in the co cco and co groups the chemical information of the membrane surfaces were further investigated using xps survey the xps wide scan spectra showed binding energy of c1s and o1s was detected at 279 and 532 ev respectively fig 5 a c1s peaks presented at lower intensity than o1s peaks in both untreated and modified membranes and was consistent with previous studies 26 28 33 for the modified membrane samples the binding energy of c1s and o1s was lower than that of untreated membranes but no significant differences in binding energy was observed between the aac co2 and aac ar membranes fig 5b illustrates high resolution c1s spectrum of the untreated membrane spectral deconvolution was performed according to a method outlined in a previous study 34 peaks corresponding to cc coc co and oco had binding energy of 284 9 286 1 287 4 and 288 5 ev respectively after aac grafting polymerization shifting in the binding energy from their original positions was observed cc 284 8 ev coc 286 7 ev co 287 9 ev and oco 289 2 ev the shifting to the higher binding energy regions of oco bond in modified membranes indicated a strong interaction of c and o in polymer molecules as a greater amount of energy was required for bonds breakage using an x ray beam from xps spectra overall xps results confirmed that surface modification occurred on membranes with plasma aac grafting polymerization which is consistent with the ftir results discussed above the changing of binding energy of co and oco groups resulted in increases in hydrophilic functional groups for modified membranes thus ar plasma treatment with aac grafting on the cta membrane successfully increased hydrophilic bonding by forming chemical functional groups such as cooh and oh 27 28 the hydrophilicity of the membrane could be changed by bonding interactions with plasma gas and increasing functional groups by the monomers used this was contrary to the findings of liu et al 28 who found no significant surface changes and the appearance of no new bonds after gamma radiation on cta membranes the difference between our results and a previous study indicated that the degree of relative intensity of major absorption bands depended on the type of plasma gas and monomers used 3 1 3 membrane surface roughness the 3d afm images showing the surface topology of untreated and modified cta membranes are presented in fig 6 the roughness profile showed that the untreated membrane had a significantly smoother surface than the plasma treated membranes the root mean square rms roughness which gives an indication of the mean roughness over an area of a membrane 35 was calculated as an average of five different points for grafted membranes the roughness of surface increased as in rms values of 8 702 nm 13 085 nm and 17 693 nm for the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes respectively the increase of surface roughness of plasma grafting membranes could be explained by the degradation of the plasma gas ions and electrons on the surface that could react with the free radicals of aac monomers to produce a poly acrylic acid paa coating on the membrane surfaces this result corresponded with a previous study 14 reporting the roughness of polydopamine pd modified cta fo membranes increased after modification with pd coating and poly ethylene glycol peg grafting due to the nodular structure produced by the self polymerization of dopamine on the membrane surfaces moreover the aac ar membrane had 25 greater in rms roughness compared with the aac co2 membrane this greater roughness could be explained by the interaction between the membrane surface and lower electron density from the ar plasma which replaced ions more effectively than the co2 plasma 28 huang et al 36 also observed that for the hydrophilic surfaces the water contact angle of the surface decreases with increasing surface roughness the greater roughness aac ar membrane can also be seen in the morphology analysis of the membranes using scanning electron microscopy sem fig s1 supporting materials the rougher surfaces of aac ar membrane corresponded to higher gy and greater hydrophilicity smaller contact angle consistent with a previous study 32 in addition to the increase in hydrophilicity caused by the chemical functional groups of plasma grafted membranes the increase in surface roughness after treatment can also have a positive impact on membrane fouling minimization as reported in previous studies 34 37 the fouling propensity of the untreated and modified membranes will be discussed in section 3 3 3 2 intrinsic propertied of modified fo membranes filtration experiments on the untreated and modified membranes were conducted in ro mode using di water and 10 mm nacl as feed solutions to determine the water permeability coefficient a and salt permeability coefficient b the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes had a of 0 74 1 32 and 1 76 lmh bar 1 respectively and b of 0 87 0 85 and 0 85 lmh respectively it can be seen that compared to the untreated membrane the water permeability coefficient of grafted membrane had significantly increased but no significant difference in salt permeability coefficient was observed the modification process of plasma grafting polymerization only occurred in the active layer thus only effected the water permeabilty of the membrane moreover the b a ratio was calculated as a parameter to determine the selectivity of the membranes a low b a ratio was observed in the aac ar membranes indicating higher selectivity lower fouling tendency and stability in membrane operation 14 this finding was consistent with previous studies stating that gratfing process could enhance the selectivity of both cta and tfc membranes 25 38 the water flux jw and the reverse salt flux rsf referred to js of the untreated and the modified membranes were evaluated under fo mode using 2 m nacl as a draw solution using di water as a feed solution jw of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were 6 11 7 56 and 8 12 lmh respectively fig 7 a the greater jw obtained for modified membranes in the fo mode was similar to results obtained in previous experiments under the ro mode similarly jw of modified membranes was also higher than that of the untreated membrane when the bsa solution was used as a feed solution compared to the untreated membrane jw obtained for the aac co2 and aac ar membranes increased by 23 and 30 respectively however bsa filtration experiments resulted in lower jw than that in di water filtration experiments which was attributed to the smaller in the difference in osmotic pressure between bsa and the draw solution the reverse salt flux js in the fo process not only reduces jw but also increases the cost of draw solute replenishment as shown in fig 7b js of the membranes decreased with plasma grafting polymerization using di water as a feed solution the js of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were 3 88 2 78 2 65 gmh respectively the results indicate that the grafting polymerization with aac resulted in greater rejection and lower js due to the deposit of aac which might reduce the pore size of the support layer of the membranes causing salt passage through the membrane to be restricted the untreated fo membranes suffered from an internal concentration polarization icp where the draw concentration was diluted by water permeating through the support at the inner side of the active layer 39 the icp caused a reduction of the effective osmotic driving force thus reducing the performance of the fo process by filling the pores of the support layer with aac grafting the effect of icp was minimized freger et al 40 also reported that the monomer from grafting polymerization could penetrate through the active layer of nf polyamide membranes accordingly pores of the support layer were filled by the grafted polymer overall grafting membranes with plasma could enhance jw and minimize js simultaneously which increases the performance of fo process 3 3 fouling propensity of modified fo membranes the fo filtration experiments were conducted to evaluate the fouling propensity of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes using a model protein 1 g l bsa and a model polysaccharide 1 g l sodium alginate solutions fig 8 a and b illustrate normalized flux decline jw jo of the membranes in three filtration cycles of bsa and alginate filtration experiments respectively the filtration experiments were operated continuously until jw jo decreased to 0 5 i e 1200 min and 640 min for bsa and alginate experiments respectively then physical cleaning with di water flushing was conducted the filtration experiments were continued in the second cycle for another 300 460 min until significant flux decline was observed then chemical cleaning with 1 citric acid and subsequently 0 5 naoh were performed for these filtration experiments steep flux decline behavior was observed for the untreated membrane indicating a severe degree of fouling the degree of fouling observed was moderate for the aac co2 membranes while the aac ar membrane was found to have the lowest fouling propensity among the three membranes tested during the first 300 min of bsa filtration experiments fig 8a the permeate flux of the three membrane slowly decreased and approximately 15 flux decline was observed after that the permeate flux decreased rapidly after 1200 min of filtration flux decline observed for the untreated the aac co2 and the aac ar membranes was 55 50 and 36 respectively at the end of the first cycle flux recovery achieved by di water flushing was 85 87 and 89 for the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes respectively the high flux recovery rate by di water flushing suggested that the majority of fouling occurring during bsa filtrations was physically reversible however when the second cycle experiments were continued a rapid flux decline was observed within 460 min of the second cycle filtration the normalized flux of the three membranes decreased to 65 70 thus chemical cleaning was performed the chemical cleaning achieved nearly 100 flux recovery for the three membranes tested indicating that bsa fouling was chemically reversible it was noted that fouling occurred more rapidly in the second cycle of filtration experiments after di flushing suggesting that not all of the foulants were able to be removed physical cleaning leading to the faster formation of a fouling layer on the membrane surfaces comparing the model protein to the model polysaccharide the fouling caused by bsa filtration was less severe than that by alginate filtration during the bsa filtration experiments the operating pressure in the system was always less than 0 3 kpa also the majority of bsa fouling could be removed by physical sheer force from di flushing which indicated that bsa formed a loose fouling layer on the membrane surfaces previous literature has also reported that the fouling layer in the fo process was less compact and easier to remove by physical cleaning than that in the pressure driven membrane process 41 moreover less bsa fouling observed on aac co2 and aac ar membranes was linked to the greater hydrophilicity of membranes after grafting polymerization the hydrophilic modified membranes were less prone to absorb bsa proteins as suggested by wavhal fisher 17 throughout 37 h of bsa filtration experiments modified membranes showed a promising fouling resistant property compared to the untreated membrane thus changes in chemical properties of the membrane surface by grafting plasma polymerization resulted in less protein fouling propensity li et al 14 also reported that membrane surface modification could improve the anti adhesion properties for both proteins and polysaccharides fouling on the other hand alginate filtration experiments resulted in a more severe flux decline fig 8b thus each alginate filtration cycle was shorter than that of bsa filtration experiments physical cleaning was performed after 660 min of filtration as the permeate flux decreased to 20 35 of the initial flux the permeate flux recovered by di water flushing was 83 87 and 88 for the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes respectively at the end of the second cycle of filtration flux recovery of 100 was achieved by chemical cleaning despite causing more severe flux decline than bsa a majority of alginate fouling was also physically reversible also chemical cleaning was effective to remove both bsa and alginate fouling the lower fouling propensity observed in bsa filtration experiments can be explained by an increase in hydrophilicity that prevented or retarded the electrostatic van der waals force and hydrate interaction between proteins and the membrane surfaces 35 severe fouling during alginate filtration was attributed to the accumulation of alginate molecules and na ions at the valleys of the membrane surface where water permeates through resulting in an increased concentration of alginate and subsequently a formation of a gel layer with high hydraulic resistance this phenomenon is called concentrative external concentration polarization ecp 42 and is important to systems operating with high permeation flux 39 in order to evaluate the reversibility of the fouling the resistance in series was calculated from flux data and shown in fig 8c the pristine membrane has a resistance rm of 1 53 1011 m 1 rm of the aac co2 and aac ar membranes was 2 81 and 8 81 lower than the untreated virgin membrane the lower rm of the aac ar membrane corresponded with the greater hydrophilicity i e smaller contact angle of the ar gas plasma treated membrane as evaluated in section 3 1 1 lower rm indicates better performance of the membranes after plasma grafting polymerization due to i the thinner active layer and ii the higher selectivity of membrane surfaces as indicated by a low b a ratio value even though total fouling resistance rf from alginate fouling was greater than that from bsa fouling the majority of both bsa and alginate fouling were reversible rre accounted for 73 83 and 87 92 of rf in bsa and alginate fouling respectively the high reversibility of fouling in fo mode was previously attributed to the less compact fouling layer formed on the membrane surface due to the low hydraulic pressure applied in the fo system 40 41 in the case of reversible fouling caused by bsa filtration the lowest levels of rre of 6 87 1010 m 1 were observed in aac ar membrane which was 58 lower than the rre of the untreated membrane the lower rre observed in the aac ar membrane corresponds with an increase in hydrophilicity thus the membrane surface was less likely to absorb amphiphilic compounds like bsa 33 the effect of the plasma grafting was less pronounced on the irreversible fouling caused by bsa filtration rirre of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were 3 21 1010 2 24 1010 and 2 57 1010 m 1 respectively it should be noted that for bsa filtration the rm accounted for 44 60 of total resistance rt these results were similar to those found by li et al 14 who reported that the rm under fo mode was about half of the rt in contrast to the conventional ro filtration in which the rm only accounted for a small fraction of the rt 43 similar to the results from the bsa filtration experiments the lowest rre from alginate fouling was also observed in the aac ar membrane 2 66 1011 m 1 followed by that in the aac co2 membrane 4 19 1011 m 1 and the highest rre was observed in the untreated membrane 6 81 1011 m 1 while the rirre observed was the highest in the untreated membrane no significant difference was observed between the rirre of aac ar and aac co2 membranes thus the plasma grafting process could reduce the formation of both reversible and irreversible fouling ar plasma was more effective than co2 plasma for anti adhesion properties of reversible fouling from both proteins and polysaccharides however the effect of plasma gas type was marginal on irreversible fouling for the same type of membrane the total fouling resistance caused by alginate filtration was more than three times of that caused by bsa filtration these results may be attributed to 44 the difference in the fouling mechanism of bsa and alginate the increase in rirre indicated that flux decline during alginate filtration was not only caused by cake layer formation but also by internal poor blocking 14 the molecular weight mw of sodium alginate 300 kda is greater than that of bsa 66 5 kda the severe flux decline by alginate seems to correspond to the mws and the solution viscosity because a larger molecular size likely reduces more the shear force associated with the feed crossflow velocity 44 a previous study also reported that alginate caused significant flux decline in fo filtration systems due to the formation of a gel layer that hindered back diffusion of the colloid and gave rise to ecp 45 lower flux decline by bsa can be attributed to the salting in and or salting out effects for proteins 46 since bsa was in a salinity rich environment due to the salt reverse flux salting in and or out effects could lead to structural deformation of bsa fouling layer such effects allows the bsa fouling layer to be easily removed from the membrane surface by shear force and physical cleaning 47 it can be concluded that cta membranes with plasma grafting polymerization with aac had the best anti adhesion properties for proteins but such properties were less pronounced for polysaccharides applications this study aimed to modify fo membranes to increase protein recovery from tuna processing by products which is comprised mainly of proteins the protein content of tuna cooking juice ranged from 4 to 9 8 so enhancing the fo membrane performance to control protein absorption was desirable in this application the membrane surfaces with the anti protein adsorption properties played a major role in the anti fouling performance during protein filtration the 22 hr static protein adsorption experiments were conducted using a bsa solution the protein absorption of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were found to be 21 7 9 3 and 8 7 μg cm2 respectively the bsa adsorption measured on these modified membranes was lower than values 23 45 μg cm2 in 24 h reported in a previous study using polyethylene membrane 30 which suggests an effectiveness of grafting polymerization of anti protein fouling property despite the rougher surfaces of the modified membranes protein absorption decreased after plasma grafting polymerization hence the degree of hydrophilicity was not correlated to the surface roughness of fo membranes this result suggests that the ability of the grafted polymer to block the adsorption sites on the grafting surface had a strong positive impact to control protein adsorption our findings are similar to a previous study 35 in which the commercial ro tfc membrane was modified by plasma polymerization using triethylene glycol dimethyl ether triglyme increasing the hydrophilicity with the addition of cooh oh functional groups together with adsorption sites blocking by grafting polymerization resulted in the lower protein absorption thus the organic fouling propensity was decreased many studies have also observed that the gy of the hydrophilic monomer was correlated with the degree of hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces and that hydrophilic surfaces were less prone to protein fouling 16 48 even though different grafting monomers were used overall the results of this study indicated that plasma grafting is a promising treatment to increase the performance of cta fo membranes increasing in jw decreasing in js and improving in anti fouling ability were achieved after the membrane was modified as the physical and chemical properties of membrane surfaces were changed it is also illustrated that the interaction between foulants and membrane surfaces were improved as protein foulants were effectively removed from the modified membrane surfaces with only physical cleaning as the aac ar membrane achieved higher performance than the aac co2 membrane only the aac ar membrane was further tested in the tuna protein recovery experiments the fo water flux as a function of filtration time during tuna protein recovery experiments is presented in fig 9 a the initial jw of the untreated and ar aac membranes was 4 80 and 5 76 lmh respectively after 300 min of continuous filtration the jw values decreased to 36 and 45 of the original jw respectively compared to the untreated membrane the ar aac membrane showed a significant improvement in the ability to maintain higher jw throughout the time period of the experiments hence the surface modification process has shown a clear improvement in membrane anti protein fouling performance this flux loss during tuna protein recovery was probably caused by the effect of ecp of foulant particles and the formation of a gel layer comprised of gelatin fish skin and fish meat on the membrane surfaces 7 at the end of the filtration cycle the fouled membranes were physically cleaned and foulant reversibility was investigated rf caused by the tuna cooking juice filtration with the untreated and aac ar membranes was 5 48 1011 and 3 31 1011 m 1 respectively we also observed higher fouling layer reversibility in the modified membrane than the untreated membrane the flux recovery achieved by physical cleaning was 84 for the aac ar membrane while only 82 was achieved for the untreated membrane for the two membranes studied flux recovery achieved by chemical cleaning was 100 thus the increase in hydrophilicity of the membrane through surface modification not only reduced fouling propensity but also improve interactions between proteins and the membrane surfaces as protein foulants were removed easily from the modified membrane surfaces after di flushing the initial protein concentration of the tuna cooking juice was 4 5 w v and it was increased to 9 48 and 10 71 for the untreated and ar aac membranes after 300 min of fo filtration fig 9b the tuna protein recovery of 76 43 was achieved by the ar aac membrane the desirable protein concentration of the concentrated solutions ranged between 10 15 49 or 5 g l 50 for commercially viable bioactive ingredient overall the tuna protein recovery experiments revealed that the ar plasma modified membrane achieved excellent maintenance of jw with greater protein recovery suggesting that the surface modification process for cta fo membranes has the potential to become a sustainable alternative for protein recovery in the tuna canning industry 4 conclusions a commercial cta membrane was modified by aac via a plasma grafting polymerization process to minimize the protein fouling tendency the following conclusions were drawn from the above study for the two plasma gases studied ar was more effective than co2 in decreasing the water contact angle of the pristine cta membrane thus enhancing hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces the membrane chemical composition analysis revealed that the hydrophilicity was increased owing to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups such as carboxyl oco and cooh compared to the untreated membrane the modified membrane had greater selectivity and water flux but lower reverse salt flux and intrinsic membrane resistance rm which enhanced the performance of the membranes in fo applications the effects of fouling caused by two types of model foulants protein and polysaccharide were compared in the fo filtration experiments the modified membranes were more suitable for protein filtration as an excellent anti protein fouling property was observed the plasma grafting polymerization could improve the performance of cta fo membranes by increasing water flux and minimizing protein fouling the interfacial characteristics between membrane surfaces and foulants were also improved as a majority of the protein fouling observed was reversible the modified membrane also achieved an excellent maintenance of flux during tuna protein recovery application overall this study presented the plasma polymerization with an efficient grafting gas that can be easily employed to modify commercial fo membranes to improve water flux and anti protein fouling properties while still maintaining its low fouling properties the modified membrane developed herein could concentrate protein from tuna cooking juice to higher than 10 which is a desirable concentration for commercially viable products declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments the work was

13839,the aim of this study was to compared the effect of two plasma gases argon ar and carbon dioxide co2 in the acrylic acid aac grafting modification of a commercial cellulose triacetate cta membrane to improve water flux and anti protein fouling properties in forward osmosis fo for protein recovery application the successful grafting polymerization was evaluated by measuring the grafting yield and water contact angle x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir analysis the contact angle of the cta membrane was decreased from 64 0 to 37 1 and 36 4 by co2 and ar plasma gas treatment respectively which indicated an increase in hydrophilicity the fo experiments were carried out in a lab scale filtration apparatus the effects of interfacial characteristics between membrane surfaces and model protein and polysaccharide foulants on flux decline and reversibility of foulants were compared ar gas was able to provide more free radicals and plasma electrons on the membrane surfaces thus it was more effective than co2 in increasing water flux and also decreased reverse salt flux and fouling tendency the modified membranes had excellent anti protein fouling properties which makes them suitable for protein recovery applications using the ar plasma modified membranes tuna protein was concentrated from 4 5 to 10 7 and excellent maintenance of water flux was achieved keywords cta membrane fo process surface modification grafting polymerization protein adsorption 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is an emerging membrane separation process that operates based on the differences in chemical concentrations or osmotic pressure 1 2 compared to reverse osmosis ro membrane processes fo membrane processes are more advantageous as they exhibit a lower degree of membrane fouling and require significantly lower energy consumption 1 2 numerous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of the fo membrane process for various applications including food processing 3 desalination 4 wastewater treatment 5 and power generation 6 nevertheless fo membranes still suffer from several drawbacks that make them less competitive in comparison to more widely used membrane technologies one of the main disadvantages of fo membrane processes is that it is necessary to use highly concentrated draw solutions that can generate high osmotic pressure which can lead to high salt leakage the fo process could be beneficial for recovering protein from whey protein 7 or tuna processing by products 8 the by products from the tuna canning process is comprised of 4 protein and 0 45 salt globally the market of canned tuna is growing annually at a rate of 2 3 and is forecast to reach up to 4672 4 million us in 2024 9 the fo process is one of many processes including precipitation ion exchange gel filtration chromatography freeze drying spray drying and evaporation that can be used to recover protein from tuna processing by products 8 the protein compounds in tuna processing by products can be recovered and concentrated by up to 9 by fo processes 8 however when 5 51 proteins tuna process by products were in the feed side and 2 m nacl was used as the draw solution the permeate flux of membranes in such processes was low 2 54 l m2 h and tended to decrease due to fouling from soluble organic and inorganic compounds thus fo membranes with greater water flux and less fouling are desired for protein recovery in tuna processing by products one of the techniques used to enhance fo membrane water flux is membrane surface modification increasing surface hydrophilicity can enhance not only membrane water flux but also decrease the propensity for membrane fouling various approaches have been used previously to improve the surface hydrophilicity of fo membranes including surface coating by inorganic nanoparticles 10 grafting with the hydrophilic monomers 11 12 and surface cross linking using hydrophilic polymers 11 among these approaches grafting has been identified as the most effective method grafting with a plasma treatment was also attempted to introduce specific functional groups e g carboxyl groups onto the surface of membranes to enhance the degree of hydrophilicity 12 13 it was demonstrated that lower fouling was experienced upon membrane surface modification plasma grafting polymerization involved activation of gas plasma on the membrane surface substrate with varied energy and exposure time then the activated membrane was exposed to air for a peroxide group to form the monomers formed on the membrane surface were either hydroxyl amine or carboxyl groups 12 in a previous study polydopamine pd coating and polyethylene glycol grafting pd g peg were used to modify cellulose triacetate cta fo membranes to improve their antifouling ability by changing their surface morphology and chemistry 14 layer by layer lbl surface modification using sodium alginate chitosan was also able to limit fouling and biofilm formation on ca membrane surface 15 previous studies 12 16 have used acrylic acid aac for membrane surface modification and positive features that could improve surface hydrophilicity due to a significant amount of carboxyl groups that was created on the membrane surface were reported generally the plasma process for modifying membrane surfaces is divided into two types depending on the plasma gas used the first type is non polymerizing plasma or plasma treatment typical gases such as argon ar carbon tetrachloride ccl4 nitrogen n2 helium he oxygen o2 and carbon dioxide co2 are utilized for plasma treatment the other type is polymerizing plasma or plasma polymerization with monomers like aac allylamine polyethylene glycol peg and vinyl acetic acid the plasma polymerization can create a thin solid polymer film on the substrate membranes with hydrophilic grafting materials containing carboxyl and amine functional groups which is ideal to improve the antifouling characteristic of membranes 12 overall reviewing these previous studies indicates a potential approach of using aac plasma polymerization with different type of plasma gases for fo membrane surface modification to improve the membrane properties the aim of this study was to compared the effect of two plasma gases ar and co2 in the aac grafting modification of a commercial cta membrane to improve water flux and anti protein fouling properties for tuna protein recovery application the membrane surfaces were characterized for surface hydrophilicity surface topology and chemical composition in addition to the performance of the membrane in term of water flux and reverse salt flux flux decline and fouling reversibility was investigated throughout with model foulants then the performance of the membranes was evaluated with tuna processing by products obtained from real scale tuna canning factory the modified membrane developed herein achieved greater protein recovery while still maintaining its low fouling properties thus has a potential to become a sustainable alternative for protein recovery in the tuna canning industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 plasma grafting polymerization the cellulose triacetate cta membrane used in this study was obtained from hti albany or usa the direct current dc plasma treatment was carried out following the method reported in the work by hidzir et al 11 primarily the pristine cta membrane was placed on a glass plate using double sided cellophane tape exposing the membrane to the atmosphere at room temperature 25 0 5 c then the plasma induced graft polymerization process was conducted using either co2 or ar gas in a plasma reactor at different exposure times 5 20 s the optimum plasma treatment condition of co2 and ar was previously determined to be 20 w and 0 25 mbar 1 after the plasma treatment the membrane was exposed to ambient air for 30 min for the peroxide to form then was immersed in a 10 w v acrylic acid aac solution at 60 c for 30 min the sample was then soaked in 50 ml of methanol at 50 c and stirring was performed for 60 min 11 finally the membrane samples were rinsed with deionized di water and dried overnight the pristine cta membrane sample was named untreated while aac co2 and aac ar corresponded to the cta membranes treated by aac grafting with co2 and ar gas respectively 2 2 characterizations of the modified membranes surface hydrophilicity of the membranes before and after plasma grafting polymerization was measured using sessile drop observation for each measurement the contact angle was calculated from an average of ten different locations of one microliter sessile drops of water on the 0 5 0 5 cm2 membrane surface specific functional groups of membranes were analyzed by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir tensor 27 bruker us the surface chemical compositions of the membrane samples were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra dld krotos analytical ltd uk surface topology and roughness of the samples were obtained using an atomic force microscope afm nanosurfeasyscan2 switzerland afm measurement was performed in a non contact mode and the average root mean square rms roughness was calculated from five different measurements from different locations plasma graft yield was determined from the initial and final weight of the samples the grafting yield gy can be defined with the following expression 17 1 g y w a w b a where w a and w b are weights of the pristine and the modified membranes respectively and a is the area of the membrane sample 2 3 evaluation of membrane performance to evaluate the performance of the untreated and modified fo membranes water and salt permeability coefficients water flux and reverse salt flux were determined the water permeability coefficient a lm 2 h 1 bar 1 referred to lmh bar 1 and the salt permeability coefficient b lm 2 h 1 referred to lmh were determined in ro mode di water and 10 mm nacl solution were used as feed to determine the water permeability and salt permeability coefficients respectively 18 19 the water permeability coefficient a was calculated using the following equation 2 a j w δ p where a corresponds to the water permeability coefficient lmh bar 1 jw is the volumetric flux of permeate water lmh and δp bar corresponds to the difference in operating pressure across the membrane respectively the salt permeability coefficient b lmh was calculated using the following equation 3 b a δ p δ π 1 r r where r is salt rejection and δπ bar corresponds to the difference in osmotic pressure across the membrane the lab scale fo apparatus used in this study is illustrated in fig 1 the membrane channel had a dimension of 20 10 0 3 cm3 length width depth the effective membrane surface area was 0 02 m2 for fo experiments to determine water flux jw lmh and reverse salt flux rsf js distilled water was used as a feed solution fs and 2 m nacl solution purity 99 9 ajax finechem pty ltd australia was used as a draw solution ds the velocities of fs and ds were kept constant at 100 ml min in a co current mode using two separate peristaltic pumps eyela mp 3 n japan jw lmh was determined based on the volume of permeate using digital weight balance and gf 3000 japan and was calculated according to the following equation 4 j w w ρ a t where w l is the volume of permeate at time t h ρ unitless is relative density and a m2 corresponds to membrane surface area js gm 2 h 1 referred to gmh was obtained from conductivity measurement with a conductivity meter mettler inpro7100 and volume of feed side at the beginning and the end of the experiments js can be calculated using the following equation as presented in a previous study 20 5 j s c f v f c i v i a t where ci and cf g l are the initial and final salt concentrations of the feed solution vi and vf l are the initial and final volumes of the feed solution and t h is the time interval during the experiments 2 4 fo experiments and fouling behavior investigation the fouling behavior observed on the membranes was investigated in terms of permeate flux decline foulant reversibility and protein absorption flux decline of the membranes was evaluated according to a previously reported protocol 21 with minor modifications bovine serum albumin bsa purity 98 sigma aldrich and sodium alginate sigma aldrich chemie gmbh uk were selected as model foulants to represent fouling from proteins and polysaccharides respectively as the membrane was modified for use with tuna protein concentrations in mind fouling from humic substances and metal ions were not evaluated an aqueous solution containing 1 g l of either bsa or sodium alginate was used as feed solutions of the fo membrane at a constant pressure of 0 3 kpa and permeate water flux jw was monitored and recorded over time fouling behavior was investigated in the multi cycle fo filtration experiments following protocols previously described by maknakorn et al 20 fo experiments were operated for 3 cycles consecutively at the end of the first cycle when a normalized permeate flux jw jo reached 0 5 8 the fouled membrane was flushed on both sides using di water then at the end of the second cycle a chemical cleaning using 1 citric acid followed by 0 5 naoh was performed each step of cleaning lasted 30 min with a controlled velocity of 0 07 m s at both sides of the membrane after each cleaning procedure the jw of the cleaned membranes were measured in order to determine flux recovery efficacy the resistance in the series model 8 14 22 was used to investigate fouling characteristics and to quantify the degree of fouling total resistance rt can be expressed as 6 r t r m r r e r i r r e δ p μ j w where δp is transmembrane pressure kpa and μ is the viscosity of water pa s rm m 1 is defined as the sum of the intrinsic resistance of the pristine membrane and internal concentration polarization of draw solution rre and rirre are defined as physically reversible and irreversible fouling resistances respectively after the membranes were physically cleaned jw was again obtained then rre could be calculated by subtracting the remaining rm and physically irreversible fouling resistance rirre from total fouling resistance the protein adsorption experiments were conducted using the method described by zhao and chen 23 using bsa as a model protein foulant the untreated and modified membranes each had the same area of 3 6 cm2 were both submerged into anhydrous ethanol followed by a 0 9 nacl solution for 30 min then the membranes were exposed to a 0 5 mg ml bsa solution in a volume of 3 ml in a shaker incubator at 25 c for 22 h the membranes with protein adsorbed on the surfaces were dried at room temperature for 24 h the concentration of bsa solutions before and after membrane adsorption test was measured using the lowry method using a uv spectrophotometer at 750 nm the amount of protein adsorbed on the membranes was determined by the difference in protein concentrations in the solutions before and after the experiment 23 and the weight of protein gained on the membrane after the experiments 17 the performance in protein recovery and fouling behavior of the membranes were also evaluated with a lab scale fo apparatus using tuna processing by products as fs and 2 m nacl as ds 200 l of tuna processing by products as in tuna cooking juice were obtained from a tuna canning factory in hat yai thailand tuna cooking juice contains proteins in a group of sarcoplasmic protein which is water soluble and can be hydrolyzed to peptides 24 coarse materials were removed by fabric filter then the samples were kept frozen at 20 c then thawed to 25 1 c before the fo filtration experiments the tuna solution had a ph of 5 79 chemical oxygen demand cod of 23 280 mg l and a protein concentration of 4 5 as bsa measured by lowry method using bsa as a protein standard the fo filtration experiments for tuna protein recovery were conducted under the same protocol with bsa and alginate filtration experiments the protein concentration of the solution was measured every 30 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characteristic 3 1 1 membrane surface hydrophilicity surface contact angles of the cta membranes treated by co2 aac co2 and ar aac ar were measured at different exposure times fig 2 without plasma treatment exposure time 0 s untreated cta membrane untreated exhibited low hydrophilicity with the water contact angle of 64 0 which corresponds with previous research 22 25 reporting cta membranes in the range of 63 91 after 10 s plasma exposure time the contact angle of aac co2 and aac ar membranes decreased to 37 14 and 36 44 respectively statistical t tests were conducted to compare contact angles of aac co2 and aac ar membranes at each exposure time the results indicate that aac ar membranes exhibited higher hydrophilic properties lower contact angle compared to aac co2 membranes p value always 0 05 the greater hydrophilicity of aac ar membranes was due to an inert characteristic of ar gas which obtains more free polar radicals for reactions on the membrane surface compared to co2 gas the decreased contact angle suggests that high surface hydrophilicity of cta membranes can be achieved with plasma induced graft polymerization process using ar gas the decreased contact angle by the ar gas could be explained by higher negative ion capacity of ar thus higher activity at the membrane surface compared to co2 ar is an inert gas whereas co2 is considered an oxidative gas inert gas plasma can significantly enhance membrane hydrophilicity by etching polar peroxide functional groups after treatment and oxygen exposure as an oxidative gas co2 plasma changed the physical structure of the membrane by enlarging the pore size for hydrophilicity enhance 26 moreover ionization energy of ar is greater than that of co2 27 thus membranes treated with ar plasma showed greater hydrophilicity with a lower contact angle by prolonging plasma treatment longer than 10 s the contact angle of the modified membrane increased this behavior was previously observed by khongnakorn et al 1 and sem image showed that higher power discharge and longer plasma exposure time could destroy etch and crack the membrane surfaces liu et al 28 also reported that cta membrane surfaces were damaged after gamma ray irradiation as the membrane surface layer was cracked and peeled off its support layer the results in fig 2 indicate that increasing exposure time did not always result in increasing in hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces hence the optimum exposure time of the plasma grafting process was determined to be 10 s and cta membranes treated at this exposure time were selected for further experiments plasma grafting yield gy of both aac co2 and aac ar membranes increased during 5 10 s of exposure time fig 3 gy of the aac ar membrane was always higher than that of the aac co2 membrane for the aac ar membrane gy at 5 and 10 s were 12 43 and 12 66 μg cm2 respectively however prolonging plasma exposure time to 15 and 20 s resulted in a slight decrease in gy of the two membranes an increase in aac gy was due to an increase in the degree of polymerization of grafted chains with a longer treatment time which also explained the higher hydrophilicity of the plasma treated membrane 17 gy depends on exposure time monomer type and monomer content type of plasma gas and membrane materials 29 30 various gy values were reported in previous studies for example gy of of 88 and 203 μg cm2 was reported for carboxybetaine polymers grafted onto polyethylene microfiltration mf membranes 30 and gy of 20 150 μg cm2 was found for poly lysine methacrylamide grafted pvdf mf membrane 29 we found that gy of the modified membranes increased and reached the equilibrium at 5 s and no increase was observed after this point a similar behavior has been reported in the grafting of the n hydroxymethyl acrylamide hmaam onto poly ethylene terephthalate pet fibers 31 membranes with high gy exhibited higher hydrophilicity and enhanced anti protein fouling properties 17 29 30 however increasing in gy could lead to a formation of polymerized layer on the top layer of the membranes which would impact the layer thickness and consequently water flux 32 compared to previous studies gy observed in this study was lower as we used different monomer and shorter exposure time on different type of membrane material the modified membranes will be evaluated for its protein adsorption and fouling propensity in section 3 3 3 1 2 membrane surface chemistry functional groups of membranes before and after 10 s plasma grafting polymerization treatment were investigated using ftir atr and the results are shown in fig 4 the untreated membrane displayed strong peak bands at 1042 1233 1742 and 3371 cm 1 which are corresponded to co stretching cco stretching co stretching and oh stretching respectively the peaks appeared between 3100 cm 1 and 3600 cm 1 were previously determined as carboxylic acid oh stretching vibration for the cta membrane 28 upon plasma grafting with ar gas the aac ar membrane showed strong peak bands of carboxylic group including oh bond at 3472 cm 1 and co stretching 1734 cm 1 1 among the three membranes investigated the greatest intensity of the oh functional group on the membrane surfaces was observed in the aac ar membrane which indicated that peroxide groups were formed on the membrane surfaces with the plasma treatment and the exposure to the atmosphere the presence of the oh functional group suggested that the grafting and polymerization reactions could be achieved more effectively on the aac ar membranes compared to the aac co2 membranes the ar plasma treatment created free radicals a few nanometers on the membrane surface subsequently hydroxyl functional groups were formed once the surfaces were exposed to the atmosphere the increase in the intensity of the hydroxyl oh and carboxyl groups co indicated the successful aac grafting on the cta membrane which led to the formation of free radicals such as cooh and oh functional groups 27 28 increased adhesion of o2 which generated carboxyl groups and carboxylic acid on cta membrane surfaces was attributed to the degree of the hydrogen bond in the co cco and co groups the chemical information of the membrane surfaces were further investigated using xps survey the xps wide scan spectra showed binding energy of c1s and o1s was detected at 279 and 532 ev respectively fig 5 a c1s peaks presented at lower intensity than o1s peaks in both untreated and modified membranes and was consistent with previous studies 26 28 33 for the modified membrane samples the binding energy of c1s and o1s was lower than that of untreated membranes but no significant differences in binding energy was observed between the aac co2 and aac ar membranes fig 5b illustrates high resolution c1s spectrum of the untreated membrane spectral deconvolution was performed according to a method outlined in a previous study 34 peaks corresponding to cc coc co and oco had binding energy of 284 9 286 1 287 4 and 288 5 ev respectively after aac grafting polymerization shifting in the binding energy from their original positions was observed cc 284 8 ev coc 286 7 ev co 287 9 ev and oco 289 2 ev the shifting to the higher binding energy regions of oco bond in modified membranes indicated a strong interaction of c and o in polymer molecules as a greater amount of energy was required for bonds breakage using an x ray beam from xps spectra overall xps results confirmed that surface modification occurred on membranes with plasma aac grafting polymerization which is consistent with the ftir results discussed above the changing of binding energy of co and oco groups resulted in increases in hydrophilic functional groups for modified membranes thus ar plasma treatment with aac grafting on the cta membrane successfully increased hydrophilic bonding by forming chemical functional groups such as cooh and oh 27 28 the hydrophilicity of the membrane could be changed by bonding interactions with plasma gas and increasing functional groups by the monomers used this was contrary to the findings of liu et al 28 who found no significant surface changes and the appearance of no new bonds after gamma radiation on cta membranes the difference between our results and a previous study indicated that the degree of relative intensity of major absorption bands depended on the type of plasma gas and monomers used 3 1 3 membrane surface roughness the 3d afm images showing the surface topology of untreated and modified cta membranes are presented in fig 6 the roughness profile showed that the untreated membrane had a significantly smoother surface than the plasma treated membranes the root mean square rms roughness which gives an indication of the mean roughness over an area of a membrane 35 was calculated as an average of five different points for grafted membranes the roughness of surface increased as in rms values of 8 702 nm 13 085 nm and 17 693 nm for the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes respectively the increase of surface roughness of plasma grafting membranes could be explained by the degradation of the plasma gas ions and electrons on the surface that could react with the free radicals of aac monomers to produce a poly acrylic acid paa coating on the membrane surfaces this result corresponded with a previous study 14 reporting the roughness of polydopamine pd modified cta fo membranes increased after modification with pd coating and poly ethylene glycol peg grafting due to the nodular structure produced by the self polymerization of dopamine on the membrane surfaces moreover the aac ar membrane had 25 greater in rms roughness compared with the aac co2 membrane this greater roughness could be explained by the interaction between the membrane surface and lower electron density from the ar plasma which replaced ions more effectively than the co2 plasma 28 huang et al 36 also observed that for the hydrophilic surfaces the water contact angle of the surface decreases with increasing surface roughness the greater roughness aac ar membrane can also be seen in the morphology analysis of the membranes using scanning electron microscopy sem fig s1 supporting materials the rougher surfaces of aac ar membrane corresponded to higher gy and greater hydrophilicity smaller contact angle consistent with a previous study 32 in addition to the increase in hydrophilicity caused by the chemical functional groups of plasma grafted membranes the increase in surface roughness after treatment can also have a positive impact on membrane fouling minimization as reported in previous studies 34 37 the fouling propensity of the untreated and modified membranes will be discussed in section 3 3 3 2 intrinsic propertied of modified fo membranes filtration experiments on the untreated and modified membranes were conducted in ro mode using di water and 10 mm nacl as feed solutions to determine the water permeability coefficient a and salt permeability coefficient b the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes had a of 0 74 1 32 and 1 76 lmh bar 1 respectively and b of 0 87 0 85 and 0 85 lmh respectively it can be seen that compared to the untreated membrane the water permeability coefficient of grafted membrane had significantly increased but no significant difference in salt permeability coefficient was observed the modification process of plasma grafting polymerization only occurred in the active layer thus only effected the water permeabilty of the membrane moreover the b a ratio was calculated as a parameter to determine the selectivity of the membranes a low b a ratio was observed in the aac ar membranes indicating higher selectivity lower fouling tendency and stability in membrane operation 14 this finding was consistent with previous studies stating that gratfing process could enhance the selectivity of both cta and tfc membranes 25 38 the water flux jw and the reverse salt flux rsf referred to js of the untreated and the modified membranes were evaluated under fo mode using 2 m nacl as a draw solution using di water as a feed solution jw of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were 6 11 7 56 and 8 12 lmh respectively fig 7 a the greater jw obtained for modified membranes in the fo mode was similar to results obtained in previous experiments under the ro mode similarly jw of modified membranes was also higher than that of the untreated membrane when the bsa solution was used as a feed solution compared to the untreated membrane jw obtained for the aac co2 and aac ar membranes increased by 23 and 30 respectively however bsa filtration experiments resulted in lower jw than that in di water filtration experiments which was attributed to the smaller in the difference in osmotic pressure between bsa and the draw solution the reverse salt flux js in the fo process not only reduces jw but also increases the cost of draw solute replenishment as shown in fig 7b js of the membranes decreased with plasma grafting polymerization using di water as a feed solution the js of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were 3 88 2 78 2 65 gmh respectively the results indicate that the grafting polymerization with aac resulted in greater rejection and lower js due to the deposit of aac which might reduce the pore size of the support layer of the membranes causing salt passage through the membrane to be restricted the untreated fo membranes suffered from an internal concentration polarization icp where the draw concentration was diluted by water permeating through the support at the inner side of the active layer 39 the icp caused a reduction of the effective osmotic driving force thus reducing the performance of the fo process by filling the pores of the support layer with aac grafting the effect of icp was minimized freger et al 40 also reported that the monomer from grafting polymerization could penetrate through the active layer of nf polyamide membranes accordingly pores of the support layer were filled by the grafted polymer overall grafting membranes with plasma could enhance jw and minimize js simultaneously which increases the performance of fo process 3 3 fouling propensity of modified fo membranes the fo filtration experiments were conducted to evaluate the fouling propensity of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes using a model protein 1 g l bsa and a model polysaccharide 1 g l sodium alginate solutions fig 8 a and b illustrate normalized flux decline jw jo of the membranes in three filtration cycles of bsa and alginate filtration experiments respectively the filtration experiments were operated continuously until jw jo decreased to 0 5 i e 1200 min and 640 min for bsa and alginate experiments respectively then physical cleaning with di water flushing was conducted the filtration experiments were continued in the second cycle for another 300 460 min until significant flux decline was observed then chemical cleaning with 1 citric acid and subsequently 0 5 naoh were performed for these filtration experiments steep flux decline behavior was observed for the untreated membrane indicating a severe degree of fouling the degree of fouling observed was moderate for the aac co2 membranes while the aac ar membrane was found to have the lowest fouling propensity among the three membranes tested during the first 300 min of bsa filtration experiments fig 8a the permeate flux of the three membrane slowly decreased and approximately 15 flux decline was observed after that the permeate flux decreased rapidly after 1200 min of filtration flux decline observed for the untreated the aac co2 and the aac ar membranes was 55 50 and 36 respectively at the end of the first cycle flux recovery achieved by di water flushing was 85 87 and 89 for the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes respectively the high flux recovery rate by di water flushing suggested that the majority of fouling occurring during bsa filtrations was physically reversible however when the second cycle experiments were continued a rapid flux decline was observed within 460 min of the second cycle filtration the normalized flux of the three membranes decreased to 65 70 thus chemical cleaning was performed the chemical cleaning achieved nearly 100 flux recovery for the three membranes tested indicating that bsa fouling was chemically reversible it was noted that fouling occurred more rapidly in the second cycle of filtration experiments after di flushing suggesting that not all of the foulants were able to be removed physical cleaning leading to the faster formation of a fouling layer on the membrane surfaces comparing the model protein to the model polysaccharide the fouling caused by bsa filtration was less severe than that by alginate filtration during the bsa filtration experiments the operating pressure in the system was always less than 0 3 kpa also the majority of bsa fouling could be removed by physical sheer force from di flushing which indicated that bsa formed a loose fouling layer on the membrane surfaces previous literature has also reported that the fouling layer in the fo process was less compact and easier to remove by physical cleaning than that in the pressure driven membrane process 41 moreover less bsa fouling observed on aac co2 and aac ar membranes was linked to the greater hydrophilicity of membranes after grafting polymerization the hydrophilic modified membranes were less prone to absorb bsa proteins as suggested by wavhal fisher 17 throughout 37 h of bsa filtration experiments modified membranes showed a promising fouling resistant property compared to the untreated membrane thus changes in chemical properties of the membrane surface by grafting plasma polymerization resulted in less protein fouling propensity li et al 14 also reported that membrane surface modification could improve the anti adhesion properties for both proteins and polysaccharides fouling on the other hand alginate filtration experiments resulted in a more severe flux decline fig 8b thus each alginate filtration cycle was shorter than that of bsa filtration experiments physical cleaning was performed after 660 min of filtration as the permeate flux decreased to 20 35 of the initial flux the permeate flux recovered by di water flushing was 83 87 and 88 for the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes respectively at the end of the second cycle of filtration flux recovery of 100 was achieved by chemical cleaning despite causing more severe flux decline than bsa a majority of alginate fouling was also physically reversible also chemical cleaning was effective to remove both bsa and alginate fouling the lower fouling propensity observed in bsa filtration experiments can be explained by an increase in hydrophilicity that prevented or retarded the electrostatic van der waals force and hydrate interaction between proteins and the membrane surfaces 35 severe fouling during alginate filtration was attributed to the accumulation of alginate molecules and na ions at the valleys of the membrane surface where water permeates through resulting in an increased concentration of alginate and subsequently a formation of a gel layer with high hydraulic resistance this phenomenon is called concentrative external concentration polarization ecp 42 and is important to systems operating with high permeation flux 39 in order to evaluate the reversibility of the fouling the resistance in series was calculated from flux data and shown in fig 8c the pristine membrane has a resistance rm of 1 53 1011 m 1 rm of the aac co2 and aac ar membranes was 2 81 and 8 81 lower than the untreated virgin membrane the lower rm of the aac ar membrane corresponded with the greater hydrophilicity i e smaller contact angle of the ar gas plasma treated membrane as evaluated in section 3 1 1 lower rm indicates better performance of the membranes after plasma grafting polymerization due to i the thinner active layer and ii the higher selectivity of membrane surfaces as indicated by a low b a ratio value even though total fouling resistance rf from alginate fouling was greater than that from bsa fouling the majority of both bsa and alginate fouling were reversible rre accounted for 73 83 and 87 92 of rf in bsa and alginate fouling respectively the high reversibility of fouling in fo mode was previously attributed to the less compact fouling layer formed on the membrane surface due to the low hydraulic pressure applied in the fo system 40 41 in the case of reversible fouling caused by bsa filtration the lowest levels of rre of 6 87 1010 m 1 were observed in aac ar membrane which was 58 lower than the rre of the untreated membrane the lower rre observed in the aac ar membrane corresponds with an increase in hydrophilicity thus the membrane surface was less likely to absorb amphiphilic compounds like bsa 33 the effect of the plasma grafting was less pronounced on the irreversible fouling caused by bsa filtration rirre of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were 3 21 1010 2 24 1010 and 2 57 1010 m 1 respectively it should be noted that for bsa filtration the rm accounted for 44 60 of total resistance rt these results were similar to those found by li et al 14 who reported that the rm under fo mode was about half of the rt in contrast to the conventional ro filtration in which the rm only accounted for a small fraction of the rt 43 similar to the results from the bsa filtration experiments the lowest rre from alginate fouling was also observed in the aac ar membrane 2 66 1011 m 1 followed by that in the aac co2 membrane 4 19 1011 m 1 and the highest rre was observed in the untreated membrane 6 81 1011 m 1 while the rirre observed was the highest in the untreated membrane no significant difference was observed between the rirre of aac ar and aac co2 membranes thus the plasma grafting process could reduce the formation of both reversible and irreversible fouling ar plasma was more effective than co2 plasma for anti adhesion properties of reversible fouling from both proteins and polysaccharides however the effect of plasma gas type was marginal on irreversible fouling for the same type of membrane the total fouling resistance caused by alginate filtration was more than three times of that caused by bsa filtration these results may be attributed to 44 the difference in the fouling mechanism of bsa and alginate the increase in rirre indicated that flux decline during alginate filtration was not only caused by cake layer formation but also by internal poor blocking 14 the molecular weight mw of sodium alginate 300 kda is greater than that of bsa 66 5 kda the severe flux decline by alginate seems to correspond to the mws and the solution viscosity because a larger molecular size likely reduces more the shear force associated with the feed crossflow velocity 44 a previous study also reported that alginate caused significant flux decline in fo filtration systems due to the formation of a gel layer that hindered back diffusion of the colloid and gave rise to ecp 45 lower flux decline by bsa can be attributed to the salting in and or salting out effects for proteins 46 since bsa was in a salinity rich environment due to the salt reverse flux salting in and or out effects could lead to structural deformation of bsa fouling layer such effects allows the bsa fouling layer to be easily removed from the membrane surface by shear force and physical cleaning 47 it can be concluded that cta membranes with plasma grafting polymerization with aac had the best anti adhesion properties for proteins but such properties were less pronounced for polysaccharides applications this study aimed to modify fo membranes to increase protein recovery from tuna processing by products which is comprised mainly of proteins the protein content of tuna cooking juice ranged from 4 to 9 8 so enhancing the fo membrane performance to control protein absorption was desirable in this application the membrane surfaces with the anti protein adsorption properties played a major role in the anti fouling performance during protein filtration the 22 hr static protein adsorption experiments were conducted using a bsa solution the protein absorption of the untreated aac co2 and aac ar membranes were found to be 21 7 9 3 and 8 7 μg cm2 respectively the bsa adsorption measured on these modified membranes was lower than values 23 45 μg cm2 in 24 h reported in a previous study using polyethylene membrane 30 which suggests an effectiveness of grafting polymerization of anti protein fouling property despite the rougher surfaces of the modified membranes protein absorption decreased after plasma grafting polymerization hence the degree of hydrophilicity was not correlated to the surface roughness of fo membranes this result suggests that the ability of the grafted polymer to block the adsorption sites on the grafting surface had a strong positive impact to control protein adsorption our findings are similar to a previous study 35 in which the commercial ro tfc membrane was modified by plasma polymerization using triethylene glycol dimethyl ether triglyme increasing the hydrophilicity with the addition of cooh oh functional groups together with adsorption sites blocking by grafting polymerization resulted in the lower protein absorption thus the organic fouling propensity was decreased many studies have also observed that the gy of the hydrophilic monomer was correlated with the degree of hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces and that hydrophilic surfaces were less prone to protein fouling 16 48 even though different grafting monomers were used overall the results of this study indicated that plasma grafting is a promising treatment to increase the performance of cta fo membranes increasing in jw decreasing in js and improving in anti fouling ability were achieved after the membrane was modified as the physical and chemical properties of membrane surfaces were changed it is also illustrated that the interaction between foulants and membrane surfaces were improved as protein foulants were effectively removed from the modified membrane surfaces with only physical cleaning as the aac ar membrane achieved higher performance than the aac co2 membrane only the aac ar membrane was further tested in the tuna protein recovery experiments the fo water flux as a function of filtration time during tuna protein recovery experiments is presented in fig 9 a the initial jw of the untreated and ar aac membranes was 4 80 and 5 76 lmh respectively after 300 min of continuous filtration the jw values decreased to 36 and 45 of the original jw respectively compared to the untreated membrane the ar aac membrane showed a significant improvement in the ability to maintain higher jw throughout the time period of the experiments hence the surface modification process has shown a clear improvement in membrane anti protein fouling performance this flux loss during tuna protein recovery was probably caused by the effect of ecp of foulant particles and the formation of a gel layer comprised of gelatin fish skin and fish meat on the membrane surfaces 7 at the end of the filtration cycle the fouled membranes were physically cleaned and foulant reversibility was investigated rf caused by the tuna cooking juice filtration with the untreated and aac ar membranes was 5 48 1011 and 3 31 1011 m 1 respectively we also observed higher fouling layer reversibility in the modified membrane than the untreated membrane the flux recovery achieved by physical cleaning was 84 for the aac ar membrane while only 82 was achieved for the untreated membrane for the two membranes studied flux recovery achieved by chemical cleaning was 100 thus the increase in hydrophilicity of the membrane through surface modification not only reduced fouling propensity but also improve interactions between proteins and the membrane surfaces as protein foulants were removed easily from the modified membrane surfaces after di flushing the initial protein concentration of the tuna cooking juice was 4 5 w v and it was increased to 9 48 and 10 71 for the untreated and ar aac membranes after 300 min of fo filtration fig 9b the tuna protein recovery of 76 43 was achieved by the ar aac membrane the desirable protein concentration of the concentrated solutions ranged between 10 15 49 or 5 g l 50 for commercially viable bioactive ingredient overall the tuna protein recovery experiments revealed that the ar plasma modified membrane achieved excellent maintenance of jw with greater protein recovery suggesting that the surface modification process for cta fo membranes has the potential to become a sustainable alternative for protein recovery in the tuna canning industry 4 conclusions a commercial cta membrane was modified by aac via a plasma grafting polymerization process to minimize the protein fouling tendency the following conclusions were drawn from the above study for the two plasma gases studied ar was more effective than co2 in decreasing the water contact angle of the pristine cta membrane thus enhancing hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces the membrane chemical composition analysis revealed that the hydrophilicity was increased owing to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups such as carboxyl oco and cooh compared to the untreated membrane the modified membrane had greater selectivity and water flux but lower reverse salt flux and intrinsic membrane resistance rm which enhanced the performance of the membranes in fo applications the effects of fouling caused by two types of model foulants protein and polysaccharide were compared in the fo filtration experiments the modified membranes were more suitable for protein filtration as an excellent anti protein fouling property was observed the plasma grafting polymerization could improve the performance of cta fo membranes by increasing water flux and minimizing protein fouling the interfacial characteristics between membrane surfaces and foulants were also improved as a majority of the protein fouling observed was reversible the modified membrane also achieved an excellent maintenance of flux during tuna protein recovery application overall this study presented the plasma polymerization with an efficient grafting gas that can be easily employed to modify commercial fo membranes to improve water flux and anti protein fouling properties while still maintaining its low fouling properties the modified membrane developed herein could concentrate protein from tuna cooking juice to higher than 10 which is a desirable concentration for commercially viable products declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments the work was
