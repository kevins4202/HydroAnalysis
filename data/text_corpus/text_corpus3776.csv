introduction perchlorate clo4 contamination has been commonly detected in various soil and water environments due to its unregulated discharge from a broad range of industrial applications such as solid rocket fuels lubricating oils pyrotechnics and munitions motzer 2001 ye et al 2012 perchlorate concentration in groundwater is generally low 100 μg l logan and lapoint 2002 but in some regions e g groundwater contaminated by weapons industrial reserve plant its concentration can reach 20 mg l or more motzer 2001 perchlorate could pose serious health threats to human beings by interfering with the uptake of iodide and subsequently inhibiting thyroid hormone production borjan et al 2011 therefore maximum contaminant limits for perchlorate ranging from 2 to 18 μg l have been recommended for drinking water by several us states e g california gu and coates 2006 various treatment techniques have been proposed to remove perchlorate from contaminated waters including physical e g adsorption ion exchange and membrane filtration hristovski et al 2008 parette and cannon 2005 yoon et al 2009 chemical and biological processes ye et al 2012 among them microbial perchlorate reduction has been recognized as one of the most promising perchlorate treatment processes srinivasan and sorial 2009 heterotrophic perchlorate reduction using organic carbon e g acetate as electron donor has been substantially studied for decades kim and logan 2001 srinivasan and sorial 2009 while the supplement of organic carbon could potentially increase operational costs or stimulate microbial growth which results in a secondary pollution in water distribution system recently autotrophic perchlorate reduction has attracted more attention for example hydrogen driven perchlorate reduction has been developed to eliminate the perchlorate contamination in which hydrogen was provided as electron donor through hollow fiber membranes miller and logan 2000 nerenberg et al 2002 compared with hydrogen methane is a much widely available carbon source and could be generated in situ from methanogenesis process i e anaerobic methane production process thus making methane a promising electron donor for perchlorate removal microbial methane oxidation may occur under both aerobic and anoxic conditions under aerobic conditions aerobic methanotrophs oxidize methane to co2 by the catalysis of the enzyme methane monooxygenases mmo coupling the reduction of oxygen to water costa et al 2000 liu et al 2014 under anoxic conditions the anoxic oxidation of methane aom is mainly mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic anme archaea which activate methane by the methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr by coupling with reduction of various electron acceptors such as sulfate nitrate and ferric ion boetius et al 2000 cai et al 2018 haroon et al 2013 initially only sulfate was confirmed as an electron acceptor to drive aom process in a consortium of anme archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria boetius et al 2000 recently nitrite nitrate dependent anoxic methane oxidation n damo processes have been discovered haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera known as n damo bacteria which belongs to the nc10 phylum can perform aom coupling with nitrite reduction with nitrite as the sole electron acceptor intracellular oxygen could be produced through the no dismutation and then used to oxidize methane in n damo bacteria ettwig et al 2010 differently candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens known as n damo archaea affiliated with anme 2d can mediate aom coupling with nitrate reduction with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor methane is initially activated by mcr carried by n damo archaea through a reverse methanogenesis pathway haroon et al 2013 regarding microbial perchlorate reduction the pathway for heterotrophic perchlorate reducers starts with the reduction of perchlorate to chlorite and then chlorite might be converted to chloride and molecular oxygen through the catalysis of chlorite dismutase rikken et al 1996 however little is known whether and how perchlorate is reduced by utilizing methane as electron donor a recent study documented that perchlorate 5 mg l in influent could be removed by providing methane as sole electron donor in a lab scale reactor luo et al 2015 in this previous study oxygen was provided in influent to drive methane oxidation and aerobic methanotrophs were enriched under such micro aerobic conditions to date it is still unknown whether perchlorate could be reduced by methane under anoxic conditions although the reaction is thermodynamically feasible ch4 clo4 hco3 cl h2o δgo 928 kj mol ch4 furthermore it is also interesting to distinguish whether different perchlorate removal pathways would be employed in the presence and absence of oxygen when using methane as electron donor the first objective of this study was to attempt to couple perchlorate reduction to microbial methane oxidation by using methane as sole electron donor the second objective was to compare perchlorate removal performance and identify key communities in the presence and absence of oxygen in order to achieve these aims a methane based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr in which hollow fibre membranes were installed as gas diffusers to supply methane and to provide surfaces for the biofilm attachment considering n damo archaea and n damo bacteria carry natural enzymes that can activate methane the mbfr was initially inoculated with an enriched culture dominated by candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens and candidatus methylomirabilis obtained from a parent n damo anammox reactor in our lab haroon et al 2013 then perchlorate was fed as sole electron acceptor to test whether it was technically feasible to couple perchlorate reduction with methane oxidation under two oxygen regimes including the absence of oxygen refers to anoxic conditions below and the presence of oxygen limited oxygen was supplied refers to oxygen limiting conditions in order to evaluate the perchlorate removal capacity the mbfr was run for a long term period 1100 days at various hydraulic retention time hrt high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was carried out throughout the experimental period to identify the key microbes performing methane oxidation and perchlorate reduction it is expected that these results will advance our understanding of microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane as electron donor and guide us to design a process to remove perchlorate from contaminated groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup a laboratory scale mbfr system with working volume of 800 ml was set up in this study the detailed reactor configuration can be found in our previous study luo et al 2018b briefly the mbfr was equipped with eight bundles of composite hollow fibre membranes 200 μm inner diameter and 300 μm outer diameter mitsubishi japan and each bundle was bent to be u shaped with the end connected to methane gas cylinders 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia the gas pressure inside the hollow fibres was controlled at 150 kpa by a gas pressure regulator ross brown australia the bulk liquor in the mbfr system was mixed by a magnetic stirrer 500 rpm labtek australia and recirculated through a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 100 ml min masterflex usa a ph probe was mounted internally in the reactor and ph was controlled between 7 and 8 by manual injection of 1m hcl or 1 m naoh solutions twice per week considering n damo archaea and n damo bacteria carry natural enzymes that can activate methane the mbfr was inoculated with 150 ml of mixed culture acquired from a parent n damo reactor in our laboratory the parent reactor dominated by n damo archaea bacteria and anammox bacteria has achieved a mean nitrate removal rate of 1 4 mmol l d haroon et al 2013 the synthetic influent was prepared as follows unit g l if not specified kh2po4 0 038 mgcl2 6h2o 0 008 cacl2 2h2o 0 015 nh4cl 0 019 acidic trace elements 0 5 ml l and alkaline trace elements 0 2 ml l luo et al 2018b the influent was stored in a 5l container and sparged with n2 for 30 min dissolved oxygen do in influent was measured using a do meter hach usa and the concentration was always zero 2 2 mbfr operation the entire experiment operation of the mbfr lasted for 1152 days which was divided into three phases table s1 including phase i i e the start up phase day 0 258 phase ii anoxic conditions day 259 1026 and phase iii limited oxygen was supplied during day 1027 1152 in phase i in order to enrich biomass and achieve biofilm attachment on the membranes the inoculum mentioned above was added to the reactor and nitrate stock solution 40 g n l was dosed periodically as the growth substrates for n damo archaea via manual injection the initial nitrate concentration was 40 160 mg n l after each dosage phase ii consisted of three stages table s1 in stage i day 259 328 nitrate was switched to perchlorate by adding concentrated stock solution 3 6 g cl l giving an in reactor perchlorate concentration 4 5 12 mg cl l after each addition in stage ii day 329 530 the influent with a perchlorate concentration of 4 mg cl l was continuously fed into the mbfr at hrt of 5 days for stage iii day 531 1026 temperature was increased from 22 2 c to 35 2 c using water bath to investigate the effect of temperature on perchlorate removal efficiency hrt was gradually reduced from 5 days to 1 day by increasing influent flow rate during phase ii the absence of oxygen in mbfr during phases i and ii was tested and confirmed since a tubing without any oxygen permeability made of polyvinyl chloride was used for recirculation no oxygen transfer was observed in the mbfr after one day monitoring by a do probe hach hq40d the detection limit is 0 1 mg l differently during phase iii limited oxygen 10 mg l d was supplied through an oxygen permeable tubing for the recirculation tygon e lab tubing inter diameter 3 1 mm masterflex core parmer during the entire operational period liquid samples were taken from the reactor every two or three days to monitor the concentrations of nitrate only phase i perchlorate species and volatile fatty acids vfas 2 3 batch tests in order to clarify the mass evolution in perchlorate reduction process a batch test was conducted at stage iii of phase ii day 637 the continuous methane supply and perchlorate feeding were stopped and then fresh methane saturated mineral medium was added into the reactor to avoid any headspace afterwards 0 5 ml of concentrated perchlorate stock solution 3 6 g cl l was injected into the reactor liquid samples of 2 ml were taken every 8 h to determine concentrations of chlorine species and dissolved methane another batch test was conducted at phase iii to prove the role of vfas in methane driven perchlorate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions during this batch test perchlorate feeding was stopped while methane was still continuously supplied seven liquid samples were taken in one week to monitor the production of vfas 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of perchlorate chlorate chlorite and chloride in the effluent were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 after 0 22 μm filtration nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined on filtered samples using a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph gc with a supelco 6 feet 1 8 in stainless steel packed column hayesep q 80 100 and a flame ionization detector fid was utilized to monitor the dissolved methane concentration vfas were analysed by gc equipped with fid and a polar capillary column db ffap the ph values in the reactor were measured by a ph meter oakton australia for microbial analysis biofilm samples were scrapped off from different locations of the membranes and then mixed together with 2 ml bulk liquid on day 258 at the end of phase i day 469 stage ii of phase ii day 733 and 866 stage iii of phase ii and day 1075 phase iii to avoid oxygen intrusion into the system the sampling port was flushed with nitrogen during sampling periods dna from the biomass samples was extracted using the fastdna spin for soil kit mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacture s protocol the 16s rrna gene sequencing and data processing were conducted as described previously luo et al 2017 briefly the universal primer set 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgacgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtrc 3 was used to amplify the 16s rrna gene and then purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa high quality sequences at 97 similarity were obtained through quality control using trimmomatic and then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by qiime an otu table with the taxonomic classification were generated via alignment of representative otu sequences against greengenes database 3 results 3 1 performance of perchlorate reduction in the methane based mbfr biofilms able to oxidize methane were enriched during phase i by adding 150 ml inoculum dominated by two known anoxic methane oxidizers namely candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens n damo archaea and candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria a nitrate reduction rate of 1 7 9 6 mg n l d without nitrite accumulation was achieved during the 250 day operation of phase i fig s1 with biofilms gradually attached to the surface of membranes on day 251 the sole electron acceptor provided to the reactor was switched from nitrate to perchlorate in order to test the capability of enriched microbial communities to couple aom to perchlorate reduction interestingly a steady perchlorate reduction rate of 0 6 1 1 mg cl l d was achieved without observable accumulation of chlorate during the whole stage i of phase ii fig 1 indicating the produced chlorate and chlorite were simultaneously reduced during stage ii of phase ii synthetic medium containing 4 mg cl l perchlorate was continuously fed into the reactor over 90 of perchlorate removal efficiency was achieved at hrt of 5d fig 2 however the removal efficiency of perchlorate was decreased to 40 when hrt was reduced to 3d in order to improve the perchlorate removal efficiency the reactor operation temperature was increased from 22 2 c to 35 2 c after increasing temperature the perchlorate removal efficiency quickly recovered to 95 within one day and then 100 suggesting that temperature has a positive impact on perchlorate reduction the stimulatory effect of high temperature on anoxic perchlorate reduction has also been reported for enriched cultures using acetate as electron donors in which 50 mg l perchlorate was completely removed after 48 h at 20 c but taking only 24 h at 30 c wu et al 2008 in addition the effect of temperature ranging from 15 to 40 c has been investigated for the growth and activity of perchlorate reducing bacteria and the optimal temperature was suggested to be around 35 c zhu et al 2016 bruce et al 1999 in our experiment the removal efficiency of perchlorate gradually decreased to 40 60 after day 866 the reason for the decreased perchlorate removal efficiency was due to an accident that methane supply was stopped for one week day 868 875 this also indicates that microbial perchlorate reduction is linked with the methane availability in phase iii limited oxygen 10 mg l d was introduced into the reactor through the oxygen permeable tubing to test whether perchlorate reduction could be achieved in the presence of oxygen although no dissolved oxygen could be detected in the mbfr the perchlorate removal efficiency was immediately recovered to 100 and was stably maintained at 100 even when hrt was shortened to 0 25 d i e 6 h indicating oxygen diffusion into the reactor significantly improved the methane driven perchlorate reduction process in addition the produced chloride amount was close to the reduced perchlorate amount fig 2 when complete perchlorate removal efficiency was achieved indicating all of the perchlorate should be converted to chloride no other intermediate e g chlorite was observed during the entire operation period which is consistent with a previous study kim and logan 2001 they also reported that chloride was the only final product of microbial perchlorate reduction using acetate as the electron donor 3 2 production of vfas in the mbfrs in the presence of oxygen recently we found vfas could be generated as the intermediates of methane partial oxidation in methane based mbfr in particular with a limited oxygen supply chen et al 2018 luo et al 2017 2018b thus vfas were regularly monitored to elucidate whether vfas from methane partial oxidation also played a role in perchlorate reduction process results showed that no vfas were observed during phases i and ii under anoxic conditions however with the intrusion of oxygen in phase iii the accumulation of vfas comprising mainly acetic acid 33 95 and propionic acid 6 52 was detected with a maximum concentration reaching 259 mg l on day 1054 fig 3 however the residual vfas gradually decreased to 1 0 mg l at the end of phase iii likely due to more consumption of vfas as carbon sources to drive perchlorate reduction at shorter hrt correspondingly complete perchlorate removal could be achieved when residual vfas were available in the mbfr in presence of oxygen i e phase iii considering the production of vfas was not detected under anoxic conditions phase i and ii the introduction of oxygen might be a triggering factor for vfas production in methane based mbfrs which is consistent with our recent study chen et al 2018 3 3 microbial community structure under both oxygen regimes the 16s rrna gene sequencing was employed to investigate microbial community structure of the inoculum day 0 the nitrate influenced biofilm day 258 phase i and the evolution of perchlorate influenced biofilm three samples on days 469 733 and 866 in phase ii and one sample on day1075 in phase iii results showed that candidatus methanoperedens n damo archaea a phycisphaerales unclassified genus and candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria dominated in the inoculum 80 of the total sequences fig 4 after 258 days of nitrate feeding under anoxic conditions n damo archaea became the dominating member in microbial population accounting for 54 of the total microbial sequences such microbial communities can match the reactor performance in which nitrate reduction was efficiently achieved in phase i by feeding nitrate as the sole electron acceptor however after replacing the electron acceptor nitrate with perchlorate the relative abundance of n damo archaea sharply decreased to 1 8 in the biofilm on day 469 0 5 on day 733 0 6 on day 866 and finally disappeared from the biofilm on day 1075 in addition n damo bacteria were also gradually washed out from the perchlorate influenced biofilm 1 2 on day 469 0 1 on day 733 0 1 on day 866 and be undetected on day 1075 these results indicate that both n damo archaea and n damo bacteria might not play a major role in methane oxidation or perchlorate reduction in phase iii surprisingly the families of methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae which have been recognized as aerobic methanotrophs mcdonald et al 2008 became the dominating methane related organisms in the biofilm on day 733 11 in total and day 866 3 7 in total the decrease of relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs could be caused by the decrease of hrt from 3 day to 1 day in which higher perchlorate loading might be toxic to aerobic methanotrophs the presence of aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions has also been reported in other studies martinez cruz et al 2017 after the limited oxygen 10 mg l d was supplied to the reactor phase iii the relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae decreased from 3 7 on day 866 to 3 2 on day 1075 in contrast the relative abundance of methanosarcina known as methanogenic archaea zehnder and brock 1979 was significantly increase from 0 4 on day 866 to 9 1 on day 1075 in addition veillonellaceae as a fermenter with metabolic capability to produce acetic acid and propionic acid by the fermentation of carbohydrates lecomte et al 2015 also increased its relative abundance from 0 4 on day 866 phase ii without oxygen supply to 9 1 on day 1075 phase iii with oxygen supply the significant increase of methanogenic archaea and fermenters after introducing oxygen has also been reported in our recent study chen et al 2018 in which a high rate vfa production could be achieved from methane bioconversion by methanogens and acid producing bacteria under oxygen limiting conditions in addition methanogenic archaea have been suggested to be able to reverse methanogenesis and mediate methane oxidation producing methanol and acetate as oxidation product zehnder and brock 1979 interestingly two new genera including denitratisoma 34 on day 469 6 0 on day 733 8 7 on day 866 0 2 on day 1075 and a unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus 5 0 on day 469 17 on day 733 13 on day 866 22 on day 1075 which both belong to the rhodocyclaceae family became the dominating microbes in the perchlorate fed biofilm under both anoxic and oxygen limiting conditions perchlorate and nitrate have been shown to be reduced by the same nitrate reductase enzyme hackenthal et al 1964 suggesting nitrate reducing bacteria denitratisoma might also be able to reduce perchlorate in addition the phylogenetic tree of 16s rrna genes of the unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus in the biofilm was established in comparison with phylogenetically close sequences figs s2 and si the sequences are phylogenetically aligned with the genus denitratisoma and azospira that have previously been shown to be able to reduce perchlorate byrne bailey and coates 2012 oren 2014 collectively these results suggest that the genera denitratisoma and this rhodocyclaceae genus could be the potential perchlorate reducers in the mbfr 4 discussion 4 1 potential mechanisms of perchlorate reduction coupled to methane oxidation in the present work we reported that perchlorate reduction could be achieved in the methane based mbfr under two oxygen regimes both the presence and absence of oxygen conditions but employing different communities or pathways to prove whether perchlorate reduction was coupled to methane oxidation under anoxic conditions a batch test was conducted at stage ii of phase ii fig s3 both methane consumption and perchlorate reduction proceeded during this batch test suggesting the occurrence of microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane under anoxic conditions perchlorate 0 11 mg cl l h was reduced to chloride 0 12 mg cl l h as the main final product resulting in a chloride to perchlorate mole ratio of 1 10 which is approximately similar to the theoretically expected value of 1 however the anoxic oxidation rate of coupled methane was only 1 17 μmol l h giving a methane to perchlorate mole ratio of 0 39 lower than the theoretically stoichiometry ratio of 1 ch4 clo4 hco3 cl h2o this discrepancy implies the possible presence of a second electron donor for perchlorate reduction such as some extracellular polymeric substances and intracellular storage compounds lai et al 2018a 2018b in terms of 16s rrna gene sequencing results microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane appears to be completed via a partnership between multiple microorganisms under anoxic conditions during phase ii aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae were substantially presented and some potential perchlorate reducers likely denitratisoma and a unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus belonging to the rhodocyclaceae family were dominant under anoxic conditions it is assumed that the occurrence of aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions might be due to the oxygen derived from dismutation of chlorite by perchlorate reducing bacteria which has been reported in a previous study rikken et al 1996 however it was also suggested that oxygen released from chlorite dismutation during perchlorate reduction might not be sufficient to aerobic methanotrophs miller et al 2014 further studies are required to confirm the release of intracellular oxygen during perchlorate reduction moreover perchlorate reducers in the rhodocyclaceae family are often heterotrophic bruce et al 1999 byrne bailey and coates 2012 which means they need organic carbons e g acetate to reduce perchlorate thus it is hypothesized that methane driven perchlorate reduction under anoxic conditions might be completed through synergetic interactions between aerobic methanotrophs likely methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae and dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria likely denitratisoma and a unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus as illustrated in fig s5a methane might be oxidized by methanotrophs in which some unknown intermediates might be produced and simultaneously utilized to reduce perchlorate heterotrophically by potential perchlorate reducing bacteria we tried to identify these intermediates during phase ii under anoxic conditions yet no organic intermediates ethanol or vfas were detected in this mbfr this indicates that possible intermediates generated by methane oxidation may have been completely consumed by perchlorate reducing bacteria or other unknown intermediates or intracellular storages have been formed furthermore the contribution from n damo microorganisms on perchlorate reduction cannot be completely ruled out in this study even though n damo archaea was detected only with a relative abundance of 0 5 1 8 during phase ii under anoxic conditions one evidence for perchlorate reduction by n damo archaea was that perchlorate could be immediately reduced by biofilms with abundant n damo archaea after switching electron acceptor from nitrate to perchlorate previous studies also documented that candidatus methanoperedens might have versatile metabolisms to reduce various electron acceptors to anoxically oxidize methane including nitrate selenate or ferric ion ettwig et al 2016 luo et al 2018a it is required to further investigate the potential of anme 2d to independently reduce perchlorate by long term enrichment in the future in the presence of oxygen vfas were detected as intermediates of methane partial oxidation followed by utilization of produced vfas during perchlorate reduction during days 1027 1138 the accumulation of vfas were observed when limited oxygen was introduced into the mbfr a batch test further confirmed the role of vfas at the later stage of phase iii when no residual vfa could be detected in the mbfr during this batch test perchlorate was not added in influent but the obvious accumulation of vfas was observed again fig s4 suggesting vfas should be utilized as the electron donors for perchlorate reduction when perchlorate is available based on reactor performance and 16s rrna gene sequencing we also proposed that methane driven perchlorate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions might be mediated through a microbial consortium fig s5b but with different key players for activating methane compared with those under anoxic conditions according to the 16s rrna gene sequencing results the relative abundance of methanosarcina known as methanogens and veillonellaceae were significantly increased after supplying limited oxygen however the abundances of aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae were decreased to be 3 2 of the total sequences our recent study reported that the methanogen i e methanosarcina and acid producing bacteria e g sporolactobacillus and propionispora could jointly convert methane into vfas chen et al 2018 here we proposed that methanosarcina and veillonellaceae might jointly oxidized methane into vfas as intermediates which were then used by potential perchlorate reducing bacteria likely denitratisoma and a rhodocyclaceae unclassified genus to heterotrophically reduce perchlorate to chloride fig s5b it should be noted that the detailed pathways for both oxygen conditions need to be elucidated by isotope metagenomics and meta transcriptomics studies in the future first it is still unclear how methane could be converted into vfas in addition the roles of methanogens and perchlorate reducers should be further identified by multiple molecular methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction metagenomics and meta transcriptomics answers to these research questions will provide insights to microbial methane oxidation couples with perchlorate reduction 4 2 practical implications previous studies have documented that perchlorate could be heterotrophically reduced with various organic compounds as electron donors or autotrophically reduced with hydrogen as electron donor in various perchlorate contaminated waters kim and logan 2001 miller and logan 2000 nerenberg et al 2002 in this study we demonstrated that microbial perchlorate reduction could be achieved in both the presence and absence of oxygen conditions by using methane as the sole electron donor the methane supported perchlorate removal rate 4 0 mg cl l d under anoxic conditions in this work is relatively lower than the reported rates in hydrogen based mbfrs 20 118 mg cl l d miller and logan 2000 nerenberg and rittmann 2004 or even lower than the obtained rates 19 7 mg cl l d in methane based mbfr under micro aerobic conditions luo et al 2015 however the perchlorate removal rates 16 mg cl l d achieved at hrt of 0 25 d fig 2 in the presence of oxygen were higher than the rate in absence of oxygen suggesting a limited oxygen supply would be beneficial for improving perchlorate removal rate considering oxygen is commonly detected in shallow groundwater or wastewater datry et al 2004 anoxic conditions might not be promising or suggested for practical perchlorate removal from contaminated water the obtained perchlorate removal rate is still relatively low which could be further increased by optimising oxygen supply rate and methane partial pressure in further studies 5 conclusions in this study microbial perchlorate reduction was achieved using methane as the sole electron donor in an mbfr both in the presence and absence of oxygen the methane driven perchlorate removal rates in the presence of oxygen is more promising to apply into groundwater remediation compared to absence of oxygen in spite of the occurrence of oxygen perchlorate reduction driven by methane might be mediated via synergetic interactions by a microbial consortium under anoxic conditions aerobic methanotrophs likely methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae might micro aerobically oxidize methane by utilizing internal oxygen from microbial perchlorate reduction which might be mediated by rhodocyclaceae differently under oxygen limiting conditions methanogens e g methanosarcina and fermenters e g veillonellaceae likely jointly converted methane into vfas then dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria e g rhodocyclaceae utilized the produced vfas to reduce perchlorate to chloride the detailed pathways under both oxygen regimes need to be elucidated by using isotope metagenomics

solid rocket fuels lubricating oils pyrotechnics and munitions motzer 2001 ye et al 2012 perchlorate concentration in groundwater is generally low 100 μg l logan and lapoint 2002 but in some regions e g groundwater contaminated by weapons industrial reserve plant its concentration can reach 20 mg l or more motzer 2001 perchlorate could pose serious health threats to human beings by interfering with the uptake of iodide and subsequently inhibiting thyroid hormone production borjan et al 2011 therefore maximum contaminant limits for perchlorate ranging from 2 to 18 μg l have been recommended for drinking water by several us states e g california gu and coates 2006 various treatment techniques have been proposed to remove perchlorate from contaminated waters including physical e g adsorption ion exchange and membrane filtration hristovski et al 2008 parette and cannon 2005 yoon et al 2009 chemical and biological processes ye et al 2012 among them microbial perchlorate reduction has been recognized as one of the most promising perchlorate treatment processes srinivasan and sorial 2009 heterotrophic perchlorate reduction using organic carbon e g acetate as electron donor has been substantially studied for decades kim and logan 2001 srinivasan and sorial 2009 while the supplement of organic carbon could potentially increase operational costs or stimulate microbial growth which results in a secondary pollution in water distribution system recently autotrophic perchlorate reduction has attracted more attention for example hydrogen driven perchlorate reduction has been developed to eliminate the perchlorate contamination in which hydrogen was provided as electron donor through hollow fiber membranes miller and logan 2000 nerenberg et al 2002 compared with hydrogen methane is a much widely available carbon source and could be generated in situ from methanogenesis process i e anaerobic methane production process thus making methane a promising electron donor for perchlorate removal microbial methane oxidation may occur under both aerobic and anoxic conditions under aerobic conditions aerobic methanotrophs oxidize methane to co2 by the catalysis of the enzyme methane monooxygenases mmo coupling the reduction of oxygen to water costa et al 2000 liu et al 2014 under anoxic conditions the anoxic oxidation of methane aom is mainly mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic anme archaea which activate methane by the methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr by coupling with reduction of various electron acceptors such as sulfate nitrate and ferric ion boetius et al 2000 cai et al 2018 haroon et al 2013 initially only sulfate was confirmed as an electron acceptor to drive aom process in a consortium of anme archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria boetius et al 2000 recently nitrite nitrate dependent anoxic methane oxidation n damo processes have been discovered haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera known as n damo bacteria which belongs to the nc10 phylum can perform aom coupling with nitrite reduction with nitrite as the sole electron acceptor intracellular oxygen could be produced through the no dismutation and then used to oxidize methane in n damo bacteria ettwig et al 2010 differently candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens known as n damo archaea affiliated with anme 2d can mediate aom coupling with nitrate reduction with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor methane is initially activated by mcr carried by n damo archaea through a reverse methanogenesis pathway haroon et al 2013 regarding microbial perchlorate reduction the pathway for heterotrophic perchlorate reducers starts with the reduction of perchlorate to chlorite and then chlorite might be converted to chloride and molecular oxygen through the catalysis of chlorite dismutase rikken et al 1996 however little is known whether and how perchlorate is reduced by utilizing methane as electron donor a recent study documented that perchlorate 5 mg l in influent could be removed by providing methane as sole electron donor in a lab scale reactor luo et al 2015 in this previous study oxygen was provided in influent to drive methane oxidation and aerobic methanotrophs were enriched under such micro aerobic conditions to date it is still unknown whether perchlorate could be reduced by methane under anoxic conditions although the reaction is thermodynamically feasible ch4 clo4 hco3 cl h2o δgo 928 kj mol ch4 furthermore it is also interesting to distinguish whether different perchlorate removal pathways would be employed in the presence and absence of oxygen when using methane as electron donor the first objective of this study was to attempt to couple perchlorate reduction to microbial methane oxidation by using methane as sole electron donor the second objective was to compare perchlorate removal performance and identify key communities in the presence and absence of oxygen in order to achieve these aims a methane based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr in which hollow fibre membranes were installed as gas diffusers to supply methane and to provide surfaces for the biofilm attachment considering n damo archaea and n damo bacteria carry natural enzymes that can activate methane the mbfr was initially inoculated with an enriched culture dominated by candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens and candidatus methylomirabilis obtained from a parent n damo anammox reactor in our lab haroon et al 2013 then perchlorate was fed as sole electron acceptor to test whether it was technically feasible to couple perchlorate reduction with methane oxidation under two oxygen regimes including the absence of oxygen refers to anoxic conditions below and the presence of oxygen limited oxygen was supplied refers to oxygen limiting conditions in order to evaluate the perchlorate removal capacity the mbfr was run for a long term period 1100 days at various hydraulic retention time hrt high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was carried out throughout the experimental period to identify the key microbes performing methane oxidation and perchlorate reduction it is expected that these results will advance our understanding of microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane as electron donor and guide us to design a process to remove perchlorate from contaminated groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup a laboratory scale mbfr system with working volume of 800 ml was set up in this study the detailed reactor configuration can be found in our previous study luo et al 2018b briefly the mbfr was equipped with eight bundles of composite hollow fibre membranes 200 μm inner diameter and 300 μm outer diameter mitsubishi japan and each bundle was bent to be u shaped with the end connected to methane gas cylinders 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia the gas pressure inside the hollow fibres was controlled at 150 kpa by a gas pressure regulator ross brown australia the bulk liquor in the mbfr system was mixed by a magnetic stirrer 500 rpm labtek australia and recirculated through a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 100 ml min masterflex usa a ph probe was mounted internally in the reactor and ph was controlled between 7 and 8 by manual injection of 1m hcl or 1 m naoh solutions twice per week considering n damo archaea and n damo bacteria carry natural enzymes that can activate methane the mbfr was inoculated with 150 ml of mixed culture acquired from a parent n damo reactor in our laboratory the parent reactor dominated by n damo archaea bacteria and anammox bacteria has achieved a mean nitrate removal rate of 1 4 mmol l d haroon et al 2013 the synthetic influent was prepared as follows unit g l if not specified kh2po4 0 038 mgcl2 6h2o 0 008 cacl2 2h2o 0 015 nh4cl 0 019 acidic trace elements 0 5 ml l and alkaline trace elements 0 2 ml l luo et al 2018b the influent was stored in a 5l container and sparged with n2 for 30 min dissolved oxygen do in influent was measured using a do meter hach usa and the concentration was always zero 2 2 mbfr operation the entire experiment operation of the mbfr lasted for 1152 days which was divided into three phases table s1 including phase i i e the start up phase day 0 258 phase ii anoxic conditions day 259 1026 and phase iii limited oxygen was supplied during day 1027 1152 in phase i in order to enrich biomass and achieve biofilm attachment on the membranes the inoculum mentioned above was added to the reactor and nitrate stock solution 40 g n l was dosed periodically as the growth substrates for n damo archaea via manual injection the initial nitrate concentration was 40 160 mg n l after each dosage phase ii consisted of three stages table s1 in stage i day 259 328 nitrate was switched to perchlorate by adding concentrated stock solution 3 6 g cl l giving an in reactor perchlorate concentration 4 5 12 mg cl l after each addition in stage ii day 329 530 the influent with a perchlorate concentration of 4 mg cl l was continuously fed into the mbfr at hrt of 5 days for stage iii day 531 1026 temperature was increased from 22 2 c to 35 2 c using water bath to investigate the effect of temperature on perchlorate removal efficiency hrt was gradually reduced from 5 days to 1 day by increasing influent flow rate during phase ii the absence of oxygen in mbfr during phases i and ii was tested and confirmed since a tubing without any oxygen permeability made of polyvinyl chloride was used for recirculation no oxygen transfer was observed in the mbfr after one day monitoring by a do probe hach hq40d the detection limit is 0 1 mg l differently during phase iii limited oxygen 10 mg l d was supplied through an oxygen permeable tubing for the recirculation tygon e lab tubing inter diameter 3 1 mm masterflex core parmer during the entire operational period liquid samples were taken from the reactor every two or three days to monitor the concentrations of nitrate only phase i perchlorate species and volatile fatty acids vfas 2 3 batch tests in order to clarify the mass evolution in perchlorate reduction process a batch test was conducted at stage iii of phase ii day 637 the continuous methane supply and perchlorate feeding were stopped and then fresh methane saturated mineral medium was added into the reactor to avoid any headspace afterwards 0 5 ml of concentrated perchlorate stock solution 3 6 g cl l was injected into the reactor liquid samples of 2 ml were taken every 8 h to determine concentrations of chlorine species and dissolved methane another batch test was conducted at phase iii to prove the role of vfas in methane driven perchlorate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions during this batch test perchlorate feeding was stopped while methane was still continuously supplied seven liquid samples were taken in one week to monitor the production of vfas 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of perchlorate chlorate chlorite and chloride in the effluent were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 after 0 22 μm filtration nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined on filtered samples using a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph gc with a supelco 6 feet 1 8 in stainless steel packed column hayesep q 80 100 and a flame ionization detector fid was utilized to monitor the dissolved methane concentration vfas were analysed by gc equipped with fid and a polar capillary column db ffap the ph values in the reactor were measured by a ph meter oakton australia for microbial analysis biofilm samples were scrapped off from different locations of the membranes and then mixed together with 2 ml bulk liquid on day 258 at the end of phase i day 469 stage ii of phase ii day 733 and 866 stage iii of phase ii and day 1075 phase iii to avoid oxygen intrusion into the system the sampling port was flushed with nitrogen during sampling periods dna from the biomass samples was extracted using the fastdna spin for soil kit mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacture s protocol the 16s rrna gene sequencing and data processing were conducted as described previously luo et al 2017 briefly the universal primer set 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgacgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtrc 3 was used to amplify the 16s rrna gene and then purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa high quality sequences at 97 similarity were obtained through quality control using trimmomatic and then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by qiime an otu table with the taxonomic classification were generated via alignment of representative otu sequences against greengenes database 3 results 3 1 performance of perchlorate reduction in the methane based mbfr biofilms able to oxidize methane were enriched during phase i by adding 150 ml inoculum dominated by two known anoxic methane oxidizers namely candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens n damo archaea and candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria a nitrate reduction rate of 1 7 9 6 mg n l d without nitrite accumulation was achieved during the 250 day operation of phase i fig s1 with biofilms gradually attached to the surface of membranes on day 251 the sole electron acceptor provided to the reactor was switched from nitrate to perchlorate in order to test the capability of enriched microbial communities to couple aom to perchlorate reduction interestingly a steady perchlorate reduction rate of 0 6 1 1 mg cl l d was achieved without observable accumulation of chlorate during the whole stage i of phase ii fig 1 indicating the produced chlorate and chlorite were simultaneously reduced during stage ii of phase ii synthetic medium containing 4 mg cl l perchlorate was continuously fed into the reactor over 90 of perchlorate removal efficiency was achieved at hrt of 5d fig 2 however the removal efficiency of perchlorate was decreased to 40 when hrt was reduced to 3d in order to improve the perchlorate removal efficiency the reactor operation temperature was increased from 22 2 c to 35 2 c after increasing temperature the perchlorate removal efficiency quickly recovered to 95 within one day and then 100 suggesting that temperature has a positive impact on perchlorate reduction the stimulatory effect of high temperature on anoxic perchlorate reduction has also been reported for enriched cultures using acetate as electron donors in which 50 mg l perchlorate was completely removed after 48 h at 20 c but taking only 24 h at 30 c wu et al 2008 in addition the effect of temperature ranging from 15 to 40 c has been investigated for the growth and activity of perchlorate reducing bacteria and the optimal temperature was suggested to be around 35 c zhu et al 2016 bruce et al 1999 in our experiment the removal efficiency of perchlorate gradually decreased to 40 60 after day 866 the reason for the decreased perchlorate removal efficiency was due to an accident that methane supply was stopped for one week day 868 875 this also indicates that microbial perchlorate reduction is linked with the methane availability in phase iii limited oxygen 10 mg l d was introduced into the reactor through the oxygen permeable tubing to test whether perchlorate reduction could be achieved in the presence of oxygen although no dissolved oxygen could be detected in the mbfr the perchlorate removal efficiency was immediately recovered to 100 and was stably maintained at 100 even when hrt was shortened to 0 25 d i e 6 h indicating oxygen diffusion into the reactor significantly improved the methane driven perchlorate reduction process in addition the produced chloride amount was close to the reduced perchlorate amount fig 2 when complete perchlorate removal efficiency was achieved indicating all of the perchlorate should be converted to chloride no other intermediate e g chlorite was observed during the entire operation period which is consistent with a previous study kim and logan 2001 they also reported that chloride was the only final product of microbial perchlorate reduction using acetate as the electron donor 3 2 production of vfas in the mbfrs in the presence of oxygen recently we found vfas could be generated as the intermediates of methane partial oxidation in methane based mbfr in particular with a limited oxygen supply chen et al 2018 luo et al 2017 2018b thus vfas were regularly monitored to elucidate whether vfas from methane partial oxidation also played a role in perchlorate reduction process results showed that no vfas were observed during phases i and ii under anoxic conditions however with the intrusion of oxygen in phase iii the accumulation of vfas comprising mainly acetic acid 33 95 and propionic acid 6 52 was detected with a maximum concentration reaching 259 mg l on day 1054 fig 3 however the residual vfas gradually decreased to 1 0 mg l at the end of phase iii likely due to more consumption of vfas as carbon sources to drive perchlorate reduction at shorter hrt correspondingly complete perchlorate removal could be achieved when residual vfas were available in the mbfr in presence of oxygen i e phase iii considering the production of vfas was not detected under anoxic conditions phase i and ii the introduction of oxygen might be a triggering factor for vfas production in methane based mbfrs which is consistent with our recent study chen et al 2018 3 3 microbial community structure under both oxygen regimes the 16s rrna gene sequencing was employed to investigate microbial community structure of the inoculum day 0 the nitrate influenced biofilm day 258 phase i and the evolution of perchlorate influenced biofilm three samples on days 469 733 and 866 in phase ii and one sample on day1075 in phase iii results showed that candidatus methanoperedens n damo archaea a phycisphaerales unclassified genus and candidatus methylomirabilis n damo bacteria dominated in the inoculum 80 of the total sequences fig 4 after 258 days of nitrate feeding under anoxic conditions n damo archaea became the dominating member in microbial population accounting for 54 of the total microbial sequences such microbial communities can match the reactor performance in which nitrate reduction was efficiently achieved in phase i by feeding nitrate as the sole electron acceptor however after replacing the electron acceptor nitrate with perchlorate the relative abundance of n damo archaea sharply decreased to 1 8 in the biofilm on day 469 0 5 on day 733 0 6 on day 866 and finally disappeared from the biofilm on day 1075 in addition n damo bacteria were also gradually washed out from the perchlorate influenced biofilm 1 2 on day 469 0 1 on day 733 0 1 on day 866 and be undetected on day 1075 these results indicate that both n damo archaea and n damo bacteria might not play a major role in methane oxidation or perchlorate reduction in phase iii surprisingly the families of methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae which have been recognized as aerobic methanotrophs mcdonald et al 2008 became the dominating methane related organisms in the biofilm on day 733 11 in total and day 866 3 7 in total the decrease of relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs could be caused by the decrease of hrt from 3 day to 1 day in which higher perchlorate loading might be toxic to aerobic methanotrophs the presence of aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions has also been reported in other studies martinez cruz et al 2017 after the limited oxygen 10 mg l d was supplied to the reactor phase iii the relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae decreased from 3 7 on day 866 to 3 2 on day 1075 in contrast the relative abundance of methanosarcina known as methanogenic archaea zehnder and brock 1979 was significantly increase from 0 4 on day 866 to 9 1 on day 1075 in addition veillonellaceae as a fermenter with metabolic capability to produce acetic acid and propionic acid by the fermentation of carbohydrates lecomte et al 2015 also increased its relative abundance from 0 4 on day 866 phase ii without oxygen supply to 9 1 on day 1075 phase iii with oxygen supply the significant increase of methanogenic archaea and fermenters after introducing oxygen has also been reported in our recent study chen et al 2018 in which a high rate vfa production could be achieved from methane bioconversion by methanogens and acid producing bacteria under oxygen limiting conditions in addition methanogenic archaea have been suggested to be able to reverse methanogenesis and mediate methane oxidation producing methanol and acetate as oxidation product zehnder and brock 1979 interestingly two new genera including denitratisoma 34 on day 469 6 0 on day 733 8 7 on day 866 0 2 on day 1075 and a unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus 5 0 on day 469 17 on day 733 13 on day 866 22 on day 1075 which both belong to the rhodocyclaceae family became the dominating microbes in the perchlorate fed biofilm under both anoxic and oxygen limiting conditions perchlorate and nitrate have been shown to be reduced by the same nitrate reductase enzyme hackenthal et al 1964 suggesting nitrate reducing bacteria denitratisoma might also be able to reduce perchlorate in addition the phylogenetic tree of 16s rrna genes of the unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus in the biofilm was established in comparison with phylogenetically close sequences figs s2 and si the sequences are phylogenetically aligned with the genus denitratisoma and azospira that have previously been shown to be able to reduce perchlorate byrne bailey and coates 2012 oren 2014 collectively these results suggest that the genera denitratisoma and this rhodocyclaceae genus could be the potential perchlorate reducers in the mbfr 4 discussion 4 1 potential mechanisms of perchlorate reduction coupled to methane oxidation in the present work we reported that perchlorate reduction could be achieved in the methane based mbfr under two oxygen regimes both the presence and absence of oxygen conditions but employing different communities or pathways to prove whether perchlorate reduction was coupled to methane oxidation under anoxic conditions a batch test was conducted at stage ii of phase ii fig s3 both methane consumption and perchlorate reduction proceeded during this batch test suggesting the occurrence of microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane under anoxic conditions perchlorate 0 11 mg cl l h was reduced to chloride 0 12 mg cl l h as the main final product resulting in a chloride to perchlorate mole ratio of 1 10 which is approximately similar to the theoretically expected value of 1 however the anoxic oxidation rate of coupled methane was only 1 17 μmol l h giving a methane to perchlorate mole ratio of 0 39 lower than the theoretically stoichiometry ratio of 1 ch4 clo4 hco3 cl h2o this discrepancy implies the possible presence of a second electron donor for perchlorate reduction such as some extracellular polymeric substances and intracellular storage compounds lai et al 2018a 2018b in terms of 16s rrna gene sequencing results microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane appears to be completed via a partnership between multiple microorganisms under anoxic conditions during phase ii aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae were substantially presented and some potential perchlorate reducers likely denitratisoma and a unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus belonging to the rhodocyclaceae family were dominant under anoxic conditions it is assumed that the occurrence of aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions might be due to the oxygen derived from dismutation of chlorite by perchlorate reducing bacteria which has been reported in a previous study rikken et al 1996 however it was also suggested that oxygen released from chlorite dismutation during perchlorate reduction might not be sufficient to aerobic methanotrophs miller et al 2014 further studies are required to confirm the release of intracellular oxygen during perchlorate reduction moreover perchlorate reducers in the rhodocyclaceae family are often heterotrophic bruce et al 1999 byrne bailey and coates 2012 which means they need organic carbons e g acetate to reduce perchlorate thus it is hypothesized that methane driven perchlorate reduction under anoxic conditions might be completed through synergetic interactions between aerobic methanotrophs likely methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae and dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria likely denitratisoma and a unclassified rhodocyclaceae genus as illustrated in fig s5a methane might be oxidized by methanotrophs in which some unknown intermediates might be produced and simultaneously utilized to reduce perchlorate heterotrophically by potential perchlorate reducing bacteria we tried to identify these intermediates during phase ii under anoxic conditions yet no organic intermediates ethanol or vfas were detected in this mbfr this indicates that possible intermediates generated by methane oxidation may have been completely consumed by perchlorate reducing bacteria or other unknown intermediates or intracellular storages have been formed furthermore the contribution from n damo microorganisms on perchlorate reduction cannot be completely ruled out in this study even though n damo archaea was detected only with a relative abundance of 0 5 1 8 during phase ii under anoxic conditions one evidence for perchlorate reduction by n damo archaea was that perchlorate could be immediately reduced by biofilms with abundant n damo archaea after switching electron acceptor from nitrate to perchlorate previous studies also documented that candidatus methanoperedens might have versatile metabolisms to reduce various electron acceptors to anoxically oxidize methane including nitrate selenate or ferric ion ettwig et al 2016 luo et al 2018a it is required to further investigate the potential of anme 2d to independently reduce perchlorate by long term enrichment in the future in the presence of oxygen vfas were detected as intermediates of methane partial oxidation followed by utilization of produced vfas during perchlorate reduction during days 1027 1138 the accumulation of vfas were observed when limited oxygen was introduced into the mbfr a batch test further confirmed the role of vfas at the later stage of phase iii when no residual vfa could be detected in the mbfr during this batch test perchlorate was not added in influent but the obvious accumulation of vfas was observed again fig s4 suggesting vfas should be utilized as the electron donors for perchlorate reduction when perchlorate is available based on reactor performance and 16s rrna gene sequencing we also proposed that methane driven perchlorate reduction under oxygen limiting conditions might be mediated through a microbial consortium fig s5b but with different key players for activating methane compared with those under anoxic conditions according to the 16s rrna gene sequencing results the relative abundance of methanosarcina known as methanogens and veillonellaceae were significantly increased after supplying limited oxygen however the abundances of aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae were decreased to be 3 2 of the total sequences our recent study reported that the methanogen i e methanosarcina and acid producing bacteria e g sporolactobacillus and propionispora could jointly convert methane into vfas chen et al 2018 here we proposed that methanosarcina and veillonellaceae might jointly oxidized methane into vfas as intermediates which were then used by potential perchlorate reducing bacteria likely denitratisoma and a rhodocyclaceae unclassified genus to heterotrophically reduce perchlorate to chloride fig s5b it should be noted that the detailed pathways for both oxygen conditions need to be elucidated by isotope metagenomics and meta transcriptomics studies in the future first it is still unclear how methane could be converted into vfas in addition the roles of methanogens and perchlorate reducers should be further identified by multiple molecular methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction metagenomics and meta transcriptomics answers to these research questions will provide insights to microbial methane oxidation couples with perchlorate reduction 4 2 practical implications previous studies have documented that perchlorate could be heterotrophically reduced with various organic compounds as electron donors or autotrophically reduced with hydrogen as electron donor in various perchlorate contaminated waters kim and logan 2001 miller and logan 2000 nerenberg et al 2002 in this study we demonstrated that microbial perchlorate reduction could be achieved in both the presence and absence of oxygen conditions by using methane as the sole electron donor the methane supported perchlorate removal rate 4 0 mg cl l d under anoxic conditions in this work is relatively lower than the reported rates in hydrogen based mbfrs 20 118 mg cl l d miller and logan 2000 nerenberg and rittmann 2004 or even lower than the obtained rates 19 7 mg cl l d in methane based mbfr under micro aerobic conditions luo et al 2015 however the perchlorate removal rates 16 mg cl l d achieved at hrt of 0 25 d fig 2 in the presence of oxygen were higher than the rate in absence of oxygen suggesting a limited oxygen supply would be beneficial for improving perchlorate removal rate considering oxygen is commonly detected in shallow groundwater or wastewater datry et al 2004 anoxic conditions might not be promising or suggested for practical perchlorate removal from contaminated water the obtained perchlorate removal rate is still relatively low which could be further increased by optimising oxygen supply rate and methane partial pressure in further studies 5 conclusions in this study microbial perchlorate reduction was achieved using methane as the sole electron donor in an mbfr both in the presence and absence of oxygen the methane driven perchlorate removal rates in the presence of oxygen is more promising to apply into groundwater remediation compared to absence of oxygen in spite of the occurrence of oxygen perchlorate reduction driven by methane might be mediated via synergetic interactions by a microbial consortium under anoxic conditions aerobic methanotrophs likely methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae might micro aerobically oxidize methane by utilizing internal oxygen from microbial perchlorate reduction which might be mediated by rhodocyclaceae differently under oxygen limiting conditions methanogens e g methanosarcina and fermenters e g veillonellaceae likely jointly converted methane into vfas then dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria e g rhodocyclaceae utilized the produced vfas to reduce perchlorate to chloride the detailed pathways under both oxygen regimes need to be elucidated by using isotope metagenomics

18881,background pseudomonas aeruginosa pa is an important opportunistic pathogen that thrives best in the distal elements of plumbing and waste water systems although nosocomial outbreaks of pa have been associated with water sources the role of the plumbing system of healthcare premises as a reservoir for this pathogen is still unclear materials and methods we collected water samples from 12 technical areas distant from any medical activity in a teaching hospital in france once a week for 11 weeks we used a method that resuscitates persister cells because of the nutrient poor conditions and the presence of inhibitors e g chlorine and copper ions briefly water was sampled in sterile bottles containing 100 μm of the copper ion chelating agent diethyldithiocarbamate ddtc a portion of the samples was immediately filtered through 0 45 μm membranes deposited on r2a agar plates and incubated seven days at 22 c following european recommendations the remaining water was incubated 14 days at 22 c and then filtered and cultured on r2a blood or cetrimide containing agar plates pa isolates were identified by ms maldi tof genotyped by pfge and wgs and tested for survival in a 150 μg l copper ii sulphate solution results although the 12 water sampling points always tested negative with the recommended method 67 were positive at least once for pa with the adapted method i e with ddtc the 14 pa persister isolates found throughout the plumbing system were clonal and belong to the high risk clone st308 their genome harbours a 37 kb genomic island gi 7 containing 13 genes linked to copper resistance st308 survived better in the copper solution than comparators that did not harbour gi 7 p aeruginosa strains pao1 pa14 and st235 the deletion of gi 7 in st308 abrogated its tolerance to copper the gi 7 nucleotide sequence shares 98 and 72 identity with sequences from the environmental species pseudomonas putida and the phytopathogenic species pseudomonas syringae respectively conclusion we report the contamination of the plumbing system of a healthcare premises by persister cells of the high risk clone p aeruginosa st308 new recommendations for the monitoring of water contamination should consider persister cells the genomic island gi 7 which confers tolerance to copper probably originates from pseudomonas species found in copper contaminated soils and plants

and copper containing materials are widely used for pipes and fixtures of plumbing systems leading to the release of copper ions into the drinking water dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 in addition copper is widely used as a biocide in agriculture and as a growth promoter in animal production this metal thus heavily contaminates soil directly treated with copper sulphate or exposed to copper containing manure nunes et al 2016 here we screened the plumbing system of a healthcare premises for p aeruginosa using a method that resuscitates persister cells we used pulsed field gel electrophoresis whole genome sequencing and gene inactivation to determine the population structure of the bacterial isolates found in the water network and identify the biological features that may have helped the strains

genomic island in p aeruginosa we constructed a gi 7 deletion mutant by using overlapping pcr and recombination events as previously described kaniga et al 1991 briefly 750 bp located up and downstream of the gi 7 region was amplified by pcr using the specific primer pairs gi7 5 fw agccaagcaccaggtctatt gi7 5 rev aggcagatgatctggcggtaagtaggct and gi7 3 fw gccagatcatctgccttgggtcatgtca gi7 3

pcr cloning kit invitrogen carlsbad united states and subcloned it into the suicide vector pkng101 in the e coli cc118λpir strain previously digested with bamhi apai restriction enzymes we transferred the recombinant suicide vector in the p aeruginosa pa 8 isolate by triparental conjugation transconjugants were selected on pseudomonas isolation agar supplemented with 2000 mg l streptomycin homologous recombination was obtained after selection of transconjugants on m9 minimal medium 42 mm na2hpo4 22 mm kh2po4 19 mm nh4cl and 8 5 mm nacl supplemented with 5 sucrose the deletion of 27 288 bp in the p aeruginosa pa 8δgi 7 isolate was confirmed by pcr and sequencing 2 9 survival in copper solution for all tested p aeruginosa isolates an overnight culture in luria bertani broth lbb biorad was diluted 1 200 into fresh lbb and further incubated at 37 c under gentle shaking until mid log phase the bacterial suspension was then centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min the pellet was washed once and resuspended in sterile deionized water bacteria were suspended in a 150 μg l copper ii sulphate solution sigma aldrich to obtain a concentration of 108 bacteria ml which was further incubated for 24 h at 22 c in the dark we chose a concentration of 150 μg l as it was the highest value retrieved at a p aeruginosa positive faucet initial and final bacterial concentrations were determined by plating the appropriate dilutions on lb agar biorad and incubating overnight at 37 c the ratios of the final and initial bacterial concentrations determined the survival rates we repeated each experiment six times independently for all isolates we used the p aeruginosa reference strains pao1 and pa14 and a clinical isolate of st235 strain pa1646 pitié salpêtrière university hospital paris france as controls 2 10 statistical analysis we used rstudio software version 3 2 2 boston usa for all statistical analysis the significance of the differences in bacterial survival in copper ii sulphate solution between the various tested p aeruginosa isolates was determined by the analysis of variance anova a multiple comparison test tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test was performed when the anova detected a significant statistical difference the chosen significance threshold was 0 05 for all tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination of the hospital plumbing system by p aeruginosa none of the 132 water samples tested was found to be positive for p aeruginosa using the method recommended by the english and french technical guidelines health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 nf en iso 16266 2008 nf en iso 19458 2006 in contrast the use of the copper ion chelating agent associated with a sample incubation of 14 days adapted method resuscitated 14 persister isolates of p aeruginosa from 11 samples 8 3 persister isolates found with the adapted method grew on r2a agar n 8 columbia agar supplemented with 5 horse blood n 4 or cetrimide containing agar n 2 overall eight of 12 sampling points were positive at least once for p aeruginosa with the four buildings and two water inlets being positive for the pathogen table 1 3 2 recommended methods failed to detect persister cells of p aeruginosa all p aeruginosa isolates were only able to grow after a 14 day incubation with the copper chelator dttc which relieves bacteria of copper inhibition dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 persister cells are not immediately culturable on media upon which the species is usually able to growth however resuscitated cells recover their full virulence as shown by cell and murine models dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 li et al 2014 the guidelines for water testing recommend water sampling in thiosulphate containing bottles followed by immediate 0 45 μm filtration and culture on agar media health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 nf en iso 16266 2008 in our hands this method did not allow the growth of persister cells of p aeruginosa hence all the water sampling points n 12 tested negative with the recommended techniques whereas eight 67 were positive for p aeruginosa with the adapted method four of the 12 sampling sites in the plumbing system two unused showers and two unused faucets were not operated according to the acknowledged rules health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 three were positive for p aeruginosa confirming that water stagnation in backwater degrades the microbiological quality of water health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 in addition although the treatment of water with a copper chelator allowed the detection of p aeruginosa persister cells in the plumbing system of the premises this method was not quantitative however as a p aeruginosa count of 1 cfu 100 ml is already considered to be unsatisfactory health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 nf en iso 16266 2008 the quantification of the pathogen is of minor importance enhancing the performance of the detection of p aeruginosa in the plumbing system of healthcare premises will expedite decontamination measures of the drinking water installation and would reduce the risk of contamination of regularly used water points their colonization by the bacterial pathogen and subsequent transmission to patients 3 3 a single st308 p aeruginosa clone colonized the entire uhb plumbing system the 14 p aeruginosa isolates of the present collection displayed a typical morphology and were fully susceptible to all antibiotics tested data not shown we tested the genetic relatedness of the 14 p aeruginosa isolates using pfge and found that they all shared the same pulsotype supplementary fig s1 four isolates were selected for genome sequencing table 1 pa 3 and pa 6 were isolated from the two main water inlets and isolates pa 8 and pa 12 came from the water network of the blue and grey buildings respectively their genomes were constructed by de novo assembly in silico mlst revealed that the four sequenced isolates belong to clone st308 the pfge data were confirmed by cgmlst which found 20 different alleles between the four isolates thus confirming the clonality of the collection mellmann et al 2016 we also assessed the genetic distance between our local st308 clone and representatives of the p aeruginosa species this collection included the genomes of i other st308 isolates ii isolates of high risk clones st111 st175 st233 st235 st277 and st395 responsible for outbreaks in healthcare settings and the two reference strains pao1 and pa14 supplementary table s1 as expected our local st308 clone clustered with the four other st308 representatives fig 2 the other tested genomes were distributed between two major phylogenetic groups one including pao1 and the other pa14 as previously shown freschi et al 2015 the st308 and st235 isolates belong to the pa14 group and the high risk clones st111 st175 st233 st277 and st395 belong to the pao1 group the survival and persistence of p aeruginosa in the harsh environment of the plumbing system of the healthcare premises presumably relies on its ability to form persiter cells within biofilms and colonize free living amoebae which offer the bacterial pathogen protection against hostile conditions and act as a vehicle of dissemination bédard et al 2016 2014 hota et al 2009 september et al 2007 wingender and flemming 2011 the presence of a single st308 clone in the drinking water installation could either be due to monoclonal inoculation from the water supply system of the city or intraspecific competition through the production of pyocins won by this particular clone michel briand and baysse 2002 3 4 p aeruginosa st308 is an emerging high risk clone although no outbreak of p aeruginosa st308 has occurred thus far among patients hospitalized in the uhb carbapenem resistant isolates of this clone have already been retrieved in the u bends of the haematology unit varin et al 2017 however two hospital outbreaks of p aeruginosa st308 involving the environment have been recently described in europe first a multidrug resistant st308 clone that produces the metallo β lactamase imp 8 spread throughout the haematological oncological unit of a german hospital over three years where the environment was a reservoir for patient contamination willmann et al 2015 second p aeruginosa st308 caused a five year outbreak in patients in a french hospital and persisted for an additional four years in the hospital environment causing sporadic infections abdouchakour et al 2018 here again the environment was identified as the likely source and reservoir of the outbreak in addition clone st308 can also produce β lactamases of ambler class a ges 7 and class b imp 1 imp 8 imp 13 imp 45 imp 63 and vim 2 oliver et al 2015 liapis et al 2018 overall p aeruginosa st308 is a high risk clone which can locally acquire resistance determinants that possibly originated from the water distribution system 3 5 st308 isolates are tolerant to copper due to genomic island gi 7 the concentration of cu2 in the water at the eight sampling points that tested positive for p aeruginosa ranged from 0 6 0 006 to 143 9 1 9 μg l table 1 these concentrations are below the maximum acceptable concentration of 2000 μg l defined by french and european standards and the world health organization however the presence of st308 in this copper containing water led us to test its survival in such hostile conditions we compared the survival of isolate pa 8 representative of the st308 clone that contaminates the uhb water network with that of the p aeruginosa reference strains pao1 and pa14 and strain pa1646 a representative of the major epidemic high risk clone st235 in a copper containing solution pcr experiments confirmed that the genomes of pao1 pa14 and pa1646 st235 do not harbour gi 7 data not shown the pa 8 isolate survived better in a 150 μg l copper solution than the reference strains pao1 pa14 and pa1646 st235 fig 3 we therefore searched for genetic elements that could confer tolerance to copper and aide in the implantation of st308 in the plumbing system analysis of the sequenced genomes of four uhb contaminating st308 isolates retrieved a 36 905 bp genomic island that contains 13 genes encoding copper resistance mechanisms fig 4 among them the genes czcc czcb and czca encode an outer membrane protein an adaptor subunit and an efflux pump respectively these proteins form the heavy metal rnd efflux pump czcabc that has already been described in p aeruginosa and p putida this zinc and copper induced pump confers resistance to heavy metals chong et al 2016 leedjärv et al 2008 the gene copg encodes a hypothetical export protein copm is a cytochrome c oxidase involved in electron transport behlau et al 2011 copa copb and copz are a copper binding protein an exporting atpase and a chaperone respectively chong et al 2016 navarro et al 2016 the copa and copb genes constitute an operon encoding a putative metal binding protein and a copper oxidase described in clinical isolates of p aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii and the environmental species pseudomonas syringae and xanthomonas sp behlau et al 2011 teitzel et al 2006 teixeira et al 2008 williams et al 2016 copa and copb bind copper ions in the periplasm and outer membrane respectively teitzel et al 2006 gi 7 also encodes two copper binding plastocyanins and a copper abc transporter involved in copper homeostasis and or transport chong et al 2016 quaranta et al 2007 finally the two regulator genes cops and copr encode proteins that form a two component signal transduction system behlau et al 2011 we confirmed the role of gi 7 in the tolerance of st308 to copper in solution by deleting the entire genomic island by chromosomal recombination and testing the survival of the deleted mutant named pa 8δgi 7 under the same conditions as those previously used as expected the deletion of gi 7 significantly decreased the tolerance of st308 in a 150 μg l copper ii sulphate solution relative to its wildtype parent fig 3 moreover the pa 8δgi 7 mutant had a tolerance to copper similar to that of the other comparators i e pao1 pa14 pa1646 st235 thus gi 7 plays an important role in the copper tolerance of st308 which may have helped the implantation of p aeruginosa in the plumbing system and could further promote contamination of the water outlets waste water system and patients in addition the survival of copper tolerant bacteria in the water distribution and plumbing systems may be favoured by their enhanced resistance to amoebic predation hence hao et al 2016 showed that copper resistance determinants in p aeruginosa play crucial roles in bacterial resistance to predation by amoeba which are prevalent in water distribution systems delafont et al 2013 3 6 gi 7 probably originated from environmental pseudomonas and spread among high risk clones of p aeruginosa gi 7 has the features of a transposable element with a transposase encoding gene together with direct and indirect repeats flanking the transposon fig 4 we blasted gi 7 against the ncbi database and found it in the genomes of 11 p aeruginosa clinical isolates with 99 identity supplementary table s2 two st308 isolates from the usa and mexico harboured gi 7 this genomic island was also found in the genomes of three isolates of p aeruginosa st395 amongst which dhs01 was the representative of a clone responsible for a long term outbreak in the uhb with identified environmental reservoirs bertrand et al 2000 petitjean et al 2017 gi 7 was also found in the genomes of the sporadic st198 and st309 clones as well as isolates of the high risk international clones st111 and st253 interestingly an isolate of the environmental species pseudomonas putida displayed a sequence that shared 98 identity with that of st308 p putida typically inhabits soil and water and is occasionally isolated from hospitalized patients molina et al 2013 gi 7 was also found in the genome of the phytopathogenic pseudomonas syringae pv actinidiae strain sr198 monteil et al 2016 with 72 identity these two environmental species are constantly exposed to this heavy metal copper derived biocides e g copper sulphate have been extensively used in wood impregnation stations and agriculture and as an animal feed additive since the mid 18th century hobman and crossman 2015 nunes et al 2016 making copper one of the most common soil contaminants for example copper contamination can reach 57 5 mg kg dry weight of soil in europe heijerick et al 2006 plant and soil associated species have thus accumulated resistance determinants to tolerate the presence of copper hobman and crossman 2015 nunes et al 2016 overall gi 7 likely emerged in environmental pseudomonas species before its transfer to the high risk clones of p aeruginosa st308 st395 st111 and st253 4 conclusion we report the contamination of the plumbing system of a healthcare premises by persister cells of p aeruginosa st308 new recommendations for the monitoring of water contamination should account for persister cells to trigger decontamination measures of the drinking water installation and reduce the risk of contamination of regularly used water points the genomic island gi 7 which confers copper tolerance to this emerging high risk clone probably originated from soil and plant associated pseudomonas species agricultural practices may have unexpectedly selected copper tolerant pathogens that can survive in drinking water installations of hospitals resulting in the potential

18881,background pseudomonas aeruginosa pa is an important opportunistic pathogen that thrives best in the distal elements of plumbing and waste water systems although nosocomial outbreaks of pa have been associated with water sources the role of the plumbing system of healthcare premises as a reservoir for this pathogen is still unclear materials and methods we collected water samples from 12 technical areas distant from any medical activity in a teaching hospital in france once a week for 11 weeks we used a method that resuscitates persister cells because of the nutrient poor conditions and the presence of inhibitors e g chlorine and copper ions briefly water was sampled in sterile bottles containing 100 μm of the copper ion chelating agent diethyldithiocarbamate ddtc a portion of

the 14 pa persister isolates found throughout the plumbing system were clonal and belong to the high risk clone st308 their genome harbours a 37 kb genomic island gi 7 containing 13 genes linked to

was diluted 1 200 into fresh lbb and further incubated at 37 c under gentle shaking until mid log phase the bacterial suspension was then centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min the pellet was washed once and resuspended in sterile deionized water bacteria were suspended in a 150 μg l copper ii sulphate solution sigma aldrich to obtain a concentration of 108 bacteria ml which was further incubated for 24 h at 22 c in the dark we chose a concentration of 150 μg l as it was the highest value retrieved at a p aeruginosa positive faucet initial and final bacterial concentrations were determined by plating the appropriate dilutions on lb agar biorad and incubating overnight at 37 c the ratios of the final and initial bacterial concentrations determined the survival rates we repeated each experiment six times independently for all isolates we used the p aeruginosa reference strains pao1 and pa14 and a clinical isolate of st235 strain pa1646 pitié salpêtrière university hospital paris france as controls 2 10 statistical analysis we used rstudio software version 3 2 2 boston usa for all statistical analysis the significance of the differences in bacterial survival in copper ii sulphate solution between the various tested p aeruginosa isolates was determined by the analysis of variance anova a multiple comparison test tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test was performed when the anova detected a significant statistical difference the chosen significance threshold was 0 05 for all tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination of the hospital plumbing system by p aeruginosa none of the 132 water samples tested was found to be positive for p aeruginosa using the method recommended by the english and french technical guidelines health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 nf en iso 16266 2008 nf en iso 19458 2006 in contrast the use of the copper ion chelating agent associated with a sample incubation of 14 days adapted method resuscitated 14 persister isolates of p aeruginosa from 11 samples 8 3 persister isolates found with the adapted method grew on r2a agar n 8 columbia agar supplemented with 5 horse blood n 4 or cetrimide containing agar n 2 overall eight of 12 sampling points were positive at least once for p aeruginosa with the four buildings and two water inlets being positive for the pathogen table 1 3 2 recommended methods failed to detect persister cells of p aeruginosa all p aeruginosa isolates were only able to grow after a 14 day incubation with the copper chelator dttc which relieves bacteria of copper inhibition dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 persister cells are not immediately culturable on media upon which the species is usually able to growth however resuscitated cells recover their full virulence as shown by cell and murine models dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 li et al 2014 the guidelines for water testing recommend water sampling in thiosulphate containing bottles followed by immediate 0 45 μm filtration and culture on agar media health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 nf en iso 16266 2008 in our hands this method did not allow the growth of persister cells of p aeruginosa hence all the water sampling points n 12 tested negative with the recommended techniques whereas eight 67 were positive for p aeruginosa with the adapted method four of the 12 sampling sites in the plumbing system two unused showers and two unused faucets were not operated according to the acknowledged rules health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 three were positive for p aeruginosa confirming that water stagnation in backwater degrades the microbiological quality of water health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 in addition although the treatment of water with a copper chelator allowed the detection of p aeruginosa persister cells in the plumbing system of the premises this method was not quantitative however as a p aeruginosa count of 1 cfu 100 ml is already considered to be unsatisfactory health technical memorandum 04 01 2016 nf en iso 16266 2008 the quantification of the pathogen is of minor importance enhancing the performance of the detection of p aeruginosa in the plumbing system of healthcare premises will expedite decontamination measures of the drinking water installation and would reduce the risk of contamination of regularly used water points their colonization by the bacterial pathogen and subsequent transmission to patients 3 3 a single st308 p aeruginosa clone colonized the entire uhb plumbing system the 14 p aeruginosa isolates of the present collection displayed a typical morphology and were fully susceptible to all antibiotics tested data not shown we tested the genetic relatedness of the 14 p aeruginosa isolates using pfge and found that they all shared the same pulsotype supplementary fig s1 four isolates were selected for genome sequencing table 1 pa 3 and pa 6 were isolated from the two main water inlets and isolates pa 8 and pa 12 came from the water network of the blue and grey buildings respectively their genomes were constructed by de novo assembly in silico mlst revealed that the four sequenced isolates belong to clone st308 the pfge data were confirmed by cgmlst which found 20 different alleles between the four isolates thus confirming the clonality of the collection mellmann et al 2016 we also assessed the genetic distance between our local st308 clone and representatives of the p aeruginosa species this collection included the genomes of i other st308 isolates ii isolates of high risk clones st111 st175 st233 st235 st277 and st395 responsible for outbreaks in healthcare settings and the two reference strains pao1 and pa14 supplementary table s1 as expected our local st308 clone clustered with the four other st308 representatives fig 2 the other tested genomes were distributed between two major phylogenetic groups one including pao1 and the other pa14 as previously shown freschi et al 2015 the st308 and st235 isolates belong to the pa14 group and the high risk clones st111 st175 st233 st277 and st395 belong to the pao1 group the survival and persistence of p aeruginosa in the harsh environment of the plumbing system of the healthcare premises presumably relies on its ability to form persiter cells within biofilms and colonize free living amoebae which offer the bacterial pathogen protection against hostile conditions and act as a vehicle of dissemination bédard et al 2016 2014 hota et al 2009 september et al 2007 wingender and flemming 2011 the presence of a single st308 clone in the drinking water installation could either be due to monoclonal inoculation from the water supply system of the city or intraspecific competition through the production of pyocins won by this particular clone michel briand and baysse 2002 3 4 p aeruginosa st308 is an emerging high risk clone although no outbreak of p aeruginosa st308 has occurred thus far among patients hospitalized in the uhb carbapenem resistant isolates of this clone have already been retrieved in the u bends of the haematology unit varin et al 2017 however two hospital outbreaks of p aeruginosa st308 involving the environment have been recently described in europe first a multidrug resistant st308 clone that produces the metallo β lactamase imp 8 spread throughout the haematological oncological unit of a german hospital over three years where the environment was a reservoir for patient contamination willmann et al 2015 second p aeruginosa st308 caused a five year outbreak in patients in a french hospital and persisted for an additional four years in the hospital environment causing sporadic infections abdouchakour et al 2018 here again the environment was identified as the likely source and reservoir of the outbreak in addition clone st308 can also produce β lactamases of ambler class a ges 7 and class b imp 1 imp 8 imp 13 imp 45 imp 63 and vim 2 oliver et al 2015 liapis et al 2018 overall p aeruginosa st308 is a high risk clone which can locally acquire resistance determinants that possibly originated from the water distribution system 3 5 st308 isolates are tolerant to copper due to genomic island gi 7 the concentration of cu2 in the water at the eight sampling points that tested positive for p aeruginosa ranged from 0 6 0 006 to 143 9 1 9 μg l table 1 these concentrations are below the maximum acceptable concentration of 2000 μg l defined by french and european standards and the world health organization however the presence of st308 in this copper containing water led us to test its survival in such hostile conditions we compared the survival of isolate pa 8 representative of the st308 clone that contaminates the uhb water network with that of the p aeruginosa reference strains pao1 and pa14 and strain pa1646 a representative of the major epidemic high risk clone st235 in a copper containing solution pcr experiments confirmed that the genomes of pao1 pa14 and pa1646 st235 do not harbour gi 7 data not shown the pa 8 isolate survived better in a 150 μg l copper solution than the reference strains pao1 pa14 and pa1646 st235 fig 3 we therefore searched for genetic elements that could confer tolerance to copper and aide in the implantation of st308 in the plumbing system analysis of the sequenced genomes of four uhb contaminating st308 isolates retrieved a 36 905 bp genomic island that contains 13 genes encoding copper resistance mechanisms fig 4 among them the genes czcc czcb and czca encode an outer membrane protein an adaptor subunit and an efflux pump respectively these proteins form the heavy metal rnd efflux pump czcabc that has already been described in p aeruginosa and p putida this zinc and copper induced pump confers resistance to heavy metals chong et al 2016 leedjärv et al 2008 the gene copg encodes a hypothetical export protein copm is a cytochrome c oxidase involved in electron transport behlau et al 2011 copa copb and copz are a copper binding protein an exporting atpase and a chaperone respectively chong et al 2016 navarro et al 2016 the copa and copb genes constitute an operon encoding a putative metal binding protein and a copper oxidase described in clinical isolates of p aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii and the environmental species pseudomonas syringae and xanthomonas sp behlau et al 2011 teitzel et al 2006 teixeira et al 2008 williams et al 2016 copa and copb bind copper ions in the periplasm and outer membrane respectively teitzel et al 2006 gi 7 also encodes two copper binding plastocyanins and a copper abc transporter involved in copper homeostasis and or transport chong et al 2016 quaranta et al 2007 finally the two regulator genes cops and copr encode proteins that form a two component signal transduction system behlau et al 2011 we confirmed the role of gi 7 in the tolerance of st308 to copper in solution by deleting the entire genomic island by chromosomal recombination and testing the survival of the deleted mutant named pa 8δgi 7 under the same conditions as those previously used as expected the deletion of gi 7 significantly decreased the tolerance of st308 in a 150 μg l copper ii sulphate solution relative to its wildtype parent fig 3 moreover the pa 8δgi 7 mutant had a tolerance to copper similar to that of the other comparators i e pao1 pa14 pa1646 st235 thus gi 7 plays an important role in the copper tolerance of st308 which may have helped the implantation of p aeruginosa in the plumbing system and could further promote contamination of the water outlets waste water system and patients in addition the survival of copper tolerant bacteria in the water distribution and plumbing systems may be favoured by their enhanced resistance to amoebic predation hence hao et al 2016 showed that copper resistance determinants in p aeruginosa play crucial roles in bacterial resistance to predation by amoeba which are prevalent in water distribution systems delafont et al 2013 3 6 gi 7 probably originated from environmental pseudomonas and spread among high risk clones of p aeruginosa gi 7 has the features of a transposable element with a transposase encoding gene together with direct and indirect repeats flanking the transposon fig 4 we blasted gi 7 against the ncbi database and found it in the genomes of 11 p aeruginosa clinical isolates with 99 identity supplementary table s2 two st308 isolates from the usa and mexico harboured gi 7 this genomic island was also found in the genomes of three isolates of p aeruginosa st395 amongst which dhs01 was the representative of a clone responsible for a long term outbreak in the uhb with identified environmental reservoirs bertrand et al 2000 petitjean et al 2017 gi 7 was also found in the genomes of the sporadic st198 and st309 clones as well as isolates of the high risk international clones st111 and st253 interestingly an isolate of the environmental species pseudomonas putida displayed a sequence that shared 98 identity with that of st308 p putida typically inhabits soil and water and is occasionally isolated from hospitalized patients molina et al 2013 gi 7 was also found in the genome of the phytopathogenic pseudomonas syringae pv actinidiae strain sr198 monteil et al 2016 with 72 identity these two environmental species are constantly exposed to this heavy metal copper derived biocides e g copper sulphate have been extensively used in wood impregnation stations and agriculture and as an animal feed additive since the mid 18th century hobman and crossman 2015 nunes et al 2016 making copper one of the most common soil contaminants for example copper contamination can reach 57 5 mg kg dry weight of soil in europe heijerick et al 2006 plant and soil associated species have thus accumulated resistance determinants to tolerate the presence of copper hobman and crossman 2015 nunes et al 2016 overall gi 7 likely emerged in environmental pseudomonas species before its transfer to the high risk clones of p aeruginosa st308 st395 st111 and st253 4 conclusion we report the contamination of the plumbing system of a healthcare premises by persister cells of p aeruginosa st308 new recommendations for the monitoring of water contamination should account for persister cells to trigger decontamination measures of the drinking water installation and reduce the risk of contamination of regularly used water points the genomic island gi 7 which confers copper tolerance to this emerging high risk clone probably originated from soil and plant associated pseudomonas species agricultural practices may have unexpectedly selected copper tolerant pathogens that can survive in drinking water installations of hospitals resulting in the potential

18882,construction of the great upper gotvand dam in the karun river iran with an impoundment capacity of 4 5 billion cubic meters has resulted in an environmental disaster accumulation of 66 5 million metric tonnes of dissolved salt in the reservoir and a dramatic increase in the salinity of the reservoir water up to 200 g l this paper aims to identify and assess the main sources of the

show that salt dissolution in the gachsaran formation especially at anbar ridge which was under estimated in the study phase of the project has provided about 86 per cent of the dissolved salt accumulated in the reservoir over a 2 year period since the impoundment of the reservoir in 2011 graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality salt gachsaran formation dam reservoir sources of salinity 1 introduction reservoirs are one of the most important water resources in arid regions and play an important role in managing the limited surface runoff for agricultural domestic industrial and power generation uses shinde et al 2011 however the environmental impacts related to reservoirs and dams e g hydrological geomorphic ecological are a serious and growing concern in river basin management and environmental protection programs zhang et al 2010 a potentially significant impact is the degradation of the quality of the water impounded in the reservoirs where the interaction with the geological formations is enhanced by the longer residence time larger contact area and higher hydraulic pressure the most likely salinity sources for reservoirs located in arid regions are 1 evaporation from the water surface 2 dissolution of evaporite outcrops in the reservoir 3 inflow of saline surface water 4 discharge of saline groundwater from adjacent aquifers through subaquatic springs or seepage areas and 5 upward intrusion of deep basin waters to the bottom of the reservoir kloppmann et al 2001 cendón et al 2008 lucas et al 2010 mongelli et al 2013 cary et al 2015 merchán

evaporation based on stable isotope evidence bagheri et al 2014a b demonstrated that the salinity in the karstic aquifer of kangan in southern iran is related to mixing with saline formation water from a gas reservoir the upper gotvand dam was constructed on the karun river which is the longest and highest discharge river in iran upper gotvand reservoir is a major infrastructure with an impoundment capacity of 4 5 billion m3 and a hydroelectric power plant that may reach a production of 4250 gw h soon after the onset of the reservoir impoundment in 2011 the quality of the water decreased dramatically total dissolved solids tds as high as 200 000 mg l whereas the average tds of the river was about 600 mg l before the dam construction the reservoir water is exposed to several sources of salinization including dissolution of flooded evaporite outcrops inflow of saline surface water from the surrounding area extreme evaporation and intrusion of oil field brine the main objectives of this contribution include characterizing the salinity of the gotvand reservoir and its stratification identifying the principal sources of salinity and assessing their relative contribution to the salinization of the reservoir water 2 geographical and geological setting the study area is located in the sw edge of the zagros mountains just north of the khuzestan plain iran the karun river the longest and highest discharge fluvial system of iran drains an extensive area in the southwestern flank of the central zagros mountains and finally flows into the persian gulf after passing through the extensively irrigated khuzestan plain the 180 m high upper gotvand dam on the karun river is the tallest embankment dam in iran the dam with a crest length of 760 m is located 10 km northeast of gotvand city fig 1 a mahab ghods consulting engineers 2012 in the meteorological station of gotvand 2012 2014 record period the maximum recorded temperature is 47 c and annual potential evaporation has been estimated at 3020 mm the annual average rainfall at the gotvand station is about 365 mm the zagros mountains hosts approximately 9 and 15 of the known oil and gas reserves of the world from the geological perspective the gotvand reservoir is located in the simply folded belt and more specifically within the dezful embayment this structural zone is characterized by the following features relevant to our investigation 1 lack of exposed salt diapirs of the precambrian cambrian hormuz series edgell 1991 2 has a thick cenozoic succession and is the area where the miocene gachsaran evaporitic formation reaches greatest thickness and the highest proportion of halite bahroudi and koyi 2004 and 3 includes a significant proportion of the oil and gas reservoirs of the zagros mountains sherkati et al 2005 such as the lali and zeloi oil fields associated with the gotvand reservoir area the nearest oil well to anbar ridge is number well 26 of the lali oil field fig 1a the outcropping geological formations in the study area in ascending stratigraphic order are gachsaran evaporites and marl early miocene mishan marl shale and limestone miocene aghajari sandstone and marl late miocene to pliocene bakhtiari conglomerate late pliocene pleistocene and various types of quaternary deposits fig 1b among these stratigraphic units the evaporitic gachsaran formation which is in direct contact with the reservoir water at several locations is the most prone to cause the hydrochemical degradation of the reservoir water in the strongly karstified anbar ridge where the reservoir water is in direct contact with significant salt exposures the gachsaran formation forms an actively rising salt pillow in which the initial proportion of halite was higher than 40 gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 3 sampling and analytical methods in order to monitor longitudinal and vertical variations in the salinity and hydrochemical characteristics of the gotvand reservoir continuous vertical measurements of the water temperature c electric conductivity ec and ph were obtained at 58 stations along the reservoir following standard methods apha 2005 and using a portable multi parametric probe aqua master amel fig 1b in addition a total of 108 water samples were collected from the sampling stations all the water samples were collected in october 2014 at the stations with high water depth and large vertical range in salinity three samples were collected i a surface sample ii a bottom sample from the base of the water column and iii a transitional sample collecting a mixture of water from the bottom to the top of the reservoir the hydrochemical analyses of cations and anions on the samples were carried out in the water laboratory of the geology department of tu bergakademie freiberg germany concentrations of major and minor ions ca mg na k cl br li and so4 were determined by ion chromatography metrohm compact ic pro 881 for anions and metrohm professional ic 850 for cations for anions a metrosep a supp 15 150 column with 3 0 mm nahco3 and 3 5 mm na2co3 as eluent was used cations were determined using a metrosep c4 150 column with 2 mm dipicolinic acid as eluent bicarbonate was determined by titration with hcl using methyl orange as indicator a total of 34 water samples collected in the reservoir the karun river upstream and downstream of the reservoir and the lali and kiars tributary streams were analyzed for stable isotopes of oxygen 18 and deuterium in the isotope laboratory of hydro isotope munich germany the isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of the water samples were measured with a laser based picarro l1102 i crdes cavity ring down spectroscopy principle all data were calculated as δ values with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow stable chlorine isotopic ratios of 37cl 35cl were analyzed in 16 water samples from the gotvand reservoir at the environmental isotope laboratory of the university of waterloo canada using the procedures described by eggenkamp 1994 and shouakar stash et al 2007 for chlorine isotopes isotopic ratios of 37cl 35cl were analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms and were reported as per

are standard mean ocean chloride smoc the sample codes and the determinations are indicated in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 salinity variations in gotvand reservoir electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured in the field and in the laboratory respectively from water samples collected at 58 stations scattered over the gotvand reservoir table 2 compiles the ec values measured on bottom and surface samples electrical conductivity ec in the reservoir ranges from 0 51 to 134 2 ms cm table 2 the salinity of the water at the bottom of the reservoir is much higher than that of the shallow water indicating stratification measured ec values on water samples from the surface of the reservoir surface samples range from 0 51 to 1 18 ms cm with an average value of 0 88 in contrast ec of bottom samples range from 0 81 to 134 2 ms cm with an average of 37 48 ms cm around 40 times higher than that of the surface samples the spatial variability of salinity at the surface and the bottom of the reservoir is illustrated in fig 2 a and b a general increase in salinity is observed from the upstream end of the reservoir to the dam however the spatial rate of salinity increase along the bottom of the reservoir is much higher than on the surface of the reservoir electrical conductivity was continuously measured and recorded from the surface to the bottom at 11 monitoring stations distributed throughout the reservoir the electrical conductivity shows a general increase with depth in all monitoring stations and a wide range of vertical variation fig 3 a however between the surface and around 70 m depth the average ec slightly increases with depth from 1 1 to 2 8 ms cm below that depth ec experiences a sharp increase reaching as much as 134 2 ms cm at the bottom of the deepest monitoring station g2 118 m deep a 2 d map showing the variability of the ec with depth and along the reservoir was produced by interpolating ec measurements from three sets of data including the surface of the reservoir the bottom of the reservoir and 11 vertical profiles obtained at monitoring stations distributed along the reservoir fig 3b an obvious stratification in the salinity of the water body and a sharp increase in ec from approximately 70 m depth are observed the maximum salinity of the water occurs in the deepest part of the reservoir close to the dam table 3 reports the depth distribution of different salinity classes rhoades et al 1992 as well as their volume within the stratified water of the reservoir 4 2 hydrochemical characterization of the gotvand reservoir the results of the physico chemical measurements and chemical analyses carried out on water samples collected in the gotvand reservoir are reported in table 1 and the summary of descriptive statistics of the parameters are included in table 4 the major cations and anions of the surface samples in decreasing order of concentration are ca na mg k and so4 cl hco3 respectively conversely for the bottom samples the decreasing order of major cations is na ca mg k and of anions is cl so4 hco3 fig 4 shows the water samples plotted on a piper diagram most of the samples are concentrated on the na and cl vertices of the cation and anion triangles respectively surface samples in the reservoir are dominantly of ca so4 type whereas bottom and transitional samples are of na cl type the piper diagram of fig 4 illustrates a downstream chemical evolution of the water along the reservoir from bicarbonate sulfate to chloride type and from calcium to sodium the arrows mark a downstream trend in the chemical evolution of the water from the upsream sector of the reservoir towards the dam from bicarbonate sulfate to chloride type and from calcium to sodium 4 3 identifying sources of salinity there are several possible sources or causes of salinization in the gotvand area including 1 dissolution of the halite bearing gachsaran evaporite formation 2 intrusion of oil field brine 3 evaporation from the reservoir surface and 4 inflow of saline water into the reservoir from springs and salty tributaries in a number cases these salinity sources have been proved to be a major cause of water quality deterioration in different regions of the zagros mountains e g bagheri et al 2014a b naderi et al 2016 conventional methods including geological and geomorphological evidence hydrochemical data as well as isotopic signature are applied in order to identify and assess the main sources of salinization of the gotvand reservoir 4 3 1 geological and geomorphological evidence geological and geomorphological evidence point to four potential sources of salinization in the study area evaporation from the reservoir area salt dissolution of gachsaran formation inflow of saline surface waters and intrusion of oil field brine evaporation from the reservoir area gotvand area is located in a semiarid arid region characterized by dry and hot summers so that the maximum temperature up to 47 c has been recorded during the study period time 2012 2014 the annual average potential evaporation in the area is about 3020 mm therefore evaporation from the surface of the reservoir with an area of 99 4 km2 during the study period was considered as one of the causes of salinization of the gotvand reservoir however the annual volume of evaporation is about 3 mcm which represents around 0 1 per cent of the total volume of the reservoir about 4500 mcm consequently the impact of evaporation on the salinity of the reservoir is not significant salt dissolution of gachsaran formation the water of the gotvand reservoir is in direct contact with extensive exposures of the gachsaran formation this formation mainly consists of halite gypsum and anhydrite and its rapid dissolution is expected to promptly degrade the quality of the water stored in the reservoir the equilibrium solubilities of halite and gypsum in distilled water under normal conditions are 360 g l and 2 4 g l respectively the presence of a considerable amount of halite in the gachsaran formation in this sector of the dezful embayment is supported by extensive exposures of rock salt borehole data and mineralogical analyses mahab ghods consulting engineers 2012 the reservoir water is in contact with outcrops of the gachsaran formation in six zones especially along the anbar ridge figs 1b 5 s1 6a s refers to supplementary materials gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 analyzed anbar ridge from the geological and geomorphological perspective reporting the following features relevant to this investigation 1 the anbar ridge covering an area of 4 km2 is an actively rising salt pillow in which the original proportion of halite was around 40 here halite is extensively exposed along the left bank of the karun river fig 5 and it used to be exploited in two salt mines one of them currently submerged under the reservoir fig s1 2 boreholes drilled by mahab ghods with a total length of 2326 m and with depths ranging from 90 to 196 m indicate that anbar ridge is highly cavernous and permeable cavities cavity fills and collapse breccias represent 21 of the drilled sections cavities 15 m high were encountered at 94 m depth below the karun river 3 anbar ridge shows a very high density of collapse sinkholes related to the foundering of cavity roofs gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 mapped a total of 693 sinkholes covering around 7 of the salt ridge with a density of 170 sinkholes km2 after the initiation of the impoundment of the reservoir in july 2011 subsurface salt dissolution has resulted in the development of numerous new collapse sinkholes and hectometer scale megacollapses these unique collapse structures are expressed as crescent shaped scarps and fissures with a concentric pattern and with the concavity facing towards the reservoir fig 5 illustrates the formation of new sinkholes and the rapid expansion of one of these megacollapses from september 2013 to november 2016 which has increased its diameter from 270 m to 450 m the growth of the collapse structure seems to reflect the progressive advance of dissolution cavity formation and collapse processes away from the reservoir these rapidly evolving subsidence phenomena indicate that a large volume of halite is being dissolved in anbar ridge and transferred in solution into the reservoir in addition the great part of the surface runoff in the area around anbar ridge flows into the sinkholes flows underground dissolving salt and finally discharges into the reservoir fig 6 b c d e surface and subsurface inflow of saline water the lali gale shour and kiars streams flow into the gotvand reservoir fig 1b kiars stream contributes fresh water to the reservoir with an ec of 0 35 ms cm and a flow rate lower than 50 l

of 6 0 and 2 9 ms cm respectively before flowing into the reservoir for comparison the ec of the karun river before reaching the reservoir is typically around 0 65 ms cm intrusion of oil field brine the gotvand reservoir is locally underlain by the lali and zeloi oil fields derikvand et al 2018 the presence of an active oil well at less than 500 m distance from the reservoir and the significant dissolution and collapse processes that affect the gachsaran formation which functions as the seal for the oil reservoir asmari limestone provides the geological evidence to consider leakage of oil field brine into the reservoir this potential source of salinzation could be related to both natural flows or leakage induced by drilling activities figs s1 and 6f 4 3 2 hydrochemical evidence classical hdyrochemical techniques have been used to identify the sources of salinity and related rock water interactions adams et al 2001 wen et al 2005 zhu et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 in the cases with a high range of ion concentrations the ion ratios are more suitable to evaluate the hydrochemical behavior of the water kouchekzadeh and zarei 2017 zarei et al 2014a b fig 7 a illustrates concentration of chloride vs sodium in water samples collected in the gotvand reservoir all samples occur along the halite dissolution line with equal molar concentrations of na and cl fig s2a shows the spatial distribution of na cl molar ratios of the water samples analyzed in the gotvand area the majority of the water samples collected from the surface and the bottom of the gotvand reservoir have na cl ratios between 0 9 and 1 1 whereas this ratio is higher than 1 1 in water samples collected upstream of the reservoir and in tributary streams of the karun river e g kiars and aghili na cl molar ratios close to one suggests halite dissolution as the main source of salinization for the reservoir jones et al 1999 vengosh et al 1999 bromide is a conservative ion that is extensively used in conjunction with chloride as a reliable indicator to characterize sources of salinity richter and kreitler 1993 siemann and schramm 2000 montety et al 2008 stotler et al 2010 halite dissolution waters have br cl ratio lower than 4 10 4 cartwright et al 2006 ghabayen et al 2006 which is lower than the ratios found in most waters affected by the other sources of salinization including oil field brines and evaporation typically higher than 1 10 3 fig s2b depicts the spatial distribution of the br cl ratio of the water samples in the study area surface and bottom samples of the gotvand reservoir show br cl ratios lower than 1 10 4 which suggests halite dissolution as the main source of salinization of the reservoir in contrast the upstream samples sample r1 g8 g13 g26 g50 g22 and g33 and water samples from tributary streams samples r3 and s1 have higher br cl ratios before reaching the reservoir a decreasing trend in the br cl ratio is observed as tds increases fig 7b which strongly supports the role of halite dissolution in increasing the salinity of the reservoir water plots of li cl vs br cl have been extensively used for identifying the sources of water salinity rittenhouse 1967 carpenter 1978 kharaka et al 1987 fontes and matray 1993a kharaka and hanor 2003 the diagram discriminates waters with different hydrochemical signatures including fresh water halite dissolution and evaporated formation deep basin waters fig 7c halite dissolution produces much lower li cl and br cl ratios than those in fresh waters and evaporated formation waters bagheri et al 2014a b and therefore they plot on the lower left side of the diagram fig 7c shows the water samples of the gotvand area on a li cl br cl diagram the water samples mainly fall on the fresh water or halite dissolution zones in addition the samples define a linear trend from the fresh water zone to the halite dissolution zone that represents a transition line between fresh water from upstream to the water stored in the reservoir that has dissolved a considerable amount of halite becoming a brine 4 3 3 isotopic evidence the isotopic signature of the water in combination with its hydrochemical characteristics are frequently used to identify the origin of the water and the source of salinity jørgensen and banoeng yakubo 2001 shouakar stash et al 2007 bouchaou et al 2008 ayenew et al 2008 to evaluate the salinity sources of the gotvand reservoir the results of isotope analyses on 35 water samples from the reservoir the karun river and some tributary streams waters were plotted on a δ2h δ18o diagram fig 8 a the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 and the local meteoric water line lmwl karimi 2013 are depicted on the diagram as reference lines the δ2h values range between 26 9 and 2 4 vsmow and those of δ18o from 5 4 to 2 3 vsmow all water samples of the reservoir plot very close to the line of lmwl on a δ2h δ18o diagram this reveals that evaporation has a limited impact on the chemistry of the reservoir which reaches a depth of ca 150 m the gotvand reservoir has a surface area volume ratio at maximum normal water level 232 m a s l of 0 02 km2 mcm slight deviation of some surface samples from the lmwl may be related to minor evaporation of the reservoir water in addition no δ18o shift is observed in the samples ruling out any mixing of the reservoir water with oil field or deep basin brines local water samples including r2 lali r3 kiars and s3 galeh shour plot close to the lmwl but are more enriched in comparison with gotvand reservoir samples the catchment area of the enriched waters are located at lower altitude in comparison with most the reservoir water that mainly come from high elevation areas of the zagros mountains in order to evaluate how isotopic composition of water changes with salinity δ18o and δ2h were plotted against the chloride concentration of the water samples of the gotvand reservoir fig 8b and c the isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of water samples remains practically constant as salinity chloride content increases from 85 to 85 100 mg l this pattern support the negligible contribution of evaporation on the salinization the reservoir and strongly supports the hypothesis that the salinity of the reservoir water is mostly related to halite dissolution in agreement with the interpretations inferred from hydrochemical techniques chlorine 37 can be used to characterize various sources of water salinity including evaporated water halite dissolution oil gas field brine intrusion and mixing of waters with different origins eggenkamp and coleman 2000 shouakar stash et al 2007 stotler et al 2010 boschetti et al 2011 bagheri et al 2014a b hanlon et al 2017 fractionation of chlorine isotopes occurs during the precipitation and dissolution of evaporite minerals e g eggenkamp et al 1995 stewart and spivack 2004 hanlon et al 2017 demonstrated that the δ37cl value in precipitated salt is higher than the residual saturated water and consequently water becomes more enriched in δ37cl during dissolution of salt a direct relationship between the δ37cl stable isotope and cl concentration of water samples from the gotvand reservoir is shown in fig 9 a the suggested values of δ37cl for water affected by halite dissolution are in the range between 0 0 and 0 5 smoc eggenkamp et al 1995 eastoe et al 1999 the δ37cl content of water samples of the gotvand reservoir ranges between 0 09 and 0 29 within the suggested range for halite dissolution waters fig 9b 4 4 contribution of salinity sources the results of our geological hydrochemical and isotopic investigation reveal that halite dissolution is the main cause of salinization of the gotvand reservoir in order to control and decrease the salinity of the reservoir it is necessary to understand where and how salt dissolves and incorporates into the reservoir the mass of dissolved salt incorporated into the reservoir m acu over a time period of two years march 2012 march 2014 was estimated at around 41 000 000 tonnes based on interpolation of the measured tds at different depths along the reservoir and the depth volume relation of the reservoir the alternatives for the incorporation of dissolved halite in the gotvand reservoir during the period march 2012 march 2014 include i total inflow from upstream by the karun river and tributary streams ii subsurface discharge into the reservoir of brine from the halite rich gachsaran formation iii drainage of surface runoff from outcrops of the gachsaran formation iv salt dissolution where the reservoir water is in direct contact with salt layers of the gachsaran formation the following mass balance equations of salt can be formulated for the gotvand reservoir mdis

conclusion water quality in the reservoir of upper gotvand reservoir with an impoundment capacity of 4 5 billion m3 decreased dramatically soon after the onset of the impoundment in 2011 such that total dissolved solids rapidly increased up to 200 000 mg l geological geomorphological hydrochemical and isotopic evidence indicate that halite dissolution is the main cause of accumulation of 66 5 million tons of dissolved salt in the reservoir severe detrimental impacts associated with the salinization of the karun river water at the gotvand reservoir are the consequence of disregarding the adverse geological conditions identified during the design and execution phases of the dam project e g gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 additionally our results refute the preliminary forecasts that postulated a limited incorporation of dissolved halite into the reservoir the current plan of the water resource authority is flushing the brine from the bottom of the reservoir to the river by using the bottom outlet in short time periods it should be emphasized that the difficult to predict impacts of the proposed plan on the downstream reaches of the karun river including its mouth in the persian gulf should be carefully assessed our suggestion to mitigate the current disastrous situation is to develop a coupled hydrological hydrochemical model integrating 1 hydrogeochemical processes especially halite dissolution precipitation 2 the salinity of the stratified reservoir and that the karun river downstream of the dam and 3 the inflow and outflow rates of water of the reservoir this would provide the technical basis for decreasing the salinity of the reservoir by releasing the bottom brine to the karun river during the most appropriate periods and at adequate rates minimizing the

18882,construction of the great upper gotvand dam in the karun river iran with an impoundment capacity of 4 5 billion cubic meters has resulted in an environmental disaster accumulation of 66 5

and power generation uses shinde et al 2011 however the environmental impacts related to reservoirs and dams e g hydrological geomorphic ecological are a serious and growing concern in river basin management and environmental protection programs zhang et al 2010 a potentially significant impact is the degradation of the quality of the water impounded in the reservoirs where the interaction with the geological formations is enhanced by the longer residence time larger contact area and higher hydraulic pressure the most likely salinity sources for reservoirs located in arid regions are 1 evaporation from the water surface 2 dissolution of evaporite outcrops in the reservoir 3 inflow of saline surface water 4 discharge of saline groundwater from adjacent aquifers through subaquatic

from a gas reservoir the upper gotvand dam was constructed on the karun river which is the longest and highest discharge river in iran upper gotvand reservoir is a major infrastructure with an impoundment capacity of 4 5 billion m3 and a hydroelectric power plant that may reach a production of 4250 gw h soon after the onset of the reservoir impoundment in 2011 the quality of the water decreased dramatically total dissolved solids tds as high as 200 000 mg l whereas the average tds of the river was about 600 mg l before the dam construction the reservoir water is exposed to several sources of salinization including dissolution of flooded evaporite outcrops inflow of saline surface water from the surrounding area extreme evaporation and intrusion of oil field brine the main objectives of this contribution include characterizing the salinity of the gotvand reservoir and its stratification identifying the principal sources of salinity and assessing their relative contribution to the salinization of the reservoir water 2 geographical and geological setting the study area is located in the sw edge of the zagros mountains just north of the khuzestan plain iran the karun river the longest and highest discharge fluvial system of iran drains an extensive area in the southwestern flank of the central zagros mountains and finally flows into the persian gulf after passing through the extensively irrigated khuzestan plain the 180 m high upper gotvand dam on the karun river is the tallest embankment dam in iran the dam with a crest length of 760 m is located 10 km northeast of gotvand city fig 1 a mahab ghods consulting engineers 2012 in the meteorological station of gotvand 2012 2014 record period the maximum recorded temperature is 47 c and annual potential evaporation has been estimated at 3020 mm the annual average rainfall at the gotvand station is about 365 mm the zagros mountains hosts approximately 9 and 15 of the known oil and gas reserves of the world from the geological perspective the gotvand reservoir is located in the simply folded belt and more specifically within the dezful embayment this structural zone is characterized by the following features relevant to our investigation 1 lack of exposed salt diapirs of the precambrian cambrian hormuz series edgell 1991 2 has a thick cenozoic succession and is the area where the miocene gachsaran evaporitic formation reaches greatest thickness and the highest proportion of halite bahroudi and koyi 2004 and 3 includes a significant proportion of the oil and gas reservoirs of the zagros mountains sherkati et al 2005 such as the lali and zeloi oil fields associated with the gotvand reservoir area the nearest oil well to anbar ridge is number well 26 of the lali oil field fig 1a the outcropping geological formations in the study area in ascending stratigraphic order are gachsaran evaporites and marl early miocene mishan marl shale and limestone miocene aghajari sandstone and marl late miocene to pliocene bakhtiari conglomerate late pliocene pleistocene and various types of quaternary deposits fig 1b among these stratigraphic units the evaporitic gachsaran formation which is in direct contact with the reservoir water at several locations is the most prone to cause the hydrochemical degradation of the reservoir water in the strongly karstified anbar ridge where the reservoir water is in direct contact with significant salt exposures the gachsaran formation forms an actively rising salt pillow in which the initial proportion of halite was higher than 40 gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 3 sampling and analytical methods in order to monitor longitudinal and vertical variations in the salinity and hydrochemical characteristics of the gotvand reservoir continuous vertical measurements of the water temperature c electric conductivity ec and ph were obtained at 58 stations along the reservoir following standard methods apha 2005 and using a portable multi parametric probe aqua master amel fig 1b in addition a total of 108 water samples were collected from the sampling stations all the water samples were collected in october 2014 at the stations with high water depth and large vertical range in salinity three samples were collected i a surface sample ii a bottom sample from the base of the water column and iii a transitional sample collecting a mixture of water from the bottom to the top of the reservoir the hydrochemical analyses of cations and anions on the samples were carried out in the water laboratory of the geology department of tu

eluent bicarbonate was determined by titration with hcl using methyl orange as indicator a total of 34 water samples collected in the reservoir the karun river upstream and downstream of the reservoir

are standard mean ocean chloride smoc the sample codes and the determinations are indicated in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 salinity variations in gotvand reservoir electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured in the field and in the laboratory respectively from water samples collected at 58 stations scattered over the gotvand reservoir table 2 compiles the ec values measured on bottom and surface samples electrical conductivity ec in the reservoir ranges from 0 51 to 134 2 ms cm table 2 the salinity of the water at the bottom of the reservoir is much higher than that of the shallow water indicating stratification measured ec values on water samples from the surface of the reservoir surface samples range from 0 51 to 1 18 ms cm with an average value of 0 88 in contrast ec of bottom samples range from 0 81 to 134 2 ms cm with an average of 37 48 ms cm around 40 times higher than that of the surface samples the spatial variability of salinity at the surface and the bottom of the reservoir is illustrated in fig 2 a and b a general increase in salinity is observed from the upstream end of the reservoir to the dam however the spatial rate of salinity increase along the bottom of the reservoir is much higher than on the surface of the reservoir electrical conductivity was continuously measured and recorded from the surface to the bottom at 11 monitoring stations distributed throughout the reservoir the electrical conductivity shows a general increase with depth in all monitoring stations and a wide range of vertical variation fig 3 a however between the surface and around 70 m depth the average ec slightly increases with depth from 1 1 to 2 8 ms cm below that depth ec experiences a sharp increase reaching as much as 134 2 ms cm at the bottom of the deepest monitoring station g2 118 m deep a 2 d map showing the variability of the ec with depth and along the reservoir was produced by interpolating ec measurements from three sets of data including the surface of the reservoir the bottom of the reservoir and 11 vertical profiles obtained at monitoring stations distributed along the reservoir fig 3b an obvious stratification in the salinity of the water body and a sharp increase in ec from approximately 70 m depth are observed the maximum salinity of the water occurs in the deepest part of the reservoir close to the dam table 3 reports the depth distribution of different salinity classes rhoades et al 1992 as well as their volume within the stratified water of the reservoir 4 2 hydrochemical characterization of the gotvand reservoir the results of the physico chemical measurements and chemical analyses carried out on water samples collected in the gotvand reservoir are reported in table 1 and the summary of descriptive statistics of the parameters are included in table 4 the major cations and anions of the surface samples in decreasing order of concentration are ca na mg k and so4 cl hco3 respectively conversely for the bottom samples the decreasing order of major cations is na ca mg k and of anions is cl so4 hco3 fig 4 shows the water samples plotted on a piper diagram most of the samples are concentrated on the na and cl vertices of the cation and anion triangles respectively surface samples in the reservoir are dominantly of ca so4 type whereas bottom and transitional samples are of na cl type the piper diagram of fig 4 illustrates a downstream chemical evolution of the water along the reservoir from bicarbonate sulfate to chloride type and from calcium to sodium the arrows mark a downstream trend in the chemical evolution of the water from the upsream sector of the reservoir towards the dam from bicarbonate sulfate to chloride type and from calcium to sodium 4 3 identifying sources of salinity there are several possible sources or causes of salinization in the gotvand area including 1 dissolution of the halite bearing gachsaran evaporite formation 2 intrusion of oil field brine 3 evaporation from the reservoir surface and 4 inflow of saline water into the reservoir from springs and salty tributaries in a number cases these salinity sources have been proved to be a major cause of water quality deterioration in different regions of the zagros mountains e g bagheri et al 2014a b naderi et al 2016 conventional methods including geological and geomorphological evidence hydrochemical data as well as isotopic signature are applied in order to identify and assess the main sources of salinization of the gotvand reservoir 4 3 1 geological and geomorphological evidence geological and geomorphological evidence point to four potential sources of salinization in the study area evaporation from the reservoir area salt dissolution of gachsaran formation inflow of saline surface waters and intrusion of oil field brine evaporation from the reservoir area gotvand area is located in a semiarid arid region characterized by dry and hot summers so that the maximum temperature up to 47 c has been recorded during the study period time 2012 2014 the annual average potential evaporation in the area is about 3020 mm therefore evaporation from the surface of the reservoir with an area of 99 4 km2 during the study period was considered as one of the causes of salinization of the gotvand reservoir however the annual volume of evaporation is about 3 mcm which represents around 0 1 per cent of the total volume of the reservoir about 4500 mcm consequently the impact of evaporation on the salinity of the reservoir is not significant salt dissolution of gachsaran formation the water of the gotvand reservoir is in direct contact with extensive exposures of the gachsaran formation this formation mainly consists of halite gypsum and anhydrite and its rapid dissolution is expected to promptly degrade the quality of the water stored in the reservoir the equilibrium solubilities of halite and gypsum in distilled water under normal conditions are 360 g l and 2 4 g l respectively the presence of a considerable amount of halite in the gachsaran formation in this sector of the dezful embayment is supported by extensive exposures of rock salt borehole data and mineralogical analyses mahab ghods consulting engineers 2012 the reservoir water is in contact with outcrops of the gachsaran formation in six zones especially along the anbar ridge figs 1b 5 s1 6a s refers to supplementary materials gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 analyzed anbar ridge from the geological and geomorphological perspective reporting the following features relevant to this investigation 1 the anbar ridge covering an area of 4 km2 is an actively rising salt pillow in which the original proportion of halite was around 40 here halite is extensively exposed along the left bank of the karun river fig 5 and it used to be exploited in two salt mines one of them currently submerged under the reservoir fig s1 2 boreholes drilled by mahab ghods with a total length of 2326 m and with depths ranging from 90 to 196 m indicate that anbar ridge is highly cavernous and permeable cavities cavity fills and collapse breccias represent 21 of the drilled sections cavities 15 m high were encountered at 94 m depth below the karun river 3 anbar ridge shows a very high density of collapse sinkholes related to the foundering of cavity roofs gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 mapped a total of 693 sinkholes covering around 7 of the salt ridge with a density of 170 sinkholes km2 after the initiation of the impoundment of the reservoir in july 2011 subsurface salt dissolution has resulted in the development of numerous new collapse sinkholes and hectometer scale megacollapses these unique collapse structures are expressed as crescent shaped scarps and fissures with a concentric pattern and with the concavity facing towards the reservoir fig 5 illustrates the formation of new sinkholes and the rapid expansion of one of these megacollapses from september 2013 to november 2016 which has increased its diameter from 270 m to 450 m the growth of the collapse structure seems to reflect the progressive advance of dissolution cavity formation and collapse processes away from the reservoir these rapidly evolving subsidence phenomena indicate that a large volume of halite is being dissolved in anbar ridge and transferred in solution into the reservoir in addition the great part of the surface runoff in the area around anbar ridge flows into the sinkholes flows underground dissolving salt and finally discharges into the reservoir fig 6 b c d e surface and subsurface inflow of saline water the lali gale shour and kiars streams flow into the gotvand reservoir fig 1b kiars stream contributes fresh water to the reservoir with an ec of 0 35 ms cm and a flow rate lower than 50 l s in contrast the water quality of the lali stream 4 5 m3 s mean discharge and gale shour stream experiences significant degradation due to interaction with the gachsaran formation reaching ec values of 6 0 and 2 9 ms cm respectively before flowing into the reservoir for comparison the ec of the karun river before reaching the reservoir is typically around 0 65 ms cm intrusion of oil field brine the gotvand reservoir is locally underlain by the lali and zeloi oil fields derikvand et al 2018 the presence of an active oil well at less than 500 m distance from the reservoir and the significant dissolution and collapse processes that affect the gachsaran formation which functions as the seal for the oil reservoir asmari limestone provides the geological evidence to consider leakage of oil field brine into the reservoir this potential source of salinzation could be related to both natural flows or leakage induced by drilling activities figs s1 and 6f 4 3 2 hydrochemical evidence classical hdyrochemical techniques have been used to identify the sources of salinity and related rock water interactions adams et al 2001 wen et al 2005 zhu et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 in the cases with a high range of ion concentrations the ion ratios are more suitable to evaluate the hydrochemical behavior of the water kouchekzadeh and zarei 2017 zarei et al 2014a b fig 7 a illustrates concentration of chloride vs sodium in water samples collected in the gotvand reservoir all samples occur along the halite dissolution line with equal molar concentrations of na and cl fig s2a shows the spatial distribution of na cl molar ratios of the water samples analyzed in the gotvand area the majority of the water samples collected from the surface and the bottom of the gotvand reservoir have na cl ratios between 0 9 and 1 1 whereas this ratio is higher than 1 1 in water samples collected upstream of the reservoir and in tributary streams of the karun river e g kiars and aghili na cl molar ratios close to one suggests halite dissolution as the main source of salinization for the reservoir jones et al 1999 vengosh et al 1999 bromide is a conservative ion that is extensively used in conjunction with chloride as a reliable indicator to characterize sources of salinity richter and kreitler 1993 siemann and schramm 2000 montety et al 2008 stotler et al 2010 halite dissolution waters have br cl ratio lower than 4 10 4 cartwright et al 2006 ghabayen et al 2006 which is lower than the ratios found in most waters affected by the other sources of salinization including oil field brines and evaporation typically higher than 1 10 3 fig s2b depicts the spatial distribution of the br cl ratio of the water samples in the study area surface and bottom samples of the gotvand reservoir show br cl ratios lower than 1 10 4 which suggests halite dissolution as the main source of salinization of the reservoir in contrast the upstream samples sample r1 g8 g13 g26 g50 g22 and g33 and water samples from tributary streams samples r3 and s1 have higher br cl ratios before reaching the reservoir a decreasing trend in the br cl ratio is observed as tds increases fig 7b which strongly supports the role of halite dissolution in increasing the salinity of the reservoir water plots of li cl vs br cl have been extensively used for identifying the sources of water salinity rittenhouse 1967 carpenter 1978 kharaka et al 1987 fontes and matray 1993a kharaka and hanor 2003 the diagram discriminates waters with different hydrochemical signatures including fresh water halite dissolution and evaporated formation deep basin waters fig 7c halite dissolution produces much lower li cl and br cl ratios than those in fresh waters and evaporated formation waters bagheri et al 2014a b and therefore they plot on the lower left side of the diagram fig 7c shows the water samples of the gotvand area on a li cl br cl diagram the water samples mainly fall on the fresh water or halite dissolution zones in addition the samples define a linear trend from the fresh water zone to the halite dissolution zone that represents a transition line between fresh water from upstream to the water stored in the reservoir that has dissolved a considerable amount of halite becoming a brine 4 3 3 isotopic evidence the isotopic signature of the water in combination with its hydrochemical characteristics are frequently used to identify the origin of the water and the source of salinity jørgensen and banoeng yakubo 2001 shouakar stash et al 2007 bouchaou et al 2008 ayenew et al 2008 to evaluate the salinity sources of the gotvand reservoir the results of isotope analyses on 35 water samples from the reservoir the karun river and some tributary streams waters were plotted on a δ2h δ18o diagram fig 8 a the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 and the local meteoric water line lmwl karimi 2013 are depicted on the diagram as reference lines the δ2h values range between 26 9 and 2 4 vsmow and those of δ18o from 5 4 to 2 3 vsmow all water samples of the reservoir plot very close to the line of lmwl on a δ2h δ18o diagram this reveals that evaporation has a limited impact on the chemistry of the reservoir which reaches a depth of ca 150 m the gotvand reservoir has a surface area volume ratio at maximum normal water level 232 m a s l of 0 02 km2 mcm slight deviation of some surface samples from the lmwl may be related to minor evaporation of the reservoir water in addition no δ18o shift is observed in the samples ruling out any mixing of the reservoir water with oil field or deep basin brines local water samples including r2 lali r3 kiars and s3 galeh shour plot close to the lmwl but are more enriched in comparison with gotvand reservoir samples the catchment area of the enriched waters are located at lower altitude in comparison with most the reservoir water that mainly come from high elevation areas of the zagros mountains in order to evaluate how isotopic composition of water changes with salinity δ18o and δ2h were plotted against the chloride concentration of the water samples of the gotvand reservoir fig 8b and c the isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of water samples remains practically constant as salinity chloride content increases from 85 to 85 100 mg l this pattern support the negligible contribution of evaporation on the salinization the reservoir and strongly supports the hypothesis that the salinity of the reservoir water is mostly related to halite dissolution in agreement with the interpretations inferred from hydrochemical techniques chlorine 37 can be used to characterize various sources of water salinity including evaporated water halite dissolution oil gas field brine intrusion and mixing of waters with different origins eggenkamp and coleman 2000 shouakar stash et al 2007 stotler et al 2010 boschetti et al 2011 bagheri et al 2014a b hanlon et al 2017 fractionation of chlorine isotopes occurs during the precipitation and dissolution of evaporite minerals e g eggenkamp et al 1995 stewart and spivack 2004 hanlon et al 2017 demonstrated that the δ37cl value in precipitated salt is higher than the residual saturated water and consequently water becomes more enriched in δ37cl during dissolution of salt a direct relationship between the δ37cl stable isotope and cl concentration of water samples from the gotvand reservoir is shown in fig 9 a the suggested values of δ37cl for water affected by halite dissolution are in the range between 0 0 and 0 5 smoc eggenkamp et al 1995 eastoe et al 1999 the δ37cl content of water samples of the gotvand reservoir ranges between 0 09 and 0 29 within the suggested range for halite dissolution waters fig 9b 4 4 contribution of salinity sources the results of our geological hydrochemical and isotopic investigation reveal that halite dissolution is the main cause of salinization of the gotvand reservoir in order to control and decrease the salinity of the reservoir it is necessary to understand where and how salt dissolves and incorporates into the reservoir the mass of dissolved salt incorporated into the reservoir m acu over a time period of two years march 2012 march 2014 was estimated at around 41 000 000 tonnes based on interpolation of the measured tds at different depths along the reservoir and the depth volume relation of the reservoir the alternatives for the incorporation of dissolved halite in the gotvand reservoir during the period march 2012 march 2014 include i total inflow from upstream by the karun river and tributary streams ii subsurface discharge into the reservoir of brine from the halite rich gachsaran formation iii drainage of surface runoff from outcrops of the gachsaran formation iv salt dissolution where the reservoir water is in direct contact with salt layers of the gachsaran formation the following mass balance equations of salt can be formulated for the gotvand reservoir mdis macu mout mstr in mrof mss 1 2 m v c where m is the total mass of dissolved salt from march 2012 to march 2014 and the subscripts denote the different components of salt input m is calculated for each component multiplying the corresponding water volume v by total dissolved solids c eq 2 m out is the only outlet of dissolved salt from the reservoir which has been calculated from the records of flow rate and tds in the karun river downstream from the dam fig s3c m str in is the total mass of dissolved salt entering the reservoir from upstream karun river and the lali stream that flow directly

assuming a rainfall recharge ratio of 0 3 for the surrounding karstified evaporite outcrops zarei 2010 and that infiltrated water reaches a salt concentration of 200 g l at the springs m rof is the estimated mass of dissolved salt entering the reservoir by direct surface runoff from the catchment area of the reservoir a runoff coefficient of 0 4 a dissolved solid concentration of 10 g l suggested by zarei 2010 for evaporite formations and a mean annual rainfall of 356 mm were used to estimate the mass of dissolved salt entering by direct surface runoff m dis is the direct salt dissolution component which is obtained by subtracting the rest of the components from the total the estimated contributions of each salt input components are reported in fig 10 and table 5 5 conclusion water quality in the reservoir of upper gotvand reservoir with an impoundment capacity of 4 5 billion m3 decreased dramatically soon after the onset of the impoundment in 2011 such that total dissolved solids rapidly increased up to 200 000 mg l geological geomorphological hydrochemical and isotopic evidence indicate that halite dissolution is the main cause of accumulation of 66 5 million tons of dissolved salt in the reservoir severe detrimental impacts associated with the salinization of the karun river water at the gotvand reservoir are the consequence of disregarding the adverse geological conditions identified during the design and execution phases of the dam project e g gutiérrez and lizaga 2016 additionally our results refute the preliminary forecasts that postulated a limited incorporation of dissolved halite into the reservoir the current plan of the water resource authority is flushing the brine from the bottom of the reservoir to the river by using the bottom outlet in short time periods it should be emphasized that the difficult to predict impacts of the proposed plan on the downstream reaches of the karun river including its mouth in the persian gulf should be carefully assessed our suggestion to mitigate the current disastrous situation is to develop a coupled hydrological hydrochemical model integrating 1 hydrogeochemical processes especially halite dissolution precipitation 2 the salinity of the stratified reservoir and that the karun river downstream of the dam and 3 the inflow and outflow rates of water of the reservoir this would provide the technical basis for decreasing the salinity of the reservoir by releasing the bottom brine to the karun river during the most appropriate periods and at adequate rates minimizing the

organic matter nom concentration on the removal of each hg species was also evaluated the three adsorbents were all effective in removing hg ii hg dom and hgs nps increasing ionic strength decreased the removal of hg ii species due to the formation of ionic hg species with lower affinity for the sorbents added nom decreased the removal of hg ii and hgs nps by all sorbents with the oc sorbent being most susceptible to nom fouling on a surface area normalized basis the oc removed all types of hg species better than the ac and sac samples moreover adsorbed hg dom transformed to a β hgs phase on the oc but not for ac and sac these studies indicate that both hg speciation and the water quality parameters need to be considered when designing sorbent based emission controls to meet hg removal

treatment process depends on the speciation of hg water quality parameters and sorbent properties relevant water quality parameters that may affect hg removal efficacies of sorbents for treatment of sediment surface water groundwater and industrial wastewaters include salinity type of cations organic matter content and the presence of organic matter the efficacy of any treatment alternative is generally determined using a site specific treatability study in this study we determine the impact of hg speciation and water quality parameters on the removal efficacy of three common adsorbents improved understanding of the impact of hg speciation and water chemistry on its removal from water will allow better decisions on the types of sorbents to consider for a selected water chemistry and desired removal efficiency sorbents are often used to remove remaining nanoparticulate and dissolved hg from water after larger particulate hg species have been removed by filtration many different adsorbents have been evaluated for their ability to remove specific mercury species from water these include experimental higher cost high affinity sorbents like gold au nps lisha and pradeep 2009 or

2006 say et al 2008 have also all been used to remove dissolved inorganic hg species from water although these experimental sorbents are interesting to consider low cost sorbents like activated carbon have been shown to be highly effective on dissolved hg ii species namasivayam and periasamy 1993 namasivayam and kadirvelu 1999 yardim et al 2003 kadirvelu et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 rao et al 2009 zhu et al 2009 here we assess the efficacy of three relatively low cost and widely used sorbents activated carbon sulfur impregnated activated carbon and organoclay to remove different hg species including hgs nps in water activated carbon is widely used for the removal of heavy metals and organic compounds from wastewater effluents and sediments because of its affinity towards many aqueous metal species and organic compounds high internal surface area and relatively low cost kadirvelu et al 2001 namasivayam and kavitha 2002 wang et al 2004 gilmour et al 2013 gomez eyles et al 2013 hadi et al 2015 sulfidation of activated carbon has been proved to be an effective way to enhance gaseous elemental hg adsorption onto activated carbons korpiel and vidic 1997 liu et al 2000 it commonly occurs through treatment with elemental sulfur which can react with the carbon surface to form disulfide thiophene sulfoxide and sulfone groups to increase the affinity of activated carbon to aqueous phase mercuric ions wang et al 2009 cai and jia 2010 enhanced adsorption of mercury species in aqueous solutions was observed for activated carbon treated with carbon disulfide mohan et al 2001 organoclays are engineered geosorbents with a high affinity for metals they are prepared by adsorption of specific organic molecules onto clays and have been used previously for removing aqueous hg species from water dias filho and do carmo 2006 filho et al 2006 say et al 2008 for example dithiocarbamate functional groups incorporated onto an organosmectite composite were shown to have an adsorption capacity of 158 mg g 1 for hg ii say et al 2008 a 2 mercapto 5 amino 1 3 4 thiadiazole modified organoclay also exhibited high hg ii adsorption capacity in aqueous systems filho et al 2006 however the effect of hg speciation on its removal by activated carbons and modified clays as well as the efficacy of using these adsorbents to remove hgs nps has not been reported the efficacy of sorbents for mercury removal from water is commonly tested using dissolved hg2 species in deionized water e g a test solution containing hgcl2 or hgno3 however in environmental media dissolved hg2 species are not typically the predominant hg species rather hg ii will form complexes with various ligands e g hs cl so4 2 and dom schuster 1991 the speciation of hg in aquatic systems is often dominated by hg dom because of the abundance of dom in natural waters and sediments and the strong binding constants typically measured for hg ii dom xia et al 1999 hesterberg et al 2001 haitzer et al 2002 2003 ravichandran 2004 in addition particulate hg and particle bound forms of hg are often detected in environmental samples hurley et al 1995 ravichandran et al 1998 1999 lowry et al 2004 this includes hgs nps that may not be effectively removed by industrial filtration processes that use filters commonly in the range of 1 10 μm szalóki et al 2011 each of these hg species has different physicochemical properties and therefore their removal by commercial sorbents can reasonably be expected to depend on this speciation dissolved hg2 species and hg dom are expected to be removed by adsorbents via either physisorption or chemisorption if the surfaces are reactive huang and blankenship 1984 while the relatively small dissolved hg species may transport into the micropore structure of activated carbons the larger sized hg dom may primarily be adsorbed to the outside pelekani and snoeyink 1999 for hgs nps heteroaggregation between hgs nps and the adsorbents is expected to be the main removal mechanism which will be impacted by solution conditions that affect the colloidal properties of the hgs nps and the sorbents hiemenz and rajagopalan 1997 aquatic systems and wastewater streams containing trace amounts of different hg species wilhelm and kirchgessner 2001 wang et al 2004 will also contain dissolved salts in varying concentrations with chloride salts of na and to a lesser extent ca2 being most abundant fillo and evans 1990 usepa 2000 the ionic composition of water can affect the removal of dissolved hg ii by changing its speciation powell et al 2004 liu et al 2012 these salts can also affect the behavior of hgs nps through screening of electrostatic repulsions between particles and sorbents french et al 2009 thus the ionic strength and ion types are expected to affect the efficacy of adsorbents for different hg species finally natural organic matter nom in natural waters and sediments may impact the removal of hg species by adsorbents by affecting hg speciation colloidal properties of hgs nps or by competing for surface sorption sites on the adsorbents humbert et al 2008 in this study the impact of hg speciation on its removal from aqueous solutions with different compositions by three different sorbents was evaluated dissolved inorganic species hg ii hgs nps and hg ii dom were selected as model hg species due to their prevalent use in sorbent efficacy testing or prevalence in aqueous environments and wastewater streams kim et al 2000 lowry et al 2004 slowey et al 2005 avellan et al 2018 elemental sulfur impregnated activated carbon sac was compared with regular activated carbon ac to assess the impact of surface sulfidation on hg removal experiments with organoclay oc allowed for a direct comparison of the efficacy of sulfur species on the surface of sac and those associated with the oc the influence of two abundant cations na and ca2 ionic strength and nom were assessed the present work provides a better understanding of how various representative hg species will respond to selected environmental parameters and insights into optimizing the hg removal process steps needed to meet site specific mercury removal objectives as a function of local environmental or operating conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbent characterization the removal efficiency of the three hg species was measured using three commercially available adsorbents activated carbon d s react a calgon corporation pittsburgh pa denoted as ac sulfur impregnated activated carbon hgr 4 10 calgon corporation pittsburgh pa denoted as sac and sulfur impregnated organoclay mr2 cetco hoffman estates il denoted as oc each adsorbent was ground and dry sieved to create a size fraction between 74 and 150 μm to eliminate potential differences in performance due to mass transfer limitations during adsorption experiments the bet n2 physisorption was measured using a quantachrome nova 2000e quantachrome instruments usa to determine the surface area of each adsorbent depending on the specific surface area of the material 100 200 mg adsorbent was weighed for the analysis samples were degassed at 200 c for 5 h and then weighed again immediately before the bet measurement nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted after the samples were cooled to 25 c specific surface areas were calculated with a multipoint bet method pore volumes were calculated by the bjh method x ray diffraction xrd spectra of adsorbents were collected to qualitatively assess the phase of sulfur differences in the carbon structure of the activated carbon samples measurements were made using an x pert pro mpd x ray diffractometer panalytical with cu kα radiation 45 kv 20 ma and a scanning range of 15 90 2θ elemental analyses were carried out using a carlo erba instrument model nt2500 to determine the sulfur content of each adsorbent electrophoretic mobility of the adsorbents was measured under solution conditions matching the removal experiment at low ionic strength 5 mm ionic strength without nom using a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk suspensions of the sorbents 130 mg l were sonicated transferred to the cells and measured immediately to assess whether the charge on the particles was positive or negative 2 2 preparation and characterization of hg species the preparation of hg ii and hg ii dom stock solutions was described previously gai et al 2016 briefly the 0 1 mm hg ii stock solution was prepared by dissolving hg no3 2 in water with 18 2 mω cm resistivity milliq water millipore billerica ma usa the hg dom species was made by saturating a humic acid ha sodium salt sigma aldrich solution with hg no3 2 in water to form hg dom complexes after equilibrating the mixture for several weeks the mixture was filtered by centrifugation using a 3 kda mw cutoff centrifuge filter excess dissolved hg2 aq and a small portion of ha with a molecular weight 3 kda were allowed to pass the filter and removed the hg dom species retained on the filter were washed several times collected and dispersed in water to provide a hg dom stock solution the hg concentration in the hg dom stock was measured as 9 4 mg l this hg dom species was used to represent hg dom species commonly found in sediment and natural waters it is less representative for most wastewater streams which commonly have different dom compositions the hgs nps were synthesized with a microwave technique wang et al 2001 first 16 mg of mercury acetate acs grade sigma aldrich and 4 mg of thiourea acs grade sigma aldrich were dissolved in 50 ml of milli q water and sealed in a teflon container the solution was heated using a microwave digestion system mars 5 cem corporation at 300 w for 10 min after cooling the synthesized black particles were centrifuged decanted and re suspended in milli q water five times to remove excess reagents the particles were then suspended in milli q water using a probe sonicator and stored as a particle suspension at 4 c until use transmission electron microscopy tem images of synthesized hgs nps were obtained using a h7100 hitachi tem microscope to estimate the average particle size the hydrodynamic radius was monitored using dynamic light scattering dls alv germany on a suspension of hgs nps 50 mg l the suspension remained stable against homoaggregation for 10 h with magnetic stirring at 150 rpm the removal experiments were performed with a lower concentration of nps 100 μg l which further increased their stability against homoaggregation xrd measurement for vacuum dried hgs nps was performed under the same condition as for adsorbents to confirm their crystal structure 2 3 hg removal experiments the removal rate of each hg species was determined in stirred 150 rpm teflon beakers for each adsorbent 2 0 0 1 mg was added to 15 ml of solution in teflon beakers the solution ph was adjusted to 7 50 0 05 using 0 1 n hcl or 0 1 n naoh without an added buffer the ph of each solution was also measured at the end of the experiment and no significant change was observed the adsorbent dispersion was placed under vacuum to saturate the adsorbent pore spaces with water before adding the hg species this procedure helps to homogenize the system with respect to the available surface area for each sorbent and facilitates comparison between the sorbents after saturating the sorbents with water 0 5 μmol hg l of either hg ii hg ii dom or hgs nps were added into the reactors these initial concentrations were selected to achieve approximately 50 removal based on preliminary testing this made the final concentration of hg in solution quantifiable by our methods aliquots were sampled at multiple times over four hours based on the documented contact times of common powdered activated carbon processes cook et al 2001 prior to analyzing the water for total hg the adsorbents could settle quiescently for 2 min at each sampling time point to separate unadsorbed hg species from hg species associated with adsorbents the relatively large sorbent particles settled out readily hg ii species and hg ii dom were directly measured in water samples according to epa method 1631 using a mercury analyzer brooks rand model merx the hgs nps were digested using aqua regia overnight before total hg analysis experimental solution conditions were used to look at the influence of cation type ionic strength and presence of nom on the removal of the three hg species each condition was studied at two specific concentrations resulting in six experimental solutions the salt and nom concentrations used in this study fall in the range reported for sediment porewater akkanen et al 2005 wastewater or produced waters fakhru l razi et al 2009 the speciation of added hg ii and hg dom in these solutions was modeled using visual minteq by assuming that equilibrium conditions were reached the hg ii dom species was estimated by assuming k dom 1023 4 l kg 1 at neutral ph haitzer et al 2002 it was assumed that the added hgs nps were stable against changes in speciation over the course of the experiment the hg removal rate constants were evaluated by fitting the experimental data of hg loss vs time supporting information figs s1 s4 using a pseudo second order kinetic model eqn 1 this model was used because it typically gives better fitting results than first or second order models ho and mckay 1999 because adsorbents rarely have a homogeneous surface structure and diffusion effects and chemical reactions are usually inseparable sparks 2013 1 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e in eqn 1 q t mg g is the amount of hg species adsorbed at time t h q e mg g is the amount of hg species adsorbed at equilibrium and k g mg 1 h 1 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant the fitting results are shown in supporting information table s1 the pseudo second order models showed high correlation coefficients in this study and several other hg removal studies ke et al 2011 li et al 2014 however the modeling results may be less valid in the case of hgs np removal than the removal of the other two hg species because heteroaggregation between adsorbent particles and hgs nps was expected to be the main removal mechanism the student newman keuls snk test was applied to the adsorption data sets using sas software to determine the statistical significance of differences in the fitted values k and qe across each group 2 4 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas experiments xas experiments were conducted to evaluate the speciation of hg on adsorbents exposed to hg ii and hg dom solutions hg was adsorbed to a concentration of 500 mg l to provide sufficient hg for xas analysis the samples were prepared by the same procedure described earlier except that an initial hg concentration of 6 mg l and 100 mg adsorbent was used the hg loaded adsorbents were centrifuged and re suspended in milli q water five times to remove weakly bound hg species the washed adsorbents were freeze dried and the hg concentration on adsorbents was measured by digesting the material with aqua regia and measuring hg in the digestate according to epa method 1631 the rest of the freeze dried sample was pressed into pellets and sealed into kapton tape the hg speciation was determined using xas at the hg l iii absorption edge 12 282 ev on beamline 11 2 at the stanford synchrotron radiation light source ssrl all measurements were conducted at liquid nitrogen temperature 77 k using a slow cooling method jew et al 2010 to identify if elemental hg had formed on the samples both transmission and fluorescence spectra were collected monochromator and internal energy calibration were made using a hgcl2 salt reference using sixpack software suite webb 2005 version 0 68 13 xas scans were then background subtracted with e0 defined as 12 284 ev converted to frequency k space using a spline range of 0 11 å 1 and weighted by k3 linear combination fitting lcf was performed as previously described avellan et al 2018 to assess hg speciation lcf identifies the components significantly contributing to the extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra of a sample lcf was performed on k space constrained between k 1 9 å 1 using a library of 18 hg model compounds supporting information fig s5 contains the list and spectra of model compounds used in the linear combination fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the adsorbents properties are shown in table 1 both activated carbon samples ac sac have a n2 bet specific surface area more than two orders of magnitude higher than oc thus the activated carbon samples have a significantly larger internal surface area compared to the oc the pore volume calculated using the bjh method for sac is more than six times lower than for ac suggesting that the sulfur present on the internal surface of sac http www calgoncarbon com wp content uploads product literature hgr mercuryremoval pdf occupied a significant fraction of the pore volume this is consistent with the relatively large amount of s present 14 wt in sac table 1 sulfur is present on the sac surfaces per discussion with a calgon representative in both the macropores and micropores korpiel and vidic 1997 the s in the microporous structures in activated carbon could be accessible for the smaller sized dissolved inorganic hg ii species huang and blankenship 1984 but potentially less accessible to larger hg species such as hg dom and hgs nps the impregnated sulfur in the oc and sac sorbents are designed to increase the affinity for hg korpiel and vidic 1997 sac was shown to be highly effective for the removal of elemental mercury from gas phases because of its sulfur content karatza et al 2000 however the ability of the sulfur on activated carbon to enhance removal of aqueous phase hg species is discussed later in the paper different from the sac the oc surface is functionalized to increase its affinity for a range of heavy metals including hg wang and abraham 2008 it has a lower sulfur content 5 wt than the sac but the sulfur is more available and reactive with hg as discussed later in the paper the exact speciation of sulfur in the oc and sac is proprietary however xrd results supporting information fig s6 indicate that the species of s on oc is different from the sac a small fraction of crystalline s is present on oc but not on sac 3 2 characterization of hg species synthesized hgs nps were characterized by xrd tem and dls xrd fig s6 indicates that the crystal form of synthesized hgs nps matched metacinnabar β hgs an average particle diameter of 10 3 nm was calculated by measuring the diameter of 100 hgs nps in tem images supporting information fig s7 however the intensity weighted mean hydrodynamic particle radius was centered on 20 nm 40 nm diameter determined by dls supporting information fig s8 suggesting that particles were homoaggregating to some degree in the aqueous phase hg dom characterization was included in our previous study gai et al 2016 a hg c molar ratio of 7 10 5 mol hg mol c was determined for the prepared hg dom species unlike hgs nps and hg dom species hg ii species were expected to depend more on the solution conditions the calculated hg ii speciation in each solution is shown in fig 1 the hg dom species is the dominant hg species when 1 mg l of nom was present at lower ionic strength in the absence of nom hg is primarily present as zero charged species hgcloh and hgcl2 with hg oh 2 and hgcl3 1 as minor dissolved species at higher ionic strengths various negatively charged dissolved mercury chloride ions hgclx 2 x are the predominant species this difference in charge of the dominant dissolved hg species is expected to impact the removal efficiencies of sorbents 3 3 removal of hg species from 5 mm nacl solution by adsorbents different hg removal mechanisms are expected for the tested hg species for hgs nps the expected main removal mechanism is heteroaggregation between hgs nps and adsorbents for hg ii species the main removal mechanism for all adsorbents is adsorption onto the surface additionally adsorption of hg ii into the micropores is expected for activated carbons ac sac but not for oc another potential mechanism for hg ii removal is reaction with impregnated sulfur on sac and oc hg dom shares the same adsorption and reaction removal mechanics as hg ii there are differences between the removal of hg ii and hg dom by adsorbents some micropores of activated carbon sorbents ac sac may be available to hg ii but not to hg dom due to its larger size in addition hg dom may not be as reactive to impregnated sulfur on the adsorbent as hg ii due to the strong hg s bond between hg and dom these differences suggest that hg dom will have lower removal than hg ii for all sorbents fig 2 shows the removal of hg species from 5 mm nacl solution by adsorbents for hg ii both sac and oc had higher removal than ac indicating that additional sulfur may react with hg ii species to enhance the removal in the case of hgs np removal both ac and sac had a similar performance oc had a slightly higher removal than activated carbon samples the positively charged surface of oc table 2 may facilitate the heteroaggregation between oc and negatively charged hgs nps gai et al 2016 for hg dom no significant difference for the hg removal was found among adsorbents 3 4 effect of cation type on the removal of hg species a cacl2 solution with the same ionic strength 5 mm was used to evaluate the effect of cation type on the removal of hg species fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the cation type tested did not significantly change the removal of hg ii and hgs nps however the change from na to ca2 significantly enhanced the removal of hg dom by adsorbents table s1 q e values shows that ca2 facilitated the removal of hg dom species in comparison with na it is known that ca2 can bridge nom with the negatively charged adsorbent surface to increase the adsorption of nom on adsorbents while na does not roy and dzombak 1996 cornelissen et al 2008 therefore it is likely that the adsorption of hg dom by activated carbon samples can also be enhanced with ca2 via bridging oc has a more positively charged surface in 1 7 mm cacl2 solution than in 5 mm nacl solution table 2 this suggests that in addition to bridging of the nom and oc the increased adsorption of hg dom by oc in cacl2 solution may result from the enhanced electrostatic attraction between the deprotonated carboxylic phenolic moieties present on hg dom and oc 3 5 effect of ionic strength on the removal of hg species the effect of ionic strength on the removal of hg species in a nacl and cacl2 solutions is shown in fig 4 the removal of hg ii species was lower at high ionic strength hashed bars compared low ionic strength for all three sorbent types the same trends were evident in the fitted q e values table s1 this is consistent with previous observations for hg ii adsorption using activated carbon and rice husk ash as adsorbents where lower adsorption of hg ii was attributed to a decrease in mercury activity at the higher ionic strength and lower electrostatic interactions krishnan and anirudhan 2002 feng et al 2004 however the hg ii speciation is also a function of ionic strength as shown in fig 1 uncharged hg ii species e g hgcloh aq hgcl2 aq are predominant at low ionic strength while negatively charged species e g hgcl4 2 hgcl3 are predominant at increased cl concentration the uncharged mercury compounds such as hgcloh aq and hgcl2 aq are more likely to adsorb than the negatively charged hg species to the negatively charged surfaces of activated carbons table 2 the decreased adsorption of hg ii by oc at high ionic strength may be due to the competitive adsorption process between hg ii ions and the background electrolyte ions as suggested in a previous study using functionalized montmorillonite and vermiculite particles to adsorb hg ii tran et al 2015 increasing ionic strength was expected to increase the removal of hgs np by decreasing the surface charge of hgs nps thereby facilitating nanoparticle heteroaggregation with the adsorbents while there is a modest increase in the removal of hgs nps in nacl at the higher ionic strength after 1 h supporting information fig s3 there is no statistically significant effect on hgs np removal after 4 h fig 4 there is also no statistically significant effect of ionic strength on the removal of hgs nps for cacl2 solutions ca2 is more efficient at screening charge on the particles than na it is likely that the ca2 ions effectively screened the charges at 1 7 mm and increasing to 66 7 mm does not provide additional screening 3 6 effect of nom on the removal of each hg species the effect of nom in solution on the removal of the hg species was compared in 5 mm nacl and 1 7 mm cacl2 solution conditions fig 5 show removal after 4 h in the absence of nom filled bars and in the presence of 1 mg c l nom hashed bars there are several trends evident in these data the mercury removal of the oc sorbent blue bars was most affected by the presence of added nom added nom decreased the removal of both hg ii species and hgs nps by oc in both nacl and cacl2 solutions fitting results of the kinetic data using the pseudo second order kinetic model are provided in table s1 the kinetic data fit well using this model for hg ii removal using oc without added nom in the solution but did not fit well for the same conditions when nom was present the poor fit suggests that a different removal mechanism may be involved for oc with nom present compared to the absence of nom organoclays are known to have high affinity for nom dentel et al 1998 the nom in the solution might be blocking the surface sites on oc and decreasing the adsorption kinetics of hg ii species the addition of nom in the solution also reduced the kinetics and extent of removal of hgs nps by oc nom is expected to adsorb onto both the oc and onto the hgs nps and thus decrease their heteroaggregation rate by increasing steric repulsion between the particles louie et al 2016 the impact of added nom on the removal of hg ii and hgs nps from 5 mm nacl solutions by ac red bars and sac green bars is less significant compared to oc blue bars fig 5 it suggests that either nom has relatively lower affinity for these activated carbon samples compared to oc or that there is a greater abundance of hg reactive sites on activated carbon compared to oc the latter is consistent with the significantly higher surface area measured for activated carbon compared to the oc however the effect of nom on sorption of hg ii and hgs on the activated carbons was greater in the presence of ca2 than for na even though both solutions had the same ionic strength fig 5 and table s1 as previously mentioned ca2 can bridge the nom with the negatively charged adsorbent surface to enhance the adsorption of nom on adsorbents while na does not have this effect roy and dzombak 1996 cornelissen et al 2008 lower adsorption of hg species occurs due to greater competition with nom in ca2 solutions in contrast to the activated carbon there was limited effect of cation type on the sorption of hg ii and hgs np species to oc this could be a result of an overall higher affinity of oc for nom which masks the effect of ca2 finally there was no apparent effect of added nom on the removal of the hg dom species however this was an artifact of the experimental design the prepared hg dom species had a hg c molar ratio of 70 μmol hg mol c gai et al 2016 meaning that 0 5 μmol l hg dom would introduce about 8 6 mg c l in the system thus an additional 1 mg c l did not significantly change the solution conditions and therefore did not significantly impact the removal results for hg dom table s1 q e values shows that ca2 enhanced the removal of hg dom species in comparison with na regardless of the presence of additional ha in the solution 3 7 comparison of adsorbent removal efficiencies the impregnation of activated carbon with sulfur is designed to increase its affinity for hg however for the aqueous conditions used in this work the sulfur impregnated activated carbon sac did not show better removal efficacy than activated carbon ac for hg dom or hgs nps there was some improvement seen for hg ii under low ionic strength conditions at high ionic strength in cacl2 solution ac showed higher removal rates for dissolved hg ii species than either sac or oc the pseudo first order model fitting results in table s1 were normalized by specific surface area values of adsorbents supporting information table s2 to further explore the differences in hg removal rates and mechanism the surface area normalized k and qe values are also plotted in fig 6 a and b on a surface area normalized basis there were differences between the sorbent types for all hg species the fitted values k and qe for the oc were statistically significantly higher than for the activated carbons p 0 0001 there were no significant differences observed between the two activated carbon samples this could be due to different s speciation on these adsorbents nabais et al 2006 or because the sulfur impregnation for sac decreased the available surface area for the materials these data indicate that oc can provide more efficient hg removal than the activated carbon samples per unit surface area 3 8 characterization of hg dom adsorbed onto absorbents significantly higher reactive surface area of the oc compared to the ac sorbents were explored by comparing the speciation of adsorbed hg dom species using xas the exafs spectra at the hg l iii edge and their linear combination fits are provided in fig 7 and table s3 respectively for ac hg ii thiol model compounds provide the best fitting results hg dom has the same xas signal as an hg thiolated ligand complex because the hg is associated with dom by forming hg s bonds these results suggest that hg dom is mainly physically absorbed onto the surface of ac a similar result is observed for sac with most hg present resembling the hg thiol hg s r model compound however the best fits are achieved using a mixture of hg thiol model compound and a hg cysteine model compound the latter tends to form two coordinated r s hg s r species the formed two coordinated species could be hg bonding with impregnated s on sac and with the s present in dom it also could be hg bonding with two impregnated s atoms on sac this speciation change also suggests that some of the impregnated sulfur in the sac is indeed reactive with the adsorbed hg dom species however the reactivity of sac with hg dom did not result in a higher sorption capacity this could be because the exafs experiments had to use a higher hg dom loading than hg removal experiments to collect useable xas spectra also ac has a higher surface area and more pore volume than sac which may enhance its uptake of hg species relative to sac thereby masking the increase in uptake due to its reactivity in contrast the hg speciation for hg dom adsorbed onto oc shows that hg dom is completely transformed to β hgs this can be formed when thiol is reacting with hg ii species wang et al 2001 zeng et al 2001 wang and zhu 2004 indicating that sulfur species on the surface of the oc were more reactive with the hg dom complex forming a more thermodynamically favorable β hgs species this is consistent with the higher observed reactivity of the oc surface compared to the activated carbon the different reactivity of hg with the sac compared to the oc may be due to the different form of sulfur present on those surfaces elemental sulfur is introduced on the sac surfaces per discussion with a calgon representative whereas a more reactive s species for example thiol that can react with hg ii to form β hgs dentel et al 1998 feng et al 2004 is present on the oc this form of sulfur could not be confirmed on oc as this information is proprietary the differences in reactivity with hg may also have resulted from the different distributions of sulfur on the particles for sac the sulfur deposited into micropores may be less available to react with large sized hg dom species however the impregnated sulfur on oc surfaces is more readily accessible to the hg dom species 4 conclusions and implications the results from these tests provide important insights into the effects of hg speciation and water quality parameters on removal of hg from water by activated carbon ac sac and organoclay oc it was shown that all three sorbents were effective at removing different hg species from water even hgs nps however the water quality parameters including cation type ionic strength and the presence of nom affected the removal of each hg species differently compared with na ca2 can enhance the removal of hg dom by adsorbents increasing the ionic strength decreased the removal of hg ii species due to the formation of dissolved hg species e g hgcl3 and hgcl4 2 with lower affinity for the sorbent surface than hg species formed at lower ionic strength hgcl2 hg oh 2 hgohcl the presence of nom reduced the removal of hg ii and hgs nps by all three adsorbents in cacl2 solution but only oc in nacl solutions the differences in hg removal between ac and sac samples used in this study were not significant this may be due to the relatively low reactivity of the form of s present on the sac xas results show that oc has a highly reactive surface forming an inorganic β hgs np phase from adsorbed hg dom whereas hg dom on the ac surface or sac surface was relatively unchanged although oc could remove all hg species better than ac or sac per unit surface area due to the higher surface reactivity of oc the lower surface area per mass of oc seems to eliminate most of its advantage on a per mass basis thus all three adsorbents can be effective for removal of hg species under various conditions but oc was more susceptible to fouling by nom in the water this study suggests that model solutions containing primarily dissolved hg ii may not accurately predict the removal efficiency of adsorbents for wastewaters although dissolved hg ii species have been widely used as a model compound to assess the performance of different hg sorbents dissolved hg ii species are typically not the dominant hg species in sediment porewaters natural waters or industrial wastewaters this study showed that hgs nps and hg dom species were removed by all sorbents but often to a lesser extent than hg ii species this indicates that using dissolved hg ii as a surrogate species for assessing removal efficiency may overestimate the efficacy of adsorbents for these other hg species the magnitude of the overestimate will depend on both the hg species and the solution conditions both the expected hg speciation and the water quality parameters ionic composition ionic strength and nom content need to be considered when designing sorbent based emission controls to meet hg removal targets for water containing high salinity e g ocean sediment porewater or neutralized industrial acids dissolved hg ii species will likely be more difficult to remove and may require increasing the adsorbent dosage compared to a low salinity case however high salinity did not appear to have a measurable impact on the removal of hgs np and hg dom emphasizing the need to consider hg species other than dissolved inorganic hg ii compounds when evaluating removal efficiencies for sorbents nominal nom concentrations as low as 1 mg c l are expected to reduce removal effectiveness especially for oc thus activated carbon may be a more effective option than oc for sorbent based remediation approaches when large amounts of nom is expected such as in subaquatic sediments gilmour et al 2013b or co produced water from oils and gas production certain refinery wastewater streams or freshwater sediment porewater the high surface reactivity of oc with hg dom and the resulting formation of a metacinnabar β hgs phase may make the use of oc attractive for hg sorption in low nom waters the formed β hgs phase has low aqueous solubility and a relatively lower bioavailability than other more labile hg species including hg dom and other dissolved phase hg species yu et al 2012 pinedo hernández et al 2015 avellan et al 2018 appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1

18883,mercury hg speciation can affect its removal efficiency by adsorbents this study assessed the removal of dissolved inorganic hg ii species hg ii β hgs nanoparticles hgs np and hg complexed with dissolved organic matter hg dom by three sorbents activated carbon ac sulfur impregnated activated carbon sac and organoclay oc the effect of ionic composition solution ionic strength and natural organic matter nom concentration on the removal of each hg species was also evaluated the three adsorbents were all effective in removing hg ii hg dom and hgs nps increasing ionic strength decreased the removal of hg ii species due to the formation of ionic hg species with lower affinity for the sorbents added nom decreased the removal of hg ii and hgs nps by all sorbents with the oc sorbent being most susceptible to nom fouling on a surface area normalized basis the oc removed all types of hg species better than the ac and sac samples moreover adsorbed hg dom transformed to a β hgs phase on the oc but not for ac and sac these studies indicate that both hg speciation and the water quality parameters need to be considered when designing sorbent based emission controls to meet hg removal

treatment process depends on the speciation of hg water quality parameters and sorbent properties relevant water quality parameters that may affect hg removal efficacies of sorbents for treatment of sediment surface water groundwater and industrial wastewaters include salinity type of cations organic matter content and the presence of organic matter the efficacy of any treatment alternative is generally determined using a site specific treatability study in this study we determine the impact of hg speciation and water quality parameters on the removal efficacy of three common adsorbents improved understanding of the impact of hg speciation and water chemistry on its removal from water will allow better decisions on the types of sorbents to consider for a selected water chemistry and desired removal efficiency sorbents are often used to remove remaining nanoparticulate and dissolved hg from water after larger particulate hg species have been removed by filtration many different adsorbents have been evaluated for their ability to remove specific mercury species from water these include experimental higher cost high affinity sorbents like gold au nps lisha and pradeep 2009 or

2006 say et al 2008 have also all been used to remove dissolved inorganic hg species from water although these experimental sorbents are interesting to consider low cost sorbents like activated carbon have been shown to be highly effective on dissolved hg ii species namasivayam and periasamy 1993 namasivayam and kadirvelu 1999 yardim et al 2003 kadirvelu et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 rao et al 2009 zhu et al 2009 here we assess the efficacy of three relatively low cost and widely used sorbents activated carbon sulfur impregnated activated carbon and organoclay to remove different hg species including hgs nps in water activated carbon is widely used for the removal of heavy metals and organic compounds from wastewater effluents and sediments because of its affinity towards many aqueous metal species and organic compounds high internal surface area and relatively low cost kadirvelu et al 2001 namasivayam and kavitha 2002 wang et al 2004 gilmour et al 2013 gomez eyles et al 2013 hadi et al 2015 sulfidation of activated carbon has been proved to be an effective way to enhance gaseous elemental hg adsorption onto activated carbons korpiel and vidic 1997 liu et al 2000 it commonly occurs through treatment with elemental sulfur which can react with the carbon surface to form disulfide thiophene sulfoxide and sulfone groups to increase the affinity of activated carbon to aqueous phase mercuric ions wang et al 2009 cai and jia 2010 enhanced adsorption of mercury species in aqueous solutions was observed for activated carbon treated with carbon disulfide mohan et al 2001 organoclays are engineered geosorbents with a high affinity for metals they are prepared by adsorption of specific organic molecules onto clays and have been used previously for removing aqueous hg species from water dias filho and do carmo 2006 filho et al 2006 say et al 2008 for example dithiocarbamate functional groups incorporated onto an organosmectite composite were shown to have an adsorption capacity of 158 mg g 1 for hg ii say et al 2008 a 2 mercapto 5 amino 1 3 4 thiadiazole modified organoclay also exhibited high hg ii adsorption capacity in aqueous systems filho et al 2006 however the effect of hg speciation on its removal by activated carbons and modified clays as well as the efficacy of using these adsorbents to remove hgs nps has not been reported the efficacy of sorbents for mercury removal from water is commonly tested using dissolved hg2 species in deionized water e g a test solution containing hgcl2 or hgno3 however in environmental media dissolved hg2 species are not typically the predominant hg species rather hg ii will form complexes with various ligands e g hs cl so4 2 and dom schuster 1991 the speciation of hg in aquatic systems is often dominated by hg dom because of the abundance of dom in natural waters and sediments and the strong binding constants typically measured for hg ii dom xia et al 1999 hesterberg et al 2001 haitzer et al 2002 2003 ravichandran 2004 in addition particulate hg and particle bound forms of hg are often detected in environmental samples hurley et al 1995 ravichandran et al 1998 1999 lowry et al 2004 this includes hgs nps that may not be effectively removed by industrial filtration processes that use filters commonly in the range of 1 10 μm szalóki et al 2011 each of these hg species has different physicochemical properties and therefore their removal by commercial sorbents can reasonably be expected to depend on this speciation dissolved hg2 species and hg dom are expected to be removed by adsorbents via either physisorption or chemisorption if the surfaces are reactive huang and blankenship 1984 while the relatively small dissolved hg species may transport into the micropore structure of activated carbons the larger sized hg dom may primarily be adsorbed to the outside pelekani and snoeyink 1999 for hgs nps heteroaggregation between hgs nps and the adsorbents is expected to be the main removal mechanism which will be impacted by solution conditions that affect the colloidal properties of the hgs nps and the sorbents hiemenz and rajagopalan 1997 aquatic systems and wastewater streams containing trace amounts of different hg species wilhelm and kirchgessner 2001 wang et al 2004 will also contain dissolved salts in varying concentrations with chloride salts of na and to a lesser extent ca2 being most abundant fillo and evans 1990 usepa 2000 the ionic composition of water can affect the removal of dissolved hg ii by changing its speciation powell et al 2004 liu et al 2012 these salts can also affect the behavior of hgs nps through screening of electrostatic repulsions between particles and sorbents french et al 2009 thus the ionic strength and ion types are expected to affect the efficacy of adsorbents for different hg species finally natural organic matter nom in natural waters and sediments may impact the removal of hg species by adsorbents by affecting hg speciation colloidal properties of hgs nps or by competing for surface sorption sites on the adsorbents humbert et al 2008 in this study the impact of hg speciation on its removal from aqueous solutions with different compositions by three different sorbents was evaluated dissolved inorganic species hg ii hgs nps and hg ii dom were selected as model hg species due to their prevalent use in sorbent efficacy testing or prevalence in aqueous environments and wastewater streams kim et al 2000 lowry et al 2004 slowey et al 2005 avellan et al 2018 elemental sulfur impregnated activated carbon sac was compared with regular activated carbon ac to assess the impact of surface sulfidation on hg removal experiments with organoclay oc allowed for a direct comparison of the efficacy of sulfur species on the surface of sac and those associated with the oc the influence of two abundant cations na and ca2 ionic strength and nom were assessed the present work provides a better understanding of how various representative hg species will respond to selected environmental parameters and insights into optimizing the hg removal process steps needed to meet site specific mercury removal objectives as a function of local environmental or operating conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbent characterization the removal efficiency of the three hg species was measured using three commercially available adsorbents activated carbon d s react a calgon corporation pittsburgh pa denoted as ac sulfur impregnated activated carbon hgr 4 10 calgon corporation pittsburgh pa denoted as sac and sulfur impregnated organoclay mr2 cetco hoffman estates il denoted as oc each adsorbent was ground and dry sieved to create a size fraction between 74 and 150 μm to eliminate potential differences in performance due to mass transfer limitations during adsorption experiments the bet n2 physisorption was measured using a quantachrome nova 2000e quantachrome instruments usa to determine the surface area of each adsorbent depending on the specific surface area of the material 100 200 mg adsorbent was weighed for the analysis samples were degassed at 200 c for 5 h and then weighed again immediately before the bet measurement nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted after the samples were cooled to 25 c specific surface areas were calculated with a multipoint bet method pore volumes were calculated by the bjh method x ray diffraction xrd spectra of adsorbents were collected to qualitatively assess the phase of sulfur differences in the carbon structure of the activated carbon samples measurements were made using an x pert pro mpd x ray diffractometer panalytical with cu kα radiation 45 kv 20 ma and a scanning range of 15 90 2θ elemental analyses were carried out using a carlo erba instrument model nt2500 to determine the sulfur content of each adsorbent electrophoretic mobility of the adsorbents was measured under solution conditions matching the removal experiment at low ionic strength 5 mm ionic strength without nom using a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk suspensions of the sorbents 130 mg l were sonicated transferred to the cells and measured immediately to assess whether the charge on the particles was positive or negative 2 2 preparation and characterization of hg species the preparation of hg ii and hg ii dom stock solutions was described previously gai et al 2016 briefly the 0 1 mm hg ii stock solution was prepared by dissolving hg no3 2 in water with 18 2 mω cm resistivity milliq water millipore billerica ma usa the hg dom species was made by saturating a humic acid ha sodium salt sigma aldrich solution with hg no3 2 in water to form hg dom complexes after equilibrating the mixture for several weeks the mixture was filtered by centrifugation using a 3 kda mw cutoff centrifuge filter excess dissolved hg2 aq and a small portion of ha with a molecular weight 3 kda were allowed to pass the filter and removed the hg dom species retained on the filter were washed several times collected and dispersed in water to provide a hg dom stock solution the hg concentration in the hg dom stock was measured as 9 4 mg l this hg dom species was used to represent hg dom species commonly found in sediment and natural waters it is less representative for most wastewater streams which commonly have different dom compositions the hgs nps were synthesized with a microwave technique wang et al 2001 first 16 mg of mercury acetate acs grade sigma aldrich and 4 mg of thiourea acs grade sigma aldrich were dissolved in 50 ml of milli q water and sealed in a teflon container the solution was heated using a microwave digestion system mars 5 cem corporation at 300 w for 10 min after cooling the synthesized black particles were centrifuged decanted and re suspended in milli q water five times to remove excess reagents the particles were then suspended in milli q water using a probe sonicator and stored as a particle suspension at 4 c until use transmission electron microscopy tem images of synthesized hgs nps were obtained using a h7100 hitachi tem microscope to estimate the average particle size the hydrodynamic radius was monitored using dynamic light scattering dls alv germany on a suspension of hgs nps 50 mg l the suspension remained stable against homoaggregation for 10 h with magnetic stirring at 150 rpm the removal experiments were performed with a lower concentration of nps 100 μg l which further increased their stability against homoaggregation xrd measurement for vacuum dried hgs nps was performed under the same condition as for adsorbents to confirm their crystal structure 2 3 hg removal experiments the removal rate of each hg species was determined in stirred 150 rpm teflon beakers for each adsorbent 2 0 0 1 mg was added to 15 ml of solution in teflon beakers the solution ph was adjusted to 7 50 0 05 using 0 1 n hcl or 0 1 n naoh without an added buffer the ph of each solution was also measured at the end of the experiment and no significant change was observed the adsorbent dispersion was placed under vacuum to saturate the adsorbent pore spaces with water before adding the hg species this procedure helps to homogenize the system with respect to the available surface area for each sorbent and facilitates comparison between the sorbents after saturating the sorbents with water 0 5 μmol hg l of either hg ii hg ii dom or hgs nps were added into the reactors these initial concentrations were selected to achieve approximately 50 removal based on preliminary testing this made the final concentration of hg in solution quantifiable by our methods aliquots were sampled at multiple times over four hours based on the documented contact times of common powdered activated carbon processes cook et al 2001 prior to analyzing the water for total hg the adsorbents could settle quiescently for 2 min at each sampling time point to separate unadsorbed hg species from hg species associated with adsorbents the relatively large sorbent particles settled out readily hg ii species and hg ii dom were directly measured in water samples according to epa method 1631 using a mercury analyzer brooks rand model merx the hgs nps were digested using aqua regia overnight before total hg analysis experimental solution conditions were used to look at the influence of cation type ionic strength and presence of nom on the removal of the three hg species each condition was studied at two specific concentrations resulting in six experimental solutions the salt and nom concentrations used in this study fall in the range reported for sediment porewater akkanen et al 2005 wastewater or produced waters fakhru l razi et al 2009 the speciation of added hg ii and hg dom in these solutions was modeled using visual minteq by assuming that equilibrium conditions were reached the hg ii dom species was estimated by assuming k dom 1023 4 l kg 1 at neutral ph haitzer et al 2002 it was assumed that the added hgs nps were stable against changes in speciation over the course of the experiment the hg removal rate constants were evaluated by fitting the experimental data of hg loss vs time supporting information figs s1 s4 using a pseudo second order kinetic model eqn 1 this model was used because it typically gives better fitting results than first or second order models ho and mckay 1999 because adsorbents rarely have a homogeneous surface structure and diffusion effects and chemical reactions are usually inseparable sparks 2013 1 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e in eqn 1 q t mg g is the amount of hg species adsorbed at time t h q e mg g is the amount of hg species adsorbed at equilibrium and k g mg 1 h 1 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant the fitting results are shown in supporting information table s1 the pseudo second order models showed high correlation coefficients in this study and several other hg removal studies ke et al 2011 li et al 2014 however the modeling results may be less valid in the case of hgs np removal than the removal of the other two hg species because heteroaggregation between adsorbent particles and hgs nps was expected to be the main removal mechanism the student newman keuls snk test was applied to the adsorption data sets using sas software to determine the statistical significance of differences in the fitted values k and qe across each group 2 4 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas experiments xas experiments were conducted to evaluate the speciation of hg on adsorbents exposed to hg ii and hg dom solutions hg was adsorbed to a concentration of 500 mg l to provide sufficient hg for xas analysis the samples were prepared by the same procedure described earlier except that an initial hg concentration of 6 mg l and 100 mg adsorbent was used the hg loaded adsorbents were centrifuged and re suspended in milli q water five times to remove weakly bound hg species the washed adsorbents were freeze dried and the hg concentration on adsorbents was measured by digesting the material with aqua regia and measuring hg in the digestate according to epa method 1631 the rest of the freeze dried sample was pressed into pellets and sealed into kapton tape the hg speciation was determined using xas at the hg l iii absorption edge 12 282 ev on beamline 11 2 at the stanford synchrotron radiation light source ssrl all measurements were conducted at liquid nitrogen temperature 77 k using a slow cooling method jew et al 2010 to identify if elemental hg had formed on the samples both transmission and fluorescence spectra were collected monochromator and internal energy calibration were made using a hgcl2 salt reference using sixpack software suite webb 2005 version 0 68 13 xas scans were then background subtracted with e0 defined as 12 284 ev converted to frequency k space using a spline range of 0 11 å 1 and weighted by k3 linear combination fitting lcf was performed as previously described avellan et al 2018 to assess hg speciation lcf identifies the components significantly contributing to the extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra of a sample lcf was performed on k space constrained between k 1 9 å 1 using a library of 18 hg model compounds supporting information fig s5 contains the list and spectra of model compounds used in the linear combination fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the adsorbents properties are shown in table 1 both activated carbon samples ac sac have a n2 bet specific surface area more than two orders of magnitude higher than oc thus the activated carbon samples have a significantly larger internal surface area compared to the oc the pore volume calculated using the bjh method for sac is more than six times lower than for ac suggesting that the sulfur present on the internal surface of sac http www calgoncarbon com wp content uploads product literature hgr mercuryremoval pdf occupied a significant fraction of the pore volume this is consistent with the relatively large amount of s present 14 wt in sac table 1 sulfur is present on the sac surfaces per discussion with a calgon representative in both the macropores and micropores korpiel and vidic 1997 the s in the microporous structures in activated carbon could be accessible for the smaller sized dissolved inorganic hg ii species huang and blankenship 1984 but potentially less accessible to larger hg species such as hg dom and hgs nps the impregnated sulfur in the oc and sac sorbents are designed to increase the affinity for hg korpiel and vidic 1997 sac was shown to be highly effective for the removal of elemental mercury from gas phases because of its sulfur content karatza et al 2000 however the ability of the sulfur on activated carbon to enhance removal of aqueous phase hg species is discussed later in the paper different from the sac the oc surface is functionalized to increase its affinity for a range of heavy metals including hg wang and abraham 2008 it has a lower sulfur content 5 wt than the sac but the sulfur is more available and reactive with hg as discussed later in the paper the exact speciation of sulfur in the oc and sac is proprietary however xrd results supporting information fig s6 indicate that the species of s on oc is different from the sac a small fraction of crystalline s is present on oc but not on sac 3 2 characterization of hg species synthesized hgs nps were characterized by xrd tem and dls xrd fig s6 indicates that the crystal form of synthesized hgs nps matched metacinnabar β hgs an average particle diameter of 10 3 nm was calculated by measuring the diameter of 100 hgs nps in tem images supporting information fig s7 however the intensity weighted mean hydrodynamic particle radius was centered on 20 nm 40 nm diameter determined by dls supporting information fig s8 suggesting that particles were homoaggregating to some degree in the aqueous phase hg dom characterization was included in our previous study gai et al 2016 a hg c molar ratio of 7 10 5 mol hg mol c was determined for the prepared hg dom species unlike hgs nps and hg dom species hg ii species were expected to depend more on the solution conditions the calculated hg ii speciation in each solution is shown in fig 1 the hg dom species is the dominant hg species when 1 mg l of nom was present at lower ionic strength in the absence of nom hg is primarily present as zero charged species hgcloh and hgcl2 with hg oh 2 and hgcl3 1 as minor dissolved species at higher ionic strengths various negatively charged dissolved mercury chloride ions hgclx 2 x are the predominant species this difference in charge of the dominant dissolved hg species is expected to impact the removal efficiencies of sorbents 3 3 removal of hg species from 5 mm nacl solution by adsorbents different hg removal mechanisms are expected for the tested hg species for hgs nps the expected main removal mechanism is heteroaggregation between hgs nps and adsorbents for hg ii species the main removal mechanism for all adsorbents is adsorption onto the surface additionally adsorption of hg ii into the micropores is expected for activated carbons ac sac but not for oc another potential mechanism for hg ii removal is reaction with impregnated sulfur on sac and oc hg dom shares the same adsorption and reaction removal mechanics as hg ii there are differences between the removal of hg ii and hg dom by adsorbents some micropores of activated carbon sorbents ac sac may be available to hg ii but not to hg dom due to its larger size in addition hg dom may not be as reactive to impregnated sulfur on the adsorbent as hg ii due to the strong hg s bond between hg and dom these differences suggest that hg dom will have lower removal than hg ii for all sorbents fig 2 shows the removal of hg species from 5 mm nacl solution by adsorbents for hg ii both sac and oc had higher removal than ac indicating that additional sulfur may react with hg ii species to enhance the removal in the case of hgs np removal both ac and sac had a similar performance oc had a slightly higher removal than activated carbon samples the positively charged surface of oc table 2 may facilitate the heteroaggregation between oc and negatively charged hgs nps gai et al 2016 for hg dom no significant difference for the hg removal was found among adsorbents 3 4 effect of cation type on the removal of hg species a cacl2 solution with the same ionic strength 5 mm was used to evaluate the effect of cation type on the removal of hg species fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the cation type tested did not significantly change the removal of hg ii and hgs nps however the change from na to ca2 significantly enhanced the removal of hg dom by adsorbents table s1 q e values shows that ca2 facilitated the removal of hg dom species in comparison with na it is known that ca2 can bridge nom with the negatively charged adsorbent surface to increase the adsorption of nom on adsorbents while na does not roy and dzombak 1996 cornelissen et al 2008 therefore it is likely that the adsorption of hg dom by activated carbon samples can also be enhanced with ca2 via bridging oc has a more positively charged surface in 1 7 mm cacl2 solution than in 5 mm nacl solution table 2 this suggests that in addition to bridging of the nom and oc the increased adsorption of hg dom by oc in cacl2 solution may result from the enhanced electrostatic attraction between the deprotonated carboxylic phenolic moieties present on hg dom and oc 3 5 effect of ionic strength on the removal of hg species the effect of ionic strength on the removal of hg species in a nacl and cacl2 solutions is shown in fig 4 the removal of hg ii species was lower at high ionic strength hashed bars compared low ionic strength for all three sorbent types the same trends were evident in the fitted q e values table s1 this is consistent with previous observations for hg ii adsorption using activated carbon and rice husk ash as adsorbents where lower adsorption of hg ii was attributed to a decrease in mercury activity at the higher ionic strength and lower electrostatic interactions krishnan and anirudhan 2002 feng et al 2004 however the hg ii speciation is also a function of ionic strength as shown in fig 1 uncharged hg ii species e g hgcloh aq hgcl2 aq are predominant at low ionic strength while negatively charged species e g hgcl4 2 hgcl3 are predominant at increased cl concentration the uncharged mercury compounds such as hgcloh aq and hgcl2 aq are more likely to adsorb than the negatively charged hg species to the negatively charged surfaces of activated carbons table 2 the decreased adsorption of hg ii by oc at high ionic strength may be due to the competitive adsorption process between hg ii ions and the background electrolyte ions as suggested in a previous study using functionalized montmorillonite and vermiculite particles to adsorb hg ii tran et al 2015 increasing ionic strength was expected to increase the removal of hgs np by decreasing the surface charge of hgs nps thereby facilitating nanoparticle heteroaggregation with the adsorbents while there is a modest increase in the removal of hgs nps in nacl at the higher ionic strength after 1 h supporting information fig s3 there is no statistically significant effect on hgs np removal after 4 h fig 4 there is also no statistically significant effect of ionic strength on the removal of hgs nps for cacl2 solutions ca2 is more efficient at screening charge on the particles than na it is likely that the ca2 ions effectively screened the charges at 1 7 mm and increasing to 66 7 mm does not provide additional screening 3 6 effect of nom on the removal of each hg species the effect of nom in solution on the removal of the hg species was compared in 5 mm nacl and 1 7 mm cacl2 solution conditions fig 5 show removal after 4 h in the absence of nom filled bars and in the presence of 1 mg c l nom hashed bars there are several trends evident in these data the mercury removal of the oc sorbent blue bars was most affected by the presence of added nom added nom decreased the removal of both hg ii species and hgs nps by oc in both nacl and cacl2 solutions fitting results of the kinetic data using the pseudo second order kinetic model are provided in table s1 the kinetic data fit well using this model for hg ii removal using oc without added nom in the solution but did not fit well for the same conditions when nom was present the poor fit suggests that a different removal mechanism may be involved for oc with nom present compared to the absence of nom organoclays are known to have high affinity for nom dentel et al 1998 the nom in the solution might be blocking the surface sites on oc and decreasing the adsorption kinetics of hg ii species the addition of nom in the solution also reduced the kinetics and extent of removal of hgs nps by oc nom is expected to adsorb onto both the oc and onto the hgs nps and thus decrease their heteroaggregation rate by increasing steric repulsion between the particles louie et al 2016 the impact of added nom on the removal of hg ii and hgs nps from 5 mm nacl solutions by ac red bars and sac green bars is less significant compared to oc blue bars fig 5 it suggests that either nom has relatively lower affinity for these activated carbon samples compared to oc or that there is a greater abundance of hg reactive sites on activated carbon compared to oc the latter is consistent with the significantly higher surface area measured for activated carbon compared to the oc however the effect of nom on sorption of hg ii and hgs on the activated carbons was greater in the presence of ca2 than for na even though both solutions had the same ionic strength fig 5 and table s1 as previously mentioned ca2 can bridge the nom with the negatively charged adsorbent surface to enhance the adsorption of nom on adsorbents while na does not have this effect roy and dzombak 1996 cornelissen et al 2008 lower adsorption of hg species occurs due to greater competition with nom in ca2 solutions in contrast to the activated carbon there was limited effect of cation type on the sorption of hg ii and hgs np species to oc this could be a result of an overall higher affinity of oc for nom which masks the effect of ca2 finally there was no apparent effect of added nom on the removal of the hg dom species however this was an artifact of the experimental design the prepared hg dom species had a hg c molar ratio of 70 μmol hg mol c gai et al 2016 meaning that 0 5 μmol l hg dom would introduce about 8 6 mg c l in the system thus an additional 1 mg c l did not significantly change the solution conditions and therefore did not significantly impact the removal results for hg dom table s1 q e values shows that ca2 enhanced the removal of hg dom species in comparison with na regardless of the presence of additional ha in the solution 3 7 comparison of adsorbent removal efficiencies the impregnation of activated carbon with sulfur is designed to increase its affinity for hg however for the aqueous conditions used in this work the sulfur impregnated activated carbon sac did not show better removal efficacy than activated carbon ac for hg dom or hgs nps there was some improvement seen for hg ii under low ionic strength conditions at high ionic strength in cacl2 solution ac showed higher removal rates for dissolved hg ii species than either sac or oc the pseudo first order model fitting results in table s1 were normalized by specific surface area values of adsorbents supporting information table s2 to further explore the differences in hg removal rates and mechanism the surface area normalized k and qe values are also plotted in fig 6 a and b on a surface area normalized basis there were differences between the sorbent types for all hg species the fitted values k and qe for the oc were statistically significantly higher than for the activated carbons p 0 0001 there were no significant differences observed between the two activated carbon samples this could be due to different s speciation on these adsorbents nabais et al 2006 or because the sulfur impregnation for sac decreased the available surface area for the materials these data indicate that oc can provide more efficient hg removal than the activated carbon samples per unit surface area 3 8 characterization of hg dom adsorbed onto absorbents significantly higher reactive surface area of the oc compared to the ac sorbents were explored by comparing the speciation of adsorbed hg dom species using xas the exafs spectra at the hg l iii edge and their linear combination fits are provided in fig 7 and table s3 respectively for ac hg ii thiol model compounds provide the best fitting results hg dom has the same xas signal as an hg thiolated ligand complex because the hg is associated with dom by forming hg s bonds these results suggest that hg dom is mainly physically absorbed onto the surface of ac a similar result is observed for sac with most hg present resembling the hg thiol hg s r model compound however the best fits are achieved using a mixture of hg thiol model compound and a hg cysteine model compound the latter tends to form two coordinated r s hg s r species the formed two coordinated species could be hg bonding with impregnated s on sac and with the s present in dom it also could be hg bonding with two impregnated s atoms on sac this speciation change also suggests that some of the impregnated sulfur in the sac is indeed reactive with the adsorbed hg dom species however the reactivity of sac with hg dom did not result in a higher sorption capacity this could be because the exafs experiments had to use a higher hg dom loading than hg removal experiments to collect useable xas spectra also ac has a higher surface area and more pore volume than sac which may enhance its uptake of hg species relative to sac thereby masking the increase in uptake due to its reactivity in contrast the hg speciation for hg dom adsorbed onto oc shows that hg dom is completely transformed to β hgs this can be formed when thiol is reacting with hg ii species wang et al 2001 zeng et al 2001 wang and zhu 2004 indicating that sulfur species on the surface of the oc were more reactive with the hg dom complex forming a more thermodynamically favorable β hgs species this is consistent with the higher observed reactivity of the oc surface compared to the activated carbon the different reactivity of hg with the sac compared to the oc may be due to the different form of sulfur present on those surfaces elemental sulfur is introduced on the sac surfaces per discussion with a calgon representative whereas a more reactive s species for example thiol that can react with hg ii to form β hgs dentel et al 1998 feng et al 2004 is present on the oc this form of sulfur could not be confirmed on oc as this information is proprietary the differences in reactivity with hg may also have resulted from the different distributions of sulfur on the particles for sac the sulfur deposited into micropores may be less available to react with large sized hg dom species however the impregnated sulfur on oc surfaces is more readily accessible to the hg dom species 4 conclusions and implications the results from these tests provide important insights into the effects of hg speciation and water quality parameters on removal of hg from water by activated carbon ac sac and organoclay oc it was shown that all three sorbents were effective at removing different hg species from water even hgs nps however the water quality parameters including cation type ionic strength and the presence of nom affected the removal of each hg species differently compared with na ca2 can enhance the removal of hg dom by adsorbents increasing the ionic strength decreased the removal of hg ii species due to the formation of dissolved hg species e g hgcl3 and hgcl4 2 with lower affinity for the sorbent surface than hg species formed at lower ionic strength hgcl2 hg oh 2 hgohcl the presence of nom reduced the removal of hg ii and hgs nps by all three adsorbents in cacl2 solution but only oc in nacl solutions the differences in hg removal between ac and sac samples used in this study were not significant this may be due to the relatively low reactivity of the form of s present on the sac xas results show that oc has a highly reactive surface forming an inorganic β hgs np phase from adsorbed hg dom whereas hg dom on the ac surface or sac surface was relatively unchanged although oc could remove all hg species better than ac or sac per unit surface area due to the higher surface reactivity of oc the lower surface area per mass of oc seems to eliminate most of its advantage on a per mass basis thus all three adsorbents can be effective for removal of hg species under various conditions but oc was more susceptible to fouling by nom in the water this study suggests that model solutions containing primarily dissolved hg ii may not accurately predict the removal efficiency of adsorbents for wastewaters although dissolved hg ii species have been widely used as a model compound to assess the performance of different hg sorbents dissolved hg ii species are typically not the dominant hg species in sediment porewaters natural waters or industrial wastewaters this study showed that hgs nps and hg dom species were removed by all sorbents but often to a lesser extent than hg ii species this indicates that using dissolved hg ii as a surrogate species for assessing removal efficiency may overestimate the efficacy of adsorbents for these other hg species the magnitude of the overestimate will depend on both the hg species and the solution conditions both the expected hg speciation and the water quality parameters ionic composition ionic strength and nom content need to be considered when designing sorbent based emission controls to meet hg removal targets for water containing high salinity e g ocean sediment porewater or neutralized industrial acids dissolved hg ii species will likely be more difficult to remove and may require increasing the adsorbent dosage compared to a low salinity case however high salinity did not appear to have a measurable impact on the removal of hgs np and hg dom emphasizing the need to consider hg species other than dissolved inorganic hg ii compounds when evaluating removal efficiencies for sorbents nominal nom concentrations as low as 1 mg c l are expected to reduce removal effectiveness especially for oc thus activated carbon may be a more effective option than oc for sorbent based remediation approaches when large amounts of nom is expected such as in subaquatic sediments gilmour et al 2013b or co produced water from oils and gas production certain refinery wastewater streams or freshwater sediment porewater the high surface reactivity of oc with hg dom and the resulting formation of a metacinnabar β hgs phase may make the use of oc attractive for hg sorption in low nom waters the formed β hgs phase has low aqueous solubility and a relatively lower bioavailability than other more labile hg species including hg dom and other dissolved phase hg

18884,the efficient and safe degradation of drugs present in wastewater requires the design of a new material possessing high activity for that process in addition to other methods photoelectrocatalysis pec merges the strengths of both photocatalytic and electrochemical methods and the efficiency could be enhanced by the type of photoelectrode material to address this challenge three ti tio2 nanotube based photoelectrodes differing in their tube morphology were prepared by anodic oxidation and employed for the degradation of the 5 fluorouracil 5 fu drug by the pec process the highest efficiency for 5 fluorouracil 5 fu degradation by pec was observed for the photoelectrode with a 1 7 μm length 65 nm diameter and 8 nm wall thickness of tio2 nanotubes which were prepared by ti foil anodization at 30 v the effects of applied potential irradiation intensity initial ph and 5 fu concentration on pec were investigated furthermore our findings showed that the mechanism of photoelectrocatalysis in the presence of tio2 nanotubes is based on oh and h activity to determine the 5 fu degradation pathway the organic byproducts were identified by lc ms analysis furthermore the ecotoxicity evaluated during pec dropped with decreasing 5 fu concentration graphical abstract image 1045 keywords anticancer drug photoelectrocatalysis tio2 nanotubes photoelectrodes 1 introduction in recent years a growth in anticancer drug consumption resulting from the increasing morbidity of cancer has been recorded zhang et al 2013 one of the most popular drugs used in anticancer therapies introduced onto the pharmaceutical market in 1958 is 5 fluorouracil 5 fu as reported by martin et al 2011 its consumption during 2011 in a single hospital in spain was 11 6 kg as an antimetabolite 5 fu works by inhibiting enzyme activity and results in a disruption in dna synthesis and it is incompletely metabolized with approximately 15 excreted unchanged xie 2012 this drug attacks not only cancer cells but also healthy cells which makes it show mutagenic and teratogenic properties lutterbeck et al 2015 in addition its physicochemical properties make it a stable compound slightly undergoing biodegradation and photolysis zhang et al 2013 for this reason insufficiently treated hospital and pharmaceutical industry wastewaters are main sources of this drug in aquatic environments booker et al 2014 to eliminate the health and environmental risks relating to the presence of anticancer drugs in the aquatic phase a few advanced oxidation processes have been suggested for the removal of these compounds from water and wastewater it was revealed that 5 fu could be efficiently degraded by electrochemical siedlecka et al 2018 photochemical lutterbeck et al 2015 and photocatalytic lin and lin 2014 processes photoelectrocatalysis pec which is a relatively new method combines the advantages of heterogeneous photocatalysis pc and electrochemical oxidation eo garcia segura and brillas 2017 zhang et al 2012 thus appearing as a promising process for the degradation of organic micropollutants integration of these methods reduces the undesirable recombination of photogenerated electron hole e cb h vb pairs reaction 2 which are formed by exposure of the semiconductor anode pa to irradiation when the energy of irradiation is greater than that of the semiconductor band gap ebg photogenerated electrons e are transported to the conduction band cb and holes h remain in the valence band vb reaction 1 limiting recombination increases the lifetime of the holes which are able to oxidize contaminants either directly or indirectly by the formation of very strong oxidants hydroxyl radicals oh from the reaction between h and adsorbed water reaction 3 moreover the degradation of organic pollutants by pec could be the result of electrochemical oxidation by the hydroxyl radicals generated in reaction 4 however the electrochemical production of hydroxyl radicals is generally not effective because of the small current density in the pec system garcia segura and brillas 2017 1 p a h v e c b h v b 2 e c b h v b p a h e a t 3 h v b h 2 o o h h 4 p a h 2 o o h h e thus far different semiconductors have been applied as photoanodes such as tio2 zno and wo3 li et al 2013 oliveira et al 2014 xin et al 2011 however the greatest interest is in tio2 as a result of its stability low cost nontoxicity and good photocatalytic properties garcia segura and brillas 2017 two main approaches have been employed to obtain thin film tio2 electrodes 1 deposition of thin films of tio2 onto a conducting plate by dipping the plate into a colloidal suspension of tio2 cardoso et al 2010 spray painting rincon et al 2001 magnetron sputtering wang et al 2017 chemical vapor deposition cvd hou et al 2012 atomic layer deposition ald edy et al 2016 or atmospheric plasma spray aps dosta et al 2016 and 2 synthesis of these highly ordered tridimensional nanostructures by ti plate anodization nischk et al 2014 as reported by chatzitakis et al 2017 highly ordered tio2 nanotube nt photoanodes are characterized by their higher photoelectrochemical degradation efficiency than that of thin film tio2 prepared by the sol gel method in addition a thin film of tio2 nts possesses a large surface area and oriented electron transport resulting in a very good charge separation efficiency and photostability which make it a promising photoanode material cardoso et al 2010 wu et al 2016 furthermore the anodization method allows for precise control of the morphology of the tio2 nanotubes such as the nanotube length and wall thickness nischk et al 2014 in addition to the morphology and structure of the photoanode the organic pollutant removal efficiency in the pec process depends on additional parameters such as the electric potential irradiation range and intensity conductivity and ph of the solution and the initial concentration of the organic pollutants brugnera et al 2010 cardoso et al 2010 garcia segura and brillas 2017 zhang et al 2012 the applied potential is responsible for reducing electron hole recombination and its optimal value depends on the photoanode film thickness an appropriate irradiation range and intensity forms the electron hole pairs in the case of tio2 the appropriate radiation is in the uv range the ph determines the state of the organic pollutants undergoing ionization while the conductivity influences the electron mass transport the pec degradation efficiency of pollutants strongly depends on the type and concentration of the organic pollutants until now the pec process has been investigated to remove compounds such as dyes ferraz et al 2013 4 chlorophenol yang et al 2009 and bisphenol a brugnera et al 2010 and the pharmaceuticals chlortetracycline daghrir et al 2014 and 17 α ethinylestradiol oliveira et al 2014 specifically tio2 nanotubes have been efficiently employed for photoelectrochemical degradation of rhodamine b wu et al 2016 aromatic amine cardoso et al 2010 and silicic acid zhang et al 2014 in the aqueous phase but it is still not clear how their morphology affected the efficiency of the pec process furthermore pec has not been applied for 5 fu removal and it is not yet understood which process parameters are most crucial for its effectiveness thus in view of this we prepared three photoanodes with different geometries of tio2 nanotubes by anodization of ti foil and applied them to the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of 5 fu their structure and morphology were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction patterns xrd uv vis absorbance photoluminescence and photoelectrochemical analyses the pec degradation activity of the prepared electrodes at different values of electric potential irradiation intensity ph and drug concentration was determined the amount of hydroxyl radicals was determined and the participation of individual oxidants in 5

parameters such as potential from 0 5 to 2 0 v ph from 3 0 to 9 0 irradiation power from 4 5 to 1 8 mw cm 2 and 5 fu concentration from 0 008 to 0 385 mm on the efficiency of photoelectrochemical

shimadzu equipped with a phenomenex kinetex c 18 column 150 4 6 mm 2 6 μm was employed to determine the concentration of 5 fu an isocratic program with 6 acetonitrile and 94 water and 0 4 ml min 1

fabiańska et al 2014 was investigated samples of 5 fu were diluted 1 10 v v in steinberg medium to keep appropriate conditions for duckweed growth during the test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the prepared ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes fig 1 shows the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes prepared at 20 30 and 40 v the tio2 nt dimensions estimated based on the sem images are given in table 1 it is evident that the thin layers of tio2 nts prepared on the titanium substrate were highly and vertically ordered and the tubular structure was uniform and free from impurities as shown in table 1 the external diameter d and length l of the tio2 nts were relatively small when the sample was anodized at 20 v reaching 54 nm and 0 8 μm respectively with increasing applied voltage up to 40 v the dimensions of the tio2 nts increased gradually reaching approximately d 72 nm and l 2 2 μm it is also worth noting that with increasing tio2 nt dimensions the active surface area of the obtained photoelectrodes became larger the developed surface area calculated based on ngaboyamahina et al 2014 all of the obtained ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes is summarized in table 1 the xrd patterns of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes obtained at 20 30 and 40 v are shown in fig 2 a in all patterns peaks reflecting the anatase and titanium support can be seen the peaks at 25 39 37 95 47 81 53 19 and 55 07 can be ascribed to the 101 004 200 105 and 211 planes respectively of tio2 anatase while those at 2θ values of 40 23 and 52 95 can be described to the 101 and 103 planes respectively of the hexagonal phase of the ti substrate the diffraction peak intensity of the anatase phase increased with increasing applied voltage due to the increase in the thickness of the tio2 nt layer on the titanium substrate the diffraction patterns of ti tio2 nts prepared at different anodization voltages are similar to one another the average crystallite sizes of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes see table 1 were estimated based on the 101 peak width the crystallite size increased with increasing anodization voltage from 33 to 36 nm and these results are in agreement with the literature nishanthi et al 2014 the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs and the kubelka munk function transformation plot vs photon energy of all ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes are displayed in fig 2b two absorption regions were detected first in the wavelength region below 400 nm the intrinsic interbond transition absorption of anatase tio2 can be seen while the second peak in the visible light region may be associated with trapped electrons at the ti3 center which can be attributed to the scattering effect of light caused by cracks and or pores in the ti tio2 nt layer jia et al 2016 zhuang et al 2007 moreover the absorption edge of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes prepared at higher voltages 30 and 40 v showed a slight redshift in comparison with the absorption edge of the sample anodized at 20 v as shown in table 1 and fig 2b insert the bandgap energy of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes decreased with increasing applied voltage starting at 3 3 ev and reaching 3 06 ev the ti tio2 nt photoelectrode obtained at 20 v exhibited a higher bandgap energy 3 3 ev compared to that of anatase tio2 3 23 ev the bandgap energy eg of tio2 mainly depends on the crystalline phase composition anatase eg 3 23 ev rutile eg 3 0 ev brookite eg 3 11 ev regonini et al 2013 therefore the coexistence of these phases in our samples could reduce the bandgap energy however from xrd patters we detected the peaks attributed to the anatase phase and the hexagonal phase of the ti substrate we did not register any signal coming from the rutile or brookite phase thus another factor influencing the band gap energy of tio2 nanotubes and other semiconductor nanomaterials is particle grain size so called quantum size effect the difference can be attributed to the quantum size effect of the tio2 nanotubes since with increasing applied voltage from 20 to 40 v the thickness of the tio2 nanotubes increased gradually from 0 8 to 2 2 nm while band gap energy decreased from 3 30 to 3 06 ev mor et al 2006 this was already observed chen et al 2016 mor et al 2006 photoluminescent pl spectra of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes anodized at different voltages are presented in fig 2c all pl spectra of the obtained ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes consisted of four emission peaks at 421 449 484 and 530 nm the first peak can be ascribed to the existence of self trapped excitons from the tio6 8 octahedron while the second and third peaks may be associated with surface and structural defects such as oxygen vacancies which are able to create intermediate energy states located below the conduction band klein et al 2016 finally the last peak at 530 nm can be related to the radiative recombination of charge carriers originating from the deep hole trap states associated with oxygen vacancies knorr et al 2008 furthermore the pl intensity registered for the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes anodized at different voltages decreased with increasing applied potential while the peak positions remained almost the same this suggests that the ti tio2 nt photoelectrode obtained at the highest anodization voltage 40 v exhibited the lowest recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs the decrease of the pl intensity for the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes anodized under higher anodization voltages may be related to the generation of higher amounts of either structural defects ti3 states or oxygen vacancies which act as electron traps facilitating electron hole separation nishanthi et al 2015 zhuang et al 2007 the results of the photoelectrochemical experiments of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes are presented in fig 3 to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated e h pairs transient photocurrent density was measured at 1 v as presented in fig 3a all of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes are characterized by very good repeatability and stability over several on off cycles of uv vis irradiation moreover comparing the generated photocurrent densities the highest value 1 5 ma cm 2 was obtained for ti tio2 nts 30 v while that of ti tio2 nts 20 v 1 ma cm 2 and ti tio2 nts 40 v 1 4 ma cm 2 were 1 5 and 1 07 times lower respectively these results demonstrate that the ti tio2 nts 30 v electrode possesses the highest separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers which leads to higher amount of charge h and e capable to generated photoelectrochemical oxidant species garcia segura et al 2018 moreover in the case of electrode prepared at 40 v the larger nt were obtained which means that the transport of photons from the light source to the base of the nt could be limited affecting the lower amount of excited states and charge transport efficiency in fig 3b the linear voltammograms of all of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes in the dark are shown the curve obtained for ti tio2 nts 30 v started to sharply increase at 1 5 v which is connected with water oxidation to oxygen in the case of the ti tio2 nts 20 v and ti tio2 nts 40 v the curve increase starts at 1 3 v which indicates that the side reaction started earlier accordingly the pec degradation should be most effective below 1 5 v for ti tio2 nts 30 v and below 1 3 v for ti tio2 nts 20 v and ti tio2 nts 40 v higher potential values cause the electrolysis of water the effect of the applied potential on pec efficiency with ti tio2 nts 30 v photoanode was presented in following part 3 2 comparison of the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes the activity is expressed as the efficiency of 5 fu degradation 1 c c0 after 180 min of the process and a first order kinetic rate constant k calculated from ln c0 c versus time plots the efficiency of 5 fu c0 0 038 mm ph 6 4 degradation depending on the type of process photoelectrocatalysis photocatalysis electrolysis and photolysis is presented in fig 4 a photoelectrocatalytic applied potential of 1 v irradiation intensity 4 5 mw cm 2 and photocatalytic activity tests were carried out in the presence of the ti tio2 nt 30 v photoelectrode the highest efficiency of 5 fu removal was observed for photoelectrocatalysis and reached 100 k 0 0235 min 1 after 150 min of running the process while photocatalytic oxidation allowed for the degradation of 70 k 0 0067 min 1 of 5 fu after 180 min of irradiation 4 5 mw cm 2 as shown in fig 4a notably 5 fu removal was not observed during either photolysis or electrolysis in view of the above mentioned results it can be concluded that photoelectrocatalytic oxidation is more effective at promoting the degradation of 5 fu this is due to the lack of recombination of the charge carriers during photoelectrocatalytic oxidation while recombination of carriers takes place during the photocatalysis process which inhibits the generation of strong oxidants on the surface of the photocatalytic layer similar results were also observed by cardoso et al 2010 and cheng et al 2016 during aromatic amine and diclofenac removal using tio2 nanotubes in a photocatalytic process 3 3 photoelectrochemical degradation of 5 fu by ti tio2 nt 3 3 1 effect of the ti tio2 nt electrode properties the efficiency of 5 fu c0 0 038 mm ph 6 4 degradation in the presence of ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes prepared at different anodization voltages is presented in fig 4b photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5 fu was conducted at an applied potential of 1 v and constant irradiation of 4 5 mw cm 2 generally the highest decomposition rate of 5 fu was achieved in the presence of the ti tio2 nt 30 v photoelectrode with k 0 0235 min 1 r2 0 9946 while the other two electrodes exhibited lower 5 fu degradation rate constants of 0 0211 r2 0 9932 and 0 0184 r2 0 9923 for ti tio2 nt 40 v and ti tio2 nt 20 v respectively the varied activity of the photoelectrodes is the result of the different dimensions of the tio2 nanotubes as has been reported macak et al 2007 marien et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the morphology of the nanotubes has an important influence on photocatalytic activity in the case of short nanotubes there is a probability that the surface area will be too small to absorb the entire irradiation alternatively a large wall thickness and relatively small inner diameter for the nanotubes limits pollutant diffusion into the tubes in the case of long nanotubes photocatalytic degradation can also be controlled by mass transport of pollutant inside of the nanotube as well as by the transport of generated oxidation species such hydroxyl radicals from surface of nanotubes to the solution moreover the depth penetration of irradiation in the longer nanotubes is limited affecting the lower amount of photogenerated charge carriers cerron calle et al 2019 therefore the optimized dimensions of tio2 nanotubes are an important step in the performance of the photoelectrocatalytic process in our experiments the optimal nanotubes ti tio2 nt 30 v were prepared by ti foil anodization at 30 v and were characterized by nanotube lengths of 1 7 μm external diameters of 65 nm wall thicknesses of 8 nm and developed surface areas of 549 cm2 3 3 2 effect of applied potential the potential in the pec process increases the degradation efficiency compared to that of the pc system the optimal potential depends on the irradiation power and photoanode material in figure 4c 5 fu 0 038 mm photoelectrocatalytic degradation on ti tio2 nt 30 v at 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 v with a uv irradiation power of 4 5 mw cm 2 and a ph of 6 4 is presented the electric field formed by the potential gradient on the ti tio2 nt surface keeps photogenerated e h pairs apart as shown the fastest decomposition of 5 fu with a rate constant of 0 0235 min 1 r 0 9946 was observed when 1 v was applied in the case of 0 5 v the decomposition of 5 fu was slower than that at 1 v and k was 0 0148 min 1 r2 0 9893 this was a result of insufficient power to separate all of the photogenerated e h pairs on the anode surface additionally 1 5 v and 2 v decreased the 5 fu decomposition rate compared to that at 1 v and the k values were 0 0192 r2 0 9683 and 0 0138 min 1 r2 0 998 respectively in this case too high a potential inhibited the degradation efficiency by the side reaction of the decomposition of water into oxygen on the anode surface which begins at 1 5 v as shown in the voltammograms fig 3b oxygen production from water is a competitive reaction to the generation of the powerful oxidants oh radicals the optimal value of the potential depends on the properties of the anode material and for the ti tio2 nt anodes the optimal value was determined to be in the range of 0 5 1 5 v zhang et al 2012 3 3 3 effect of irradiation intensity the irradiation intensity is the main parameter that regulates the amount of charge carrier produced at the surface of the ti tio2 nts therefore simulation of natural sunlight with uv irradiation intensity values of 4 5 3 2 and 1 8 mw cm 2 was used for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 5 fu 0 038 mm the experimental conditions were as follows potential of 1 v ph of 6 4 and ti tio2 nts 30 v anode the pseudo first order rate constant k calculated for the uv irradiation intensities of 4 5 mw cm 2 3 2 mw cm 2 and 1 8 mw cm 2 was 0 0235 r2 0 9946 0 0105 r2 0 9961 and 0 008 r2 0 9941 min 1 respectively as expected k increased with an increase in irradiation intensity fig 4d wang et al 2015 found the same trend using the pec system for methylene blue removal there were also calculated the electric energy require to pec degradation of 5 fu depending on the irradiation intensity the eeo value 0 35 0 43 and 0 59 kwh m 3 order 1 were obtained for irradiation intensity 4 5 1 8 and 3 2 mw cm 2 respectively these results shows that the smallest amount of electric energy was used for removal 5 fu in pec process when the highest irradiation was applied although to produce higher irradiation intensities more energy is needed the process takes less time than a process conducted at a lower irradiation intensity additionally eeo was calculated for pc with ti tio2 30v at 4 5 mw cm 2 and the amount of electric energy used for these process 1 2 kwh m 3 order 1 was more than three times higher compere to pec therefore it can be concluded that from economic point of view using pec is more favorable than pc 3 3 4 effect of solution ph in the pec system the solution ph can significantly influence the degradation process efficiency martins et al 2017 for this reason the role of the initial ph in the pec oxidation of a 0 038 mm solution of 5 fu was studied with the initial ph values of 3 0 5 0 6 4 7 0 9 0 at 1 v and 4 5 mw cm 2 on ti tio2 nt 30 v a ph of 6 4 is the original ph value of a solution of 0 035 mm of 5 fu and electrolyte na2so4 sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid were used to regulate the solution ph the obtained results are presented in fig 4e in this study an increase in the 5 fu decomposition rate with decreasing initial ph value was observed a k equal to 0 0276 r2 0 9705 0 0244 r2 0 9918 0 0235 r2 0 9946 0 0196 r2 0 9967 and 0 0143 r2 0 9938 was obtained for ph 3 0 5 0 6 4 7 0 and 9 0 respectively in accordance with zhang et al 2014 more effective pec oxidation of organic matter can be associated with an easier charge transfer between the photoelectrode and electrolyte at acidic conditions compared to that in basic conditions furthermore the redox potentials of oh calculated by the nernst equation martins et al 2017 present the highest oxidative potential for acid medium therefore in ph 3 5 fu oxidation is favorable moreover in the alkaline solution ph 9 hco3 and co3 2 existed in solution which are strong oh scavengers and inhibit the degradation of 5 fu although the pec degradation at the acidic ph occurred faster than at near neutral ph the efficiency not increased enough to be economical and technological reasonably to acidify the solution before the process 3 3 5 effect of 5 fu concentration the effect of the 5 fu initial concentration on pec was investigated in the range from 0 008 to 0 385 mm at 1 v and 4 5 mw cm 2 the obtained results are presented in fig 4f the degradation was much slower at the high 5 fu concentration 0 385 mm than in diluted solutions of 5 fu 0 008 and 0 038 mm the pseudo first order rate constant for degradation of 0 385 mm of 5 fu equals 0 0101 r2 0 9844 which was 2 3 times lower than the k obtained for 0 038 0 0235 r2 0 9946 and 1 8 times lower than the k obtained for 0 008 mm 0 0186 r2 0 9948 it is worth noting that although the decomposition was faster at lower concentrations of 5 fu the amount of drug removed was higher at greater concentrations as shown at 150 min of pec 0 0385 mm and 0 308 mm of 5 fu were removed from the 0 0385 mm and 0 385 mm initial concentrations respectively this is most likely the result of the increase of the organic matter diffusion flux in the direction of the photoanode with the increase of 5 fu concentration ammar et al 2016 these results indicate that the pec process were limited by mass transport the same trend of decreasing decomposition rate with increasing pollutant concentration in pec was shown by zheng et al zhang et al 2014 using salicylic acid and cardoso et al 2010 who used aromatic amine these results suggest that photoelectrochemical oxidation is an efficient method for treating 5 fu in dilute solutions as well as in solutions with higher concentrations 3 4 photoelectrocatalysis mechanism degradation of organics in pec can be a result of active species such as oh and h by exciting the tio2 photoanode h e pairs are generated then the hydroxyl radicals are generated by the oxidation of water or hydroxyl anions by h while the e are transported to the cathode garcia segura and brillas 2017 hua et al 2016 in photocatalysis e react with oxygen creating o 2 which can degrade organics compared to photocatalysis in pec o 2 and e are not involved in the decomposition process which is connected with carrying electrons by an external electrical circuit to the cathode to investigate the contribution of individual oxidizing species in photoelectrocatalysis into treated solutions of 5 fu the scavengers methanol meoh formic acid fa and potassium iodide ki were added cheng et al 2013 li et al 2016 yang et al 2009 ki scavenged both oh and h while meoh and fa block the activity of oh and h respectively as shown in fig 5 a pec without scavengers leads to complete removal of 5 fu in 150 min the presence of ki completely inhibited 5 fu photoelectrocatalytic degradation this indicates that the drug has not been removed by sorption on the photoelectrode and that the hydroxyl radicals and the holes are both important active species which are mainly responsible for the degradation in the case of hydroxyl radical scavenging addition of meoh only 40 of the 5 fu initial concentration was removed after 3 h of pec a similar situation was observed when formic acid scavenger of h was added into the reaction system this result confirms a similar contribution from both oh and h in 5 fu photoelectrochemical degradation yang et al 2009 also presented a significant role for hydroxyl radicals in the pec degradation of 4 chlorophenol alternatively studies wang et al 2014 on pec oxidation of aqueous ammonia using tio2 nanotubes indicate that the photogenerated holes play a more important role than the hydroxyl radicals in this process this proves that the participation of the active species in pec depends on the compound nature additionally the results presented in fig 5b show that the amount of generated hydroxyl radicals in pec increased during the process in conclusion the pec degradation of 5 fu was mainly driven by the participation of oh and h 3 5 5 fu degradation pathway after 4 h of the photoelectrocatalytic process the active species had almost completely degraded 5 fu 0 385 mm however in the same time toc was only 30 removed fig 6 incomplete mineralization suggests that the process leads to organic intermediates rather than co2 to identify the organic degradation products of 5 fu liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer was used the applied photoelectrocatalytic process led to the formation of five degradation products of 5 fluorouracil with m h 143 163 and m h 113 115 and 159 as shown in fig 7 the 5 fu decomposition was the result of substitution or detachment of the fluorine atom and ketonization of the pyrimidine ring in the next step ring opening was observed ring opening can be a result of breaking the c n bond by hydrogenation at the n1 position according to the electrochemical degradation of 5 fluoro 2 methoxypyrimidine presented by zhang et al 2016 and additional oxidation to form a carboxyl group similar 5 fu degradation products under photocatalytic and electrochemical processes were presented by lutterbeck et al 2015 and siedlecka et al 2018 respectively an analysis of inorganic ions after 4 h of the 5 fu 0 385 mm pec degradation showed that the 30 2 13 mg l 1 f of fluoride and 17 of inorganic form of nitrogen 1 7 mg l 1 n nh4 n no3 not detected which could be release from 5 fu were formed according to garcia segura et al garcia segura et al 2017 there is also possible released small amounts of nox species these results indicated that organic transformation product contain both nitrogen and fluoride 3 6 ecotoxicity considering the possibility of exposing green plants to the presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments lemna minor toxicity tests were chosen to investigate the ecotoxicity of the 5 fu treated solution by pec moreover as has been shown by białk bielińska et al 2017 these organisms are more sensitive to 5 fu than daphnia magna or vibrio fischeri it is worth pointing out that for the first time duckweed l minor was used to evaluate the ecotoxicity of a solution treated by pec to date only marine bacteria vibrio fischeri algae pseudokirchella subcapitata microcystis aeruginosa and shellfish daphnia magna have been used daghrir et al 2013 li et al 2014 liu et al 2013 as reported by li et al and daghrir et al pec reduced the toxicity of ofloxacin to m aeruginosa and chlortetracycline to v fisheri and p subcapitata additionally liu et al 2013 showed that triclosan degradation by pec can generate intermediates that are more toxic to v fisheri as shown in fig 6 the initial solutions of 5 fu showed 60 l minor growth inhibition during pec as the concentration of the drug decreases the toxicity also decreases although the toc was only 30 removed these results indicated that the formed degradation products are characterized by lower toxicity than 5 fu degradation products of 5 fu with low toxicity to l minor were also identified during electrochemical oxidation as reported by siedlecka et al 2018 additionally there were no identified 5 fu degradation products with mutagenic or genotoxic properties according to the in silico toxicity prediction reported by lutterbek et al lutterbeck et al 2015 therefore it can be assumed that the 5 fu solution treated by pec is safer for the environment than the initial solution 4 conclusion photoelectrocatalysis is a process in which the efficiency of pollutant treatment depends on experimental parameters as well as the photoelectrode material in the present study photoelectrodes comprised of ti tio2 nts were prepared at different anodization voltages and were characterized by the various geometric parameters of the tio2 nanotubes the highest photoelectrocatalytic removal of 5 fu was achieved by ti tio2 nt 30 v which have a 1 7 μm length 65 nm diameter and 8 nm wall thickness for the tio2 nanotubes and was characterized by the highest photocurrent response this electrode was used for 5 fu decomposition in electrolysis photolysis and photoelectrocatalysis with the last process proving to be the most effective in the next step the effects of the applied potential irradiation intensity initial ph and initial 5 fu concentration on photoelectrocatalysis were investigated for the ti tio2 nt 30 v photoelectrode the results indicate that the highest 5 fu degradation rate was obtained at a potential of 1 v moreover for higher irradiation intensity and lower initial ph faster degradation was observed additionally pec removal of 5 fu at initial concentrations in the range of 0 008 0 385 mm was effective furthermore studies have shown that the mechanism of photoelectrocatalysis of 5 fu is based on oh and h activity finally the photoelectrocatalytic degradation pathway and ecotoxicity of 5 fu treated by photoelectrocatalysis were demonstrated an investigation of the organic degradation products of 5 fu showed defluoridation and ketonization of the pyrimidine ring next breaking the c n bond causing ring opening was observed additionally the inorganic products such f and nh4 were released in addition the results showed decreasing l minor growth inhibition with decreasing 5 fu concentration during photoelectrocatalysis declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

18884,the efficient and safe degradation of drugs present in wastewater requires the design of a new material possessing high activity for that process in addition to other methods photoelectrocatalysis pec merges the strengths of both photocatalytic and electrochemical methods and the efficiency could be enhanced by the type of photoelectrode material to address this challenge three ti tio2 nanotube based photoelectrodes differing in their tube morphology were prepared by anodic oxidation and employed for the degradation of the 5 fluorouracil 5 fu drug by the pec process the highest efficiency for 5 fluorouracil 5 fu degradation by pec was observed for the photoelectrode with a 1 7 μm length 65 nm diameter and 8 nm wall thickness of tio2 nanotubes which were prepared by ti foil anodization at 30 v the effects of applied potential irradiation intensity initial ph and 5 fu concentration on pec were investigated furthermore our findings showed that the mechanism of photoelectrocatalysis in the presence of tio2 nanotubes is based on oh and h activity to determine the 5 fu degradation pathway the organic byproducts were identified by lc ms analysis furthermore the ecotoxicity evaluated during pec dropped with decreasing 5 fu concentration graphical abstract image 1045 keywords anticancer drug photoelectrocatalysis tio2 nanotubes photoelectrodes 1 introduction in recent years a growth in anticancer drug consumption resulting from the increasing morbidity of cancer has been recorded zhang et al 2013 one of the most popular drugs used in anticancer therapies introduced onto the pharmaceutical market in 1958 is 5 fluorouracil 5 fu as reported by martin et al 2011 its consumption during 2011 in a single hospital in spain was 11 6 kg as an antimetabolite 5 fu works by inhibiting enzyme activity and results in a disruption in dna synthesis and it is incompletely metabolized with approximately 15 excreted unchanged xie 2012 this drug attacks not only cancer cells but also healthy cells which makes it show mutagenic and teratogenic properties lutterbeck et al 2015 in addition its physicochemical properties make it a stable compound slightly

booker et al 2014 to eliminate the health and environmental risks relating to the presence of anticancer drugs in the aquatic phase a few advanced oxidation processes have been suggested for the removal of these compounds from water and wastewater it was revealed that 5 fu could be efficiently degraded by electrochemical siedlecka et al 2018 photochemical lutterbeck et al 2015 and

the holes which are able to oxidize contaminants either directly or indirectly by the formation of very strong oxidants hydroxyl radicals oh from the reaction between h and adsorbed water reaction 3 moreover the degradation of organic pollutants by pec could be the result of electrochemical oxidation by the hydroxyl radicals generated in reaction 4 however the electrochemical production of hydroxyl radicals is generally not effective because of the small current density in the pec system garcia segura and brillas 2017 1 p a h v e c b h v b 2 e c b h v b p a h e a t 3 h v b h 2 o o h h 4 p a h 2 o o h h e thus far different semiconductors have been applied as photoanodes such as tio2 zno and wo3 li et al 2013 oliveira et al 2014 xin et al 2011 however the greatest interest is in tio2 as a result of its stability low cost nontoxicity and good photocatalytic properties garcia segura and brillas 2017 two main approaches have been employed to obtain thin film tio2 electrodes 1 deposition of thin films of tio2 onto a conducting plate by dipping the plate into a colloidal suspension of tio2 cardoso et al 2010 spray painting rincon et al 2001 magnetron sputtering wang et al 2017 chemical vapor deposition cvd hou et al 2012 atomic layer deposition ald edy et al 2016 or atmospheric plasma spray aps dosta et al 2016 and 2 synthesis of these highly ordered tridimensional nanostructures by ti plate anodization nischk et al 2014 as reported by chatzitakis et al 2017 highly ordered tio2 nanotube nt photoanodes are characterized by their higher photoelectrochemical degradation efficiency than that of thin film tio2 prepared by the sol gel method in addition a thin film of tio2 nts possesses a large surface area and oriented electron transport resulting in a very good charge separation efficiency and photostability which make it a promising photoanode material cardoso et al 2010 wu et al 2016 furthermore the anodization method allows for precise control of the morphology of the tio2 nanotubes such as the nanotube length and wall thickness nischk et al 2014 in addition to the morphology and structure of the photoanode the organic pollutant removal efficiency in the pec process depends on additional parameters such as the electric potential irradiation range and intensity conductivity and ph of the solution and the initial concentration of the organic pollutants brugnera et al 2010 cardoso et al 2010 garcia segura and brillas 2017 zhang et al 2012 the applied potential is responsible for reducing electron hole recombination and its optimal value depends on the photoanode film thickness an appropriate irradiation range and intensity forms the electron hole pairs in the case of tio2 the appropriate radiation is in the uv range the ph determines the state of the organic pollutants undergoing ionization while the conductivity influences the electron mass transport the pec degradation efficiency of pollutants strongly depends on the type and concentration of the organic pollutants until now the pec process has been investigated to remove compounds such as dyes ferraz et al 2013 4 chlorophenol yang et al 2009 and bisphenol a brugnera et al 2010 and the pharmaceuticals chlortetracycline daghrir et al 2014 and 17 α ethinylestradiol oliveira et al 2014 specifically tio2 nanotubes have been efficiently employed for photoelectrochemical degradation of rhodamine b wu et al 2016 aromatic amine cardoso et al 2010 and silicic acid zhang et al 2014 in the aqueous phase but it is still not clear how their morphology affected the efficiency of the pec process furthermore pec has not been applied for 5 fu removal and it is not yet understood which process parameters are most crucial for its effectiveness thus in view of this we prepared three photoanodes with different geometries of tio2 nanotubes by anodization of ti foil and applied them to the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of 5 fu their structure and morphology were investigated

fluorescent product 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid the photoelectrochemical experiments were conducted in a three electrode setup with a steel sheet as the counter electrode a ti tio2 nt 30 v

ls 50b luminescence spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon discharge lamp as an excitation source excitation wavelength 315 nm and an r928 photomultiplier detector 2 5 photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5 fu photoelectrochemical degradation experiments of 5 fu were performed in an 80 ml single compartment reactor with magnetic stirring the reactor contained a three electrode configuration with one

fabiańska et al 2014 was investigated samples of 5 fu were diluted 1 10 v v in steinberg medium to keep appropriate conditions for duckweed growth during the test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the prepared ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes fig 1 shows the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes prepared at 20 30 and 40 v the tio2 nt dimensions estimated based on the sem images are given in table 1 it is evident that the thin layers of tio2 nts prepared on the titanium substrate were highly and vertically ordered and the tubular structure was uniform and free from impurities as shown in table 1 the external diameter d and length l of the tio2 nts were relatively small when the sample was anodized at 20 v reaching 54 nm and 0 8 μm respectively with increasing applied voltage up to 40 v the dimensions of the tio2 nts increased gradually reaching approximately d 72 nm and l 2 2 μm it is also worth noting that with increasing tio2 nt dimensions the active surface area of the obtained photoelectrodes became larger the developed surface area calculated based on ngaboyamahina et al 2014 all of the obtained ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes is summarized in table 1 the xrd patterns of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes obtained at 20 30 and 40 v are shown in fig 2 a in all patterns peaks reflecting the anatase and titanium support can be seen the peaks at 25 39 37 95 47 81 53 19 and 55 07 can be ascribed to the 101 004 200 105 and 211 planes respectively of tio2 anatase while those at 2θ values of 40 23 and 52 95 can be described to the 101 and 103 planes respectively of the hexagonal phase of the ti substrate the diffraction peak intensity of the anatase phase increased with increasing applied voltage due to the increase in the thickness of the tio2 nt layer on the titanium substrate the diffraction patterns of ti tio2 nts prepared at different anodization voltages are similar to one another the average crystallite sizes of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes see table 1 were estimated based on the 101 peak width the crystallite size increased with increasing anodization voltage from 33 to 36 nm and these results are in agreement with the literature nishanthi et al 2014 the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs and the kubelka munk function transformation plot vs photon energy of all ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes are displayed in fig 2b two absorption regions were detected first in the wavelength region below 400 nm the intrinsic interbond transition absorption of anatase tio2 can be seen while the second peak in the visible light region may be associated with trapped electrons at the ti3 center which can be attributed to the scattering effect of light caused by cracks and or pores in the ti tio2 nt layer jia et al 2016 zhuang et al 2007 moreover the absorption edge of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes prepared at higher voltages 30 and 40 v showed a slight redshift in comparison with the absorption edge of the sample anodized at 20 v as shown in table 1 and fig 2b insert the bandgap energy of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes decreased with increasing applied voltage starting at 3 3 ev and reaching 3 06 ev the ti tio2 nt photoelectrode obtained at 20 v exhibited a higher bandgap energy 3 3 ev compared to that of anatase tio2 3 23 ev the bandgap energy eg of tio2 mainly depends on the crystalline phase composition anatase eg 3 23 ev rutile eg 3 0 ev brookite eg 3 11 ev regonini et al 2013 therefore the coexistence of these phases in our samples could reduce the bandgap energy however from xrd patters we detected the peaks attributed to the anatase phase and the hexagonal phase of the ti substrate we did not register any signal coming from the rutile or brookite phase thus another factor influencing the band gap energy of tio2 nanotubes and other semiconductor nanomaterials is particle grain size so called quantum size effect the difference can be attributed to the quantum size effect of the tio2 nanotubes since with increasing applied voltage from 20 to 40 v the thickness of the tio2 nanotubes increased gradually from 0 8 to 2 2 nm while band gap energy decreased from 3 30 to 3 06 ev mor et al 2006 this was already observed chen et al 2016 mor et al 2006 photoluminescent pl spectra of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes anodized at different voltages are presented in fig 2c all pl spectra of the obtained ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes consisted of four emission peaks at 421 449 484 and 530 nm the first peak can be ascribed to the existence of self trapped excitons from the tio6 8 octahedron while the second and third peaks may be associated with surface and structural defects such as oxygen vacancies which are able to create intermediate energy states located below the conduction band klein et al 2016 finally the last peak at 530 nm can be related to the radiative recombination of charge carriers originating from the deep hole trap states associated with oxygen vacancies knorr et al 2008 furthermore the pl intensity registered for the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes anodized at different voltages decreased with increasing applied potential while the peak positions remained almost the same this suggests that the ti tio2 nt photoelectrode obtained at the highest anodization voltage 40 v exhibited the lowest recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs the decrease of the pl intensity for the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes anodized under higher anodization voltages may be related to the generation of higher amounts of either structural defects ti3 states or oxygen vacancies which act as electron traps facilitating electron hole separation nishanthi et al 2015 zhuang et al 2007 the results of the photoelectrochemical experiments of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes are presented in fig 3 to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated e h pairs transient photocurrent density was measured at 1 v as presented in fig 3a all of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes are characterized by very good repeatability and stability over several on off cycles of uv vis irradiation moreover comparing the generated photocurrent densities the highest value 1 5 ma cm 2 was obtained for ti tio2 nts 30 v while that of ti tio2 nts 20 v 1 ma cm 2 and ti tio2 nts 40 v 1 4 ma cm 2 were 1 5 and 1 07 times lower respectively these results demonstrate that the ti tio2 nts 30 v electrode possesses the highest separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers which leads to higher amount of charge h and e capable to generated photoelectrochemical oxidant species garcia segura et al 2018 moreover in the case of electrode prepared at 40 v the larger nt were obtained which means that the transport of photons from the light source to the base of the nt could be limited affecting the lower amount of excited states and charge transport efficiency in fig 3b the linear voltammograms of all of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes in the dark are shown the curve obtained for ti tio2 nts 30 v started to sharply increase at 1 5 v which is connected with water oxidation to oxygen in the case of the ti tio2 nts 20 v and ti tio2 nts 40 v the curve increase starts at 1 3 v which indicates that the side reaction started earlier accordingly the pec degradation should be most effective below 1 5 v for ti tio2 nts 30 v and below 1 3 v for ti tio2 nts 20 v and ti tio2 nts 40 v higher potential values cause the electrolysis of water the effect of the applied potential on pec efficiency with ti tio2 nts 30 v photoanode was presented in following part 3 2 comparison of the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity of the ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes the activity is expressed as the efficiency of 5 fu degradation 1 c c0 after 180 min of the process and a first order kinetic rate constant k calculated from ln c0 c versus time plots the efficiency of 5 fu c0 0 038 mm ph 6 4 degradation depending on the type of process photoelectrocatalysis photocatalysis electrolysis and photolysis is presented in fig 4 a photoelectrocatalytic applied potential of 1 v irradiation intensity 4 5 mw cm 2 and photocatalytic activity tests were carried out in the presence of the ti tio2 nt 30 v photoelectrode the highest efficiency of 5 fu removal was observed for photoelectrocatalysis and reached 100 k 0 0235 min 1 after 150 min of running the process while photocatalytic oxidation allowed for the degradation of 70 k 0 0067 min 1 of 5 fu after 180 min of irradiation 4 5 mw cm 2 as shown in fig 4a notably 5 fu removal was not observed during either photolysis or electrolysis in view of the above mentioned results it can be concluded that photoelectrocatalytic oxidation is more effective at promoting the degradation of 5 fu this is due to the lack of recombination of the charge carriers during photoelectrocatalytic oxidation while recombination of carriers takes place during the photocatalysis process which inhibits the generation of strong oxidants on the surface of the photocatalytic layer similar results were also observed by cardoso et al 2010 and cheng et al 2016 during aromatic amine and diclofenac removal using tio2 nanotubes in a photocatalytic process 3 3 photoelectrochemical degradation of 5 fu by ti tio2 nt 3 3 1 effect of the ti tio2 nt electrode properties the efficiency of 5 fu c0 0 038 mm ph 6 4 degradation in the presence of ti tio2 nt photoelectrodes prepared at different anodization voltages is presented in fig 4b photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5 fu was conducted at an applied potential of 1 v and constant irradiation of 4 5 mw cm 2 generally the highest decomposition rate of 5 fu was achieved in the presence of the ti tio2 nt 30 v photoelectrode with k 0 0235 min 1 r2 0 9946 while the other two electrodes exhibited lower 5 fu degradation rate constants of 0 0211 r2 0 9932 and 0 0184 r2 0 9923 for ti tio2 nt 40 v and ti tio2 nt 20 v respectively the varied activity of the photoelectrodes is the result of the different dimensions of the tio2 nanotubes as has been reported macak et al 2007 marien et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the morphology of the nanotubes has an important influence on photocatalytic activity in the case of short nanotubes there is a probability that the surface area will be too small to absorb the entire irradiation alternatively a large wall thickness and relatively small inner diameter for the nanotubes limits pollutant diffusion into the tubes in the case of long nanotubes photocatalytic degradation can also be controlled by mass transport of pollutant inside of the nanotube as well as by the transport of generated oxidation species such hydroxyl radicals from surface of nanotubes to the solution moreover the depth penetration of irradiation in the longer nanotubes is limited affecting the lower amount of photogenerated charge carriers cerron calle et al 2019 therefore the optimized dimensions of tio2 nanotubes are an important step in the performance of the photoelectrocatalytic process in our experiments the optimal nanotubes ti tio2 nt 30 v were prepared by ti foil anodization at 30 v and were characterized by nanotube lengths of 1 7 μm external diameters of 65 nm wall thicknesses of 8 nm and developed surface areas of 549 cm2 3 3 2 effect of applied potential the potential in the pec process increases the degradation efficiency compared to that of the pc system the optimal potential depends on the irradiation power and photoanode material in figure 4c 5 fu 0 038 mm photoelectrocatalytic degradation on ti tio2 nt 30 v at 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 v with a uv irradiation power of 4 5 mw cm 2 and a ph of 6 4 is presented the electric field formed by the potential gradient on the ti tio2 nt surface keeps photogenerated e h pairs apart as shown the fastest decomposition of 5 fu with a rate constant of 0 0235 min 1 r 0 9946 was observed when 1 v was applied in the case of 0 5 v the decomposition of 5 fu was slower than that at 1 v and k was 0 0148 min 1 r2 0 9893 this was a result of insufficient power to separate all of the photogenerated e h pairs on the anode surface additionally 1 5 v and 2 v decreased the 5 fu decomposition rate compared to that at 1 v and the k values were 0 0192 r2 0 9683 and 0 0138 min 1 r2 0 998 respectively in this case too high a potential inhibited the degradation efficiency by the side reaction of the decomposition of water into oxygen on the anode surface which begins at 1 5 v as shown in the voltammograms fig 3b oxygen production from water is a competitive reaction to the generation of the powerful oxidants oh radicals the optimal value of the potential depends on the properties of the anode material and for the ti tio2 nt anodes the optimal value was determined to be in the range of 0 5 1 5 v zhang et al 2012 3 3 3 effect of irradiation intensity the irradiation intensity is the main parameter that regulates the amount of charge carrier produced at the surface of the ti tio2 nts therefore simulation of natural sunlight with uv irradiation intensity values of 4 5 3 2 and 1 8 mw cm 2 was used for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 5 fu 0 038 mm the experimental conditions were as follows potential of 1 v ph of 6 4 and ti tio2 nts 30 v anode the pseudo first order rate constant k calculated for the uv irradiation intensities of 4 5 mw cm 2 3 2 mw cm 2 and 1 8 mw cm 2 was 0 0235 r2 0 9946 0 0105 r2 0 9961 and 0 008 r2 0 9941 min 1 respectively as expected k increased with an increase in irradiation intensity fig 4d wang et al 2015 found the same trend using the pec system for methylene blue removal there were also calculated the electric energy require to pec degradation of 5 fu depending on the irradiation intensity the eeo value 0 35 0 43 and 0 59 kwh m 3 order 1 were obtained for irradiation intensity 4 5 1 8 and 3 2 mw cm 2 respectively these results shows that the smallest amount of electric energy was used for removal 5 fu in pec process when the highest irradiation was applied although to produce higher irradiation intensities more energy is needed the process takes less time than a process conducted at a lower irradiation intensity additionally eeo was calculated for pc with ti tio2 30v at 4 5 mw cm 2 and the amount of electric energy used for these process 1 2 kwh m 3 order 1 was more than three times higher compere to pec therefore it can be concluded that from economic point of view using pec is more favorable than pc 3 3 4 effect of solution ph in the pec system the solution ph can significantly influence the degradation process efficiency martins et al 2017 for this reason the role of the initial ph in the pec oxidation of a 0 038 mm solution of 5 fu was studied with the initial ph values of 3 0 5 0 6 4 7 0 9 0 at 1 v and 4 5 mw cm 2 on ti tio2 nt 30 v a ph of 6 4 is the original ph value of a solution of 0 035 mm of 5 fu and electrolyte na2so4 sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid were used to regulate the solution ph the obtained results are presented in fig 4e in this study an increase in the 5 fu decomposition rate with decreasing initial ph value was observed a k equal to 0 0276 r2 0 9705 0 0244 r2 0 9918 0 0235 r2 0 9946 0 0196 r2 0 9967 and 0 0143 r2 0 9938 was obtained for ph 3 0 5 0 6 4 7 0 and 9 0 respectively in accordance with zhang et al 2014 more effective pec oxidation of organic matter can be associated with an easier charge transfer between the photoelectrode and electrolyte at acidic conditions compared to that in basic conditions furthermore the redox potentials of oh calculated by the nernst equation martins et al 2017 present the highest oxidative potential for acid medium therefore in ph 3 5 fu oxidation is favorable moreover in the alkaline solution ph 9 hco3 and co3 2 existed in solution which are strong oh scavengers and inhibit the degradation of 5 fu although the pec degradation at the acidic ph occurred faster than at near neutral ph the efficiency not increased enough to be economical and technological reasonably to acidify the solution before the process 3 3 5 effect of 5 fu concentration the effect of the 5 fu initial concentration on pec was investigated in the range from 0 008 to 0 385 mm at 1 v and 4 5 mw cm 2 the obtained results are presented in fig 4f the degradation was much slower at the high 5 fu concentration 0 385 mm than in diluted solutions of 5 fu 0 008 and 0 038 mm the pseudo first order rate constant for degradation of 0 385 mm of 5 fu equals 0 0101 r2 0 9844 which was 2 3 times lower than the k obtained for 0 038 0 0235 r2 0 9946 and 1 8 times lower than the k obtained for 0 008 mm 0 0186 r2 0 9948 it is worth noting that although the decomposition was faster at lower concentrations of 5 fu the amount of drug removed was higher at greater concentrations as shown at 150 min of pec 0 0385 mm and 0 308 mm of 5 fu were removed from the 0 0385 mm and 0 385 mm initial concentrations respectively this is most likely the result of the increase of the organic matter diffusion flux in the direction of the photoanode with the increase of 5 fu concentration ammar et al 2016 these results indicate that the pec process were limited by mass transport the same trend of decreasing decomposition rate with increasing pollutant concentration in pec was shown by zheng et al zhang et al 2014 using salicylic acid and cardoso et al 2010 who used aromatic amine these results suggest that photoelectrochemical oxidation is an efficient method for treating 5 fu in dilute solutions as well as in solutions with higher concentrations 3 4 photoelectrocatalysis mechanism degradation of organics in pec can be a result of active species such as oh and h by exciting the tio2 photoanode h e pairs are generated then the hydroxyl radicals are generated by the oxidation of water or hydroxyl anions by h while the e are transported to the cathode garcia segura and brillas 2017 hua et al 2016 in photocatalysis e react with oxygen creating o 2 which can degrade organics compared to photocatalysis in pec o 2 and e are not involved in the decomposition process which is connected with carrying electrons by an external electrical circuit to the cathode to investigate the contribution of individual oxidizing species in photoelectrocatalysis into treated solutions of 5 fu the scavengers methanol meoh formic acid fa and potassium iodide ki were added cheng et al 2013 li et al 2016 yang et al 2009 ki scavenged both oh and h while meoh and fa block the activity of oh and h respectively as shown in fig 5 a pec without scavengers leads to complete removal of 5 fu in 150 min the presence of ki completely inhibited 5 fu photoelectrocatalytic degradation this indicates that the drug has not been removed by sorption on the photoelectrode and that the hydroxyl radicals and the holes are both important active species which are mainly responsible for the degradation in the case of hydroxyl radical scavenging addition of meoh only 40 of the 5 fu initial concentration was removed after 3 h of pec a similar situation was observed when formic acid scavenger of h was added into the reaction system this result confirms a similar contribution from both oh and h in 5 fu photoelectrochemical degradation yang et al 2009 also presented a significant role for hydroxyl radicals in the pec degradation of 4 chlorophenol alternatively studies wang et al 2014 on pec oxidation of aqueous ammonia using tio2 nanotubes indicate that the photogenerated holes play a more important role than the hydroxyl radicals in this process this proves that the participation of the active species in pec depends on the compound nature additionally the results presented in fig 5b show that the amount of generated hydroxyl radicals in pec increased during the process in conclusion the pec degradation of 5 fu was mainly driven by the participation of oh and h 3 5 5 fu degradation pathway after 4 h of the photoelectrocatalytic process the active species had almost completely degraded 5 fu 0 385 mm however in the same time toc was only 30 removed fig 6 incomplete mineralization suggests that the process leads to organic intermediates rather than co2 to identify the organic degradation products of 5 fu liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer was used the applied photoelectrocatalytic process led to the formation of five degradation products of 5 fluorouracil with m h 143 163 and m h 113 115 and 159 as shown in fig 7 the 5 fu decomposition was the result of substitution or detachment of the fluorine atom and ketonization of the pyrimidine ring in the next step ring opening was observed ring opening can be a result of breaking the c n bond by hydrogenation at the n1 position according to the electrochemical degradation of 5 fluoro 2 methoxypyrimidine presented by zhang et al 2016 and additional oxidation to form a carboxyl group similar 5 fu degradation products under photocatalytic and electrochemical processes were presented by lutterbeck et al 2015 and siedlecka et al 2018 respectively an analysis of inorganic ions after 4 h of the 5 fu 0 385 mm pec degradation showed that the 30 2 13 mg l 1 f of fluoride and 17 of inorganic form of nitrogen 1 7 mg l 1 n nh4 n no3 not detected which could be release from 5 fu were formed according to garcia segura et al garcia segura et al 2017 there is also possible released small amounts of nox species these results indicated that organic transformation product contain both nitrogen and fluoride 3 6 ecotoxicity considering the possibility of exposing green plants to the presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments lemna minor toxicity tests were chosen to investigate the ecotoxicity of the 5 fu treated solution by pec moreover as has been shown by białk bielińska et al 2017 these organisms are more sensitive to 5 fu than daphnia magna or vibrio fischeri it is worth pointing out that for the first time duckweed l minor was used to evaluate the ecotoxicity of a solution treated by pec to date only marine bacteria vibrio fischeri algae pseudokirchella subcapitata microcystis aeruginosa and shellfish daphnia magna have been used daghrir et al 2013 li et al 2014 liu et al 2013 as reported by li et al and daghrir et al pec reduced the toxicity of ofloxacin to m aeruginosa and chlortetracycline to v fisheri and p subcapitata additionally liu et al 2013 showed that triclosan degradation by pec can generate intermediates that are more toxic to v fisheri as shown in fig 6 the initial solutions of 5 fu showed 60 l minor growth inhibition during pec as the concentration of the drug decreases the toxicity also decreases although the toc was only 30 removed these results indicated that the formed degradation products are characterized by lower toxicity than 5 fu degradation products of 5 fu with low toxicity to l minor were also identified during electrochemical oxidation as reported by siedlecka et al 2018 additionally there were no identified 5 fu degradation products with mutagenic or genotoxic properties according to the in silico toxicity prediction reported by lutterbek et al lutterbeck et al 2015 therefore it can be assumed that the 5 fu solution treated by pec is safer for the environment than the initial solution 4 conclusion photoelectrocatalysis is a process in which the efficiency of pollutant treatment depends on experimental parameters as well as the photoelectrode material in the present study photoelectrodes comprised of ti tio2 nts were prepared at different anodization voltages and were characterized by the various geometric parameters of the tio2 nanotubes the highest photoelectrocatalytic removal of 5 fu was achieved by ti tio2 nt 30 v which have a 1 7 μm length 65 nm diameter and 8 nm wall thickness for the tio2 nanotubes and was characterized by the highest photocurrent response this electrode was used for 5 fu decomposition in electrolysis photolysis and photoelectrocatalysis with the last process proving to be the most effective in the next step the effects of the applied potential irradiation intensity initial ph and initial 5 fu concentration on photoelectrocatalysis were investigated for the ti tio2 nt 30 v photoelectrode the results indicate that the highest 5 fu degradation rate was obtained at a potential of 1 v moreover for higher irradiation intensity and lower initial ph faster degradation was observed additionally pec removal of 5 fu at initial concentrations in the range of 0 008 0 385 mm was effective furthermore studies have shown that the mechanism of photoelectrocatalysis of 5 fu is based on oh and h activity finally the photoelectrocatalytic degradation pathway and ecotoxicity of 5 fu treated by photoelectrocatalysis were demonstrated an investigation of the organic degradation products of 5 fu showed defluoridation and ketonization of the pyrimidine ring next breaking the c n bond causing ring opening was observed additionally the inorganic products such f and nh4 were released in addition the results showed decreasing l minor growth inhibition with decreasing 5 fu concentration during photoelectrocatalysis declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing
