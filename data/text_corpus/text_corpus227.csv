1135,the role of an emergent form of stratiotes aloides water soldier in creating a habitat for microcrustaceans cladocera and copepoda in an oxbow lake of the bug river poland was studied from june to september in years 2003 and 2004 water samples were collected monthly both in open water and from stratiotes beds in the littoral zone at half of the water depth plants were sampled in the littoral zone from the area of one square meter densities and biomass of microcrustaceans concentrations of oxygen chlorophyll a seston temperature ph conductivity and stratiotes densities and biomass were determined microcrustacean assemblages within macrophyte beds were taxonomically richer more diverse and abundant than in open water on average 10 versus 2 taxa 460 versus 128 ind dm 3 0 54 versus 0 03 mg dw dm 3 respectively cyclopoida dominated in the densities and biomass in both habitats with copepodites and adults being the most numerous in the stratiotes stands cladocera were represented almost exclusively by bosmina longirostris in open water and mainly by chydorids ceriodaphnia spp and simocephalus vetulus among plants daphnia longispina complex was recorded only in the littoral zone microcrustacean diversity in the oxbow lake was positively correlated with stratiotes abundance the observed microcrustacean composition and spatial distribution suggest fish predation as the main factor shaping the microcrustacean community in the oxbow lake while stratiotes stands acted mainly as a habitat for benthic and plant associated species as well as a likely refuge for small

habitat or shelter for fish mostly juvenile cyprinids that forage on zooplankton prejs et al 1994 in autumn all roots and most of the leaves fall off and become incorporated into the detrital food web while the remaining plant parts overwinter on an oxbow lake bottom strzałek and koperski 2009 the objective of the present study was to establish how beds of emergent stratiotes affect the microcrustacean community in an oxbow lake we hypothesized that microcrustacean assemblages of stratiotes stands would be taxonomically richer more diverse and more abundant than those of open water due to higher spatial complexity additional food sources and potentially different abiotic features of the habitat compared to more homogenous open water 2 material and methods the research was conducted in the summer of 2003 and 2004 from june to september in the bużysko oxbow lake located on the left bank of the bug river 52 40 n 21 55 e central eastern poland the bużysko oxbow lake is a shallow eutrophic water body with a surface area of 16 2 ha and a mean water depth of 1 5 m the maximum depth during the year varied between 2 5 m in summer and 3 5 m after heavy rain the oxbow lake

their distributions were not normal the taxonomic composition of microcrustaceans of the two habitats was compared by the χ 2 test the strength and direction of the relationship between taxonomic

correlation coefficient r s the significance level of 0 05 was used analyses were carried out with statistix 8 and statistica for windows v 12 0 3 results 3 1 microcrustacean community structure microcrustacean densities were significantly higher in the stratiotes stands than in open water due to the density of cyclopoida copepodites and adults and cladocerans mainly alona spp chydorus spp g testudinaria ceriodaphnia spp simocephalus vetulus o f müller and pleuroxus spp tables 1 and 2 and figs 1 and 2 the occurrence of older stages of cyclopoids and large bodied cladocerans such as s crystallina e lamellatus s vetulus and numerous small bodied ceriodaphnia spp was responsible for the higher biomass of microcrustaceans in the vegetated area compared to the open water however cladoceran individuals reached the length of the lower range of body sizes reported by rybak and błędzki 2010 cyclopoida dominated in both zones while calanoids were absent in the samples copepodites and adults occurred mainly among the plants whereas nauplii had no spatial preferences the taxonomic richness was significantly higher in the vegetation 19 taxa due to 10 plant associated taxa and daphnia longispina complex the latter was recorded only in this habitat daphnia spp s crystallina s mucronata and o tenuicaudis were sampled only once during the study period cladocerans of open water were only represented by six taxa of these microcrustaceans b longirostris was the most common with 50 frequency and ceriodaphnia spp alonella spp and pleuroxus spp were recorded on one occasion only tables 1 and 2 the χ 2 test revealed variation in the taxonomic composition of the microcrustacean communities in the studied habitats χ 2 function value 789 55 p 0 0001 the differences in the taxonomic composition density and biomass between the two lake zones were reflected in the values of the shannon wiener index which were significantly higher in the littoral zone than in the open water table 1 the littoral zone was significantly richer in seston and poorer in phytoplankton biomass measured as chlorophyll a concentrations table 3 its microalgal assemblages consisted mainly of tycholimnetic filamentous cyanophyceae and bacillariophyceae and the open water phytoplankton was dominated by chrysophytes and cyanobacteria unpublished results of a pasztaleniec the stratiotes plants densely covering the water body surface reduced photosynthetically active radiation by more than 90 at a water depth of 0 5 m during summer the high seston concentration resulted from a considerable cladoceran biomass in the vegetated zone and particularly from the density and biomass of e lamellatus r s 0 75 p 0 0054 and r s 0 76 p 0 0040 respectively table 4 3 2 abundance of microcrustaceans and stratiotes aloides the taxonomic richness diversity and abundance of microcrustaceans in the oxbow lake were strongly positively correlated with the density and or biomass of stratiotes plants table 4 to find these relations between above parameters of microcrustacean community structure and stratiotes abundance samples from both habitats were used n 16 however if we look at the changes in the abundance of microcrustacean assemblages over time it turns out that their densities and biomass do not always follow the monthly changes in stratiotes abundance in 2004 the littoral microcrustacean assemblage was most abundant in june density 572 ind dm 3 and biomass 1329 µg dw dm 3 during the minimum plant biomass 684 g dw m 2 and maximum plant density 25 ind m 2 contrary to the previous year when the peak of microcrustacean density 755 ind dm 3 and biomass 801 µg dw dm 3 was in september and coincided with the high stratiotes biomass 1338 g dw m 2 and the lowest density 14 ind m 2 of the taxa occurring in both habitats alona spp alonella spp b longirostris ceriodaphnia spp g testudinaria pleuroxus spp only b longirostris was not related to the abundance of water soldier the occurrence of this species was also negatively correlated with water conductivity table 4 4 discussion in accordance with our hypothesis stratiotes stands supported a richer more diverse and abundant community of microcrustaceans in the bużysko oxbow lake compared to the open water our findings confirm the results of karpowicz et al 2016 who found the same pattern in twelve water bodies including five stratiotes dominated oxbow lakes such a spatial differentiation is related to the complexity of the littoral zone offering various microhabitats to planktonic benthic and plant associated animals and this was observed in the case of other macrophyte beds kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2006 pasztaleniec et al 2013 both lake zones did not differ in terms of physical and chemical water parameters except for concentrations of chlorophyll a and seston however chlorophyll a did not correlate with any parameter of the microcrustacean community and any particular taxa thus our results did not confirm the high effectiveness of cladocera in reducing the phytoplankton biomass along a gradient from open water to the centres of macrophyte beds showed by rybak and węgleńska 2003 low concentrations of chlorophyll a in the littoral zone resulted from shading and or faster sedimentation of algae caused by the stratiotes plants covering the water surface high seston concentrations were related to cladoceran abundance mainly large bodied eurycercus lamellatus and numerous small bodied alona spp the occurrence of most taxa in the littoral zone was correlated with the stratiotes density and or biomass except for pelagic bosmina longirostris which was more abundant and frequent in open water however we did not find a clear relationship between the monthly changes in the densities biomass of stratiotes and microcrustaceans this may be explained by the spatial heterogeneity of microcrustaceans that can aggregate among plants and in open water and therefore may be sampled unrepresentatively irvine et al 1990 cerbin et al 2003 moreover some littoral microcrustaceans e g alonella exigua lilljeborg graptoleberis testudinaria peracantha truncata fryer 1968 and sida crystallina are associated with the macrophyte surface and hence their densities may be underestimated when water is sampled with a patalas sampler linhart 1999 found numerous cladocerans attached to the stratiotes plants with prevailing s crystallina this may be the main reason why our samples were so poor in this species and the second one could be the fish predation on free swimming sida cerbin et al 2003 the heterogeneity of the littoral microcrustaceans may be caused by the availability of various food sources e g epiphytic algae that may abundantly inhabit water soldier plants toporowska et al 2008 they are ingested by periphyton grazers such as chydorids e g a exigua g testudinaria p truncata ceridaphnia spp s vetulus and e lamellatus balayla and moss 2004 masclaux et al 2012 2014 that dominated along with cyclopoids in the stratiotes stands during our study a considerable relative abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria noted in the bużysko oxbow lake may be partly responsible for the dominance of small sized cladocerans in the microcrustacean community which are less vulnerable to cyanobacterial filaments due to a narrower entrance into their filtration chambers gliwicz 2003 according to schriver et al 1995 the abundance of cyanobacteria indirectly shows a fish predation pressure on large bodied cladocerans e g daphnia they found that in the presence of daphnia and bosmina phytoplankton was dominated by edible fast growing microalgae e g cryptomonas the potential refuge effect of macrophyte stands against fish predation strongly depends on plant biomass schriver et al 1995 stansfield et al 1997 perrow et al 1999 rybak and węgleńska 2003 macrophyte bed size lauridsen et al 1996 and the spatial structure of the vegetation kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2006 in the bużysko oxbow lake stratiotes formed an extensive dense zone along the lake shore during the growing season the underwater parts of the plants consisted of stems with one third of the length of leaves and roots which yielded approximately 122 g dw m 2 unpublished data according to engel 1988 this biomass is at least half of what is necessary to provide a sufficient refuge to hide zooplankters from fish predators littoral zones are inhabited by juvenile fish e g perch also occurring in the bużysko oxbow lake bowszyc et al 2012 and frankiewicz and wojtal frankiewicz 2012 showed that the small sized perch diet was based on large bodied herbivorous zooplankters particularly daphnia spp and calanoida the latter was absent from the bużysko oxbow lake therefore the small population of daphnia longispina complex and of free swimming s crystallina the absence of calanoids cyclopoid dominance and the presence of smaller sized cladocerans could indicate plankivorous fish pressure in the bużysko oxbow lake which was also suggested by other authors schriver et al 1995 karabin et al 1997 cerbin et al 2003 bowszyc et al 2012 and insufficient effectiveness of the emergent stratiotes as a refuge for large bodied free swimming cladocerans however water soldier stands offer suitable conditions for benthic and plant associated species to live on and may provide refuges for small bodied ceriodaphnia spp as well as adults and copepodites of cyclopoida conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the research was done

contrary to the previous year when the peak of microcrustacean density 755 ind dm 3 and biomass 801 µg dw dm 3 was in september and coincided with the high stratiotes biomass 1338 g dw m 2 and the lowest density 14 ind m 2 of the taxa occurring in both habitats alona spp alonella spp b longirostris ceriodaphnia spp g testudinaria pleuroxus spp only b longirostris was not related to the abundance of water soldier the occurrence of this species was also negatively correlated with water conductivity table 4 4 discussion in accordance with our hypothesis stratiotes stands supported a richer more diverse and abundant community of microcrustaceans in the bużysko oxbow lake compared to the open water our findings confirm the results of karpowicz et al 2016 who found the same pattern in twelve water bodies including five stratiotes dominated oxbow lakes such a spatial differentiation is related to the complexity of the littoral zone offering various microhabitats to planktonic benthic and plant associated animals and this was observed in the case of other macrophyte beds kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2006 pasztaleniec et al 2013 both lake zones did not differ in terms of physical and chemical water parameters except for concentrations of chlorophyll a and seston however chlorophyll a did not correlate with any parameter of the microcrustacean community and any particular taxa thus our results did not confirm the high effectiveness of cladocera in reducing the phytoplankton biomass along a gradient from open water to the centres of macrophyte beds showed by rybak and węgleńska 2003 low concentrations of chlorophyll a in the littoral zone resulted from shading and or faster sedimentation of algae caused by the stratiotes plants covering the water surface high seston concentrations were related to cladoceran abundance mainly large bodied eurycercus lamellatus and numerous small bodied alona spp the occurrence of most taxa in the littoral zone was correlated with the stratiotes density and or biomass except for pelagic bosmina longirostris which was more abundant and frequent in open water however we did not find a clear relationship between the monthly changes in the densities biomass of stratiotes and microcrustaceans this may be explained by the spatial heterogeneity of microcrustaceans that can aggregate among plants and in open water and therefore may be sampled unrepresentatively irvine et al 1990 cerbin et al 2003 moreover some littoral microcrustaceans e g alonella exigua lilljeborg graptoleberis testudinaria peracantha truncata fryer 1968 and sida crystallina are associated with the macrophyte surface and hence their densities may be underestimated when water is sampled with a patalas sampler linhart 1999 found numerous cladocerans attached to the stratiotes plants with prevailing s crystallina this may be the main reason why our samples were so poor in this species and the second one could be the fish predation on free swimming sida cerbin et al 2003 the heterogeneity of the littoral microcrustaceans may be caused by the availability of various food sources e g epiphytic algae that may abundantly inhabit water soldier plants toporowska et al 2008 they are ingested by periphyton grazers such as chydorids e g a exigua g testudinaria p truncata ceridaphnia spp s vetulus and e lamellatus balayla and moss 2004 masclaux et al 2012 2014 that dominated along with cyclopoids in the stratiotes stands during our study a considerable relative abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria noted in the bużysko oxbow lake may be partly responsible for the dominance of small sized cladocerans in the microcrustacean community which are less vulnerable to cyanobacterial filaments due to a narrower entrance into their filtration chambers gliwicz 2003 according to schriver et al 1995 the abundance of cyanobacteria indirectly shows a fish predation pressure on large bodied cladocerans e g daphnia they found that in the presence of daphnia and bosmina phytoplankton was dominated by edible fast growing microalgae e g cryptomonas the potential refuge effect of macrophyte stands against fish predation strongly depends on plant biomass schriver et al 1995 stansfield et al 1997 perrow et al 1999 rybak and węgleńska 2003 macrophyte bed size lauridsen et al 1996 and the spatial structure of the vegetation kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2006 in the bużysko oxbow lake stratiotes formed an extensive dense zone along the lake shore during the growing season the underwater parts of the plants consisted of stems with one third of the length of leaves and roots which yielded approximately 122 g dw m 2 unpublished data according to engel 1988 this biomass is at least half of what is necessary to provide a sufficient refuge to hide zooplankters from fish predators littoral zones are inhabited by juvenile fish e g perch also occurring in the bużysko oxbow lake bowszyc et al 2012 and frankiewicz and wojtal frankiewicz 2012 showed that the small sized perch diet was based on large bodied herbivorous zooplankters particularly daphnia spp and calanoida the latter was absent from the bużysko oxbow lake therefore the small population of daphnia longispina complex and of free swimming s crystallina the absence of calanoids cyclopoid dominance and the presence of smaller sized cladocerans could indicate plankivorous fish pressure in the bużysko oxbow lake which was also suggested by other authors schriver et al 1995 karabin et al 1997 cerbin et al 2003 bowszyc et al 2012 and insufficient effectiveness of the emergent stratiotes as a refuge for large bodied free swimming cladocerans however water soldier stands offer suitable conditions for benthic and plant associated species to live on and may provide refuges for small bodied ceriodaphnia spp as well as adults and copepodites of cyclopoida conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the research was done

1136,evapotranspiration et is a major component of land hydrological processes where it determines the transfer of moisture and energy in the soil vegetation atmosphere system in this study an empirical et model pyh et was established based on the relationships between the monthly et and the leaf area index lai precipitation pre and pan evaporation evp in the whole poyang lake watershed china then this model was applied to sub watersheds of the poyang lake watershed and analyzed the contributions of the three variables to et the results showed that the correlation coefficients between the monthly et and the monthly lai pre and evp were 0 969 0 380 and 0 894 respectively the moving average of the pre per 2 months was used to replace the monthly pre as a variable in the model the accuracy of the phy et model was high where the r value for the model was 0 98 and the relative error of the model was 10 2 when the data of 2014 were used to validate the model built according to the data during 2000 2013 the contribution of lai to et was highest in all sub watersheds followed by evp whereas pre made the lowest contribution in addition the contributions of these three factors to et in this watershed conformed to the law of the minimum where the variation in et was limited by the factor with the smallest change the proposed high accuracy empirical model requires a small number of readily available parameters and it is suitable for integration with hydrological models keywords evapotranspiration contribution ratio leaf area index pan evaporation precipitation poyang lake watershed 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the total water vapor flux that enters the atmosphere from vegetation and the land surface including the evaporation of moisture from the surface of the earth and transpiration from plants zhang et al 2016 et is a very important component of land hydrological processes where it determines the transfer of moisture and energy in the soil vegetation atmosphere system lu et al 2003 et is the key variable that connects hydrological processes and ecological processes but it is difficult to quantify several techniques and methods have been developed for quantifying et wang and dickinson 2012 observational techniques generally use evaporation pans in weather stations but this approach can only measure water surface evaporation rather than et lysimeter and eddy covariance flux towers can measure et directly liu et al 1998 nagler et al 2005 but the observational data are difficult to obtain and they cannot be used on a large scale due to the low number of observation stations remote sensing rs provides relatively frequent and spatially contiguous measurements to allow the global monitoring of surface biophysical variables that affect et including the albedo vegetation type and density yet rs products are easily affected by cloudiness and the results still need to be verified using field data before being applied in researches many calculation models have been developed for estimating et the watershed water balance method is the easiest method for calculating et but it is generally limited to the long term average when the change in the water storage component is negligible ford et al 2007 surface energy balance seb methods comprising one source seb and two source seb are used frequently especially in the rs field allen et al 2007 norman et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 seb based physical et models are mainly based on surface energy balance equation and heat transfer equation and thermal ir based land surface temperature lst is a critical remote sensing variable but these products have many disadvantages like the difficulty of estimating sensible heat flux h and et can often exceed net radiation at a given time or place due to advection of h from the surrounding landscape glenn et al 2007 gowda et al 2008 mu et al 2011 in that case rs et models using the penman monteith p m approach were developed the p m model is one of most widely used methods for estimating et and this physical based model performs well when applied in vegetation covered regions allen et al 1994 leuning et al 2008 monteith 1965 many global rs based et products are derived from p m approach such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product developed by mu et al 2007 2011 and the global long term 1983 2006 daily et product developed by zhang et al 2010 however the available rs data cannot always meet the requirements in terms of the research time range and scale when applied to simulations of hydrological processes in addition few hydrological models can directly incorporate rs et data products into their calculations and the usage of rs in the parameterization of hydrological models is a growing field of research herman et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 zou et al 2017 when directly using p m model coupled with meteorological data to calculate et this model requires several climatic variables that are often unavailable and the surface conductance which is difficult to determine sun et al 2010 using complex et methods in hydrological models will increase the number of parameters required which will also increase the uncertainty of the hydrological models simplifying the method used for calculating et in hydrological models would reduce the difficulty and uncertainty of calibrations and facilitate runoff process simulations sun et al 2011a b yin et al 2016 however the estimation of et is excessively simple in some hydrological models such as using the pan evaporation evp conversion coefficient to calculate et which ignores the large difference between et and evp thereby leading to errors in final modeling results therefore establishing a simple et model that conforms with the et pattern for a certain watershed is necessary for simulating hydrological processes the variation in et especially the inter annual variation is mainly controlled by the available amount of water the available energy and characteristics of the surface cover wang and dickinson 2012 the available water for et is usually related to precipitation pre in the watershed evp is related to the combined effect of all the meteorological factors on areas with open water where it reflects both the available radiation energy and the influence of meteorological factors on evaporation in a region kahler and brutsaert 2006 the leaf area index lai is a general parameter that can reflect the canopy structure characteristic of the vegetation and it is closely related to plant transpiration liu et al 2016 for many watersheds pre evp and lai data can be obtained easily from meteorological stations and rs images thereby increasing the possible applications of the et model developed according to the relationships between et and the three variables in this study we considered the poyang lake watershed china as an example and we established the relationships among et and lai pre and evp based on the average inter annual change in et and the other three variables we also analyzed the contributions of natural factors like vegetation cover available water temperature and other meteorological factors reflected by lai pre and evp to et on different watershed scales 2 methods 2 1 basic conditions in the study area the poyang lake watershed has an area of 1 622 105 km2 where it accounts for nearly 97 of the entire area of jiangxi province south china the poyang lake watershed ranges geographically from 24 29 14 n to 30 04 41 n latitude and from 113 34 36 e to 118 28 58 e longitude the poyang lake watershed is a typical inland watershed in china this dustpan like watershed is surrounded by high mountains except on the north side which slopes gradually downward from the south to the north five large rivers comprising the xiushui river ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river and raohe river distributing in five main closed sub watersheds flow into poyang lake water flows from the lake into the yangtze river through the lake mouth fig 1 the major land use types in the poyang lake watershed and six sub watersheds are tree cover shrubland and cropland fig 1 table 1 the vegetation in this region is dominated by evergreen coniferous forest seasonal green cover and mixed cover the climate in this region is subtropical humid climate and it is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon regime summer monsoon and winter monsoon included the mean annual temperature is approximately 17 1 c with july mean temperatures of 29 32 c and january mean temperatures of 3 0 5 0 c the annual pre is approximately 1620mm most of which falls between april and september and it is influenced by the summer monsoon xu et al 2016 the annual et is 700 850mm the temporal spatial distributions of pre and et are uneven poyang lake watershed is representative region which is dominated by woodland and cropland under the humid subtropical monsoon climate 2 2 data sources this study used watershed boundary and drainage data derived from the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science and technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn shuttle radar topographic mission srtm 90m digital elevation model dem data were acquired from the geospatial data cloud the land use and land cover data were derived from 300m annual global land cover data 2000 2007 2014 provided by the framework of the climate change initiative the daily pre data and evp data obtained from 2000 to 2014 for 15 meteorological stations were provided by the china meteorological data service center the lai dataset was derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis liu et al 2012 2016 where it comprised 8 day lai composites at a spatial resolution of 500m from 2000 to 2014 the lai data were retrieved from the 8 day modis reflectance product mod09a1 v05 and the yearly modis land cover datasets mcd12q1 v051 using a four scale geometric optical model deng et al 2006 the lai data were validated by measuring lai in representative regions of the study region which made the lai data become more targeted for the research liu et al 2012 the et validation data came from the monthly modis et product mod16a2 and it was shown previously that they are suitable for analyzing the characteristic spatial temporal distributions of et in the poyang lake watershed wu et al 2013 all the rs data came from the whole calendar year for the period of 2000 to 2014 2 3 calculated monthly et pre and lai we used the thiessen polygon method to calculate the monthly pre for the whole watershed according to the pre data from 15 meteorological stations the same method was used to determine the evp for the whole watershed but the result only represented the combined effect of all the meteorological factors and radiation energy at the whole watershed scale the monthly lai and et were calculated by using envi 5 0 to count the averages from an rs image of the whole watershed the data in modis et products only consider the terrestrial et and they ignore the evaporation from lakes so we focused mainly on the terrestrial et the resulted data for each month were calculated by overlaying and averaging the corresponding monthly rs data from 2000 to 2014 the analysis of inner annual variation of the lai pre and evp was based on these average data for the land use changes of vegetation cover were relative small during these years table 2 we could study the inner annual performance of the lai on et without concerning about the significant impact of inter annual variation of lai the five sub watersheds raohe fuhe xinjiang ganjiang and xiushui were generated according to the characteristics of the dem and drainage from the poyang lake watershed using hydrology module in the toolbox of arcgis 10 3 the monthly pre evp lai and et data for each sub watershed were calculated using the same method described above 2 4 empirical et model development we analyzed the correlation coefficients between et and lai pre and evp using all the monthly data from 2000 2014 in addition we established regression models for the relationships between et lai pre and evp during 2000 2013 using the multiple linear regression mlr method in ibm spss 19 0 the data from 2014 were then used to validate the accuracy of the established model 3 results 3 1 monthly et pre evp and lai the variations in the monthly et pre evp and lai averages of the whole poyang lake watershed from 2000 to 2014 are shown in fig 2 the poyang lake watershed is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and it is controlled by the asian monsoon where the rainfall increases sharply around june this phenomenon is known as the plum rains and it is the result of the stagnation of the main rain belt over the yangtze river watershed therefore pre peaked in june and then decreased sharply evp is mainly related to the radiation temperature humidity and other meteorological conditions due to the plum rains the land receives less radiation and evaporation is limited so the evp decreased in june but peaked in july which are the warmest months lai is affected by plant phenology plants begin to grow in april and may with exuberant growth from june to august so the lai values increased rapidly in april and may and peaked from june to august the variable trend in et was highly consistent with that in lai by comparing the et and evp we found that evp was lower than et during may and june but the opposite in other months for the five main closed sub watersheds the inner annual variation tendencies of et evp lai and pre were similar fig 3 but the variation ranges of these variables among different sub watersheds existed differences for example the peaks of lai in xiushui and raohe were much higher than other sub watersheds which was the result of relative high vegetation coverage in the two regions fig 1 the evp of fuhe was highest during the whole year while the pre of xinjiang and fuhe were higher than other sub watersheds before jun and then decreased lower than others and it is the consequences of spatial distribution changes of precipitation temperature and other climate features in poyang lake watershed 3 2 relationships between pre evp lai and et fig 4a c show the relationships between the monthly lai evp pre and monthly et of the whole watershed during 2000 2014 where the r values were 0 969 0 894 and 0 380 respectively therefore et had the strongest correlation with lai and the lowest correlation with pre the water available for et is affected by the current month s pre but also by the pre in the previous month which is stored in the soil layers in the watershed in fig 4d pre 2m is the moving average of the pre per 2 months the correlation coefficient between et and pre 2m was 0 591 so we used pre 2m to represent the effect of pre on et which appeared to be more suitable for the poyang lake watershed table 3 also shows that the relationships between the monthly et with four variables in five main sub watersheds have the similar characteristic as the whole watershed according to the data obtained in the whole poyang lake watershed from 2000 to 2013 we established a multiple linear regression model of the relationships between et lai pre 2m and evp using spss the model pyh et is formulated as follows 1 et 5 476 20 97 lai 0 297 evp 0 070 pre 2 m where r 0 980 sig f 0 0001 and all variables and the intercept in the equation were highly significant p 0 001 in order to validate the pyh et model we compared the et values calculated by eq 1 based on the monthly lai evp and pre 2m data predicted data with the et values measured based on monthly modis et products measured data in 2014 and the results are shown in fig 5 the fitting result for the model was credible and the relative error between the two sets of data was 10 2 so the model has relative high accuracy and was satisfactory for the simulation of et in poyang lake watershed 3 3 spatial application of the pyh et model based on the data from june 2014 when all the parameters values were high as an example to simulate the spatial distribution of et fig 6a we used the pyh et model to overlay the spatial distributions of pre evp and lai according to fig 6a and b the overall trend in the characteristic spatial distribution of et obtained by the simulation was consistent with the modis product although the resolution of the simulation results was relatively low in some areas by comparing the spatial distribution of the et with the spatial distributions of lai evp and pre figures are not put here we found that the spatial distribution of the simulation results was affected mainly by the spatial distribution of the lai rather than the other two factors we subtracted the modis product from the simulation result and the difference is shown in fig 6c according to figs 1 and 6c compared with the modis product the simulation overestimated the et in the tree covered region and underestimated the et in the cropland region 3 4 contribution rates of pre evp and lai in different sub watersheds the same method of pyh et model was applied to the sub watersheds including raohe watershed xinjiang watershed fuhe watershed ganjiang watershed and xiushui watershed and different coefficients were obtained table 4 the pyh et model was suitable for all five sub watersheds where the most accurate results were obtained for the raohe watershed and the xiushui watershed thus the pyh et model is suitable for application to land surfaces at the small watershed scale the contribution rate of the lai to et can be expressed as follows 2 s l δ l a i c l a i δ e t where δlai is the absolute value of the variation in lai c lai is the coefficient of lai in the model and δet is the variation in et obtained by the model similarly s p and s e are expressed as follows 3 s p δ p r e 2 m c pre 2m δ e t 4 s e δ e v p c evp δ e t where s p is the contribution rate of pre to et and s e is the contribution rate of evp to et the period from february to june is the growing season of plants in the poyang lake watershed and all of the variables tended to increase during this period fig 3 thus we studied the contribution rates to the variation in et for the different variables in the five sub watersheds from february to june during 2000 2014 according to table 5 and fig 3 lai made the highest contribution rate in all of the sub watersheds followed by evp whereas pre made the lowest contribution rate by comparing the different sub watersheds we found that the variations in et were relatively high in the raohe watershed and xiushui watershed but relatively low in the xinjiang watershed the variations in lai were relatively large in the raohe watershed and xiushui watershed but the variations in pre and evp were relatively low where the contribution rate of lai was relatively low in these two watersheds whereas the contribution rates of pre and evp were relatively high similarly the variation in evp was high whereas that in lai was relatively low in the fuhe watershed and the contribution rate of pre was relatively low whereas the contribution rate of lai was relatively high in addition the contribution rates of evp were lower in the ganjiang watershed and fuhe watershed where the variations in evp were higher compared with those in the other sub watersheds therefore the contribution rates of the three variables to et in the watersheds actually conformed to the law of the minimum the law of the minimum is a principle developed in agricultural science which states that growth is dictated not by total resources available but by the scarcest resource limiting factor the law has also been applied to ecosystem field to emphasis the significance of the scarcity of essential resource in this study the three factors control the et simultaneously during the process but the change in et is limited by the factor with the smallest change a change in this factor will greatly influence the changes in et whereas the contribution rates of the other non limiting factors will be reduced however the contribution rate only represents the relative ratio of lai pre 2m and evp to the contribution of et in the same watershed it cannot be used to compare the absolute values of the contributions between different sub watersheds the absolute values of the contributions are still depending on the absolute values of the variation of the variables 4 discussion in terms of physical mechanisms et is mainly controlled by the temperature humidity wind speed radiation pre vegetation and co2 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 in this study we selected variables to establish an empirical model to represent the three main dimensions of these factors i e lai represents the state of vegetation cover pre determines the amount of water that can be supplied for et and evp reflects the combined influence of the temperature humidity wind speed radiation and other meteorological factors at inter annual scale the et from a watershed is mainly influenced by the water input and available energy but to a minor extent by the vegetation types oudin et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 in this study we focused on the relationships between variations in et and dynamic changes in pre energy and vegetation on a monthly time scale according to our results the variations in vegetation made the greatest contribution to the inter annual changes in et lai affects et by influencing many biological and physiological factors that control et processes such as the land surface albedo canopy conductance canopy interception rates and root distribution betts 2000 mccarthy et al 1992 sun et al 2010 admittedly the modis et products have lai as one of its key input of its conductance sub model which may let the influence of lai be overestimated during the growing season soil water and groundwater usually serve as important reservoirs to meet the peak et demand therefore throughout the year the correlation coefficient between the et and the mean pre in the current month and previous month was higher than the correlation coefficient between et and pre for the present month thus the variations in et actually lagged behind the variations in pre in many studies of et the potential evapotranspiration pet is often an important variable for estimating the actual et in rainfall runoff and ecosystem modeling however pet has been defined in different ways in various studies and quantitatively estimating pet with existing mathematical formulae yields inconsistent results lu et al 2005 xu and singh 2002 by contrast although it is easy to obtain objective evp data in meteorological stations evp data have actually been used less frequently in studies of et especially in investigations that focused on ecological processes because it ignores the transpiration from vegetation thereby resulting in great differences between the evp and actual et in this study for example maybe due to the cloudy and rainy weather during may and june the evaporation of water was relatively low fig 2 whereas transpiration by plants was relatively high because of the intense transpiration and photosynthesis by plants in the growing season thus evp reflected the evaporation of water and it was lower than et in may and june after july the surface radiation energy increased and rainfall decreased and evp was higher than et in this period in this study we used evp as an indicator of the available energy and meteorological factors in the pyh et model and the evp s limitations on reflecting actual et process like vegetation coverage and available water can be complemented when combined with pre and lai the results obtained by this model were better than those produced only using evp data for reference in addition this model directly uses evp observation data and thus it is relatively simple compared with most pet models which require more meteorological and radiation parameters in this study we compared the characteristics of pre lai evp and et in whole watershed scale and sub watershed scale we chose five sub watersheds raohe xinjing fuhe ganjing xiushui excluding lake area as the main research objects in sub watershed scale because the five sub watersheds were closed watershed and all the runoff in the five watersheds would flow into lake area where the poyang lake existed it was better to analyze the hydrological conditions and build model in closed watershed on the other hand the water area occupied large part of the lake area but the et model we built was based on terrestrial et so lake area was not suitable to do the same study on the whole the results of sub watersheds were consistent with the whole watershed the variation tendencies of pre lai evp and et in sub watersheds were similar with the whole watershed so were the relationships between et and pre lai evp we established the pyh et model based on the average data of the watershed without considering the spatial difference of lai pre evp within the watershed however our model was still suitable for analyzing the spatial distribution of terrestrial et in the poyang lake watershed admittedly the pyh et model simplified the relationships between lai evp pre and et which ignored the nonlinearity relationships between et and other parameters in the evapotranspiration process the linear coefficient of lai in the model was relative large which resulted in that the model may overestimate the et where lai was relative high and underestimate the et where lai was relative low any et observations and estimation methods include uncertainty rs technology is suitable for studying et on a large spatial scale but the precision of the product usually varies among different areas and cover types thus the accuracy of the mod16 et is higher in humid areas than in arid areas and this product also performs better in forest covered regions than agricultural land regions kim et al 2012 therefore rs products always require further verification when applied to specific areas meir et al 2010 the applicability of pan evaporation also varies among different regions where the correlation between the potential terrestrial evapotranspiration and evp is high in humid regions and low in non humid regions brutsaert et al 1998 since the method used to estimate et in this study is largely influenced by land use in future research we will study the suitability of our empirical model in other regions with similar land cover and ecological systems as well as its limitations on different land cover regions 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the average inter annual variations in evapotranspiration et leaf area index lai precipitation pre and pan evaporation evp in the poyang lake watershed during the period from 2000 to 2014 the correlation between the inter annual variation in et and lai was highest whereas the correlation between et and pre was lowest according to the variations in each factor we established an empirical model pyh et of the relationships between lai pre 2m evp and et and the model was used for accurately estimating the terrestrial et in the poyang lake watershed the pyh et model was applied to five sub watersheds in the poyang lake watershed which were calibrated separately the model performed well in all of the sub watersheds where the highest accuracy was obtained for the sub watersheds with high vegetation coverage the contribution rates of lai to et was highest in all the sub watersheds followed by evp whereas pre made the lowest contribution the contribution rates of these three factors to et in this watershed conformed to the law of the minimum thus the three factors controlled the et simultaneously but changes in et were limited by the factor with the smallest change a change in this factor greatly affected the et whereas the contribution rates of the other non limiting factors were relatively low the pyh et model requires a small number of readily available parameters and its accuracy is high therefore this model is suitable for applications in ecological resource management hydrological process simulation and other practical problems in the poyang lake watershed moreover this method provides a new way to estimate evapotranspiration by using several easily available data and it can be applied to many regions with similar physical geographical features conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements this study was

than et lysimeter and eddy covariance flux towers can measure et directly liu et al 1998 nagler et al 2005 but the observational data are difficult to obtain and they cannot be used on a large scale due to the low number of observation stations remote sensing rs provides relatively frequent and spatially contiguous measurements to allow the global monitoring of surface biophysical variables that affect et including the albedo vegetation type and density yet rs products are easily affected by cloudiness and the results still need to be verified using field data before being applied in researches many calculation models have been developed for estimating et the watershed water balance method is the easiest method for calculating et but it is generally limited to the long term average when the change in the water storage component is negligible ford et al 2007 surface energy balance seb methods comprising one source seb and two source seb are used frequently especially in the rs field allen et al 2007 norman et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 seb based physical et models are mainly based on surface energy balance equation and heat transfer equation and thermal ir based land surface temperature lst is a critical remote sensing variable but these products have many disadvantages like the difficulty of estimating sensible heat flux h and et can often exceed net radiation at a given time or place due to advection of h from the surrounding landscape glenn et al 2007 gowda et al 2008 mu et al 2011 in that case rs et models using the penman monteith p m approach were developed the p m model is one of most widely used methods for estimating et and this physical based model performs well when applied in vegetation covered regions allen et al 1994 leuning et al 2008 monteith 1965 many global rs based et products are derived from p m approach such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product developed by mu et al 2007 2011 and the global long term 1983 2006 daily et product developed by zhang et al 2010 however the available rs data cannot always meet the requirements in terms of the research time range and scale when applied to simulations of hydrological processes in addition few hydrological models can directly incorporate rs et data products into their calculations and the usage of rs in the parameterization of hydrological models is a growing field of research herman et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 zou et al 2017 when directly using p m model coupled with meteorological data to calculate et this model requires several climatic variables that are often unavailable and the surface conductance which is difficult to determine sun et al 2010 using complex et methods in hydrological models will increase the number of parameters required which will also increase the uncertainty of the hydrological models simplifying the method used for calculating et in hydrological models would reduce the difficulty and uncertainty of calibrations and facilitate runoff process simulations sun et al 2011a b yin et al 2016 however the estimation of et is excessively simple in some hydrological models such as using the pan evaporation evp conversion coefficient to calculate et which ignores the large difference between et and evp thereby leading to errors in final modeling results therefore establishing a simple et model that conforms with the et pattern for a certain watershed is necessary for simulating hydrological processes the variation in et especially the inter annual variation is mainly controlled by the available amount of water the available energy and characteristics of the surface cover wang and dickinson 2012 the available water for et is usually related to precipitation pre in the watershed evp is related to the combined effect of all the meteorological factors on areas with open water where it reflects both the available radiation energy and the influence of meteorological factors on evaporation in a region kahler and brutsaert 2006 the leaf area index lai is a general parameter that can reflect the canopy structure characteristic of the vegetation and it is closely related to plant transpiration liu et al 2016 for many watersheds pre evp and lai data can be obtained easily from meteorological stations and rs images thereby increasing the possible applications of the et model developed according to the relationships between et and the three variables in this study we considered the poyang lake watershed china as an example and we established the relationships among et and lai pre and evp based on the average inter annual change in et and the other three variables we also analyzed the contributions of natural factors like vegetation cover available water temperature and other meteorological factors reflected by lai pre and evp to et on different watershed scales 2 methods 2 1 basic conditions in the study area the poyang lake watershed has an area of 1 622 105 km2 where it accounts for nearly 97 of the entire area of jiangxi province south china the poyang lake watershed ranges geographically from 24 29 14 n to 30 04 41 n latitude and from 113 34 36 e to 118 28 58 e longitude the poyang lake watershed is a typical inland watershed in china this dustpan like watershed is surrounded by high mountains except on the north side which slopes gradually downward from the south to the north five large rivers comprising the xiushui river ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river and raohe river distributing in five main closed sub watersheds flow into poyang lake water flows from the lake into the yangtze river through the lake mouth fig 1 the major land use types in the poyang lake watershed and six sub watersheds are tree cover shrubland and cropland fig 1 table 1 the vegetation in this region is dominated by evergreen coniferous forest seasonal green cover and mixed cover the climate in this region is subtropical humid climate and it is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon regime summer monsoon and winter monsoon included the mean annual temperature is approximately 17 1 c with july mean temperatures of 29 32 c and january mean temperatures of 3 0 5 0 c the annual pre is approximately 1620mm most of which falls between april and september and it is influenced by the summer monsoon xu et al 2016 the annual et is 700 850mm the temporal spatial distributions of pre and et are uneven poyang lake watershed is representative region which is dominated by woodland and cropland under the humid subtropical monsoon climate 2 2 data sources this study used watershed boundary and drainage data derived from the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science and technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn shuttle radar topographic mission srtm 90m digital elevation model dem data were acquired from the geospatial data cloud the land use and land cover data were derived from 300m annual global land cover data 2000 2007 2014 provided by the framework of the climate change initiative the daily pre data and evp data obtained from 2000 to 2014 for 15 meteorological stations were provided by the china meteorological data service center the lai dataset was derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis liu et al 2012 2016 where it comprised 8 day lai composites at a spatial resolution of 500m from 2000 to 2014 the lai data were retrieved from the 8 day modis reflectance product mod09a1 v05 and the yearly modis land cover datasets mcd12q1 v051 using a four scale geometric optical model deng et al 2006 the lai data were validated by measuring lai in representative regions of the study region which made the lai data become more targeted for the research liu et al 2012 the et validation data came from the monthly modis et product mod16a2 and it was shown previously that they are suitable for analyzing the characteristic spatial temporal distributions of et in the poyang lake watershed wu et al 2013 all the rs data came from the whole calendar year for the period of 2000 to 2014 2 3 calculated monthly et pre and lai we used the thiessen polygon method to calculate the monthly pre for the whole watershed according to the pre data from 15 meteorological stations the same method was used to determine the evp for the whole watershed but the result only represented the combined effect of all the meteorological factors and radiation energy at the whole watershed scale the monthly lai and et were calculated by using envi 5 0 to count the averages from an rs image of the whole watershed the data in modis et products only consider the terrestrial et and they ignore the evaporation from lakes so we focused mainly on the terrestrial et the resulted data for each month were calculated by overlaying and averaging the corresponding monthly rs data from 2000 to 2014 the analysis of inner annual variation of the lai pre and evp was based on these average data for the land use changes of vegetation cover were relative small during these years table 2 we could study the inner annual performance of the lai on et without concerning about the significant impact of inter annual variation of lai the five sub watersheds raohe fuhe xinjiang ganjiang and xiushui were generated according to the characteristics of the dem and drainage from the poyang lake watershed using hydrology module in the toolbox of arcgis 10 3 the monthly pre evp lai and et data for each sub watershed were calculated using the same method described above 2 4 empirical et model development we analyzed the correlation coefficients between et and lai pre and evp using all the monthly data from 2000 2014 in addition we established regression models for the relationships between et lai pre and evp during 2000 2013 using the multiple linear regression mlr method in ibm spss 19 0 the data from 2014 were then used to validate the accuracy of the established model 3 results 3 1 monthly et pre evp and lai the variations in the monthly et pre evp and lai averages of the whole poyang lake watershed from 2000 to 2014 are shown in fig 2 the poyang lake watershed is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and it is controlled by the asian monsoon where the rainfall increases sharply around june this phenomenon is known as the plum rains and it is the result of the stagnation of the main rain belt over the yangtze river watershed therefore pre peaked in june and then decreased sharply evp is mainly related to the radiation temperature humidity and other meteorological conditions due to the plum rains the land receives less radiation and evaporation is limited so the evp decreased in june but peaked in july which are the warmest months lai is affected by plant phenology plants begin to grow in april and may with exuberant growth from june to august so the lai values increased rapidly in april and may and peaked from june to august the variable trend in et was highly consistent with that in lai by comparing the et and evp we found that evp was lower than et during may and june but the opposite in other months for the five main closed sub watersheds the inner annual variation tendencies of et evp lai and pre were similar fig 3 but the variation ranges of these variables among different sub watersheds existed differences for example the peaks of lai in xiushui and raohe were much higher than other sub watersheds which was the result of relative high vegetation coverage in the two regions fig 1 the evp of fuhe was highest during the whole year while the pre of xinjiang and fuhe were higher than other sub watersheds before jun and then decreased lower than others and it is the consequences of spatial distribution changes of precipitation temperature and other climate features in poyang lake watershed 3 2 relationships between pre evp lai and et fig 4a c show the relationships between the monthly lai evp pre and monthly et of the whole watershed during 2000 2014 where the r values were 0 969 0 894 and 0 380 respectively therefore et had the strongest correlation with lai and the lowest correlation with pre the water available for et is affected by the current month s pre but also by the pre in the previous month which is stored in the soil layers in the watershed in fig 4d pre 2m is the moving average of the pre per 2 months the correlation coefficient between et and pre 2m was 0 591 so we used pre 2m to represent the effect of pre on et which appeared to be more suitable for the poyang lake watershed table 3 also shows that the relationships between the monthly et with four variables in five main sub watersheds have the similar characteristic as the whole watershed according to the data obtained in the whole poyang lake watershed from 2000 to 2013 we established a multiple linear regression model of the relationships between et lai pre 2m and evp using spss the model pyh et is formulated as follows 1 et 5 476 20 97 lai 0 297 evp 0 070 pre 2 m where r 0 980 sig f 0 0001 and all variables and the intercept in the equation were highly significant p 0 001 in order to validate the pyh et model we compared the et values calculated by eq 1 based on the monthly lai evp and pre 2m data predicted data with the et values measured based on monthly modis et products measured data in 2014 and the results are shown in fig 5 the fitting result for the model was credible and the relative error between the two sets of data was 10 2 so the model has relative high accuracy and was satisfactory for the simulation of et in poyang lake watershed 3 3 spatial application of the pyh et model based on the data from june 2014 when all the parameters values were high as an example to simulate the spatial distribution of et fig 6a we used the pyh et model to overlay the spatial distributions of pre evp and lai according to fig 6a and b the overall trend in the characteristic spatial distribution of et obtained by the simulation was consistent with the modis product although the resolution of the simulation results was relatively low in some areas by comparing the spatial distribution of the et with the spatial distributions of lai evp and pre figures are not put here we found that the spatial distribution of the simulation results was affected mainly by the spatial distribution of the lai rather than the other two factors we subtracted the modis product from the simulation result and the difference is shown in fig 6c according to figs 1 and 6c compared with the modis product the simulation overestimated the et in the tree covered region and underestimated the et in the cropland region 3 4 contribution rates of pre evp and lai in different sub watersheds the same method of pyh et model was applied to the sub watersheds including raohe watershed xinjiang watershed fuhe watershed ganjiang watershed and xiushui watershed and different coefficients were obtained table 4 the pyh et model was suitable for all five sub watersheds where the most accurate results were obtained for the raohe watershed and the xiushui watershed thus the pyh et model is suitable for application to land surfaces at the small watershed scale the contribution rate of the lai to et can be expressed as follows 2 s l δ l a i c l a i δ e t where δlai is the absolute value of the variation in lai c lai is the coefficient of lai in the model and δet is the variation in et obtained by the model similarly s p and s e are expressed as follows 3 s p δ p r e 2 m c pre 2m δ e t 4 s e δ e v p c evp δ e t where s p is the contribution rate of pre to et and s e is the contribution rate of evp to et the period from february to june is the growing season of plants in the poyang lake watershed and all of the variables tended to increase during this period fig 3 thus we studied the contribution rates to the variation in et for the different variables in the five sub watersheds from february to june during 2000 2014 according to table 5 and fig 3 lai made the highest contribution rate in all of the sub watersheds followed by evp whereas pre made the lowest contribution rate by comparing the different sub watersheds we found that the variations in et were relatively high in the raohe watershed and xiushui watershed but relatively low in the xinjiang watershed the variations in lai were relatively large in the raohe watershed and xiushui watershed but the variations in pre and evp were relatively low where the contribution rate of lai was relatively low in these two watersheds whereas the contribution rates of pre and evp were relatively high similarly the variation in evp was high whereas that in lai was relatively low in the fuhe watershed and the contribution rate of pre was relatively low whereas the contribution rate of lai was relatively high in addition the contribution rates of evp were lower in the ganjiang watershed and fuhe watershed where the variations in evp were higher compared with those in the other sub watersheds therefore the contribution rates of the three variables to et in the watersheds actually conformed to the law of the minimum the law of the minimum is a principle developed in agricultural science which states that growth is dictated not by total resources available but by the scarcest resource limiting factor the law has also been applied to ecosystem field to emphasis the significance of the scarcity of essential resource in this study the three factors control the et simultaneously during the process but the change in et is limited by the factor with the smallest change a change in this factor will greatly influence the changes in et whereas the contribution rates of the other non limiting factors will be reduced however the contribution rate only represents the relative ratio of lai pre 2m and evp to the contribution of et in the same watershed it cannot be used to compare the absolute values of the contributions between different sub watersheds the absolute values of the contributions are still depending on the absolute values of the variation of the variables 4 discussion in terms of physical mechanisms et is mainly controlled by the temperature humidity wind speed radiation pre vegetation and co2 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 in this study we selected variables to establish an empirical model to represent the three main dimensions of these factors i e lai represents the state of vegetation cover pre determines the amount of water that can be supplied for et and evp reflects the combined influence of the temperature humidity wind speed radiation and other meteorological factors at inter annual scale the et from a watershed is mainly influenced by the water input and available energy but to a minor extent by the vegetation types oudin et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 in this study we focused on the relationships between variations in et and dynamic changes in pre energy and vegetation on a monthly time scale according to our results the variations in vegetation made the greatest contribution to the inter annual changes in et lai affects et by influencing many biological and physiological factors that control et processes such as the land surface albedo canopy conductance canopy interception rates and root distribution betts 2000 mccarthy et al 1992 sun et al 2010 admittedly the modis et products have lai as one of its key input of its conductance sub model which may let the influence of lai be overestimated during the growing season soil water and groundwater usually serve as important reservoirs to meet the peak et demand therefore throughout the year the correlation coefficient between the et and the mean pre in the current month and previous month was higher than the correlation coefficient between et and pre for the present month thus the variations in et actually lagged behind the variations in pre in many studies of et the potential evapotranspiration pet is often an important variable for estimating the actual et in rainfall runoff and ecosystem modeling however pet has been defined in different ways in various studies and quantitatively estimating pet with existing mathematical formulae yields inconsistent results lu et al 2005 xu and singh 2002 by contrast although it is easy to obtain objective evp data in meteorological stations evp data have actually been used less frequently in studies of et especially in investigations that focused on ecological processes because it ignores the transpiration from vegetation thereby resulting in great differences between the evp and actual et in this study for example maybe due to the cloudy and rainy weather during may and june the evaporation of water was relatively low fig 2 whereas transpiration by plants was relatively high because of the intense transpiration and photosynthesis by plants in the growing season thus evp reflected the evaporation of water and it was lower than et in may and june after july the surface radiation energy increased and rainfall decreased and evp was higher than et in this period in this study we used evp as an indicator of the available energy and meteorological factors in the pyh et model and the evp s limitations on reflecting actual et process like vegetation coverage and available water can be complemented when combined with pre and lai the results obtained by this model were better than those produced only using evp data for reference in addition this model directly uses evp observation data and thus it is relatively simple compared with most pet models which require more meteorological and radiation parameters in this study we compared the characteristics of pre lai evp and et in whole watershed scale and sub watershed scale we chose five sub watersheds raohe xinjing fuhe ganjing xiushui excluding lake area as the main research objects in sub watershed scale because the five sub watersheds were closed watershed and all the runoff in the five watersheds would flow into lake area where the poyang lake existed it was better to analyze the hydrological conditions and build model in closed watershed on the other hand the water area occupied large part of the lake area but the et model we built was based on terrestrial et so lake area was not suitable to do the same study on the whole the results of sub watersheds were consistent with the whole watershed the variation tendencies of pre lai evp and et in sub watersheds were similar with the whole watershed so were the relationships between et and pre lai evp we established the pyh et model based on the average data of the watershed without considering the spatial difference of lai pre evp within the watershed however our model was still suitable for analyzing the spatial distribution of terrestrial et in the poyang lake watershed admittedly the pyh et model simplified the relationships between lai evp pre and et which ignored the nonlinearity relationships between et and other parameters in the evapotranspiration process the linear coefficient of lai in the model was relative large which resulted in that the model may overestimate the et where lai was relative high and underestimate the et where lai was relative low any et observations and estimation methods include uncertainty rs technology is suitable for studying et on a large spatial scale but the precision of the product usually varies among different areas and cover types thus the accuracy of the mod16 et is higher in humid areas than in arid areas and this product also performs better in forest covered regions than agricultural land regions kim et al 2012 therefore rs products always require further verification when applied to specific areas meir et al 2010 the applicability of pan evaporation also varies among different regions where the correlation between the potential terrestrial evapotranspiration and evp is high in humid regions and low in non humid regions brutsaert et al 1998 since the method used to estimate et in this study is largely influenced by land use in future research we will study the suitability of our empirical model in other regions with similar land cover and ecological systems as well as its limitations on different land cover regions 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the average inter annual variations in evapotranspiration et leaf area index lai precipitation pre and pan evaporation evp in the poyang lake watershed during the period from 2000 to 2014 the correlation between the inter annual variation in et and lai was highest whereas the correlation between et and pre was lowest according to the variations in each factor we established an empirical model pyh et of the relationships between lai pre 2m evp and et and the model was used for accurately estimating the terrestrial et in the poyang lake watershed the pyh et model was applied to five sub watersheds in the poyang lake watershed which were calibrated separately the model performed well in all of the sub watersheds where the highest accuracy was obtained for the sub watersheds with high vegetation coverage the contribution rates of lai to et was highest in all the sub watersheds followed by evp whereas pre made the lowest contribution the contribution rates of these three factors to et in this watershed conformed to the law of the minimum thus the three factors controlled the et simultaneously but changes in et were limited by the factor with the smallest change a change in this factor greatly affected the et whereas the contribution rates of the other non limiting factors were relatively low the pyh et model requires a small number of readily available parameters and its accuracy is high therefore this model is suitable for applications in ecological resource management hydrological process simulation and other practical problems in the poyang lake watershed moreover this method provides a new way to estimate evapotranspiration by using several easily available data and it can be applied to many regions with similar

1137,the flow characteristic in a partly vegetated channel with emergent condition is studied by covering a finite length of the channel with natural oryza sativa rice stems with downward seepage spatial study of velocity profiles shows that vegetation reduces the flow velocity lengthways of vegetation zone even with the presence of downward seepage reynolds stress increases at the downstream end of the interface section because of higher velocity fluctuations between vegetated and un vegetated zone the increase in reynolds stress at the downstream of interface section is attributed to higher lateral flow and momentum exchange in this transition zone between vegetated and un vegetated area for the vegetated section vegetation serves as a barrier for the vegetated section in reducing the maximum reynolds stress in the range of 17 20 along the flow direction it is also observed that downward seepage increases the reynolds stress as well as turbulence intensities integral scales increase with increase in percentage of downward seepage resulting in higher reynolds stresses with downward seepage presented work will help in analyzing the changes in flow field with partially emergent vegetation in alluvial channel subjected to downward seepage the overall results of this study may enhance the comprehensive understanding of the vegetation effects on flow characteristics in partly emerged vegetated channel and may also provide some guidance for the practice of river ecological restoration on river bed or banks keywords fluvial hydrodynamics turbulence sediment vegetation interaction seepage partially emergent vegetation 1 introduction the presence of vegetation in a channel affects the whole flow characteristics giving rise to a range of scientific and engineering implications montakhab et al 2015 previous studies show that aquatic vegetation improves water quality schulz et al 2003 promotes habitat diversity crowder and diplas 2002 stabilizes the channel bed wang et al 2009 and increases bed material deposition lopez and garcia 1998 cotton et al 2006 gurnell et al 2006 therefore vegetation has been regarded as river system engineers jones et al 1994 gurnell 2014 several investigations for exploring the flow conditions in a vegetated channel are found in literature many researchers nepf and vivoni 2000 finnigan et al 2009 nepf 2012 conducted experiments based on the theory of turbulence and stated that the turbulence is greatly related to vegetation characteristics nezu and onitsuka 2001 conducted the experiments on a partly vegetated channel and observed that horizontal vortices close to water surface are created by the inflection shear instability and that turbulence close the water surface is exchanged laterally from the non vegetated region to vegetated region by secondary currents wilson et al 2003 investigated turbulence characteristics between two various types of submerged vegetation and observed that the extra superficial zone of the fronds influence the momentum exchange between the vegetated zone and the upper flow zone thus decreasing the shear induced turbulence järvelä 2005 observed a change in the universal logarithmic velocity profile for vegetated flow and the maximum value of shear stress occurring approximately at the top of the vegetation is used for expressing darcy weisbach s friction factor the presence of emergent vegetation in a channel influences the conveyance capacity of the channel james and makoa 2006 jordanova et al 2006 the type of occurrence and distribution of vegetation affect the flow resistance characteristics even if it occupies a small part of the channel and it influences the flow characteristics in the clear water region for a partly vegetated channel james and makoa 2006 chen et al 2011 investigated the turbulence characteristics of submerged flexible vegetation with various patterns and various longitudinal and transverse spacing the fully flow zone is categorized into three zones upper non vegetated zone middle vegetated zone and lower sheath zone the flow characteristics will be changed at the sheath zone and at the top of the plant clump where the flow is deaccelerated by plant siniscalchi et al 2012 showed that a strong shear layer formed at the top of the vegetation patch increases the vertical turbulent transport kubrak et al 2012 investigated the impact of stem deflections on the vertical distributions of flow velocities they presented the methods of computing the deflections of flexible vegetation elements under the dynamic pressure of water and observed that the differences in heights of the submerged parts of the stem did not influence the computed velocity distributions significantly in another study by montakhab et al 2015 it was found that distribution of patchy vegetation is vital for investigating hydraulic characteristics not only vegetation will cause a change in flow characteristics the bed condition also plays an important role natural channels rivers and streams have beds formed by earthen permeable materials and experience seepage flow through boundaries because of the difference between water levels in the channel and the adjoining ground water levels seepage flow through a channel can be observed in two forms suction and injection if the free water surface in the channel is higher than the adjoining ground water level seepage flow occurs through a channel bed and is called suction or downward seepage while injection or upward seepage occurs when water surface in the channel is lower than the adjoining ground water level and seepage flow occurs into the channel previous studies show that downward seepage flow can affect the hydrodynamic behaviour of the channel flow as well as its sediment transport conditions rao and sitaram 1999 rao et al 2011 cao and chiew 2014 deshpande and kumar 2015 patel et al 2015 the application of downward seepage to stable alluvial channel minimal occurrence of erosion and deposition of sediments increases the sediment transport because of the increase in bed shear stress rao et al 2011 the threshold for motion of bed materials is employed in the design of stable channels the investigation of flow structure in seepage affected vegetated alluvial channel can provide solution of important engineering problems recently devi and kumar 2015 studied the effect of downward seepage on the turbulent flow parameters in a vegetated channel by using artificial rubber cylinders and concluded that turbulent flow parameters increase with downward seepage as compared to no seepage devi and kumar 2016a also investigated the flow characteristics in a channel partially covered with submerged vegetation devi and kumar 2016b studied the change in flow characteristics of alluvial channel occupied by submerged vegetated patches of different spacing under downward seepage condition devi and kumar 2016c analyzed the impact of the presence of submerged flexible vegetation in a seepage affected alluvial channel with two patterns staggered and uniform and two different vegetation spacing devi et al 2016a studied the drag owing to the presence of vegetation and turbulent characteristics in a mobile bed channel characterized by fully submerged vegetation formed by non uniform vegetation densities devi et al 2016b carried out the experiments to compare the flow characteristics with and without the presence of flexible vegetation in a channel devi et al 2017 used the experimental observations in a tilting flume having a bed covered with rice plants to analyze the flow characteristics of flexible emergent vegetation with downward seepage devi and kumar 2017 investigated the flow conditions in a channel covered with fully submerged oryza sativa considering downward seepage the flow measurements taken at the upstream free vegetation zone centre of the vegetation zone and downstream free vegetation zone will provide a better understanding regarding the flow hydrodynamics in a vegetated channel experiments on alluvial channels proved that seepage occurs because of the porosity of the soil and difference in the water level in the channel and ground water table the presence of seepage on such channels has also been studied and found that the presence of downward seepage increases the sediment transport rate when vegetation grows on such downward seepage affected channels it will not be a wiser option to neglect the effect of downward seepage previous studies on emergent vegetation studied the flow characteristics without considering the bed condition or seepage parameter in the present study the novelty lies in studying the effect of downward seepage and comparing the flow characteristics of no seepage with seepage case additionally two different seepage percentages have been applied and checked the change in flow characteristics with increase in seepage percentage numerous results have been obtained on defining the spatial flow characteristics in a vegetated river and thus there is a need to understand the spatial flow characteristics in a partially vegetated river considering downward seepage aquatic vegetation in a natural river can be occurred partially of finite length as it is known that such partial cover of aquatic vegetation in a natural river can be occurred for emergent vegetation and thus there is a need to comprehend the longitudinal change in flow characteristics in a seepage affected channel covered partly with emergent vegetation thus the main aim of the present study is to understand the changes in turbulent flow structures in a stable channel covered partly with emergent vegetation without seepage and after the application of downward seepage the underlying process behind sediment transport with downward seepage in partly covered vegetated channels is also presented the overall results of this study may enhance the comprehensive understanding of the vegetation effects on flow characteristics in partly emerged vegetated channel and may also provide some guidance for the practice of river ecological restoration on river bed or banks 2 experimental set up all the experiments were conducted in a tilting flume of 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 72 m deep fig 1 a a tank of dimensions 2 8 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m deep was provided at the upstream of the flume to straighten the flow prior to its introduction in to the flume two metres of upstream length of the main channel bed was made non porous and the remaining length of the channel was made porous by covering a fine mesh 0 1 mm this mesh arrangement was supported by steel tube structure of 0 22 m height which was placed on the bottom of the bed bottom pressure chamber 15 20 m in length 1 m wide and 0 22 m deep were formed by the area between the bottom of the channel and the fine mesh sand was placed on the fine mesh in order to prevent its entrance into the bottom chamber this pressure chamber was used to remove the water from the main channel through the sand bed in perpendicular direction in the form of downward seepage in order to prevent highly turbulent flow from entering the channel a wooden baffle was installed at the upstream collection tank and the main channel has been smoothened for a length of 2 m at upstream the bed slope was fixed at 0 15 which was kept fixed for all the experiments the flow in the flume was driven by three 10 hp centrifugal pump the discharge in the flume was measured with the help of a rectangular notch located at the downstream of the flume the water depth in the flume was measured with a digital point gauge two electromagnetic flow meters installed at the downstream of the flume have a control valve and a digital display which was used for applying desired percentage of seepage discharge fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup the flow depth h at incipient motion condition was fixed at 12 cm when measured at the centre of the test section and discharge qi was found as 0 0326 m3 s 1 vegetation stems were placed in a section of 5 m long and 0 5 m wide in the middle of the flume fig 1b experiments were conducted for emergent condition natural rice stems o sativa were placed in a staggered pattern at 10 cm centre centre fig 2 present work falls under the category of bending plants of high flexural rigidity nikora 2010 it can be representative of the flexible and emergent plants often found on riverbanks and drainage channels a bundle comprising of three to four rice stems were used for imitating a vegetation stem of average diameter 10 mm different flow characteristics were presented by taking measurements at the vegetated section interface of the vegetated zone and unvegetated zone and unvegetated section fig 1b shows 11 measurement locations for studying the spatial flow conditions free upstream upstream centre and downstream of vegetated zone a1 a2 and a3 interface section b1 b2 and b3 and unvegetated section c1 c2 and c3 and free downstream the flow coming in the channel was permitted to stabilize for about one hour before taking any measurements after placing the vegetation model in the flume post processing of raw velocity data is done in a similar manner as explained in devi et al 2016a b instantaneous velocity measurements were taken with the help of nortek 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv a sampling rate of 200 hz was used for data collection the duration of data acquisition was chosen as 5 min consequently after conducting the experiment with vegetation at no seepage condition different seepage percentages 10 and 15 of the discharge at incipient motion were applied by controlling the valve of electromagnetic flow meters in all the experiments snr was kept at 15 or above and the signal correlation between transmitted and received signals of 70 is recommended as cut off value the velocity data measured by the adv include spikes because of interference between transmitted and received signals these data are needed to be post processed or filtered acceleration thresholding method goring and nikora 2002 is used for removing the spikes in the velocity data threshold values 1 1 5 were selected by trial and error in such a way that the velocity power spectra in the inertial subrange yielded a satisfactory fit with kolmogorov 5 3 scaling law the uncertainty of vectrino data was determined by collecting 16 pulses samples at the centre of the test section at a location of 4 mm over the beds

i w 2 n the study of flow characteristics around the vegetation provided above requires provision of drag coefficient as it is one of the important parameters for defining vegetation characteristics the measurement of drag force with the presence of vegetation stems directly is a difficult task using appropriate devices therefore it is calculated from the horizontally averaged momentum equation dunn et al 1996 nepf and vivoni 2000 nezu and sanjou 2008 the momentum equation for steady and uniform 2d open channel flow with homogenous vegetation stems is given below 4 y u w u w υ u y g i e f f

c d a u u 2 1 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 time averaged velocity the flow velocity variations at different measurement locations will provide an insight to the influence of vegetation in a channel the flow velocities at a section and b section remain about the same except that a rise in the near bed velocity for b3 is observed fig 3 the flow velocities measured at the downstream and upstream locations where there is no vegetation lie close to each other within 5 it is noted that the velocity in the vegetated region decreases and increases in the un vegetated region as the flow goes downstream this clearly indicates that the velocity reduced in the vegetation zone is diverted towards the un vegetated zone the time averaged flow velocities of the vegetated zone are 45 60 lowers than the corresponding velocities in the un vegetated zone a section and b section have 0 2023 m s 1 for no seepage 0 2135 m s 1 for 10 seepage and 0 2179 m s 1 for 15 seepage this shows that vegetation can effectively reduce the flow velocities which confirmed the previous work devi and kumar 2016b in the investigation of flow characteristic in a fully vegetated channel with emergent vegetation devi et al 2017 it can be seen that overall the presence of vegetation retards the velocity profiles with regard to the upstream free zone for all the measurement locations a higher velocity zone exists in the lower flow region as observed by cao and chiew 2014 fig 3 the lower flow region has a higher velocity zone for all the locations fig 3 the velocity increases by a value of 11 and 15 average with 10 and 15 seepage respectively as compared to no seepage for a constant discharge the presence of the seepage reduces the flow depth in the channel which suggests that velocity increased in the presence of seepage previous investigations into the application of downward seepage have shown that the velocity profile moves downward and hence a higher velocity is achieved in the near bed region cao and chiew 2014 with the application of seepage the flow velocity is higher than in the no seepage case because of the shifting of the higher velocity zone near the bed devi et al 2017 the flow velocities at a1 and a2 are higher than a3 for both no seepage as well as seepage cases which mean that even with downward seepage vegetation can resist the flow and reduces the velocity in contrast to a section the flow at the downstream of unvegetated section c 3 is always higher than c 2 and c 3 3 2 reynolds stress the distribution of reynolds stress is used in estimating the shear velocity which evaluates the bed resistance to the flow the vertical profile of reynolds stresses gives information on the momentum diffusion mechanism the variation of water flow in a partly vegetated channel made it complex to describe the reynolds shear stress distribution zhang et al 2015 the maximum value of reynolds stress for all the measurement locations lies near the bed except for a2 and b2 the profiles of a2 and b2 show that the values of reynolds stress lie near zero which implies that the presence of emergent vegetation reduces the bed shear stress and restricts the transport of bed material the occurrence of maximum reynolds stress close to the bed means that the main source of turbulence production is the channel bed in the fully emerged vegetated conditions devi et al 2017 the position of maximum stress is no longer at the channel bed and the bed is no longer the primary source of turbulence generation in vegetated flow rather it is now dominated by turbulence generated by the vegetation stems in case of partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2017 the occurrence of maximum value of reynolds stress close to the bed for upstream free vegetation zone shows that main turbulence production comes from the channel bed while it is not the same for vegetation zone a shear layer is formed because of the momentum exchange close to the top of the vegetation the reynolds shear stress at a1 is greater than at a2 and a3 which implies that the presence of vegetation resists the flow as it goes downstream the value of highest reynolds stress at b1 and b2 are almost comparable to the value at a1 and a2 at b3 reynolds stress is significantly increased at b3 where vegetation ends this means that bed shear stress is higher at the interface region where vegetation ends and consequently higher sediment transport is observed at the interface region comparing all the measurement locations the maximum reynolds stress for c2 and c3 are higher which leads to achievement of higher bed shear stress and higher bed material transport additionally even the free downstream zone has a higher reynolds stress than free upstream zone the whole process can be briefly described as the deviation of flow from the vegetated zone to the unvegetated zone causing more bed shear stress and bed material transport in the un vegetated region hence for a partly vegetated channel the decreased reynolds stress in the vegetated zone leads to attainment of more reynolds stress in the unvegetated region the reduction in reynolds stress in the vegetated zone along the flow direction would induce sediment deposition and increase in reynolds stress along the longitudinal direction in the unvegetated region may lead to destabilization of the unvegetated region the presence of vegetation in an open channel can significantly affect the hydrodynamic behavior of the flow and consequently sediment transport by obstructing the flow and changing the flow characteristics this result is confirmed with devi and kumar 2017 advances in understanding the behavior of flow over vegetation allow design engineers to improve both the knowledge of flow velocity profiles and flow resistance and the design of vegetated channels therefore design engineers must visualize these morphological adjustments and ecological impact different profiles of reynolds stress for no seepage as well as seepage cases at different measurement locations are shown in fig 4 the increase in shear stress with increase in seepage percentage is observed in all the vertical reynolds stress profiles the maximum reynolds stress increased to a range of 12 20 and 20 28 from no seepage to 10 seepage and 15 seepage respectively which shows that application of downward seepage promotes the bed material transport while in case of partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2017 downward seepage increases the maximum reynolds stress at no seepage by a percentage increase of 19 average for 10 seepage and 38 average for 15 seepage the value of reynolds stress at the downstream of the vegetated region a3 is less range of 17 20 than at the centre of the vegetated region a2 for both the seepage cases this means that vegetation can help in damping the reynolds stress and subsequently sediment transport at the downstream even with downward seepage 3 3 turbulent intensity the generation of turbulent intensity occurs from the variation of instantaneous velocity affected by vegetation and bed roughness turbulent intensity in longitudinal and vertical directions is denoted by σu and σw σu and σw are shown in figs 5 and 6 there is no significant change in the turbulent intensity at free upstream a1 b1 and c1 i e all values lie close to each other within 9 the turbulent intensity at a2 and b2 are lower as compared to free upstream a1 and b1 which means that the turbulent intensity is suppressed by the emergent vegetation at a3 a slight increase in turbulence intensity is noted but not larger than the free upstream an increase in turbulent intensity near the bed for b3 c2 and c3 is noted even more than the free upstream zone the increase in lateral flow and momentum exchange at the interface between vegetated and unvegetated area leads to occurrence of more turbulent fluctuations and more sediment transport zong and nepf 2010 observing the free downstream region it can be noted that maximum turbulent intensity occurs near the water surface this might be because of the reason that the flexible vegetation bends as flow occurs creating more fluctuations near the water surface at the free downstream in case of fully emerged vegetated channel devi et al 2017 the maximum turbulent intensity occurs at the starting portion of the vegetation zone and then decreases at the end of the vegetation zone implying that the turbulence production is reduced because of the presence of vegetation in case of submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2017 the centre and downstream of the vegetation zone have a maximum value of turbulent intensity near the top of the vegetation while the upstream free vegetation zone achieves a maximum value close to the bed the increase in reynolds stress and bed shear stress with the increase in seepage percentage leads to more shearing of flow thereby resulting in more turbulence intensity turbulence intensity for both the seepage cases 10 and 15 at all the locations increase by a value of 20 average as compared to no seepage case 3 4 moments the third order moment is defined by m j k u ˆ j w ˆ k where j k 3 u ˆ u u u 0 5 and w ˆ w w w 0 5 devi and kumar 2016a m 30 u ˆ 3 also known as the skewness of u is the streamwise flux of the streamwise reynolds stress while the skewness of w m 03 w ˆ 3 is the vertical flux of the vertical reynolds stress m 12 u ˆ 1 w ˆ 2 and m21 u ˆ 2 w ˆ 1 are the diffusion terms defining the diffusions of w w in x co ordinate streamwise or longitudinal direction and u u in z co ordinate vertical direction respectively third order moments m 30 m 03 m 12 and m 21 at a2 b2 and c2 are presented in fig 7 m 30 has small positive values and m 03 has small negative values close to the bed for the case of no seepage this implies that longitudinal flux of turbulent kinetic energy occurs in the flow direction and vertical flux of turbulent kinetic energy is in downward direction the magnitude of m 30 and m 12 increases near the bed by 2 5 for the seepage cases compared to the no seepage case this means an increase in streamwise flux of turbulent kinetic energy in streamwise direction and increase in diffusion of vertical flux of turbulent kinetic energy in streamwise direction leading to more sediment transport in seepage case for m 03 and m 21 the downward seepage increases the negative values of m 03 and m 21 by 2 5 which is in conformity with the occurrence of downward flow because of downward seepage this increase in the negative values of m 03 and m 21 suggests an increase in the vertical transport of vertical flux and increase in diffusion of longitudinal flux in vertical downward direction devi and kumar 2016c 3 5 quadrant analysis the mass and momentum exchange can be conferred through the identification of organized coherent structures it shows the impact of velocity fluctuations to reynolds stress at a point a u w plane is considered for sorting the instantaneous velocity components u and w lu and willmarth 1973 the plane is comprised of four quadrants each quadrant representing one event each as outward interaction q1 ejection q2 inward interaction q3 and sweep q4 the calculation of quadrant analysis is already discussed in raupach 1981 fractional contribution of reynolds stress for a2 b2 and c2 plotted along flow depth are shown in fig 8 the contribution of sweep and ejection events towards reynolds stress is more than inward and outward interactions for all the cases the contribution of ejection and sweep at a2 lies in close approximation at b2 ejection and sweep events have equal contribution for no seepage and 10 seepage but the dominance of sweep in the whole flow region is observed at 15 seepage this implies that downward seepage results in the increase of sweep event compared to ejection event resulting in higher bed material transport at c2 location the whole flow region above z h 0 3 is dominated by ejection for no seepage case but with the presence of downward seepage sweep event starts contributing to the flow this dominance of sweep events over ejection denotes an increase in momentum transfer and achievement of more reynolds stress sharma and kumar 2017 these increased contributions from sweep events in the seepage run increase momentum exchange from the flow to bed particles due to which sediment transport is increased with the application of downward seepage as compared to no seepage hence for downward seepage sweep is the major events in the near bed flow zone with the application of downward seepage the high speed fluid parcel becomes more persistently preserving near to the bed as compare to that with no seepage 3 6 drag coefficient the calculation of drag coefficient in vegetated flows is vital for understanding the flow structures which helps in defining vegetation characteristics the drag force with the presence of vegetation stems cannot be measured directly using devices the horizontally averaged momentum equation is used for drag coefficient calculation and the derivation is discussed by nezu and sanjou 2008 the values of cd for both no seepage and seepage cases are calculated and shown in fig 9 for flexible vegetation the drag coefficient is a depth dependent because of the variation in rigidity and thickness along the plant length the observed value of cd closer to the bed for no seepage lie near 3 which conforms to the range of cd 0 1 3 found by previous studies nepf and vivoni 2000 the increase in the values of cd with decrease in flow depth highlights the importance of viscous effects near the bed nepf and vivoni 2000 the change in the value of cd with downward seepage is observed the values of drag coefficients are 0 955 0 883 and 0 818 for no seepage 10 seepage and 15 seepage respectively this shows a decrease in the value of cd with downward seepage thereby implying the reduction in resistance or roughness offered by the vegetation with downward seepage 3 7 scales of flow the coherent structures present in a turbulent flow are formed because of sweep event which can induce the formation of bed features gyr and schmid 1989 time and length scales for no seepage as well as seepage cases can provide the phenomenon behind the bed material transport in a vegetated channel the calculations of length and time scales are described in devi and kumar 2016a b table 2 shows different integral time scale and length scale et and el vary between 0 151 0 941 s and 0 014 0 239 m for no seepage 0 171 1 187 s and 0 021 0 273 m for 10 seepage and 0 181 1 198 s and 0 029 0 293 m for 15 seepage in case of fully emerged vegetated channel devi et al 2017 the values of et and el vary between 0 435 and 0 730 s and 0 045 0 117 m for no seepage and between 0 9 and 1 094 s and 0 1 0 201 m for 10 seepage an increase in the values of et and el with seepage as compared to the no seepage is observed the results are in good agreement with devi et al 2017 this shows an increase in length and turnover time of large eddies with downward seepage subsequently momentum exchange and energy transfer increase leading to less destruction of turbulent motions occurring in the region closer to the bed leading to an increase in the levels of turbulence based on previous investigations it is found that vegetation placed in various arrangements can affect the flow and turbulence structure which have a direct impact on sediment transport and stream morphology neary et al 2012 according to nepf 2012 the scour patterns similar to that observed around piers occurred at the scale of individual stems while transition in bed forms from migrating dunes to a fixed pattern of scour associated with individual plants occurred in the unvegetated area most previous studies observe enhanced deposition in regions of vegetation with greater deposition observed in regions of higher stem density bos et al 2007 however some recent studies have also noted regions of erosion that develop at the edges of vegetation bouma et al 2007 rominger et al 2010 the redistribution of flow also produces spatial patterns in sediment transport condition with fine grain sediment and organic matter accumulating within patches where velocity is reduced and coarse grain sediment left between the patches where velocity is enhanced sand jensen and madsen 1992 the change in vegetation density influences the degree of sediment redistribution sharpe and james 2006 mudd et al 2010 lower vegetation density leads to sandification which is most likely attributed to occurrence of more turbulence within the sparse vegetation patch van katwijk et al 2010 if the stem density is sufficiently low so that the velocity within the patch remains high turbulence generation within the wakes of individual stems increases the turbulence levels within the vegetation region nepf 1999 and promotes erosion zong and nepf 2012 further chen et al 2012 observed that the deposition of fine material is limited to a region where both the mean and turbulent velocities are depressed it is recognized that some of the main factors that affect the flow are vegetation erosion and sediment processes zhang and dai 2009 aupoix 2015 a proper understanding regarding the sediment transport process is important for planning of river restoration projects the bed elevation along the longitudinal direction of the unvegetated zone was measured using a seatek 5 mhz ultrasonic ranging system urs that contains four transducers fixed to an automated trolley that moves on a rail at a uniform speed the resolution of the measuring system and the uncertainty in measurements are 0 1 and 0 2 mm respectively in the current experiments the variation in the bed profile along the longitudinal direction of the unvegetated zone has been recorded after the channel is about to reach a fully equilibrium state the observed bed elevation data have been processed by using surfer as shown in fig 10 a and b results drawn from different flow characteristics is attributed to the sediment transport i e erosion and deposition pattern that exists for a given flow condition the sediment transport pattern is studied for the unvegetated portion of the 5 m test section fig 10 a and the downstream region b the starting of the interface or junction of unvegetated and vegetated region is noted as y 0 and x axis shows the longitudinal length of the flume for the downstream section positive value of y shows the downstream of the unvegetated section while negative value of y shows the downstream of vegetated section it is observed that very weak erosion takes place at the interface section for x upto around 6 5 m for no seepage and 6 m for 10 seepage implying the existence of lower bed shear stress at b1 and b2 after this region of weak erosion more erosion starts taking place which is noted from the attainment of higher reynolds stress at b3 as compared to b1 and b2 for 15 seepage it is noted that near the interface section more erosion takes place because of an increase in reynolds stress close to the bed the whole process can be described as the deviation of lateral flow from the interface region towards the unvegetated region leading to occurrence of erosion in the unvegetated region on observing the unvegetated region it is seen that for no seepage highest erosion zone occurs at x 6 8 m this region of high erosion extends in such a way that at 15 seepage almost half of the transverse unvegetated section y 25 40 cm is dominated by high erosion downstream of the unvegetated section is dominated by erosion while deposition of sediment occurs at the downstream of the vegetated section this shows that vegetation helps in protecting the downstream of a channel however in natural conditions vegetation may occur partially and the present study observed that the partial occurrence of vegetation can also have a negative impact on the stability of the channel even though the channel is protected with the presence of vegetation in the vegetated section there is also need to consider the erosion that would be taking place at the unvegetated portion the present study provides a base for considering the flow characteristics in the unvegetated region and its change in sediment transport conditions thus for proper restoration project with the aid of vegetation there is a need for design engineers to study the erosion conditions taking place at the unvegetated region as it may lead to destabilization of river banks in case of partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2016a erosion is more on the half portion of the unvegetated section for no seepage while the other half portion has negligible or very weak 0 3 2 mm erosion at the upstream section x 9 5 6 5 m and erosion of 2 6 mm occurs at x 6 5 3 5 m and y 4 16 cm for 10 seepage highest erosion takes place in the region y 30 35 cm while for 15 seepage highest erosion regions occur in spots the highest sediment erosion takes place in the unvegetated region for both the partly submerged and partly emerged vegetated channel because lateral exchange of flow momentum takes place from vegetated region to unvegetated region as compared to quantity of erosion in partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2016a the quantity of erosion in present study that is in partly emerged vegetated channel is higher as more flow momentum is transferred from unvegetated to vegetated region therefore the design engineers must consider the placement of submerged vegetation in channels where erosion is less as compared to placement of emerged vegetation in channels 4 conclusions experimental investigations were carried out for investigating the flow features in a natural channel covered partially with emergent natural o sativa rice stems the effect of downwards seepage at the permeable natural channel was taken into account the spatial change in flow features in a partly vegetated channel was studied by measuring velocities at different sections of the flume the flow velocities at upstream and downstream which are free of vegetation lie close to each other increases within 5 however the reduction of flow velocity in the vegetation section and increase of flow velocity in the unvegetated region along the length of the flume signify that the velocity reduced in the vegetated region is transported towards the unvegetated region the decrease in the value of average velocities at vegetated section and interface section by 45 60 of the unvegetated region signifies that vegetation can be used as a mitigation measure against erosion an increase in the velocity closer to the bed is achieved by downward seepage for all the measurement locations than no seepage an interesting point is that for seepage cases vegetation resists the flow and hence velocity is reduced along the flow direction of vegetation zone at the centre portion of the test section the values of reynolds stress lie near zero implying the importance of vegetation in reducing the bed shear stress the occurrence of more reynolds stress at the downstream of interface section indicates more side flow and exchange of momentum in this region of interface consequently the downstream portion of unvegetated region has more reynolds stress and thus more sediment transport an important finding is that vegetation acts as a barrier for the vegetated section in reducing the maximum reynolds stress along the flow direction turbulent intensity for all the locations increases with seepage as compared to no seepage from moment analysis it shows that the negative values of m 03 and m 21 closer to the bed shows the occurrence of inrush flow and the flow coming towards the bed is again transported by the flow in the flow direction which is shown by the positive values of m 30 and m 12 quadrant analysis shows that sweep event plays a vital role in stress contribution with downward seepage which denotes higher momentum transfer and more reynolds stress a decrease in the value of drag coefficient is observed with downward seepage the integral time scale and length scale increase for seepage flow as compared to no seepage flow downward seepage increases the length and turnover time of large eddies and hence reynolds stress is increased the presence of vegetation forces the flow from the vegetation zone towards the unvegetated region leading to the occurrence of erosion in the unvegetated region the study of the change in the flow characteristics along the flow direction shows that the presence of emergent vegetation is effective in protecting the downstream region even with the presence of downward seepage which is an important finding for river restoration programme it can be concluded from the results of longitudinal profile that emergent vegetation reduces the flow velocity reynolds stress turbulence intensities which means that emergent vegetation can be used as an effective tool for erosion control the overall results of this study may enhance the comprehensive understanding of the vegetation effects on flow characteristics in partly emerged vegetated channel and may also provide some guidance for the practice of river ecological restoration on river bed or banks these changes in turbulent flow fields around patches of emergent vegetation are likely to be important in determining sediment budgets in their vicinity one of the main findings of this research is that vegetated region can significantly affect fluvial hydrodynamics by changing the mean and turbulent flow field and therefore sediment transport from the present results one will get knowledge about events of turbulent flow link with sediment transport in partly emergent vegetation sand bed channel since events of turbulent flow govern the morph dynamical changes by entraining and depositing the sediments conflict of

1137,the flow characteristic in a partly vegetated channel with emergent condition is studied by covering a finite length of the channel with natural oryza sativa rice stems with downward seepage spatial study of velocity profiles shows that vegetation reduces the flow velocity lengthways of vegetation zone even with the presence of downward seepage reynolds stress increases at the downstream end of the interface section because of higher velocity fluctuations between vegetated and un vegetated zone the increase in reynolds stress at the downstream of interface section is attributed to higher lateral flow and momentum exchange in this transition zone between vegetated and un vegetated area for the vegetated section vegetation serves as a barrier for the vegetated section in reducing the maximum reynolds stress in the range of 17 20 along the flow direction it is also observed that downward seepage increases the reynolds stress as well as turbulence intensities integral scales increase with increase in percentage of downward seepage resulting in higher reynolds stresses with downward seepage presented work will help in analyzing the changes in flow field with partially emergent vegetation in alluvial channel subjected to downward seepage the overall results of this study may enhance the comprehensive understanding of the vegetation effects on flow characteristics in partly emerged vegetated channel and may also provide some guidance for the practice of river ecological restoration on river bed or banks keywords fluvial hydrodynamics turbulence sediment vegetation

implications montakhab et al 2015 previous studies show that aquatic vegetation improves water quality schulz et al 2003 promotes habitat diversity crowder and diplas 2002 stabilizes the channel bed wang et al 2009 and increases bed material deposition lopez and garcia 1998 cotton et al 2006 gurnell et al 2006 therefore vegetation has been regarded as river system engineers jones et al 1994 gurnell 2014 several investigations for exploring the flow conditions in a vegetated channel are found in literature many researchers nepf and vivoni 2000 finnigan et al 2009 nepf 2012 conducted experiments based on the theory of turbulence and stated that the turbulence is greatly related to vegetation characteristics nezu and onitsuka 2001 conducted the experiments on a partly vegetated channel and observed that horizontal vortices close to water surface are created by the inflection shear instability and that turbulence close the water surface is exchanged laterally from the non vegetated region to vegetated region by secondary currents wilson et al 2003 investigated turbulence characteristics between two various types of submerged vegetation and observed that the extra superficial zone of the fronds influence the momentum exchange between the vegetated zone and the upper flow zone thus decreasing the shear induced turbulence järvelä 2005 observed a change in the universal logarithmic velocity profile for vegetated flow and the maximum value of shear stress occurring approximately at the top of the vegetation is used for expressing darcy weisbach s friction factor the presence of emergent vegetation in a channel influences the conveyance capacity of the channel james and makoa 2006 jordanova et al 2006 the type of occurrence and distribution of vegetation affect the flow resistance characteristics even if it occupies a small part of the channel and it influences the flow characteristics in the clear water region for a partly vegetated channel james and makoa 2006 chen et al 2011 investigated the turbulence characteristics of submerged flexible vegetation with various patterns and various longitudinal and transverse spacing the fully flow zone is categorized into three zones upper non vegetated zone middle vegetated zone and lower sheath zone the flow characteristics will be changed at the sheath zone and at the top of the plant clump where the flow is deaccelerated by plant siniscalchi et al 2012 showed that a strong shear layer formed at the top of the vegetation patch increases the vertical turbulent transport kubrak et al 2012 investigated the impact of stem deflections on the vertical distributions of flow velocities they presented the methods of computing the deflections of flexible vegetation elements under the dynamic pressure of water and observed that the differences in heights of the submerged parts of the stem did not influence the computed velocity distributions significantly in another study by montakhab et al 2015 it was found that distribution of patchy vegetation is vital for investigating hydraulic characteristics not only vegetation will cause a change in flow characteristics the bed condition also plays an important role natural channels rivers and streams have beds formed by earthen permeable materials and experience seepage flow through boundaries because of the difference between water levels in the channel and the adjoining ground water levels seepage flow through a channel can be observed in two forms suction and injection if the free water surface in the channel is higher than the adjoining ground water level seepage flow occurs through a channel bed and is called suction or downward seepage while injection or upward seepage occurs when water surface in the channel is lower than the adjoining ground water level and seepage flow occurs into the channel previous studies show that downward seepage flow can affect the hydrodynamic behaviour of the channel flow as well as its sediment transport conditions rao and sitaram 1999 rao et al 2011 cao and chiew 2014 deshpande and kumar 2015 patel et al 2015 the application of downward seepage to stable alluvial channel minimal occurrence of erosion and deposition of sediments increases the sediment transport because of the increase in bed shear stress rao et al 2011 the threshold for motion of bed materials is employed in the design of stable channels the investigation of flow structure in seepage affected vegetated alluvial channel can provide solution of important engineering problems recently devi and kumar 2015 studied the effect of downward seepage on the turbulent flow parameters in a vegetated channel by using artificial rubber cylinders and concluded that turbulent flow parameters increase with downward seepage as compared to no seepage devi and kumar 2016a also investigated the flow characteristics in a channel partially covered with submerged vegetation devi and kumar 2016b studied the change in flow characteristics of alluvial channel occupied by submerged vegetated patches of different spacing under downward seepage condition devi and kumar 2016c analyzed the impact of the presence of submerged flexible vegetation in a seepage affected alluvial channel with two patterns staggered and uniform and two different vegetation spacing devi et al 2016a studied the drag owing to the presence of vegetation and turbulent characteristics in a mobile bed channel characterized by fully submerged vegetation formed by non uniform vegetation densities devi et al 2016b carried out the experiments to compare the flow characteristics with and without the presence of flexible vegetation in a channel devi et al 2017 used the experimental observations in a tilting

covered with fully submerged oryza sativa considering downward seepage the flow measurements taken at the upstream free vegetation zone centre of the vegetation zone and downstream free vegetation zone will provide a better understanding regarding the flow hydrodynamics in a vegetated channel experiments on alluvial channels proved that seepage occurs because of the porosity of the soil and difference in the water level in the channel and ground water table the presence of seepage on such channels has also been studied and found that the presence of downward seepage increases the sediment transport rate when vegetation grows on such downward seepage affected channels it will not be a wiser option to neglect the effect of downward seepage previous studies on emergent vegetation studied the flow characteristics without considering the bed condition or seepage parameter in the present study the novelty lies in studying the effect of downward seepage and comparing the flow characteristics of no seepage with seepage case additionally two different seepage percentages have been applied and checked the change in flow characteristics with increase in seepage percentage numerous results have been obtained on defining the spatial flow characteristics in a vegetated river and thus there is a need to understand the spatial flow characteristics in a partially vegetated river considering downward seepage aquatic vegetation in a natural river can be occurred partially of finite length as it is known that such partial cover of aquatic vegetation in a natural river can be occurred for emergent vegetation and thus there is a need to comprehend the longitudinal change in flow characteristics in a seepage affected channel covered partly with emergent vegetation thus the main aim of the present study is to understand the changes in turbulent flow structures in a stable channel covered partly with emergent vegetation without seepage and after the application of downward seepage the underlying process behind sediment transport with downward seepage in partly covered vegetated channels is also presented the overall results of this study may enhance the comprehensive understanding of the vegetation effects on flow characteristics in partly emerged vegetated channel and may also provide some guidance for the practice of river ecological restoration on river bed or banks 2 experimental set up all the experiments were conducted in a tilting flume of 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 72 m deep fig 1 a a tank of dimensions 2 8 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m deep was provided at the upstream of the flume to straighten the flow prior to its introduction in to the flume two metres of upstream length of the main channel bed was made non porous and the remaining length of the channel was made porous by covering a fine mesh 0 1 mm this mesh arrangement was supported by steel tube structure of 0 22 m height which was placed on the bottom of the bed bottom pressure chamber 15 20 m in length 1 m wide and 0 22 m deep were formed by the area between the bottom of the channel and the fine mesh sand was placed on the fine mesh in order to prevent its entrance into the bottom chamber this pressure chamber was used to remove the water from the main channel through the sand bed in perpendicular direction in the form of downward seepage in order to prevent highly turbulent flow from entering the channel a wooden baffle was installed at the upstream collection tank and the main channel has been smoothened for a length of 2 m at upstream the bed slope was fixed at 0 15 which was kept fixed for all the experiments the flow in the flume was driven by three 10 hp centrifugal pump the discharge in the flume was measured with the help of a rectangular notch located at the downstream of the flume the water depth in the flume was measured with a digital point gauge two electromagnetic flow meters installed at the downstream of the flume have a control valve and a digital display which was used for applying desired percentage of seepage discharge fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup the flow depth h at incipient motion condition was fixed at 12 cm when measured at the centre of the test section and discharge qi was found as 0 0326 m3 s 1 vegetation stems were placed in a section of 5 m long and 0 5 m wide in the middle of the flume fig 1b experiments were conducted for emergent condition natural rice stems o sativa were placed in a staggered pattern at 10 cm centre centre fig 2 present work falls under the category of bending plants of high flexural rigidity nikora 2010 it can be representative of the flexible and emergent plants often found on riverbanks and drainage channels a bundle comprising of three to four rice stems were used for imitating a vegetation stem of average diameter 10 mm different flow characteristics were presented by taking measurements at the vegetated section interface of the vegetated zone and unvegetated zone and unvegetated section fig 1b shows 11 measurement locations for studying the spatial flow conditions free upstream upstream centre and downstream of vegetated zone a1 a2 and a3 interface section b1 b2 and b3 and unvegetated section c1 c2 and c3 and free downstream the flow coming in the channel was permitted to stabilize for about one hour before taking any measurements after placing the vegetation model in the flume post processing of raw velocity data is done in a similar manner as explained in devi et al 2016a b instantaneous velocity measurements were taken with the help of nortek 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv a sampling rate of 200 hz was used for data collection the duration of data acquisition was chosen as 5 min consequently after conducting the experiment with vegetation at no seepage condition different seepage percentages 10 and 15 of the discharge at incipient motion were applied by controlling the valve of electromagnetic flow meters in all the experiments snr was kept at 15 or above and the signal correlation between transmitted and received signals of 70 is recommended as cut off value the velocity data measured by the adv include spikes because of interference between transmitted and received signals these data are needed to be post processed or filtered acceleration thresholding method goring and nikora 2002 is used for removing the spikes in the velocity data threshold values 1 1 5 were selected by trial and error in such a way that the velocity power spectra in the inertial subrange yielded a satisfactory fit with kolmogorov 5 3 scaling law the uncertainty of vectrino data was determined by collecting 16 pulses samples at the centre of the test section at a location of 4 mm over the beds in table 1 u v and w are the time averaged velocities in stream wise span wise and vertical direction while u v and w are velocity fluctuations in stream wise span wise and vertical direction respectively u u 0 5 v v 0 5 and w w 0 5 are the root mean square rms of u v and w respectively time averaged stream wise u and vertical w velocities were calculated as 1 u 1 n i 1 n u i w 1 n i 1 n w

i w 2 n the study of flow characteristics around the vegetation provided above requires provision of drag coefficient as it is one of the important parameters for defining vegetation characteristics the measurement of drag force with the presence of vegetation stems directly is a difficult task using appropriate devices therefore it is calculated from the horizontally averaged momentum equation dunn et al 1996 nepf and vivoni 2000 nezu and sanjou 2008 the momentum equation for steady and uniform 2d open channel flow with homogenous vegetation stems is given below 4 y u w u w υ u y g i e f f x f v x where ie is the energy gradient u w is the dispersive stress term f vx is the viscous drag force and f fx is the form drag force ie can be calculated from 5 u g i e h h v where u is the shear velocity the viscous drag and dispersive stress are assumed to be negligibly small as compared to stem drag and hence after neglecting these terms eq 4 becomes 6 y u w u 2 1 h f f x u 2 the form drag is given by 7 f f x 1 2 c d a u 2 where a is the projected plant area per unit volume and is a constant for a particular vegetation density now the final equation for cd calculation is 8 y u w u 2 1 2 c d a u u 2 1 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 time averaged velocity the flow velocity variations at different measurement locations will provide an insight to the influence of vegetation in a channel the flow velocities at a section and b section remain about the same except that a rise in the near bed velocity for b3 is observed fig 3 the flow velocities measured at the downstream and upstream locations where there is no vegetation lie close to each other within 5 it is noted that the velocity in the vegetated region decreases and increases in the un vegetated region as the flow goes downstream this clearly indicates that the velocity reduced in the vegetation zone is diverted towards the un vegetated zone the time averaged flow velocities of the vegetated zone are 45 60 lowers than the corresponding velocities in the un vegetated zone a section and b section have 0 2023 m s 1 for no seepage 0 2135 m s 1 for 10 seepage and 0 2179 m s 1 for 15 seepage this shows that vegetation can effectively reduce the flow velocities which confirmed the previous work devi and kumar 2016b in the investigation of flow characteristic in a fully vegetated channel with emergent vegetation devi et al 2017 it can be seen that overall the presence of vegetation retards the velocity profiles with regard to the upstream free zone for all the measurement locations a higher velocity zone exists in the lower flow region as observed by cao and chiew 2014 fig 3 the lower flow region has a higher velocity zone for all the locations fig 3 the velocity increases by a value of 11 and 15 average with 10 and 15 seepage respectively as compared to no seepage for a constant discharge the presence of the seepage reduces the flow depth in the channel which suggests that velocity increased in the presence of seepage previous investigations into the application of downward seepage have shown that the velocity profile moves downward and hence a higher velocity is achieved in the near bed region cao and chiew 2014 with the application of seepage the flow velocity is higher than in the no seepage case because of the shifting of the higher velocity zone near the bed devi et al 2017 the flow velocities at a1 and a2 are higher than a3 for both no seepage as well as seepage cases which mean that even with downward seepage vegetation can resist the flow and reduces the velocity in contrast to a section the flow at the downstream of unvegetated section c 3 is always higher than c 2 and c 3 3 2 reynolds stress the distribution of reynolds stress is used in estimating the shear velocity which evaluates the bed resistance to the flow the vertical profile of reynolds stresses gives information on the momentum diffusion mechanism the variation of water flow in a partly vegetated channel made it complex to describe the reynolds shear stress distribution zhang et al 2015 the maximum value of reynolds stress for all the measurement locations lies near the bed except for a2 and b2 the profiles of a2 and b2 show that the values of reynolds stress lie near zero which implies that the presence of emergent vegetation reduces the bed shear stress and restricts the transport of bed material the occurrence of maximum reynolds stress close to the bed means that the main source of turbulence production is the channel bed in the fully emerged vegetated conditions devi et al 2017 the position of maximum stress is no longer at the channel bed and the bed is no longer the primary source of turbulence generation in vegetated flow rather it is now dominated by turbulence generated by the vegetation stems in case of partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2017 the occurrence of maximum value of reynolds stress close to the bed for upstream free vegetation zone shows that main turbulence production comes from the channel bed while it is not the same for vegetation zone a shear layer is formed because of the momentum exchange close to the top of the vegetation the reynolds shear stress at a1 is greater than at a2 and a3 which implies that the presence of vegetation resists the flow as it goes downstream the value of highest reynolds stress at b1 and b2 are almost comparable to the value at a1 and a2 at b3 reynolds stress is significantly increased at b3 where vegetation ends this means that bed shear stress is higher at the interface region where vegetation ends and consequently higher sediment transport is observed at the interface region comparing all the measurement locations the maximum reynolds stress for c2 and c3 are higher which leads to achievement of higher bed shear stress and higher bed material transport additionally even the free downstream zone has a higher reynolds stress than free upstream zone the whole process can be briefly described as the deviation of flow from the vegetated zone to the unvegetated zone causing more bed shear stress and bed material transport in the un vegetated region hence for a partly vegetated channel the decreased reynolds stress in the vegetated zone leads to attainment of more reynolds stress in the unvegetated region the reduction in reynolds stress in the vegetated zone along the flow direction would induce sediment deposition and increase in reynolds stress along the longitudinal direction in the unvegetated region may lead to destabilization of the unvegetated region the presence of vegetation in an open channel can significantly affect the hydrodynamic behavior of the flow and consequently sediment transport by obstructing the flow and changing the flow characteristics this result is confirmed with devi and kumar 2017 advances in understanding the behavior of flow over vegetation allow design engineers to improve both the knowledge of flow velocity profiles and flow resistance and the design of vegetated channels therefore design engineers must visualize these morphological adjustments and ecological impact different profiles of reynolds stress for no seepage as well as seepage cases at different measurement locations are shown in fig 4 the increase in shear stress with increase in seepage percentage is observed in all the vertical reynolds stress profiles the maximum reynolds stress increased to a range of 12 20 and 20 28 from no seepage to 10 seepage and 15 seepage respectively which shows that application of downward seepage promotes the bed material transport while in case of partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2017 downward seepage increases the maximum reynolds stress at no seepage by a percentage increase of 19 average for 10 seepage and 38 average for 15 seepage the value of reynolds stress at the downstream of the vegetated region a3 is less range of 17 20 than at the centre of the vegetated region a2 for both the seepage cases this means that vegetation can help in damping the reynolds stress and subsequently sediment transport at the downstream even with downward seepage 3 3 turbulent intensity the generation of turbulent intensity occurs from the variation of instantaneous velocity affected by vegetation and bed roughness turbulent intensity in longitudinal and vertical directions is denoted by σu and σw σu and σw are shown in figs 5 and 6 there is no significant change in the turbulent intensity at free upstream a1 b1 and c1 i e all values lie close to each other within 9 the turbulent intensity at a2 and b2 are lower as compared to free upstream a1 and b1 which means that the turbulent intensity is suppressed by the emergent vegetation at a3 a slight increase in turbulence intensity is noted but not larger than the free upstream an increase in turbulent intensity near the bed for b3 c2 and c3 is noted even more than the free upstream zone the increase in lateral flow and momentum exchange at the interface between vegetated and unvegetated area leads to occurrence of more turbulent fluctuations and more sediment transport zong and nepf 2010 observing the free downstream region it can be noted that maximum turbulent intensity occurs near the water surface this might be because of the reason that the flexible vegetation bends as flow occurs creating more fluctuations near the water surface at the free downstream in case of fully emerged vegetated channel devi et al 2017 the maximum turbulent intensity occurs at the starting portion of the vegetation zone and then decreases at the end of the vegetation zone implying that the turbulence production is reduced because of the presence of vegetation in case of submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2017 the centre and downstream of the vegetation zone have a maximum value of turbulent intensity near the top of the vegetation while the upstream free vegetation zone achieves a maximum value close to the bed the increase in reynolds stress and bed shear stress with the increase in seepage percentage leads to more shearing of flow thereby resulting in more turbulence intensity turbulence intensity for both the seepage cases 10 and 15 at all the locations increase by a value of 20 average as compared to no seepage case 3 4 moments the third order moment is defined by m j k u ˆ j w ˆ k where j k 3 u ˆ u u u 0 5 and w ˆ w w w 0 5 devi and kumar 2016a m 30 u ˆ 3 also known as the skewness of u is the streamwise flux of the streamwise reynolds stress while the skewness of w m 03 w ˆ 3 is the vertical flux of the vertical reynolds stress m 12 u ˆ 1 w ˆ 2 and m21 u ˆ 2 w ˆ 1 are the diffusion terms defining the diffusions of w w in x co ordinate streamwise or longitudinal direction and u u in z co ordinate vertical direction respectively third order moments m 30 m 03 m 12 and m 21 at a2 b2 and c2 are presented in fig 7 m 30 has small positive values and m 03 has small negative values close to the bed for the case of no seepage this implies that longitudinal flux of turbulent kinetic energy occurs in the flow direction and vertical flux of turbulent kinetic energy is in downward direction the magnitude of m 30 and m 12 increases near the bed by 2 5 for the seepage cases compared to the no seepage case this means an increase in streamwise flux of turbulent kinetic energy in streamwise direction and increase in diffusion of vertical flux of turbulent kinetic energy in streamwise direction leading to more sediment transport in seepage case for m 03 and m 21 the downward seepage increases the negative values of m 03 and m 21 by 2 5 which is in conformity with the occurrence of downward flow because of downward seepage this increase in the negative values of m 03 and m 21 suggests an increase in the vertical transport of vertical flux and increase in diffusion of longitudinal flux in vertical downward direction devi and kumar 2016c 3 5 quadrant analysis the mass and momentum exchange can be conferred through the identification of organized coherent structures it shows the impact of velocity fluctuations to reynolds stress at a point a u w plane is considered for sorting the instantaneous velocity components u and w lu and willmarth 1973 the plane is comprised of four quadrants each quadrant representing one event each as outward interaction q1 ejection q2 inward interaction q3 and sweep q4 the calculation of quadrant analysis is already discussed in raupach 1981 fractional contribution of reynolds stress for a2 b2 and c2 plotted along flow depth are shown in fig 8 the contribution of sweep and ejection events towards reynolds stress is more than inward and outward interactions for all the cases the contribution of ejection and sweep at a2 lies in close approximation at b2 ejection and sweep events have equal contribution for no seepage and 10 seepage but the dominance of sweep in the whole flow region is observed at 15 seepage this implies that downward seepage results in the increase of sweep event compared to ejection event resulting in higher bed material transport at c2 location the whole flow region above z h 0 3 is dominated by ejection for no seepage case but with the presence of downward seepage sweep event starts contributing to the flow this dominance of sweep events over ejection denotes an increase in momentum transfer and achievement of more reynolds stress sharma and kumar 2017 these increased contributions from sweep events in the seepage run increase momentum exchange from the flow to bed particles due to which sediment transport is increased with the application of downward seepage as compared to no seepage hence for downward seepage sweep is the major events in the near bed flow zone with the application of downward seepage the high speed fluid parcel becomes more persistently preserving near to the bed as compare to that with no seepage 3 6 drag coefficient the calculation of drag coefficient in vegetated flows is vital for understanding the flow structures which helps in defining vegetation characteristics the drag force with the presence of vegetation stems cannot be measured directly using devices the horizontally averaged momentum equation is used for drag coefficient calculation and the derivation is discussed by nezu and sanjou 2008 the values of cd for both no seepage and seepage cases are calculated and shown in fig 9 for flexible vegetation the drag coefficient is a depth dependent because of the variation in rigidity and thickness along the plant length the observed value of cd closer to the bed for no seepage lie near 3 which conforms to the range of cd 0 1 3 found by previous studies nepf and vivoni 2000 the increase in the values of cd with decrease in flow depth highlights the importance of viscous effects near the bed nepf and vivoni 2000 the change in the value of cd with downward seepage is observed the values of drag coefficients are 0 955 0 883 and 0 818 for no seepage 10 seepage and 15 seepage respectively this shows a decrease in the value of cd with downward seepage thereby implying the reduction in resistance or roughness offered by the vegetation with downward seepage 3 7 scales of flow the coherent structures present in a turbulent flow are formed because of sweep event which can induce the formation of bed features gyr and schmid 1989 time and length scales for no seepage as well as seepage cases can provide the phenomenon behind the bed material transport in a vegetated channel the calculations of length and time scales are described in devi and kumar 2016a b table 2 shows different integral time scale and length scale et and el vary between 0 151 0 941 s and 0 014 0 239 m for no seepage 0 171 1 187 s and 0 021 0 273 m for 10 seepage and 0 181 1 198 s and 0 029 0 293 m for 15 seepage in case of fully emerged vegetated channel devi et al 2017 the values of et and el vary between 0 435 and 0 730 s and 0 045 0 117 m for no seepage and between 0 9 and 1 094 s and 0 1 0 201 m for 10 seepage an increase in the values of et and el with seepage as compared to the no seepage is observed the results are in good agreement with devi et al 2017 this shows an increase in length and turnover time of large eddies with downward seepage subsequently momentum exchange and energy transfer increase leading to less destruction of turbulent motions occurring in the region closer to the bed leading to an increase in the levels of turbulence based on previous investigations it is found that vegetation placed in various arrangements can affect the flow and turbulence structure which have a direct impact on sediment transport and stream morphology neary et al 2012 according to nepf 2012 the scour patterns similar to that observed around piers occurred at the scale of individual stems while transition in bed forms from migrating dunes to a fixed pattern of scour associated with individual plants occurred in the unvegetated area most previous studies observe enhanced deposition in regions of vegetation with greater deposition observed in regions of higher stem density bos et al 2007 however some recent studies have also noted regions of erosion that develop at the edges of vegetation bouma et al 2007 rominger et al 2010 the redistribution of flow also produces spatial patterns in sediment transport condition with fine grain sediment and organic matter accumulating within patches where velocity is reduced and coarse grain sediment left between the patches where velocity is enhanced sand jensen and madsen 1992 the change in vegetation density influences the degree of sediment redistribution sharpe and james 2006 mudd et al 2010 lower vegetation density leads to sandification which is most likely attributed to occurrence of more turbulence within the sparse vegetation patch van katwijk et al 2010 if the stem density is sufficiently low so that the velocity within the patch remains high turbulence generation within the wakes of individual stems increases the turbulence levels within the vegetation region nepf 1999 and promotes erosion zong and nepf 2012 further chen et al 2012 observed that the deposition of fine material is limited to a region where both the mean and turbulent velocities are depressed it is recognized that some of the main factors that affect the flow are vegetation erosion and sediment processes zhang and dai 2009 aupoix 2015 a proper understanding regarding the sediment transport process is important for planning of river restoration projects the bed elevation along the longitudinal direction of the unvegetated zone was measured using a seatek 5 mhz ultrasonic ranging system urs that contains four transducers fixed to an automated trolley that moves on a rail at a uniform speed the resolution of the measuring system and the uncertainty in measurements are 0 1 and 0 2 mm respectively in the current experiments the variation in the bed profile along the longitudinal direction of the unvegetated zone has been recorded after the channel is about to reach a fully equilibrium state the observed bed elevation data have been processed by using surfer as shown in fig 10 a and b results drawn from different flow characteristics is attributed to the sediment transport i e erosion and deposition pattern that exists for a given flow condition the sediment transport pattern is studied for the unvegetated portion of the 5 m test section fig 10 a and the downstream region b the starting of the interface or junction of unvegetated and vegetated region is noted as y 0 and x axis shows the longitudinal length of the flume for the downstream section positive value of y shows the downstream of the unvegetated section while negative value of y shows the downstream of vegetated section it is observed that very weak erosion takes place at the interface section for x upto around 6 5 m for no seepage and 6 m for 10 seepage implying the existence of lower bed shear stress at b1 and b2 after this region of weak erosion more erosion starts taking place which is noted from the attainment of higher reynolds stress at b3 as compared to b1 and b2 for 15 seepage it is noted that near the interface section more erosion takes place because of an increase in reynolds stress close to the bed the whole process can be described as the deviation of lateral flow from the interface region towards the unvegetated region leading to occurrence of erosion in the unvegetated region on observing the unvegetated region it is seen that for no seepage highest erosion zone occurs at x 6 8 m this region of high erosion extends in such a way that at 15 seepage almost half of the transverse unvegetated section y 25 40 cm is dominated by high erosion downstream of the unvegetated section is dominated by erosion while deposition of sediment occurs at the downstream of the vegetated section this shows that vegetation helps in protecting the downstream of a channel however in natural conditions vegetation may occur partially and the present study observed that the partial occurrence of vegetation can also have a negative impact on the stability of the channel even though the channel is protected with the presence of vegetation in the vegetated section there is also need to consider the erosion that would be taking place at the unvegetated portion the present study provides a base for considering the flow characteristics in the unvegetated region and its change in sediment transport conditions thus for proper restoration project with the aid of vegetation there is a need for design engineers to study the erosion conditions taking place at the unvegetated region as it may lead to destabilization of river banks in case of partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2016a erosion is more on the half portion of the unvegetated section for no seepage while the other half portion has negligible or very weak 0 3 2 mm erosion at the upstream section x 9 5 6 5 m and erosion of 2 6 mm occurs at x 6 5 3 5 m and y 4 16 cm for 10 seepage highest erosion takes place in the region y 30 35 cm while for 15 seepage highest erosion regions occur in spots the highest sediment erosion takes place in the unvegetated region for both the partly submerged and partly emerged vegetated channel because lateral exchange of flow momentum takes place from vegetated region to unvegetated region as compared to quantity of erosion in partly submerged vegetated channel devi and kumar 2016a the quantity of erosion in present study that is in partly emerged vegetated channel is higher as more flow momentum is transferred from unvegetated to vegetated region therefore the design engineers must consider the placement of submerged vegetation in channels where erosion is less as compared to placement of emerged vegetation in channels 4 conclusions experimental investigations were carried out for investigating the flow features in a natural channel covered partially with emergent natural o sativa rice stems the effect of downwards seepage at the permeable natural channel was taken into account the spatial change in flow features in a partly vegetated channel was studied by measuring velocities at different sections of the flume the flow velocities at upstream and downstream which are free of vegetation lie close to each other increases within 5 however the reduction of flow velocity in the vegetation section and increase of flow velocity in the unvegetated region along the length of the flume signify that the velocity reduced in the vegetated region is transported towards the unvegetated region the decrease in the value of average velocities at vegetated section and interface section by 45 60 of the unvegetated region signifies that vegetation can be used as a mitigation measure against erosion an increase in the velocity closer to the bed is achieved by downward seepage for all the measurement locations than no seepage an interesting point is that for seepage cases vegetation resists the flow and hence velocity is reduced along the flow direction of vegetation zone at the centre portion of the test section the values of reynolds stress lie near zero implying the importance of vegetation in reducing the bed shear stress the occurrence of more reynolds stress at the downstream of interface section indicates more side flow and exchange of momentum in this region of interface consequently the downstream portion of unvegetated region has more reynolds stress and thus more sediment transport an important finding is that vegetation acts as a barrier for the vegetated section in reducing the maximum reynolds stress along the flow direction turbulent intensity for all the locations increases with seepage as compared to no seepage from moment analysis it shows that the negative values of m 03 and m 21 closer to the bed shows the occurrence of inrush flow and the flow coming towards the bed is again transported by the flow in the flow direction which is shown by the positive values of m 30 and m 12 quadrant analysis shows that sweep event plays a vital role in stress contribution with downward seepage which denotes higher momentum transfer and more reynolds stress a decrease in the value of drag coefficient is observed with downward seepage the integral time scale and length scale increase for seepage flow as compared to no seepage flow downward seepage increases the length and turnover time of large eddies and hence reynolds stress is increased the presence of vegetation forces the flow from the vegetation zone towards the unvegetated region leading to the occurrence of erosion in the unvegetated region the study of the change in the flow characteristics along the flow direction shows that the presence of emergent vegetation is effective in protecting the downstream region even with the presence of downward seepage which is an important finding for river restoration programme it can be concluded from the results of longitudinal profile that emergent vegetation reduces the flow velocity reynolds stress turbulence intensities which means that emergent vegetation can be used as an effective tool for erosion control the overall results of this study may enhance the comprehensive understanding of the vegetation effects on flow characteristics in partly emerged vegetated channel and may also provide some guidance for the practice of river ecological restoration on river bed or banks these changes in turbulent flow fields around patches of emergent vegetation are likely to be important in determining sediment budgets in their vicinity one of the main findings of this research is that vegetated region can significantly affect fluvial hydrodynamics by changing the mean and turbulent flow field and therefore sediment transport from the present results one will get knowledge about events of turbulent flow link with sediment transport in partly emergent vegetation sand bed channel since events of turbulent flow govern the morph dynamical changes by entraining and depositing the sediments conflict of

1138,a comparative analysis of five environmental flow assessment methods was performed on the example of the yaselda river in its selets section the significant difference in their results was revealed the threshold methods provide a uniform environmental flow values along the year the values vary among the methods it is explained that the methods were developed in different economic and social conditions practically identical results were obtained with the methods used in belarus and ukraine however the other method would assume the environmental flow value above the natural flow in some periods of the year the method of exceedance probability transfer appears to be the most promising one partial zoning of probability transfer parameters would make the method more efficient for management purposes it is proposed to introduce yearly adjustments of environmental flow rates taking into account the discharges of previous years this would allow to re water floodplains overdried in dry years and recover habitats for biota keywords environmental flow evaluation methods exceedance probability 1 introduction water withdrawal from the surface sources rivers and flow through reservoirs in the republic of belarus is more than 40 of the total water consumption surface water is mainly used for the industrial water supply fish and pond farming as well as for irrigation as the country is working out a new nature protection strategy it is necessary to estimate in detail a maximal load imposed on water flow it should be noted that global climatic changes worsen the situation a river is a natural object whose geo system forms for a long time an optimal ratio of number and diversity of biological species forms during that time that is why any alterations in yearly flow can cause changes in biodiversity the maximal volume of water withdrawal is usually calculated considering environmental flow as a basis methods of environmental flow assessment started to develop quite long ago the first methods to evaluate a minimal flow appeared in the 1940s in the usa they aimed at determining minimal flow to provide conditions for ichthyofauna as the influence of damming straightening and flow regulation on biocenoses has increased considerably over 200 methods of flow assessment have been developed so far arthington et al 2006 dyson et al 2003 and tharme 2003 classify all of them into four groups purely hydrological methods methods of hydraulic assessment hydro biological methods and complex methods it is worth pointing out the advanced research done by smakhtin et al 2004 to assess environmental flow for 128 world s biggest rivers it applies watergap2 model to evaluate environmental flow this model makes it possible to calculate the whole reserve of renewable water resources with the use of equation of water energy balance smakhtin et al 2004 define environmental flow here as 20 50 of total reserve of the area in renewable water resources however such simplified methods can cause significant environmental threats because 50 water withdrawal results in deterioration of the watershed geosystem besides arthington et al 2006 in their research present a detailed review of approaches to environmental flow assessment applied in the world today the authors analyze both their advantages and drawbacks one of the advantages is that the method can be applied even if there are no observations showing the relation of flow rate to biological environmental state of the river and the area around the research offers to group rivers according to the shape of probability density function but the groups include both modified and non modified streams from our point of view it is more correct to do the grouping only after statistical restoration of the natural flow is performed moreover this method does not make it possible to estimate environmental flow rate for various exceedance probabilities it appears important as most engineering and management tasks must be based on exeedance probability values let us consider different demands to environmental flow raised by geo ecology and hydro biology environmental flow is a minimal river flow that can be constant or variable within a year as markin 2005a b describes ecologically sustainable flow must meet the following requirement a flow rate appropriate for sustainable development of hydrobionts according to vladimirov and imamov 1994 and tkachev and bulanov 2002 an appropriate flow rate can be achieved by keeping flow velocity within 0 25 0 6m s 0 25m s is the lowest velocity which makes the development of phytoplankton possible with the flow depth not less than 0 1 0 3m according to byelorussian soviet encyclopedia 1975 the minimal depth corresponds to winter and summer low water periods however deterioration of fish fauna occurs at average rate of ice formation from 17 45cm in the south to 29 64cm in the north and north west fulfillment of natural functions by a river in their research shokoohi and amini 2014 and xuhong et al 2015 explain how a river network transports substances and energy thus rearranging them in time and space intra annual flow variability according to suen and eheart 2006 variability of a flow during a year keeps the natural development cycles of various biological species inter annual flow variability taichi 2013 says that inter annual variability as same as intra annual one makes it possible to enrich the floodplain of a watercourse with nutrients at the same time floods destroy hydrophobic plants inhabiting the floodplain during a low water period in xx century the period of dynamic industrial development experts started to use a term minimal flow however it was mainly oriented toward man s needs for water resources besides the minimal amount of water flowing into a tail bay was related to the number of downstream water users murphy et al 2012 prove that from a modern point of view such preconditions for the estimation of minimal flow are unacceptable 2 material and methods there are various methods to estimate environmental flow which markin 2005a b and knight et al 2011 conventionally arrange into four groups we will consider them separately 2 1 method of lower discharge as vladimirov and imamov 1994 show in their paper the extent of a minimal environmental flow is assumed as equal to the minimal average monthly flow at 95 of exceedance probability besides ladynina 1986 specifies that the volume of an environmental flow depends on variations of an annual river flow with substantial variability of annual flow the absolute value of environmental flow can reach the value of a minimal annual flow environmental flow is determined as a percentage of the calculated value given in table 1 according to tkachev and bulanov 2002 in the republic of belarus environmental flow rate is assumed as 75 of the minimal average monthly flow at 95 of exceedance probability 1 q e n v k q min m o n t h where k is a proportionality coefficient that depends on a river class and its long term average annual flow table 2 according to markin 2005a b in switzerland environmental flow is regulated by the size of catchment area particularly by the minimal environmental flow module 2 q e n v a q e n v where q env is the minimal flow module which is assumed as equal to 10 3 m3 s per km2 a is the catchment area km2 this approach does not fully comply with the above stated requirements as it does not provide intra annual flow variability it does not take into account long term cycles of water inflow and in most cases the minimal rate of the flow cannot be achieved 2 2 method of field studies this method is based on doing field or laboratory studies the method is most frequently used for environmentally relevant objects this method can be hard to implement because it involves significant costs and long term uninterrupted monitoring today autonomous hydrological monitoring stations have gained wide popularity they accumulate all the necessary data for reliable environmental flow assessment but the problem of the evaluation of maximal anthropogenic load the volume of wastewater discharges the chemical content of wastewater and discharge regime still remains because if it is over limits geocenoses start to deteriorate what is more maximal environmentally grounded characteristics of the watercourse would be different in each case thus from the fisheries viewpoint the key factor is the amount of oxygen dissolved in water but geological and mineralogical conditions can significantly affect the amount of oxygen too a similar method of environmental flow assessment is presented by european commission 2015 in details this document describes main approaches to estimate environmental flows and gives a list of methods applied in european states if there are data from observations over the state of ecosystems in a catchment area minimal flow is estimated quite reasonably but if there is a shortage of monitoring data environmental flow is considered by most european countries as constant during the year it contradicts to both the requirements defined by european commission 2015 and the introduction to this paper in addition it should be noted that both arthington et al 2006 and european commission 2015 do not define approaches to environmental flow assessment with different exceedance probabilities as an example of the method of field application two papers can be cited walega et al 2015 and piniewski et al 2011 the main concept of these manuscripts is conditions of the development of the ichthyofauna of rivers as criterion for assessing minimal flow this approach also does not give a probabilistic estimate of environmental flow 2 3 method of increasing exceedance probability the method described by faschevsky 1989 1993 involves determining lower and upper limits of flow change the idea of the method is to set up a lower limit of environmentally sustainable flow at the level of monthly discharge for a year of 99 exceedance probability as this condition is ultimate in terms of natural resources in most cases with over 90 exceedance probability a plain flooding is not observed on belarusian rivers and even if flooding does occur it has local nature caused by the local topography the upper limit is the discharge of 50 exceedance probability such conditions allow a normal regime of substance energy exchange to form in river floodplain geosystems the highest efficiency of river and plain ecosystems is observed at 40 60 exceedance probability as markin 2005a b shows the parameters determination of the density function of the environmental flow is based on the transfer of average annual flow exceedance probability to the predetermined exceedance probability of environmental flow it is supposed that environmental flow of 95 exceedance probability corresponds to average annual environmental flow of 90 exceedance probability while environmental flow of 25 exceedance probability is assumed to be equal to the flow of 50 exceedance probability having two points of the curve of the density function of a random value one can determine parameters of the function but the use of this approach limits the range of the applied theoretical curves of distribution only two parameter functions can be used besides the use of only 2 points of transfer 99 95 and 50 25 seems rather subjective so it cannot always be used as a designed or directive one markin 2005a b states that application of this approach appears most effective for large rivers in belarus water budget analysis is mainly aimed at small or medium rivers so the use of this method is not always effective and well grounded 2 4 the method of proportional discharges this method is based on the proportional separation of environmental flow as a part of a river flow at a current time it implies the use of a proportional coefficient k which is characteristic for particular conditions taking the proportional coefficient into consideration the value of the environmental flow q i e c o at an i time interval is defined as follows 3 q i e c o q i k i this approach involves carrying out field studies with the participation of biologists the method is widely used in western europe the disadvantage is that there is no well grounded technique to determine proportional coefficient in different natural conditions the method could be effective if standard approaches to the definition of the coefficient were developed according to markin 2005a b when proportional discharges method is used either an average monthly discharge for a year of 75 exceedance probability or an average annual discharge of 80 90 exceedance probability must be taken as a minimal river discharge this precondition is based on the analysis of the shape of the density function of the river flow with different values of variation coefficients besides the choice of the lower limit depends on the peculiarities of the flow formation from such sources as overland flow groundwater flow and groundwater forcing flow it is supposed that the minimal value of the flow will be achieved without overland and groundwater sources as reimers 1990 says this happens very rarely and cannot be considered as the lower limit of environmentally grounded river flow according to kovalenko and faschevsky 1986 lantsova and nulyakova 2001 long term variability of the flow must be provided by cyclic recurrence in the water content of the river thus when developing a scheme how to control a hydrological regime and maintain a water resource balance in water storage reservoirs it is necessary to provide above average annual discharges with natural cyclic recurrence intra annual variability of the flow is an indisputable necessity for any geosystem with modified streams to provide intra annual variability three main seasons are taken into account winter summer autumn spring intensive biological processes take place in the river system during the summer spring low water period during that period the largest growth of biomass of aquatic and riverside plants takes place when designing a water resources management system in this condition an indicator of biocenosis productivity is river depth average depth in terms of maximal productivity an optimal river depth can be different in different natural conditions the results of the experiment presented by markin 2005a b show that phytocoenosis productivity has ascending and descending parts of the graph the descending part related to significant increase in depth is of least interest let us consider the ascending part plants survival is provided with discharges of 90 95 exceedance probability these discharges are acceptable only for a summer spring low water period generally it is necessary to perform field studies to set up a dependence of flow discharge on average depth of the stream at a control cross section at the same time the dependence of discharge on average speed of the stream may be used at present these parameters are widely used in regulatory documents for example when estimating the maximal wastewater discharge into streams if there are data from long term observations at the control station the problem is solved very easily otherwise it is possible to apply the method described by volchek and sheshko 2011 to calculate the dependence of discharge on average depth of the stream in this case they use the data that come from observation over discharge on analogue rivers or on the same river at another control cross section in order to assess the measured value of exceedance probability in winter a flow first of all must provide the minimal amount of oxygen in water and prevent it from freezing according to markin 2005a b the analysis of the graph of the density function of discharge shows that the left point of inflection corresponds to the start of the surface inflow consequently the discharge value at the left point of inflection of the density function may be assumed as environmental flow in winter environmental flow in spring is defined by the maximal value of the amount of suspended sediment the precondition for sustainable river functioning is the balance of suspended sediments transported down the stream spring is characterized by significant amount of water and sediment during low water periods the sediment must be transported downstream otherwise the stream may silt river s depth reduces due to silting which is an unfavorable factor for the development of stream s geosystem minimal flow rate in spring is based on field observations over suspended sediment concentration during the year according to chalov 1997 markin 2005a b spring flow rate is supposed to be no less than portion k w of the total annual river flow rate 4 w s p w y e a r k w where w sp is maximal flow rate in spring m3 s w year is flow rate in spring k w coefficient may be defined as follows 5 k w ρ ρ ρ s p where ρ and ρ sp are sediment concentration during the whole year and in a spring period maximal respectively g m3 to sum up it should be pointed out that the method of proportional discharges can be regarded as the most developed one because it takes into the consideration local peculiarities of a river and probabilistic characteristic of the flow however this approach is not widely used and its effectiveness must be checked on particular rivers 3 calculation the yaselda river is the second largest left tributary of the pripyat river the river has its source in the lowland swamp located 4km to the west of the village of trukhnovichi pruzhanski district brest region the river flows into the pripyat river at the left bank near the village of kachanovichi the length of the river is 214km its catchment area is 5590km2 the catchment area is located in the north west of polessie covers zagorodie glacifluvial plain and swamp lowlands around it although the yaselda river belongs to the group of small rivers it is very important for the industrially developed population centers situated on the banks of the river towns bereza beloozersk motol etc besides there is a large water storage reservoir selets in the river head its main purpose is to supply water into selets fish breeding farm water consumption of the farm is a significant part of the river flow at this cross section thus environmental flow assessment for the yaselda river is not only a difficult theoretical but also an important practical task the stretch of the river from selets reservoir to the highway e30 brest minsk may be considered the most environmentally heavy because of the largest water withdrawal by selets fish breeding farm and wastewater disposal from bereza town the analysis of the parameters of environmental flow is carried out for this river stretch monitoring of the yaselda river flow at the station of selets reservoir was conducted at two gauge stations from 1972 till 1991 monitoring was performed at horeva gauge station the observations at the yaselda river town bereza gauge station have been made since 1929 with 11 year interruption from 1934 till 1945 4 results and discussion some hydrologic research was carried out at selets reservoir section to specify the yaselda river flow discharges of various exceedance probabilities were estimated at the yaselda river town bereza gauge station as the water storage reservoir with intra annual management does not considerably affect the annual flow at this cross section the annual average discharge can be considered as natural environmental flow what is more there is no need to restore monitoring data and all the available observations 1945 2013 are used for the analysis the uniformity analysis confirms the hypothesis which was put forward thus the obtained data of the average annual flow of various exceedance probabilities are given in table 3 to transfer the flow characteristics on the cross section of interest it is necessary to calculate flow modules of different exceedance probability catchment area at three cross sections was calculated with the use of digital elevation model dem and the algorithm of overland flow structure analysis we analyzed only an overland flow because in large catchment areas a groundwater flow usually copies an overland flow the analysis of closed local relief declines was carried out for the algorithm to work some adjustments to dem were made to level the local closed relief declines thus the map of catchment areas was compiled fig 1 having calculated the geometry of the catchment areas we counted the squares of the areas the catchment area at horeva cross section is 663km2 at selets cross section 858km2 at bereza cross section 1131km2 their catchment areas were analyzed in terms to diversion of the flow due to soil reclamation canals several zones with a small change in catchment area stand out but the total square of these sections is less than 0 5 of the catchment area of the river at horeva cross section that is why further calculations were done with the obtained squares of catchment areas the values of flow modules at horeva and bereza sections are given in table 4 the average annual flow at selets cross section was calculated on their basis table 4 shows that the flow modules at bereza and horeva gauge stations differ considerably which is explained by the differences in flow formation the yaselda river at horeva cross section is like a small river so it has higher flow modules that is why we use monitoring data from bereza station to assess the flow at selets cross section the analysis of average monthly minimal discharge reveals some changes in flow formation that were observed when selets reservoir was put into operation fig 2a and b for further assessment with the method of lower discharge we use monitoring data from 1945 to 1985 the analysis of empirical curve of distribution of random value of minimal average monthly discharge shows that the most acceptable theoretical curve of density distribution is that of kritskiy menkel fig 3 it is clear due to value of criterion χ2 for kritskiy menkel distribution it equals to 9 34 this shows the least deviation of empirical points from the function of distribution law eq 6 given in the regulatory document estimated hydrologic characteristics estimation procedure tkp 45 3 168 2009 0225 2010 is used for a transfer from average monthly minimal discharge 6 q p d a y a q p b a 1000 where a and b are empirical regression coefficients which are determined as average in a hydrologic region to relate daily and 30 day minimal discharge of analogue rivers if it is impossible to choose analogue rivers for summer autumn period a 0 89 b 0 09 for winter a 0 86 b 0 11 respectively a catchment area upstream of gauging station km2 the results of calculations are given in table 5 as the table shows environmental flow with high exceedance probability approaches zero according to this method water may not pass into a canal pound of the reservoir in low water years the data from table 1 also show that environmental flow of the yaselda river is taken as minimal low water flow if taking into account variations of average annual flow c v 0 31 as there is no concept of minimal low water flow in the regulatory document estimated hydrologic characteristics estimation procedure tkp 45 3 168 2009 0225 2010 it can be taken as minimal daily discharge which is given in table 5 according to formula 1 and table 2 an environmental flow is determined as the product of a minimal average monthly flow by proportionality coefficient k 0 3 in this case environmental flow equals to 0 11m3 s this index does not depend on a rated probability according to the dependence 2 used in switzerland an environmental flow at selets cross section is 0 86m3 s and at bereza cross section it is 1 13m3 s the considered approaches to environmental flow assessment regulate only minimal flow rate but variability of the flow on an annual basis is not given this approach is recommended to be used to control decrease in lower limit of environmental flow whose assessment was done with the use of other methods considering a simpler realization of the faschevsky s 1989 way of probability transfer in which the following transfers are taken into account q e c o 50 q m o n t h 75 q e c o 75 q m o n t h 95 q e c o 95 q m o n t h 99 the values of environmental flow for 3 major rated probabilities are obtained table 6 the value of probability of the discharge was transferred and intra annual flow variability was used intra annual flow variability appears very important to maintain a reservoir for intra annual regulation the following suppositions were used as a hypothesis to estimate intra annual variability such researchers as volchek and natarova 2010 state that intra annual variability of the river flows in belarus has not changed significantly for the last decades rivers modified by reservoirs have a flow change between seasons the period before selets reservoir was put into operation can be considered as non modified to evaluate the intra annual variability an intra annual flow variability for the yaselda river at horeva and bereza cross sections was defined with the method of seasons grouping on the ground of the above stated hypotheses like before slight difference in the flow structure at these gauge stations was revealed mostly it is explained by the gaps and shorter duration of the time series at horeva gauge station as it is mentioned above the use of full probability transfer method estimation of the density function parameters at two gauge stations leads to a significant difference in the results at the same time the result is greatly affected by the structure of time series that is why we offer to apply a probability transfer method with the use of three points of transfer to estimate the parameters of a density function two close alternatives to choose probability transfer are possible 25 5 50 25 99 95 25 5 75 50 99 95 the first one is closer to the method of transfer offered by faschevsky 1993 but it involves using one more point 25 5 the other alternative is compiled to some extent intuitively but it is based on the approaches described above exceedance probability transfer makes it possible to produce a density function of random value of environmental flow and it allows having environmental flow of estimated exceedance probability in terms of engineering purposes after that we can get intra annual variability of environmental flow which takes into account biologically relevant periods of water content in the river probability transfer can be applied not only to kritskiy menkel density function but also to other distribution laws in this case an equation similar to 6 must be composed for a distribution law chosen so the method proves to be universal and there is no chance to manipulate with the results to please any particular water users special attention must be paid to the choice of parameters of exceedance probability transfer we have already pointed out that the parameters of exceedance probability transfer which are used in this paper are expert ones i e they are defined on the basis of expert assessment the algorithm of flow grouping done by arthington et al 2006 can be used to define parameters of exceedance probability transfer if it is necessary to take into account biological hydro biological social and economical functions of the flow in this case it is possible to use the same parameters of exceedance probability transfer within the same class if the flows are grouped according to their natural features each class must have at least one river with the monitoring data that represent the relation of the river s water content to its environment forming and environment reproducing function with the use of algorithm by arthington et al 2006 it is possible to compile maps layouts of zoning of parameters of exceedance probability transfer to define characteristics of environmental flow density function we consider the annual flow of the yaselda river at bereza gauge station from 1945 to 2013 like with minimal monthly flow the initial data are most efficiently described by the kritskiy menkel s function of random variable density distribution the following system of differential equations is used to estimate the parameters of the function 7 1 0 95 0 q 99 γ γ b γ γ γ b 1 q b γ γ q q γ b 1 e γ γ b γ γ q q 1 b d q 1 0 25 0 q 50 γ γ b γ γ γ b 1 q b γ γ q q γ b 1 e γ γ b γ γ q q 1 b d q 1 0 05 0 q 25 γ γ b γ γ γ b 1 q b γ γ q q γ b 1 e γ γ b γ γ q q 1 b d q where b γ q are the required parameters of distribution of random value of water discharge γ γ is gamma function q p is the water discharge in the flow with p probability m3 s the equation for the second alternative of probability transfer is composed in the same way solving the equation we get two functions of environmental flow density distribution in fig 4a c we can see the curve of the environmental flow which shifts to the left and becomes close to the normal law of distribution besides the two alternatives of probability transfer have given similar results the obtained results of environmental flow assessment are presented in the general graph fig 5 and in table 7 for this purpose the flow of 75 exceedance probability is analyzed because such a flow is the most frequently used one when waterworks facilities are designed 5 conclusion after we examined various methods of environmental flow assessment analyzed the main requirements to the flow rate and calculated minimal environmentally substantiated yaselda flow we could see a significant difference in the results the difference is generally explained by the conditions of each method and the economic and social circumstances they were formed in besides such researchers as kirvel 2005 note that water storage reservoirs are of importance to form the environmental flow of small rivers in the summer autumn and winter low water periods the assessment methods used in belarus and ukraine gave the same results which confirms that they were formed in similar economic and scientific situations the methods of lower discharge came to significantly differing results although they are based on similar principles flow variations class of the river thus the method of lower discharge showed that the yaselda river s environmental flow in september is even higher than its natural flow that month switzerland s assessment method showed that environmental flow rate is 32 of the natural river s flow it means that nearly a third of the total flow must reach the tail bay of water storage reservoir the method of probability transfer appears the most promising as it considers intra annual variability of environmental flow the results obtained with this method may be recommended to be used to design adjust a water economy balance in the yaselda s catchment area but the transfers applied in the research are subjective and they need ecological and economic grounding for different natural conditions partial zoning of probability transfer parameters can be used depending on the river s natural conditions the level of industrial development and the level of landscape modification historical and social importance of the region as a perspective of our research we are considering taking into account flood and drought recurrence in environmental flow assessment this approach implies yearly adjustment of environmental flow rate with account for water content of previous years thus for instance if a river s flood plain is not watered for a long time current flood recurrence is less than flood recurrence in natural condition water management authorities must adjust environmental flow for the next year to water the river s flood plain conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements

1138,a comparative analysis of five environmental flow assessment methods was performed on the example of the yaselda river in its selets section the significant difference in their results was revealed the threshold methods provide a uniform environmental flow values along the year the values vary among the methods it is explained that the methods were developed in different economic and social conditions practically identical results were obtained with the methods used in belarus and ukraine however the other method would assume the environmental flow value above the natural flow in some periods of the year the method of exceedance probability transfer appears to be the most promising one partial zoning of probability transfer parameters would make the method more efficient for management purposes it is proposed to introduce yearly adjustments of environmental flow rates taking into account the discharges of previous years this would allow to re water floodplains overdried in dry years and recover habitats for biota keywords environmental flow evaluation methods exceedance probability 1 introduction water withdrawal from the surface sources rivers and flow through reservoirs in the republic of belarus is more than 40 of the total water consumption surface water is mainly used for the industrial water supply fish and pond farming as well as for irrigation as the country is working out a new nature protection strategy it is necessary to estimate in detail a maximal load imposed on water flow it should be noted that global climatic changes worsen the situation a river is a natural object whose geo system forms for a long time an optimal ratio of number and diversity of biological species forms during that time that is why any alterations in yearly flow can cause changes in biodiversity the maximal volume of water withdrawal is usually calculated considering environmental flow as a basis methods of environmental flow assessment started to develop quite long ago the first methods to evaluate a minimal flow appeared in the 1940s in the usa they aimed at determining minimal flow to provide conditions for ichthyofauna as the influence of damming straightening and flow regulation on biocenoses has increased considerably over 200 methods of flow assessment have been developed so far arthington et al 2006 dyson et al 2003 and tharme 2003 classify all of them into four groups purely hydrological methods methods of hydraulic assessment hydro biological methods and complex methods it is worth pointing out the advanced research done by smakhtin et al 2004 to assess environmental flow for 128 world s biggest rivers it applies watergap2 model to evaluate environmental flow this model makes it possible to calculate the whole reserve of renewable water resources with the use of equation of water energy balance smakhtin et al 2004 define environmental flow here as 20 50 of total reserve of the area in renewable water resources however such simplified methods can cause significant environmental threats because 50 water withdrawal results in deterioration of the watershed geosystem besides arthington et al 2006 in their research present a detailed review of approaches to environmental flow assessment applied in the world today the authors analyze both their advantages and drawbacks one of the advantages is that the method can be applied even if there are no observations showing the relation of flow rate to biological environmental state of the river and the area around the research offers to group rivers according to the shape of probability density function but the groups include both modified and non modified streams from our point of view it is more correct to do the grouping only after statistical restoration of the natural flow is performed moreover this method does not make it possible to estimate environmental flow rate for various exceedance probabilities it appears important as most engineering and management tasks must be based on exeedance probability values let us consider different demands to environmental flow raised by geo ecology and hydro biology environmental flow is a minimal river flow that can be constant or variable within a year as markin 2005a b describes ecologically sustainable flow must meet the following requirement a flow rate appropriate for sustainable development of hydrobionts according to vladimirov and imamov 1994 and tkachev and bulanov 2002 an appropriate flow rate can be achieved by keeping flow velocity within 0 25 0 6m s 0 25m s is the lowest velocity which makes the development of phytoplankton possible with the flow depth not less than 0 1 0 3m according to byelorussian soviet encyclopedia 1975 the minimal depth corresponds to winter and summer low water periods however deterioration of fish fauna occurs at average rate of ice formation from 17 45cm in the south to 29 64cm in the north and north west fulfillment of natural functions by a river in their research shokoohi and amini 2014 and xuhong et al 2015 explain how a river network transports substances and energy thus rearranging them in time and space intra annual flow variability

during a low water period in xx century the period of dynamic industrial development experts started to use a term minimal flow however it was mainly oriented toward man s needs for water resources besides the minimal amount of water flowing into a tail bay was related to the number of downstream water users murphy et al 2012 prove that from a modern point of view such preconditions for the estimation of minimal flow are unacceptable 2 material and methods there are various methods to estimate environmental flow which markin 2005a b and knight et al 2011 conventionally arrange into four groups we will consider them separately 2 1 method of lower discharge as vladimirov and imamov 1994 show in their paper the extent of a minimal environmental flow is assumed as equal to the minimal average monthly flow at 95 of exceedance probability besides ladynina 1986 specifies that the volume of an environmental flow depends on variations of an annual river flow with substantial variability of annual flow the absolute value of environmental flow can reach the value of a minimal annual flow environmental flow is determined as a percentage of the calculated value given in table 1 according to tkachev and bulanov 2002 in the republic of belarus environmental flow rate is assumed as 75 of the minimal average monthly flow at 95 of exceedance probability 1 q e n v k q min m o n t h where k is a proportionality coefficient that depends on a river class and its long term average annual flow table 2 according to markin 2005a b in switzerland environmental flow is regulated by the size of catchment area particularly by the minimal environmental flow module 2 q e n v a q e n v where q env is the minimal flow module which is assumed as equal to 10 3 m3 s per km2 a is the catchment area km2 this approach does not fully comply with the above stated requirements as it does not provide intra annual flow variability it does not take into account long term cycles of water inflow and in most cases the minimal rate of the flow cannot be achieved 2 2 method of field studies this method is based on doing field or laboratory studies the method is most frequently used for environmentally

watercourse would be different in each case thus from the fisheries viewpoint the key factor is the amount of oxygen dissolved in water but geological and mineralogical conditions can significantly affect the amount of oxygen too a similar method of environmental flow assessment is presented by european commission 2015 in details this document describes main approaches to estimate environmental flows and gives a list of methods applied in european states if there are data from observations over the state of ecosystems in a catchment area minimal flow is estimated quite reasonably but if there is a shortage of monitoring data environmental flow is considered by most european countries as constant during the year it contradicts to both the requirements defined by european commission 2015 and the introduction to this paper in addition it should be noted that both arthington et al 2006 and european commission 2015 do not define approaches to environmental flow assessment with different exceedance probabilities as an example of the method of field application two papers can be cited walega et al 2015 and piniewski et al 2011 the main concept of these manuscripts is

effective for large rivers in belarus water budget analysis is mainly aimed at small or medium rivers so the use of this method is not always effective and well grounded 2 4 the method of proportional discharges this method is based on the proportional separation of environmental flow as a part of a river flow at a current time it implies the use of a proportional coefficient k which is characteristic for particular conditions taking the proportional coefficient into consideration the value of the environmental flow q i e c o at an i time interval is defined as follows 3 q i e c o q i k i this approach involves carrying out field studies with the participation of biologists the method is widely used in western europe the disadvantage is that there is no well grounded technique to determine proportional coefficient in different natural conditions the method could be effective if standard approaches to the definition of the coefficient were developed according to markin 2005a b when proportional discharges method is used either an average monthly discharge for a year of 75 exceedance probability or an average annual discharge of 80 90 exceedance probability must be taken as a minimal river discharge this precondition is based on the analysis of the shape of the density function of the river flow with different values of variation coefficients besides the choice of the lower limit depends on the peculiarities of the flow formation from such sources as overland flow groundwater flow and groundwater forcing flow it is supposed that the minimal value of the flow will be achieved without overland and groundwater sources as reimers 1990 says this happens very rarely and cannot be considered as the lower limit of environmentally grounded river flow according to kovalenko and faschevsky 1986 lantsova and nulyakova 2001 long term variability of the flow must be provided by cyclic recurrence in the water content of the river thus when developing a scheme how to control a hydrological regime and maintain a water resource balance in water storage reservoirs it is necessary to provide above average annual discharges with natural cyclic recurrence intra annual variability of the flow is an indisputable necessity for any geosystem with modified streams to provide intra annual variability three main seasons are taken into account winter summer autumn spring intensive biological processes take place in the river system during the summer spring low water period during that period the largest growth of biomass of aquatic and riverside plants takes place when designing a water resources management system in this condition an indicator of biocenosis productivity is river depth average depth in terms of maximal productivity an optimal river depth can be different in different natural conditions the results of the experiment presented by markin 2005a b show that phytocoenosis productivity has ascending and descending parts of the graph the descending part related to significant increase in depth is of least interest let us consider the ascending part plants survival is provided with discharges of 90 95 exceedance probability these discharges are acceptable only for a summer spring low water period generally it is necessary to perform field studies to set up a dependence of flow discharge on average depth of the stream at a control cross section at the same time the dependence of discharge on average speed of the stream may be used at present these parameters are widely used in regulatory documents for example when estimating the maximal wastewater discharge into streams if there are data from long term observations at the control station the problem is solved very easily otherwise it is possible to apply the method described by volchek and sheshko 2011 to calculate the dependence of discharge on average depth of the stream in this case they use the data that come from observation over discharge on analogue rivers or on the same river at another control cross section in order to assess the measured value of exceedance probability in winter a flow first of all must provide the minimal amount of oxygen in water and prevent it from freezing according to markin 2005a b the analysis of the graph of the density function of discharge shows that the left point of inflection corresponds to the start of the surface inflow consequently the discharge value at the left point of inflection of the density function may be assumed as environmental flow in winter environmental flow in spring is defined by the maximal value of the amount of suspended sediment the precondition for sustainable river functioning is the balance of suspended sediments transported down the stream spring is characterized by significant amount of water and sediment during low water periods the sediment must be transported downstream otherwise the stream may silt river s depth reduces due to silting which is an unfavorable factor for the development of stream s geosystem minimal flow rate in spring is based on field observations over suspended sediment concentration during the year according to chalov 1997 markin 2005a b spring flow rate is supposed to be no less than portion k w of the total annual river flow rate 4 w s p w y e a r k w where w sp is maximal flow rate in spring m3 s w year is flow rate in spring k w coefficient may be defined as follows 5 k w ρ ρ ρ s p where ρ and ρ sp are sediment concentration during the whole year and in a spring period maximal respectively g m3 to sum up it should be pointed out that the method of proportional discharges can be regarded as the most developed one because it takes into the consideration local peculiarities of a river and probabilistic characteristic of the flow however this approach is not widely used and its effectiveness must be checked on particular rivers 3 calculation the yaselda river is the second largest left tributary of the pripyat river the river has its source in the lowland swamp located 4km to the west of the village of trukhnovichi pruzhanski district brest region the river flows into the pripyat river at the left bank near the village of kachanovichi the length of the river is 214km its catchment area is 5590km2 the catchment area is located in the north west of polessie covers zagorodie glacifluvial plain and swamp lowlands around it although the yaselda river belongs to the group of small rivers it is very important for the industrially developed population centers situated on the banks of the river towns bereza beloozersk motol etc besides there is a large water storage reservoir selets in the river head its main purpose is to supply water into selets fish breeding farm water consumption of the farm is a significant part of the river flow at this cross section thus environmental flow assessment for the yaselda river is not only a difficult theoretical but also an important practical task the stretch of the river from selets reservoir to the highway e30 brest minsk may be considered the most environmentally heavy because of the largest water withdrawal by selets fish breeding farm and wastewater disposal from bereza town the analysis of the parameters of environmental flow is carried out for this river stretch monitoring of the yaselda river flow at the station of selets reservoir was conducted at two gauge stations from 1972 till 1991 monitoring was performed at horeva gauge station the observations at the yaselda river town bereza gauge station have been made since 1929 with 11 year interruption from 1934 till 1945 4 results and discussion some hydrologic research was carried out at selets reservoir section to specify the yaselda river flow discharges of various exceedance probabilities were estimated at the yaselda river town bereza gauge station as the water storage reservoir with intra annual management does not considerably affect the annual flow at this cross section the annual average discharge can be considered as natural environmental flow what is more there is no need to restore monitoring data and all the available observations 1945 2013 are used for the analysis the uniformity analysis confirms the hypothesis which was put forward thus the obtained data of the average annual flow of various exceedance probabilities are given in table 3 to transfer the flow characteristics on the cross section of interest it is necessary to calculate flow modules of different exceedance probability catchment area at three cross sections was calculated with the use of digital elevation model dem and the algorithm of overland flow structure analysis we analyzed only an overland flow because in large catchment areas a groundwater flow usually copies an overland flow the analysis of closed local relief declines was carried out for the algorithm to work some adjustments to dem were made to level the local closed relief declines thus the map of catchment areas was compiled fig 1 having calculated the geometry of the catchment areas we counted the squares of the areas the catchment area at horeva cross section is 663km2 at selets cross section 858km2 at bereza cross section 1131km2 their catchment areas were analyzed in terms to diversion of the flow due to soil reclamation canals several zones with a small change in catchment area stand out but the total square of these sections is less than 0 5 of the catchment area of the river at horeva cross section that is why further calculations were done with the obtained squares of catchment areas the values of flow modules at horeva and bereza sections are given in table 4 the average annual flow at selets cross section was calculated on their basis table 4 shows that the flow modules at bereza and horeva gauge stations differ considerably which is explained by the differences in flow formation the yaselda river at horeva cross section is like a small river so it has higher flow modules that is why we use monitoring data from bereza station to assess the flow at selets cross section the analysis of average monthly minimal discharge reveals some changes in flow formation that were observed when selets reservoir was put into operation fig 2a and b for further assessment with the method of lower discharge we use monitoring data from 1945 to 1985 the analysis of empirical curve of distribution of random value of minimal average monthly discharge shows that the most acceptable theoretical curve of density distribution is that of kritskiy menkel fig 3 it is clear due to value of criterion χ2 for kritskiy menkel distribution it equals to 9 34 this shows the least deviation of empirical points from the function of distribution law eq 6 given in the regulatory document estimated hydrologic characteristics estimation procedure tkp 45 3 168 2009 0225 2010 is used for a transfer from average monthly minimal discharge 6 q p d a y a q p b a 1000 where a and b are empirical regression coefficients which are determined as average in a hydrologic region to relate daily and 30 day minimal discharge of analogue rivers if it is impossible to choose analogue rivers for summer autumn period a 0 89 b 0 09 for winter a 0 86 b 0 11 respectively a catchment area upstream of gauging station km2 the results of calculations are given in table 5 as the table shows environmental flow with high exceedance probability approaches zero according to this method water may not pass into a canal pound of the reservoir in low water years the data from table 1 also show that environmental flow of the yaselda river is taken as minimal low water flow if taking into account variations of average annual flow c v 0 31 as there is no concept of minimal low water flow in the regulatory document estimated hydrologic characteristics estimation procedure tkp 45 3 168 2009 0225 2010 it can be taken as minimal daily discharge which is given in table 5 according to formula 1 and table 2 an environmental flow is determined as the product of a minimal average monthly flow by proportionality coefficient k 0 3 in this case environmental flow equals to 0 11m3 s this index does not depend on a rated probability according to the dependence 2 used in switzerland an environmental flow at selets cross section is 0 86m3 s and at bereza cross section it is 1 13m3 s the considered approaches to environmental flow assessment regulate only minimal flow rate but variability of the flow on an annual basis is not given this approach is recommended to be used to control decrease in lower limit of environmental flow whose assessment was done with the use of other methods considering a simpler realization of the faschevsky s 1989 way of probability transfer in which the following transfers are taken into account q e c o 50 q m o n t h 75 q e c o 75 q m o n t h 95 q e c o 95 q m o n t h 99 the values of environmental flow for 3 major rated probabilities are obtained table 6 the value of probability of the discharge was transferred and intra annual flow variability was used intra annual flow variability appears very important to maintain a reservoir for intra annual regulation the following suppositions were used as a hypothesis to estimate intra annual variability such researchers as volchek and natarova 2010 state that intra annual variability of the river flows in belarus has not changed significantly for the last decades rivers modified by reservoirs have a flow change between seasons the period before selets reservoir was put into operation can be considered as non modified to evaluate the intra annual variability an intra annual flow variability for the yaselda river at horeva and bereza cross sections was defined with the method of seasons grouping on the ground of the above stated hypotheses like before slight difference in the flow structure at these gauge stations was revealed mostly it is explained by the gaps and shorter duration of the time series at horeva gauge station as it is mentioned above the use of full probability transfer method estimation of the density function parameters at two gauge stations leads to a significant difference in the results at the same time the result is greatly affected by the structure of time series that is why we offer to apply a probability transfer method with the use of three points of transfer to estimate the parameters of a density function two close alternatives to choose probability transfer are possible 25 5 50 25 99 95 25 5 75 50 99 95 the first one is closer to the method of transfer offered by faschevsky 1993 but it involves using one more point 25 5 the other alternative is compiled to some extent intuitively but it is based on the approaches described above exceedance probability transfer makes it possible to produce a density function of random value of environmental flow and it allows having environmental flow of estimated exceedance probability in terms of engineering purposes after that we can get intra annual variability of environmental flow which takes into account biologically relevant periods of water content in the river probability transfer can be applied not only to kritskiy menkel density function but also to other distribution laws in this case an equation similar to 6 must be composed for a distribution law chosen so the method proves to be universal and there is no chance to manipulate with the results to please any particular water users special attention must be paid to the choice of parameters of exceedance probability transfer we have already pointed out that the parameters of exceedance probability transfer which are used in this paper are expert ones i e they are defined on the basis of expert assessment the algorithm of flow grouping done by arthington et al 2006 can be used to define parameters of exceedance probability transfer if it is necessary to take into account biological hydro biological social and economical functions of the flow in this case it is possible to use the same parameters of exceedance probability transfer within the same class if the flows are grouped according to their natural features each class must have at least one river with the monitoring data that represent the relation of the river s water content to its environment forming and environment reproducing function with the use of algorithm by arthington et al 2006 it is possible to compile maps layouts of zoning of parameters of exceedance probability transfer to define characteristics of environmental flow density function we consider the annual flow of the yaselda river at bereza gauge station from 1945 to 2013 like with minimal monthly flow the initial data are most efficiently described by the kritskiy menkel s function of random variable density distribution the following system of differential equations is used to estimate the parameters of the function 7 1 0 95 0 q 99 γ γ b γ γ γ b 1 q b γ γ q q γ b 1 e γ γ b γ γ q q 1 b d q 1 0 25 0 q 50 γ γ b γ γ γ b 1 q b γ γ q q γ b 1 e γ γ b γ γ q q 1 b d q 1 0 05 0 q 25 γ γ b γ γ γ b 1 q b γ γ q q γ b 1 e γ γ b γ γ q q 1 b d q where b γ q are the required parameters of distribution of random value of water discharge γ γ is gamma function q p is the water discharge in the flow with p probability m3 s the equation for the second alternative of probability transfer is composed in the same way solving the equation we get two functions of environmental flow density distribution in fig 4a c we can see the curve of the environmental flow which shifts to the left and becomes close to the normal law of distribution besides the two alternatives of probability transfer have given similar results the obtained results of environmental flow assessment are presented in the general graph fig 5 and in table 7 for this purpose the flow of 75 exceedance probability is analyzed because such a flow is the most frequently used one when waterworks facilities are designed 5 conclusion after we examined various methods of environmental flow assessment analyzed the main requirements to the flow rate and calculated minimal environmentally substantiated yaselda flow we could see a significant difference in the results the difference is generally explained by the conditions of each method and the economic and social circumstances they were formed in besides such researchers as kirvel 2005 note that water storage reservoirs are of importance to form the environmental flow of small rivers in the summer autumn and winter low water periods the assessment methods used in belarus and ukraine gave the same results which confirms that they were formed in similar economic and scientific situations the methods of lower discharge came to significantly differing results although they are based on similar principles flow variations class of the river thus the method of lower discharge showed that the yaselda river s environmental flow in september is even higher than its natural flow that month switzerland s assessment method showed that environmental flow rate is 32 of the natural river s flow it means that nearly a third of the total flow must reach the tail bay of water storage reservoir the method of probability transfer appears the most promising as it considers intra annual variability of environmental flow the results obtained with this method may be recommended to be used to design adjust a water economy balance in the yaselda s catchment area but the transfers applied in the research are subjective and they need ecological and economic grounding for different natural conditions partial zoning of probability transfer parameters can be used depending on the river s natural conditions the level of industrial development and the level of landscape modification historical and social importance of the region as a perspective of our research we are considering taking into account flood and drought recurrence in environmental flow assessment this approach implies yearly adjustment of environmental flow rate with account for water content of previous years thus for instance if a river s flood plain is not watered for a long time current flood recurrence is less than flood recurrence in natural condition water management authorities must adjust environmental flow for the next year to water the river s flood plain conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements

1139,ecohydrological modelling and prescribing environmental flows e flows is significant in the integrated water resources management iwrm practice however for many river basins there is lack of data on ecosystems and on the relationships between e flows and ecosystem functioning this lack of sufficient ecosystem data is mostly addressed in ecohydrological modelling by using hydrological metrics as surrogates of river ecosystem in this study we are demonstrating how it helps e flows modelling and real life management decisions underway with respect to inter basin water transfer ibwt projects desktop model flow health is used here to design e flows regime for chalakkudi sub basin in southern peninsular india chalakkudi sub basin is over abstracted with six large dams built as components of the parambikulam aliyar project pap asia s largest ibwt network the monthly e flow regimes required to maintain alternate levels of ecosystem conservation are estimated in this paper the additional flood flow volume required for these alternate levels is also discussed the results are useful in the stakeholder engagement process for informed decision making on e flows and redefining the ibwt operations within a broad framework of iwrm 1 introduction the importance of rivers and its ecosystems in delivering integrated water resources management iwrm solutions has been widely appreciated in the recent past sustainable management of rivers is an essential prerequisite for the conservation of its ecosystems however over abstraction of water from rivers is an increasing concern today millennium ecosystem assessment millennium assessment board 2005 has observed that 15 35 of irrigation withdrawal exceeds supply rates and are therefore unsustainable historically river managers have focused on maximising the short term economic growth from the use of water the iwrm paradigm now emphasizes the need to take care of aquatic ecosystems for long term economic viability dyson et al 2003 restoring the over abstracted rivers and their ecosystems to its pristine condition may not be possible in most of the situations but they can be brought back closer to this condition by modifying the river flows scientifically environmental flows e flows modelling in the case of hydrologically altered rivers is the methodology for identifying the volume of river flows required to mimic the pristine flow variabilities over different periods of a year in general e flows refer to the hydrological regime required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and wellbeing that depend on them webb et al 2012 banks and docker 2013 hirji et al 2009 jain and kumar 2014 overton et al 2014 saintilan et al 2010 gippel et al 2012 warner et al 2014 it is the natural pattern of high and low flows that maintain ecosystems in a less than pristine condition critical factors that maintain river ecosystems are quantity quality timing and its duration of lean flow together with the flood flows therefore e flows are different from natural flows minimum flows or the average flows nevertheless river rejuvenation cannot be ensured just by providing adequate e flows the key idea is to recognize it as an integral part of modern river management and restoration processes ecohydrology is the new paradigm for sustainability zalewski 2014 ecohydrological approach in the assessment of e flows has therefore gained momentum in this approach the quantity as well as quality of water is equally important there are many hydrological water quality models available now connecting the flows and the ecosystem functioning singh vijay et al 2006 creams a field scale model for chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems consists of three components hydrology erosion sedimentation and chemistry answers areal nonpoint source watershed environmental simulation simulates the impacts of watershed management practices on runoff sediment and nutrient losses hspf hydrological simulation program fortran simulates hydrologic and water quality processes in natural and man made water systems the purpose of mike she another popular model is the simulation of coupled hydrologic processes with emphasis on surface water ground water interactions channel flow unsaturated zone flow and groundwater flow the moneris modelling nutrient emissions in river systems model developed by icpdr international commission for protection of danube river calculates the emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus to the surface water by different pathways as well as the in stream retention in the surface water network icpdr 2007 basins is an extensible open source gis based decision support system that integrates watershed models with ready access to data flow meteorological water quality and various gis layers very recently swat soil and water assessment tool has become a much more popular hydrologic model in this category in the quality aspect sediment load of flowing water is an important ecosystem services parameter spnm sediment phosphorous nitrogen model can simulate the sediment phosphorous and nitrogen yields from agricultural basins it is designed to predict sediment phosphorous and nitrogen yields for individual storms on small basins and to route these yields through streams and valleys of large basins williams 1980 kourgialas and karatzas 2014 has developed a hydro sedimentary modelling system for flash flood propagation and hazard estimation under different agricultural practices riparian vegetation s effect on flood propagation parameters such as inundation depth discharge flow velocity and sediment transport load can be investigated using this model though sediment load is an important ecosystem services parameter lack of detailed data on sediment loads is a common situation in many regions of the world as the e flows and sediment load are inextricably linked special efforts should be made in the future to improve long term data bases on sediment transport and develop a better knowledge of temporal and spatial patterns of sediment transport variability batalla and sala 1994 assessment of the e flows for ecosystem sustainability is a very complex exercise ideally ecologists and hydrologists must work together for a comprehensive assessment of e flows but for most of the e flows studies particularly in india unavailability of ecological data is critical however as observed in the study assessment of environmental flows for the upper ganga basin in india lack of information and resources should never be a barrier to the implementation of e flows some attempt to restore the natural flow variability is always better than none and fine tuning can be done as more knowledge and resources become available over time o keeffe et al 2012 this lack of sufficient ecosystem data is mostly addressed by using hydrological metrics as surrogates of river ecosystem gippel et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 the changing role of ecohydrological sciences in modelling the ecosystem and prescribing e flows regimes are increasingly recognized as key basic concept in the literature on e flows linking it with current water management frameworks such as iwrm eia environmental impact assessment eco flood ecological benefits of flood ea ecosystem approach eco drr ecosystem based disaster risk reduction etc is the thrust area of e flows research there are many open source and commercial software available today aiding the e flows modelling these tools differ mainly in their approach to the design of flow regimes some of them are purely based on the linkages of hydrological metrics with the ecosystem functions rather some others have the capability of inputting and analysing site specific species data too table 1 illustrates a few examples of both these types the hydrological metrics based methods are preferred over the other type owing to the detailed species data requirement which are difficult to obtain gippel et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 flow health iha and eflow predictor work based on hydrological metrics but flow health has certain specific advantages its ability to design monthly e flows regime is the first one among these advantages with respect to the practical aspects of implementing e flows a monthly regime is important flow health provides an additional option of comparing scores of different flow regimes this is particularly useful when the stakeholders want to do the cost benefit analysis of each e flow regime and compare in addition to this flow health can design the e flow regime determined using any other method and predict its score in a stakeholder engagement process on deciding the e flows to be maintained all these factors are important chalakkudi sub basin is an over abstracted small basin with six large dams built across its different tributaries its present status of flows indicate large deviation from the pristine condition no scientific studies on e flows assessment has been carried out in this basin because of this lacuna the concept of e flows is not being recognized in its current water management paradigm the river is also linked with the neighbouring basins periyar and bharathapuzha for inter basin water transfer ibwt under a water sharing agreement this ibwt agreement was also made without considering the e flows requirements the chalakkudi sub basin restoration campaigners accuse that the environmental degradation of this river was mainly attributed by the parambikulam aliyar project pap and its water sharing the environmental governance of the chalakkudi sub basin requires the revision of pap s water sharing terms with proper accounting for the e flows requirements to revise this agreement and its water sharing it has become a prerequisite to scientifically assess the e flow regime the river restoration campaigns by the civil society have also raised the pressing need for e flows design and its implementation therefore e flows modelling of chalakkudi sub basin has become an immediate requirement many stakeholder engagement processes were held in the past revisiting pap s water sharing pact for the actual conservation and restoration of this river system one of the main points being raised in these consultation processes was the urgency of incorporating environmental flow needs into pap s water sharing compact e flows have been generally recognized as a legal requirement in india but precise guidelines on assessment of e flows being multi disciplinary in nature is still at evolving stage in india the broad allocation principles being followed at present for hydropower projects are based on the study carried out by wildlife institute of india wii i e 20 of monthly average of flow during dry season november to march 25 of monthly average of flow from october to april and 30 of monthly average of high flow season from may to september however all these are crude estimation and are being criticized by many experts the present study using flow health model illustrates how clearly e flows can be designed based on the current status of the crucial e flows components especially when ecological data is lacking missing adequate ecological data is a general case for many rivers in india jain 2015 observes a there is lack of data on ecosystems and the relationships between flows and ecosystem functioning are not available b data and studies on values of ecosystem services are also lacking and similar efforts have to be made in this direction though multiple studies have been conducted on chalakkudi sub basin they all highlight only the importance of biodiversity but no specific relationships between flows and ecosystem functioning are available providing a methodology for assessment of e flows in the absence of ecosystem data is the prime objective of this paper thereby significantly contributing to the e flows assessment methodology evolution in india is its secondary objective 2 materials and methods 2 1 chalakkudi sub basin the rivers in india are grouped into 20 basin systems at the national level west flowing rivers from tadri to kanyakumari wfrtk composite basin encompasses 54 rivers and is put together as one of these basin systems periyar and others is a sub basin of this basin system chalakkudi sub basin is also included in this sub basin cwc nrsc 2014 fig 1 shows the sub basin and its location in peninsular india chalakkudi sub basin is located between the 76 20 0 and 77 0 0 e and 10 10 0 and 10 30 0 n average rainfall in this basin based on observed data of four sub catchments parambikulam thunacadavu peruvaripallam and thekkadi ar from 1966 to 2015 is 1775 mm it shows an increasing trend fig 2 the average minimum and maximum temperature in chalakkudi sub basin are 17 83 c and 33 25 c respectively this river originates at anamalai hills in western ghats at an elevation of 1250 m it has a length of 145 km with basin area approximately 1700 km2 this river and neighbourhood have a very rich biodiversity and is identified as a hotspot of western ghats mainly this river is famous for its fish diversity it has 104 species of fish the highest among rivers in kerala and one of the highest in india the abundance of fish wealth has decreased considerably over the past half century fragmentation of the river course by dams reduction in riparian forest stretches sand mining etc have contributed to this the national bureau of fish genetic resources has recommended that the upper reaches of the river should be declared a fish sanctuary latha et al 2012 about 16 species of fish fauna of this river are endangered and 4 are critically endangered it has been reported that three of the critically endangered are strictly endemic to chalakkudi sub basin system raghavan et al 2008 the riparian vegetation also includes endemic species of flowering plants of western ghats six major storage reservoirs have been constructed across various tributaries of this river marked as 1 6 in fig 1 salient features of these reservoirs are given in table 2 all these storage reservoirs except poringalkuthu are a part of pap pap is an inter basin water transfer ibwt project under this project chalakkudi sub basin is a receiver as well as donor it receives water from the adjacent basin periyar and it donates water to the next basin bharathapuzha there is an interstate water sharing agreement on pap the chalakkudi basin s hydrologic alteration caused by pap is significant how the current mean monthly discharge is different from the pristine monthly discharge is given in table 3 and fig 3 iha indicators of hydrological alteration analysis of the current flow regime using reconstructed naturalized hydrograph before commissioning of pap reveals it these results are presented as supplementary material 1 hydrologic alteration of the indicators in middle and high rva category are phenomenal most important flow component with respect to ecological relevance extreme low flow is also significantly altered this is evident from the relevant iha output graph presented as supplementary material 2 when originally contemplated pap s water sharing agreement was cited as an example of inter basin and interstate cooperation but recently this agreement has turned out to be a point of conflict this is mainly due to the inequities in water sharing being surfaced in the changed socio economic and environmental scenarios in both the states also this conflict has resulted from the fact that no scientific study on the e flows on the basin was carried out at the inception of agreement or later hence these conflicts can be easily resolved if such a basis was existing while framing the agreement a study at this stage will also give insight into the legitimacy of the claim 2 2 flow health model flow health model is based on those components of flow that are ecologically most relevant and only hydrologic data is required to run this model this is the main rationale for selecting this model the main advantage of these hydrologic data is its acceptability by the stakeholders of chalakkudi sub basin these data are jointly gauged by the riparian states of chalakkudi sub basin kerala and tamil nadu and hence its validity is not contested though a few studies on ecosystem of chalakkudi sub basin are available there are two issues with respect to its adoption in environmental flow assessment efa i these studies are mainly conducted by the scientists from lower riparian state kerala alone and hence do not have acceptability by all the stakeholders ii moreover these studies highlight only the rich biodiversity of the basin and there are no standard peer reviewed articles relating flows to ecosystem functionalities of the basin when pap s water sharing pact is revisited it is difficult to negotiate consideration of environmental flows if the efa is conducted based on ecosystem data observed by one party alone the water conflicts in this basin and other proposed ibwt basins are intense it is difficult for the upper and lower riparian states to have consensus on any data that are not jointly gauged or observed therefore using flow health for e flows modelling has direct linkage to the real life management decisions underway with respect to the pap revision and any other ibwt proposals flow health is an e flows modelling software which uses a suite of 9 hydrological indicators of flow that are ecologically relevant these indicators are given below gippel et al 2012 1 high flow volume hf hf is the sum of the monthly flows in the natural high flow period 2 low flow volume lf lf is the sum of the monthly flows in the natural low flow period 3 highest monthly flow hm hm is the highest monthly flow in the year 4 lowest monthly flow lm lm is the lowest monthly flow in the year 5 persistently higher flow ph ph is a measure of how many sequential months in the natural low flow season were higher than expected 6 persistently lower flow pl pl is a measure of how many sequential months were lower than expected 7 persistently very low flow pvl pvl is a measure of how many sequential months were much lower than expected 8 seasonality flow shift sfs sfs if a measure of the degree to which the seasonality of the monthly flows has been altered 9 flood flow interval ffi ffi is a measure of the time interval between the last significant flood month these nine indicators are then combined to give an overall flow health fh score comparing the distributions of the values of these indicators under reference period with that of the test period is the primary logic applied for deriving the flow health score it uses a 0 1 scale with score 0 for very large deviation and score 1 for very small deviations from the reference conditions reference period is the benchmark and its flow data are unimpaired through regulation fh components are assessed as dimensionless parameters which can be globally applied to any river system they have no specificity attached with australian scenario where this model has been developed the concept and ecological relevance of flow health indicators clausen and biggs 1997 gippel et al 2009 richter et al 1996 richter and thomas 2007 are summarized and

method the minimum monthly flow method derives the e flow regime based on achieving certain target scores for the 9 indicators or overall fh score the highest target is a flow regime that scores 1 on every indicator this would represent a very low risk e flow regime however such regimes are difficult to follow but the model can also be used to design e flow regimes with lower fh scores which certainly carry higher environmental risk in the design flow method e flow regime is designed based on achieving a certain percentage of the mean reference flow for each month this method also offers the facility of inputting the e flow requirement value estimated using a different method for example wetted perimeter method the wetted perimeter method is commonly used to make a preliminary estimate of the e flows requirement davie 2008 padikkal and rema 2013 gippel and stewardson 1998 parker and armstrong 2001 basic theory behind this method is based on the direct relationship between wetted perimeter of the stream and the habitat it supports the wetted perimeter of a stream is defined as the width of streambed and steam banks in contact with the water this is used as a measure of the availability of aquatic habitat over a range of discharges this method involves the following steps 1 survey the cross section of the river and plot it to compute wetted perimeter for different depths of flow 2 establish a stage discharge relationship for this cross section by appropriate methods 3 plot the relationship between discharge and wetted perimeter 4 observe the discharge corresponding to the point of maximum curvature of the above plot as minimum e flow requirement see figure in supplementary material 5 in this paper wetted perimeter method is used only to demonstrate the quick estimation of e flows and to compare it with the results of a detailed e flows modelling exercise using flow health this comparison would help the stakeholders of the river basin in appreciating the difference in e flows regimes designed applying different methods 2 4 input data assimilation initially daily flow data of arangaly site gdsq gauge discharge silt and water quality from 1979 to 2013 are collected the daily data of storage and outflows at each of the five major storage reservoirs for this period are then collected daily data of major diversion of flows at thumburmuzhi weir site are also collected the daily flows at arangali site are then simulated to its pristine values by using the water balance method p r i s t i n e f l o w a t a r a n g a l y c u r

site is taken as the test period flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 model default thresholds case a the running of the flow health requires the setting up of threshold values of various parameters this can be set to the user defined or default values the default thresholds and custom selected thresholds used in this study to run flow health model is presented in supplementary material 6 the length of interval after which the score is zero is the interval from the last flood where the environmental benefits from that flood no longer exist for example expecting that benefits from a flood may continue at a high level for say 4 years after a flood and then decline to a ffi score of zero after a further 4 years in which case the length of interval after which the score is zero would be 8 years the flow health analysis output table for the test period 2006 2013 is presented in table 4 refer supplementary material 7 for its visualisation the overall fh scores during this period are significantly lower indicating moderate to large deviation from that of reference hf and hm scores indicate very large variation from the reference values in every alternate test year the deviation is not uniform and it is only an accidental occurrence the lowest value of hm in reference period occurred in 1987 in every alternate test years hm was less than this lowest and hence it scored zero lf and lm are the indicators of gross habitat area availability and required minimum flows for survival of the ecosystem respectively there have consistently very large deviation from the reference ph scored 1 throughout the test period showing its very small or insignificant deviation from the reference values it also indicates the absence of an unusually wet low flow season probably due to heavy summer showers in the catchment out of the eight test years only 2006 2007 2010 and 2011 have pl scored above 0 5 it implies that the flows in the remaining test years were notably lower than the expected range for two or more consecutive months pvl scores indicate large variation from the reference values in the year 2013 pvl scored zero which is indicative of the cessation of flow in the river the threshold of 1 percentile of the reference flow that is used in this score calculation is also significant changing the threshold to a higher percentile would score zero for more number of test years in the case of an over abstracted river like chalakkudipuzha how pvl score varies when the threshold percentile is reset to a higher value is also important this is discussed in the next section with a set of model outputs obtained while using different threshold percentiles sfs scores indicate that flow pattern has been partly reversed shifting of the high and low flow seasons to other times of the year is not a favourable condition for the survival of many species but indicative of environmental degradation except for the two years of the test period shifting of flows has been significant ffi scores have not been reduced to zero in the test period it implies that the floodplain ecosystem health has not been severely impacted despite the shifting of the seasons however these scores are based on the flow health model default flood frequency of 4 years ffi scores obtained for reduced flood frequency is discussed in the next section of results 3 2 custom selected thresholds case b in this section the model outputs with some of the custom selected thresholds are discussed flow health allows setting the lower range thresholds from 5 to 40 percentiles and the pvl threshold from 1 to 10 percentiles model was run by changing these thresholds to the maximum values the custom thresholds selected are sort of extreme values to understand the degree of moderation happening with default thresholds it provides a slider to the stakeholder for deliberations on setting e flows it also illustrates the range of thresholds within which the stakeholders can have decision making on e flows this would also help understanding the cost of water to meet e flows in each case moreover it should provide a platform to deliberate on sustainable water sharing in pap setting of lower range threshold to 40 percentiles has reduced the overall fh score considerably as can be seen from table 5 and fig 4 changing the pvl threshold to 10 percentiles has resulted in very large deviation from the reference during one third of the test years this comparison with the default threshold values are also shown in fig 4 changing the flood frequency to three years has resulted in zero ffi score in the year 2013 it implies that the default interval of 48 months between threshold floods is the standard pattern during reference period 3 3 environmental flow regime now the alternatives were explored such that the score of fh reaches different level viz 1 0 8 default thresholds case a target fh score 1 minimum monthly flow that is required to meet environmental flow regime considering the target fh score as 1 is first attempted monthly environmental flow regime designed based on minimum monthly flows is compared with the current flows in table 6 and fig 5 additional flow volume required to meet this regime in a year is 92 mm3 extra flow volume required to keep an ffi score of 1 and a return period of 4 years is 213 mm3 as can be seen from the fig 6 fig 6 is the model output modified with appropriate legends and numerical values for better readability default thresholds target fh score 0 8 minimum monthly flows for a target fh score of 0 8 is designed next monthly environmental flow regime designed based on minimum monthly flows is compared with the current flows in columns 3 and 4 of table 6 and fig 5 additional flow volume required to meet this regime in a year is 83 5 mm3 extra flow volume required to keep an ffi score of 0 6 with a return period of 5 years is 249 mm3 a large value of extra flow volume for a lower score is justifiable as the second half of test year period were relatively drier than the first half custom thresholds case b target fh scores 1 and 0 8 now the designing of e flow regime for the custom thresholds is done for a target fh score of 1 and 0 8 the minimum monthly flows method has suggested an additional flow requirement of 391 mm3 and 193 mm3 respectively the minimum monthly flow regimes based on custom thresholds are given in table 7 and fig 5 custom selected thresholds imply very high standards and hence naturally the additional flow requirement is very high it also implies that practically no water is available for inter basin transfer if these standards are followed strictly wetted perimeter method design flow design flow method of monthly e flow regime can select any values for the monthly flows perhaps derived by a different method here the wetted perimeter method is used to make a preliminary estimate of e flows the river cross section at arangali site was surveyed using a total station and is plotted in fig 7 cross section profile during pre monsoon and post monsoon have been plotted to compute the wetted perimeter based on the stage discharge relationship already established at this site the graph in fig 8 is plotted the discernible breakpoint in the wetted perimeter discharge relationship has given an estimate of 100 m3 s the design flow method of flow health is now used with the estimated discharge of 100 cumecs to suggest a monthly flow regime it is also checked for the fh score the fh score obtained is only 0 82 but the monthly flow regime is very expensive as can be seen from table 8 and fig 9 it implies that the estimate based on wetted perimeter method is very high in this case and is not economical to take it for e flow regime design however the fh scores that can be achieved for a range of lower threshold discharges can also be computed using design flow method similarly the possibility of obtaining a lower threshold discharge from other cross sections of this river with discernible breakpoints can also be explored these options would provide the alternate e flow regimes that can also be considered the e flows requirement of this basin is now computed in three ways firstly the default thresholds of flow health are used secondly the custom selected thresholds are used thirdly the design flow method with wetted perimeter application is used the results obtained under these three methods are significantly different because different standards are being used in each method for the practical purpose of river management the e flows regime designed using default thresholds appears to be more reasonable the additional flow volume required to maintain e flows regime with fh score 1 and 0 8 under the custom thresholds are 390 4 mm3 and 192 7 mm3 respectively this is a substantial volume of water restricting the e flow regimes to either of these two would make the ibwt under pap practically impossible for the sake of maintaining e flows revoking a water sharing pact on ibwt is not possible in the current socio political scenario of the basin therefore the e flows regime designed using default thresholds appears to be more reasonable nevertheless a final decision on this should come out of stakeholder engagement process 4 conclusion the current study used data from one of the river basins of the southern peninsular india viz chalakkudi in demonstrating the ability of the flow health model and its component scores in representing the significant variation from the pristine scenario of this basin flow health suggests a better methodology for environmental flow assessment efa based on all components of flow which are ecologically relevant and is not simply based on lean flow alone this is of importance when detailed species types and its flow variability requirements for sustainability are not scientifically correlated and established as a database important findings of this study are this study has shown that a monthly environmental flow regime with fh score 1 very small deviation from the reference conditions is possible for the basin and it requires an additional augmentation of flows annually by 92 mm3 the environmental flow regimes for different fh scores with custom threshold values of flow health have also been designed this can be useful in presenting to the stakeholders in a multi stakeholder engagement process msep to decide on the river rejuvenation program the default thresholds were modified to the highest possible standards to identify the extreme flow values additional flow requirement under this extreme condition is 391 mm3 however the optimum fh score to be targeted may have to be decided in the msep e flow modelling results obtained here using flow health would facilitate discussion on alternate scenarios and its associated environmental risks during the msep the results of the study could be made the base for

1139,ecohydrological modelling and prescribing environmental flows e flows is significant in the integrated water resources management iwrm practice however for many river basins there is lack of data on ecosystems and on the relationships between e flows and ecosystem functioning this lack of sufficient ecosystem data is mostly addressed in ecohydrological modelling by using hydrological metrics as surrogates of river ecosystem in this study we are demonstrating how it helps e flows modelling and real life management decisions underway with respect to inter basin water transfer ibwt projects desktop model flow health is used here to design e flows regime for chalakkudi sub basin in southern peninsular india chalakkudi sub basin is over abstracted with six large dams built as components of the parambikulam aliyar project pap asia s largest ibwt network the monthly e flow regimes required to maintain alternate levels of ecosystem conservation are estimated in this paper the additional flood flow volume required for these alternate levels is also discussed the results are useful in the stakeholder engagement process for informed decision making on e flows and redefining the ibwt operations within a broad framework of iwrm 1 introduction the importance of rivers and its ecosystems in delivering integrated water resources management iwrm solutions has been widely appreciated in the recent past sustainable management of rivers is an essential prerequisite for the conservation of its ecosystems however over abstraction of water from rivers is an increasing concern today millennium ecosystem assessment millennium assessment board 2005 has observed that 15 35 of irrigation withdrawal exceeds supply rates and are therefore unsustainable historically river managers have focused on maximising the short term economic growth from the use of water the iwrm paradigm now emphasizes the need to take care of aquatic ecosystems for long term economic viability dyson et al 2003 restoring the over abstracted rivers and their ecosystems to its pristine condition may not be possible in most of the situations but they can be brought back closer to this condition by modifying the river flows scientifically environmental flows e flows modelling in the case of hydrologically altered rivers is the methodology for identifying the volume of river flows required to mimic the pristine flow variabilities over different periods of a year in general e flows refer to the hydrological regime required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and wellbeing that depend on them webb et al 2012 banks and docker 2013 hirji et al 2009 jain and kumar 2014 overton et al 2014 saintilan et al 2010 gippel et al 2012 warner et al 2014 it is the natural pattern of high and low flows that maintain ecosystems in a less than pristine condition critical factors that maintain river ecosystems are quantity quality timing and its duration of lean flow together with the flood flows therefore e flows are different from natural flows minimum flows or the average flows nevertheless river rejuvenation cannot be ensured just by providing adequate e flows the key idea is to recognize it as an integral part of modern river management and restoration processes ecohydrology is the new paradigm for sustainability zalewski 2014 ecohydrological approach in the assessment of e flows has therefore gained momentum in this approach the quantity as well as quality of water is equally important there are many hydrological water quality models available now connecting the flows and the ecosystem functioning singh vijay et al 2006 creams a field scale model for chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems consists of three components hydrology erosion sedimentation and chemistry answers areal nonpoint source watershed environmental simulation simulates the impacts of watershed management practices on runoff sediment and nutrient losses hspf hydrological simulation program fortran simulates hydrologic and water quality processes in natural and man made water systems the purpose of mike she another popular model is the simulation of coupled hydrologic processes with emphasis on surface water ground water interactions channel flow unsaturated zone flow and groundwater flow the moneris modelling nutrient emissions in river systems model developed by icpdr international commission for protection of danube river calculates the emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus to the surface water by different pathways as well as the in stream retention in the surface water network icpdr 2007 basins is an extensible open source gis based decision support system that integrates watershed models with ready access to data flow meteorological water quality and various gis layers very recently swat soil and water assessment tool has become a much more popular hydrologic model in this category in the quality aspect sediment load of flowing water is an important ecosystem services parameter spnm sediment phosphorous nitrogen model can simulate the sediment phosphorous and nitrogen yields from agricultural basins it is designed to predict sediment phosphorous and nitrogen yields for individual storms on small basins and to route these yields through streams and valleys of large basins williams 1980 kourgialas and karatzas 2014 has developed a hydro sedimentary modelling system for flash flood propagation and hazard estimation under different agricultural practices riparian vegetation s effect on flood propagation parameters such as inundation depth discharge flow velocity and sediment transport load can be investigated using this model though sediment load is an important ecosystem services parameter lack of detailed data on sediment loads is a common situation in many regions of the world as the e flows and sediment load are inextricably linked special efforts should be made in the future to improve long term data bases on sediment transport and develop a better knowledge of temporal and spatial patterns of sediment transport variability batalla and sala 1994 assessment of the e flows for ecosystem sustainability is a very complex exercise ideally ecologists and hydrologists must work together for a comprehensive assessment of e flows but for most of the e flows studies particularly in india unavailability of ecological data is critical however as observed in the study assessment of environmental flows for the upper ganga basin in india lack of information and resources should never be a barrier to the implementation of e flows some attempt to restore the natural flow variability is always better than none and fine tuning can be done as more knowledge and resources become available over time o keeffe et al 2012 this lack of sufficient ecosystem data is mostly addressed by using hydrological metrics as surrogates of river ecosystem gippel et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 the changing role of ecohydrological sciences in modelling the ecosystem and prescribing e flows regimes are increasingly recognized as key basic concept in the literature on e flows linking it with current water management frameworks such as iwrm eia environmental impact assessment eco flood ecological benefits of flood ea ecosystem approach eco drr ecosystem based disaster risk reduction etc is the thrust area of e flows research there are many open source and commercial software available today aiding the e flows modelling these tools differ mainly in their approach to the design of flow regimes some of them are purely based on the linkages of hydrological metrics with the ecosystem functions rather some others have the capability of inputting and analysing site specific species data too table 1 illustrates a few examples of both these types the hydrological metrics based methods are preferred over the other type owing to the detailed species data requirement which are difficult to obtain gippel et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 flow health iha and eflow predictor work based on hydrological metrics but flow health has certain specific advantages its ability to design monthly e flows regime is the first one among these advantages with respect to the practical aspects of implementing e flows a monthly regime is important flow health provides an additional option of comparing scores of different flow regimes this is particularly useful when the stakeholders want to do the cost benefit analysis of each e flow regime and compare in addition to this flow health can design the e flow regime determined using any other method and predict its score in a stakeholder engagement process on deciding the e flows to be maintained all these factors are important chalakkudi sub basin is an over abstracted small basin with six large dams built across its different tributaries its present status of flows indicate large deviation from the pristine condition no scientific studies on e flows assessment has been carried out in this basin because of this lacuna the concept of e flows is not being recognized in its current water management paradigm the river is also linked with the neighbouring basins periyar and bharathapuzha for inter basin water transfer ibwt under a water sharing agreement this ibwt agreement was also made without considering the e flows requirements the chalakkudi sub basin restoration campaigners accuse that the environmental degradation of this river was mainly attributed by the parambikulam aliyar project pap and its water sharing the environmental governance of the chalakkudi sub basin requires the revision of pap s water sharing terms with proper accounting for the e flows requirements to revise this agreement and its water sharing it has become a prerequisite to scientifically assess the e flow regime the river restoration campaigns by the civil society have also raised the pressing need for e flows design and its implementation therefore e flows modelling of chalakkudi sub basin has become an immediate requirement many stakeholder engagement processes were held in the past revisiting pap s water sharing pact for the actual conservation and restoration of this river system one of the main points being raised in these consultation processes was the urgency of incorporating environmental flow needs into pap s water sharing compact e flows have been generally recognized as a legal requirement in india but precise guidelines on assessment of e flows being multi disciplinary in nature is still at evolving stage in india the broad allocation principles being followed at present for hydropower projects are based on the study carried out by wildlife institute of india wii i e 20 of monthly average of flow during dry season november to march 25 of monthly average of flow from october to april and 30 of monthly average of high flow season from may to september however all these are crude estimation and are being criticized by many experts the present study using flow health model illustrates how clearly e flows can be designed based on the current status of the crucial e flows components especially when ecological data is lacking missing adequate ecological data is a general case for many rivers in india jain 2015 observes a there is lack of data on ecosystems and the relationships between flows and ecosystem functioning are not available b data and studies on values of ecosystem services are also lacking and similar efforts have to be made in this direction though multiple studies have been conducted on chalakkudi sub basin they all highlight only the importance of biodiversity but no specific relationships between flows and ecosystem functioning are available providing a methodology for assessment of e flows in the absence of ecosystem data is the prime objective of this paper thereby significantly contributing to the e flows assessment methodology evolution in india is its secondary objective 2 materials and methods 2 1 chalakkudi sub basin the rivers in india are grouped into 20 basin systems at the national level west flowing rivers from tadri to kanyakumari wfrtk composite basin encompasses 54 rivers and is put together as one of these basin systems periyar and others is a sub basin of this basin system chalakkudi sub basin is also included in this sub basin cwc nrsc 2014 fig 1 shows the sub basin and its location in peninsular india chalakkudi sub basin is located between the 76 20 0 and 77 0 0 e and 10 10 0 and 10 30 0 n average rainfall in this basin based on observed data of four sub catchments parambikulam thunacadavu peruvaripallam and thekkadi ar from 1966 to 2015 is 1775 mm it shows an increasing trend fig 2 the average minimum and maximum temperature in chalakkudi sub basin are 17 83 c and 33 25 c respectively this river originates at anamalai hills in western ghats at an elevation of 1250 m it has a length of 145 km with basin area approximately 1700 km2 this river and neighbourhood have a very rich biodiversity and is identified as a hotspot of western ghats mainly this river is famous for its fish diversity it has 104 species of fish the highest among rivers in kerala and one of the highest in india the abundance of fish wealth has decreased considerably over the past half century fragmentation of the river course by dams reduction in riparian forest stretches sand mining etc have contributed to this the national bureau of fish genetic resources has recommended that the upper reaches of the river should be declared a fish sanctuary latha et al 2012 about 16 species of fish fauna of this river are endangered and 4 are critically endangered it has been reported that three of the critically endangered are strictly endemic to chalakkudi sub basin system raghavan et al 2008 the riparian vegetation also includes endemic species of flowering plants of western ghats six major storage reservoirs have been constructed across various tributaries of this river marked as 1 6 in fig 1 salient features of these reservoirs are given in table 2 all these storage reservoirs except poringalkuthu are a part of pap pap is an inter basin water transfer ibwt project under this project chalakkudi sub basin is a receiver as well as donor it receives water from the adjacent basin periyar and it donates water to the next basin bharathapuzha there is an interstate water sharing agreement on pap the chalakkudi basin s hydrologic alteration caused by pap is significant how the current mean monthly discharge is different from the pristine monthly discharge is given in table 3 and fig 3 iha indicators of hydrological alteration analysis of the current flow regime using reconstructed naturalized hydrograph before commissioning of pap reveals it these results are presented as supplementary material 1 hydrologic alteration of the indicators in middle and high rva category are phenomenal most important flow component with respect to ecological relevance extreme low flow is also significantly altered this is evident from the relevant iha output graph presented as supplementary material 2 when originally contemplated pap s water sharing agreement was cited as an example of inter basin and interstate cooperation but recently this agreement has turned out to be a point of conflict this is mainly due to the inequities in water sharing being surfaced in the changed socio economic and environmental scenarios in both the states also this conflict has resulted from the fact that no scientific study on the e flows on the basin was carried out at the inception of agreement or later hence these conflicts can be easily resolved if such a basis was existing while framing the agreement a study at this stage will also give insight into the legitimacy of the claim 2 2 flow health model flow health model is based on those components of flow that are ecologically most relevant and only hydrologic data is required to run this model this is the main rationale for selecting this model the main advantage of these hydrologic data is its acceptability by the stakeholders of chalakkudi sub basin these data are jointly gauged by the riparian states of chalakkudi sub basin kerala and tamil nadu and hence its validity is not contested though a few studies on ecosystem of chalakkudi sub basin are available there are two issues with respect to its adoption in environmental flow assessment efa i these studies are mainly conducted by the scientists from lower riparian state kerala alone and hence do not have acceptability by all the stakeholders ii moreover these studies highlight only the rich biodiversity of the basin and there are no standard peer reviewed articles relating flows to ecosystem functionalities of the basin when pap s water sharing pact is revisited it is difficult to negotiate consideration of environmental flows if the efa is conducted based on ecosystem data observed by one party alone the water conflicts in this basin and other proposed ibwt basins are intense it is difficult for the upper and lower riparian states to have consensus on any data that are not jointly gauged or observed therefore using flow health for e flows modelling has direct linkage to the real life management decisions underway with respect to the pap revision and any other ibwt proposals flow health is an e flows modelling software which uses a suite of 9 hydrological indicators of flow that are ecologically relevant these indicators are given below gippel et al 2012 1 high flow volume hf hf is the sum of the monthly flows in the natural high flow period 2 low flow volume lf lf is the sum of the monthly flows in the natural low flow period 3 highest monthly flow hm hm is the highest monthly flow in the year 4 lowest monthly flow lm lm is the lowest monthly flow in the year 5 persistently higher flow ph ph is a measure of how many sequential months in the natural low flow season were higher than expected 6 persistently lower flow pl pl is a measure of how many sequential months were lower than expected 7 persistently very low flow pvl pvl is a measure of how many sequential months were much lower than expected 8 seasonality flow shift sfs sfs if a measure of the degree to which the seasonality of the monthly flows has been altered 9 flood flow interval ffi ffi is a measure of the time interval between the last significant flood month these nine indicators are then combined to give an overall flow health fh score comparing the distributions of the values of these indicators under reference period with that of the test period is the primary logic applied for deriving the flow health score it uses a 0 1 scale with score 0 for very large deviation and score 1 for very small deviations from the reference conditions reference period is the benchmark and its flow data are unimpaired through regulation fh components are assessed as dimensionless parameters which can be globally applied to any river system they have no specificity attached with australian scenario where this model has been developed the concept and ecological relevance of flow health indicators clausen and biggs 1997 gippel et al 2009 richter et al 1996 richter and thomas 2007 are summarized and presented in supplementary material 3 default thresholds and its scoring pattern for hf lf hm and lm are illustrated in supplementary material 4 the general equations for calculating their scores with

method the minimum monthly flow method derives the e flow regime based on achieving certain target scores for the 9 indicators or overall fh score the highest target is a flow regime that scores 1 on every indicator this would represent a very low risk e flow regime however such regimes are difficult to follow but the model can also be used to design e flow regimes with lower fh scores which certainly carry higher environmental risk in the design flow method e flow regime is designed based on achieving a certain percentage of the mean reference flow for each month this method also offers the facility of inputting the e flow requirement value estimated using a different method for example wetted perimeter method the wetted perimeter method is commonly used to make a preliminary estimate of the e flows requirement davie 2008 padikkal and rema 2013 gippel and stewardson 1998 parker and armstrong 2001 basic theory behind this method is based on the direct relationship between wetted perimeter of the stream and the habitat it supports the wetted perimeter of a stream is defined as the width of streambed and steam banks in contact with the water this is used as a measure of the availability of aquatic habitat over a range of discharges this method involves the following steps 1 survey the cross section of the river and plot it to compute wetted perimeter for different depths of flow 2 establish a stage discharge relationship for this cross section by appropriate methods 3 plot the relationship between discharge and wetted perimeter 4 observe the discharge corresponding to the point of maximum curvature of the above plot as minimum e flow requirement see figure in supplementary material 5 in this paper wetted perimeter method is used only to demonstrate the quick estimation of e flows and to compare it with the results of a detailed e flows modelling exercise using flow health this comparison would help the stakeholders of the river basin in appreciating the difference in e flows regimes designed applying different methods 2 4 input data assimilation initially daily flow data of arangaly site gdsq gauge discharge silt and water quality from 1979 to 2013 are collected the daily data of storage and outflows at each of the five major storage reservoirs for this period are then collected daily data of major diversion of flows at thumburmuzhi weir site are also collected the daily flows at arangali site are then simulated to its pristine values by using the water balance method p r i s t i n e f l o w a t a r a n g a l y c u r

site is taken as the test period flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 model default thresholds case a the running of the flow health requires the setting up of threshold values of various parameters this can be set to the user defined or default values the default thresholds and custom selected thresholds used in this study to run flow health model is presented in supplementary material 6 the length of interval after which the score is zero is the interval from the last flood where the environmental benefits from that flood no longer exist for example expecting that benefits from a flood may continue at a high level for say 4 years after a flood and then decline to a ffi score of zero after a further 4 years in which case the length of interval after which the score is zero would be 8 years the flow health analysis output table for the test period 2006 2013 is presented in table 4 refer supplementary material 7 for its visualisation the overall fh scores during this period are significantly lower indicating moderate to large deviation from that of reference hf and hm scores indicate very large variation from the reference values in every alternate test year the deviation is not uniform and it is only an accidental occurrence the lowest value of hm in reference period occurred in 1987 in every alternate test years hm was less than this lowest and hence it scored zero lf and lm are the indicators of gross habitat area availability and required minimum flows for survival of the ecosystem respectively there have consistently very large deviation from the reference ph scored 1 throughout the test period showing its very small or insignificant deviation from the reference values it also indicates the absence of an unusually wet low flow season probably due to heavy summer showers in the catchment out of the eight test years only 2006 2007 2010 and 2011 have pl scored above 0 5 it implies that the flows in the remaining test years were notably lower than the expected range for two or more consecutive months pvl scores indicate large variation from the reference values in the year 2013 pvl scored zero which is indicative of the cessation of flow in the river the threshold of 1 percentile of the reference flow that is used in this score calculation is also significant changing the threshold to a higher percentile would score zero for more number of test years in the case of an over abstracted river like chalakkudipuzha how pvl score varies when the threshold percentile is reset to a higher value is also important this is discussed in the next section with a set of model outputs obtained while using different threshold percentiles sfs scores indicate that flow pattern has been partly reversed shifting of the high and low flow seasons to other times of the year is not a favourable condition for the survival of many species but indicative of environmental degradation except for the two years of the test period shifting of flows has been significant ffi scores have not been reduced to zero in the test period it implies that the floodplain ecosystem health has not been severely impacted despite the shifting of the seasons however these scores are based on the flow health model default flood frequency of 4 years ffi scores obtained for reduced flood frequency is discussed in the next section of results 3 2 custom selected thresholds case b in this section the model outputs with some of the custom selected thresholds are discussed flow health allows setting the lower range thresholds from 5 to 40 percentiles and the pvl threshold from 1 to 10 percentiles model was run by changing these thresholds to the maximum values the custom thresholds selected are sort of extreme values to understand the degree of moderation happening with default thresholds it provides a slider to the stakeholder for deliberations on setting e flows it also illustrates the range of thresholds within which the stakeholders can have decision making on e flows this would also help understanding the cost of water to meet e flows in each case moreover it should provide a platform to deliberate on sustainable water sharing in pap setting of lower range threshold to 40 percentiles has reduced the overall fh score considerably as can be seen from table 5 and fig 4 changing the pvl threshold to 10 percentiles has resulted in very large deviation from the reference during one third of the test years this comparison with the default threshold values are also shown in fig 4 changing the flood frequency to three years has resulted in zero ffi score in the year 2013 it implies that the default interval of 48 months between threshold floods is the standard pattern during reference period 3 3 environmental flow regime now the alternatives were explored such that the score of fh reaches different level viz 1 0 8 default thresholds case a target fh score 1 minimum monthly flow that is required to meet environmental flow regime considering the target fh score as 1 is first attempted monthly environmental flow regime designed based on minimum monthly flows is compared with the current flows in table 6 and fig 5 additional flow volume required to meet this regime in a year is 92 mm3 extra flow volume required to keep an ffi score of 1 and a return period of 4 years is 213 mm3 as can be seen from the fig 6 fig 6 is the model output modified with appropriate legends and numerical values for better readability default thresholds target fh score 0 8 minimum monthly flows for a target fh score of 0 8 is designed next monthly environmental flow regime designed based on minimum monthly flows is compared with the current flows in columns 3 and 4 of table 6 and fig 5 additional flow volume required to meet this regime in a year is 83 5 mm3 extra flow volume required to keep an ffi score of 0 6 with a return period of 5 years is 249 mm3 a large value of extra flow volume for a lower score is justifiable as the second half of test year period were relatively drier than the first half custom thresholds case b target fh scores 1 and 0 8 now the designing of e flow regime for the custom thresholds is done for a target fh score of 1 and 0 8 the minimum monthly flows method has suggested an additional flow requirement of 391 mm3 and 193 mm3 respectively the minimum monthly flow regimes based on custom thresholds are given in table 7 and fig 5 custom selected thresholds imply very high standards and hence naturally the additional flow requirement is very high it also implies that practically no water is available for inter basin transfer if these standards are followed strictly wetted perimeter method design flow design flow method of monthly e flow regime can select any values for the monthly flows perhaps derived by a different method here the wetted perimeter method is used to make a preliminary estimate of e flows the river cross section at arangali site was surveyed using a total station and is plotted in fig 7 cross section profile during pre monsoon and post monsoon have been plotted to compute the wetted perimeter based on the stage discharge relationship already established at this site the graph in fig 8 is plotted the discernible breakpoint in the wetted perimeter discharge relationship has given an estimate of 100 m3 s the design flow method of flow health is now used with the estimated discharge of 100 cumecs to suggest a monthly flow regime it is also checked for the fh score the fh score obtained is only 0 82 but the monthly flow regime is very expensive as can be seen from table 8 and fig 9 it implies that the estimate based on wetted perimeter method is very high in this case and is not economical to take it for e flow regime design however the fh scores that can be achieved for a range of lower threshold discharges can also be computed using design flow method similarly the possibility of obtaining a lower threshold discharge from other cross sections of this river with discernible breakpoints can also be explored these options would provide the alternate e flow regimes that can also be considered the e flows requirement of this basin is now computed in three ways firstly the default thresholds of flow health are used secondly the custom selected thresholds are used thirdly the design flow method with wetted perimeter application is used the results obtained under these three methods are significantly different because different standards are being used in each method for the practical purpose of river management the e flows regime designed using default thresholds appears to be more reasonable the additional flow volume required to maintain e flows regime with fh score 1 and 0 8 under the custom thresholds are 390 4 mm3 and 192 7 mm3 respectively this is a substantial volume of water restricting the e flow regimes to either of these two would make the ibwt under pap practically impossible for the sake of maintaining e flows revoking a water sharing pact on ibwt is not possible in the current socio political scenario of the basin therefore the e flows regime designed using default thresholds appears to be more reasonable nevertheless a final decision on this should come out of stakeholder engagement process 4 conclusion the current study used data from one of the river basins of the southern peninsular india viz chalakkudi in demonstrating the ability of the flow health model and its component scores in representing the significant variation from the pristine scenario of this basin flow health suggests a better methodology for environmental flow assessment efa based on all components of flow which are ecologically relevant and is not simply based on lean flow alone this is of importance when detailed species types and its flow variability requirements for sustainability are not scientifically correlated and established as a database important findings of this study are this study has shown that a monthly environmental flow regime with fh score 1 very small deviation from the reference conditions is possible for the basin and it requires an additional augmentation of flows annually by 92 mm3 the environmental flow regimes for different fh scores with custom threshold values of flow health have also been designed this can be useful in presenting to the stakeholders in a multi stakeholder engagement process msep to decide on the river rejuvenation program the default thresholds were modified to the highest possible standards to identify the extreme flow values additional flow requirement under this extreme condition is 391 mm3 however the optimum fh score to be targeted may have to be decided in the msep e flow modelling results obtained here using flow health would facilitate discussion on alternate scenarios and its associated environmental risks during the msep the results of the study could be made the base for
