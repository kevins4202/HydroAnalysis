11070,a six year study was carried out to assess the effects of deficit di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies on yield and water use efficiency of two hybrids of asparagus asparagus officinalis l hybrids grande and italo in a typical semi arid mediterranean environment of southern italy the experimental setup consisted of full irrigation irr restoration of 100 of the crop evapotranspiration etc di restoration of 50 of etc from the first fern flush until the end of the growing season and two rdi 1 no irrigation supply from the first fern flush crop development stage more sensitive to water stress until end of the growing season rdi1 2 no irrigation supply from the second fern flush until the end of the growing season rdi2 treatments the relationships between yield and water regimes in the multi year dataset were analyzed using linear mixed effect models lmm taking into account residual autocorrelation and comparing different variance covariance structures irrigation treatments affected significantly the asparagus productivity the six year average yield was highest under irr treatment 6 4 t ha 1 and lowest under rdi1 treatment 4 4 t ha 1 in comparison with irr treatment di reduced etc by 20 and yield by 13 6 season average six year average yields were similar in di and rdi2 treatments 5 6 and 5 4 t ha 1 respectively asparagus yield varied with hybrid italo hybrid showed higher yield performances 5 6 t ha 1 respect to grande 5 3 t ha 1 the soil water deficit tolerance assessed through the yield response factor ky of the marketable yield was 0 61 and this value indicates that asparagus is mildly negatively affected by sub optimal irrigation regimes on the contrary irrigation water use efficiency wuei was clearly affected by the experimental treatment wuei was higher 2 8 kg m 3 if asparagus experiences the soil water shortage during the first fern flush rdi1 operatively full irrigation maximizes asparagus marketable yield while reduced irrigation volume di or rdi2 treatments seems a promising strategy since it allowed reducing on average the irrigation volume supplies by 34 with asparagus marketable yield loss by 13 keywords water balance crop evapotranspiration crop management linear mixed effects models lmm residual autocorrelation 1 introduction the united nations food and agricultural organization estimates that the world currently uses about 70 of available fresh water for irrigation fao 2017 nowadays traditional irrigation practice i e full irrigation is considered as luxury water consumption for crop production due to limited irrigation water resources in many areas of the world chai et al 2016 an ideal irrigation management should significantly reduce water consumption without losing crop yield pereira et al 2002 there are several water saving practices including deficit irrigation di regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying consoli et al 2017 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 di is an approach that uniformly reduces the applied irrigation below the crop water requirement throughout the growing season capra et al 2008 oweis et al 2011 rdi provides adequate water only during critical growth periods that may affect yields kirda 2002 katerji et al 2008 favorable weather conditions solar radiation and temperature in semi arid climates e g mediterranean basin have allowed the spread of most horticultural crops patanè et al 2011 in these environments di and rdi would allow saving water resources and increasing water productivity oweis and zhang 1998 the study of the effects of the di and rdi requires experimental trials which allow both to identify the relationship between water saving and crop productivity and quantifying water use efficiency oweis and hachum 2001 however the effects of di and rdi at farm scale are site specific depending on the climate and the soil type katerji and mastrorilli 2009 therefore it is important to assess the impact of deficit irrigation strategies with multi year experiments before suggesting the most appropriate irrigation scheduling method to be adopted in any location for a given crop scholberg et al 2000 igbadun et al 2008 moreover the statistical treatment of data from a multi year experiment in particular when involves perennial crops requires appropriate data analysis repeated measurements such as traits measured over the same experimental unit may give rise to correlations that need to be accounted for in statistical analysis piepho et al 2004 in these cases failure to account for residual autocorrelation over space and time in classical analysis of variance and standard linear models may cause inefficient estimation of treatment significance hong et al 2005 this increases the risk of misleading or erroneous inferences hu and spilke 2009 asparagus asparagus officinalis l is a typical perennial crop thus suitable statistical models allowing to take into account residual autocorrelation should be adopted to correctly and comprehensively analyze multi year experimental data the handling of complex models that allow to structure correlations decreasing with the distance in time or space has become feasible in the framework of the mixed model theory using maximum likelihood ml or restricted maximum likelihood reml ritcher and kroschewski 2006 for the availability of correlation variance covariance models more parsimonious than the one implied by manova in glm and for the facility to accommodate several error terms verbeke and molenberghs 2000 in the mediterranean area the growing season of asparagus coincides with the period in which the climate water deficit is the highest consequently asparagus requires irrigation for assuring the productivity in the following harvest seasons few studies have been carried out on asparagus response to di and mainly under climatic conditions different from those of semi arid mediterranean environments such as the research from drost and wilcox lee 1997a and b in usa for this reason their results cannot be easily generalized since this species is recognized as an alternative to current vegetable cropping systems in the mediterranean area spain italy france and greece knowledge on asparagus water requirements merits to be revised for defining appropriate irrigation strategies through systematic studies falavigna and palumbo 2001 research on asparagus irrigation is mainly focused on increasing spear number roth and gardner 1991 takatori et al 1970 and spear size hartmann et al 1990 yield increases associated with irrigation are considered to depend on the increased carbohydrate levels from a greater fern growth hartmann et al 1990 takatori et al 1970 though asparagus is considered a drought tolerant crop drost 1996 water stresses negatively affect the yield and quality yield and quality worsen in terms of decreasing spear size and spear number per plant and increasing spear fiber percentage moreover at a long time scale the asparagus stand duration tends to decrease wilcox lee 1987 wilson et al 1996 with the increase of stress periods during the vegetative seasons from the analysis of the literature above reported a question arises is it possible to apply deficit irrigation strategies on asparagus crop reducing the yield losses the aim of this paper is to evaluate respect to the full irrigation the effects of different deficit irrigation strategies di and rdi on asparagus crop in a mediterranean environment during a six year field study the selected agronomic criteria for comparing the irrigation strategies on asparagus response were seasonal evapotranspiration yield and agronomic perry 2011 water use efficiency wue represented by amount of produced yield using the water unit volume in terms of irrigation wuei or crop evapotranspiration wueet for a deeper understanding of the relationships among yield response to different water regimes in a multi year dataset the mixed model theory is proposed to analyze the yield data such theory allows to structure correlations decreasing with the distance in time or space ritcher and kroschewski 2006 and to efficiently estimate treatment significance 2 materials and methods 2 1 the site the experimental trial was located at rutigliano a karstic area in southern italy lat 40 59 n long 17 01 e alt 147 m a s l in the experimental farm belonging to the council for agricultural research and economics crea before the transplanting soil was sampled from each block in five replicates to determine the physico chemical characteristics no significant difference was identified between the two blocks and average physico chemical characteristics of soil were reported in table 1 soil texture was classified as clay loam u s dept of agriculture a soil survey staff 1975 at 0 6 m of depth is present a parent rock that reduces the capacity of the root systems to expand beyond this layer the experimental site is under the mediterranean climate characterized by warm and dry summers with minimum and maximum annual air temperature ranging from 0 to 5 c and 32 43 c respectively and minimum and maximum relative humidity ranging from 40 15 and 90 100 the annual rainfall is 535 mm it is mainly concentrated in the autumn and late winter periods and it is greatly reduced or absent in the spring summer period campi et al 2012 as a consequence the effective precipitation does not meet the reference evapotranspiration et0 requirements from april to september table 2 the annual average 1984 2006 value of the differences between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration p et0 is 560 mm therefore from april to september most species can be cultivated successfully only by supplying irrigation water campi et al 2016 2 2 crop management and experimental design asparagus seedlings were transplanted in the 2005 season june 29th the final density was 2 5 plants m 2 plant spacing of 1 2 m between the rows and 0 33 m within the row the annual mineral fertilizer supply was 120 kg ha 1 n 90 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 60 kg ha 1 k2o weed control pests and diseases with particular regard to puccinia asparagi and stemphylium vesicarium were managed as needed the treatments consisted of two high yielding hybrids grande walker brothers inc from u s a early and vigorous growth adapted under warm climate conditions and italo horteck srl from italy particularly adapted in semi arid conditions and resistant to rust and four irrigation regimes irr the control treatment which restored 100 of crop evapotranspiration the irrigation occurs when ready water availability is exhausted in average once per week in according to allen et al 1998 methodology in particular the tabulated crop coefficients kcini 0 15 kcmed 0 90 kcend 0 20 and depletion fraction value of 0 45 were adopted correction of kcini for precipitation events kcmed and kcend for climatic conditions and crop height was performed according to allen et al 1998 methodology di deficit irrigation irrigation volume reduced by 50 of the control treatment from the first fern flush end of june until the end of the growing season end of september rdi1 regulated deficit irrigation withholding the irrigation supply from the first fern flush end of june until the end of the growing season end of september in average after n 6 irrigation events rdi2 regulated deficit irrigation withholding the irrigation supply from the second fern flush about in the first half of august until the end of the growing season end of september in average after n 11 irrigation events during the crop development seasons 2005 and 2006 1 and 2 years old the irrigation was uniformly applied and scheduled for maintaining the soil under optimal moisture conditions the experimental irrigation treatments were differentiated from full development of crop 3 years old drip irrigation system was adopted with the flow rate of 4 l h 1 per dripper applied to a 0 33 m dripper spacing seasonal irrigation volumes depth mm and number irrigation events n applied for each treatment are reported in table 2 treatments were arranged under a complete block design with four replicates plot size was 40 m2 while the harvest was performed excluding the border plants so the distances between harvest area 29 m2 have been set to avoid the horizontal flow of the water between the treatments relative coordinates of the plot center were recorded to verify the existence of spatial residual autocorrelation 2 3 measurements daily crop evapotranspiration etc mm was estimated by means of water balance equation lhomme and katerji 1991 from may until september for each season runoff and capillary rise are negligible because of the flat ground and the presence of a cracked rocky layer that limits the soil depth 0 60 m the simplified equation for the soil water balance can be expressed at a daily scale as 1 etc δwc p i dr where etc crop water evapotranspiration mm d 1 p effective precipitation mm d 1 i irrigation mm d 1 δwc the difference in volume of soil water content in the whole soil profile mm d 1 explored by the root system measured with tdr time domain reflectometry probes dr drainage mm d 1 dr was estimated as the amount of water exceeding the maximum water capacity in the entire soil profile the seasonal water consumption etc was obtained by cumulating the daily values of etc however roots and water can infiltrate through the cracked layer and go beyond the area were changes in soil moisture were evaluated top 60 cm thus the calculated etc is referred to the 0 6 m top soil layer six tdr coaxial probes 0 3 m in length were installed horizontally into the soil and transversely in the row at 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m from the soil surface only in plots of italo hybrid under irr and di treatments in order to intercept the dynamics of soil water content below the dripping lines the probes were linked to tdr100 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa soil specific calibration curves were used to calculate the volumetric soil water content daily soil water content for the soil profile 0 6 m was determined as an integral of the values measured for each depth since a probe is supposed to detect the water content in a 0 2 m soil layer 2 0 0 6 w c w c 0 1 m 3 m 3 0 2 m w c 0 3 m 3 m 3 0 2 m w c 0 5 m 3 m 3 0 2 m the approach used to measure daily et was previously validated at the same experimental site by mastrorilli et al 1998 in diverse soil water conditions by comparing on a daily scale the et from equation 1 and et measured by the bowen ratio method rana and katerji 2009 differences within 10 15 were measured between the daily et determined by the two independent methods mastrorilli et al 1998 asparagus harvestings were carried out every 2 3 days from mid march until the first week of may depending on weather conditions asparagus spears were harvested about 20 times per season yield observations were conducted on the central three rows 29 m² leaving aside two buffer strips each wide 2 4 m2 according to marketable size spear caliber and height the fresh total yield was divided into extra class spear caliber 32 mm first class spear caliber 16 32 mm second class spear caliber 16 mm and discarded spears fresh marketable yield was represented by extra first and second class spears the height of the fresh marketable spears ranged from 0 22 to 0 27 m it should be underlined that the yield of a season is the result of agronomic management and climate of the previous season in other words the harvest coincides with the beginning of the next vegetative cycle consequently yields data of 2008 2013 are linked to agronomic management and climate of 2007 2012 during the first two years no harvest has been carried out in order to allow a better development of the crop 2 4 water use efficiencies and yield response factor from the measured values of seasonal irrigation volumes i m3 m 2 seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc m3 m 2 and fresh marketable yield y kg m 2 two indices of asparagus efficiency in using water were calculated 3 w u e i k g m 3 y k g m 2 i m 3 m 2 wuei marketable yield irrigation water use efficiency indicates the amount of marketable yield in kg produced by asparagus using 1 m3

consumption perry 2011 wueet was calculated for the treatments where etc was measured italo hybrid under irr and di treatments yield response factor ky is defined as the decrease in yield per unit decrease in et singh et al 2010 seasonal values of the yield response factor ky were calculated for each experimental year as follows stewart et al 1977 5 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ym kg m 2 is yield obtained from fully irrigated treatment irr ya kg m 2 is yield obtained from deficit irrigation treatment di etm m3 m 2 is crop evapotranspiration obtained from fully irrigated treatment irr eta m3 m 2 is crop evapotranspiration determined from di treatment ym and etm were obtained from full irrigation treatment because crops under non limiting soil water conditions show the maximum productivity lovelli et al 2007 patanè et al 2011 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 preliminary statistical analysis for yield response descriptive statistics were computed for commercial yield y to synthesize the main features of data distribution in addition the homogeneity of variance across years water regimes and hybrids was tested using bartlett s test 2 5 2 linear mixed effect model for any yield parameters the ordinary least squares model ols 1 1 y xβ e where y is the vector of the responses x the matrix of the observations β the vector of the unknown fixed effect coefficients and e the vector of independent and identically distributed iid normal random errors assumes that the normal random errors are independent and identically distributed iid or in symbol e n 0 σ2 i where i is identity matrix rodrigues et al 2013 ventrella et al 2016 however often the independence assumption about y residuals is too restrictive because residuals may show correlations linear mixed effect model extends the general linear model by allowing elements of y to be correlated both on space and time this can be achieved through i a specification of the covariance function of e as a function of the distance between two locations or observations i and j dij e n 0 r for both spatial or temporal variability where r the covariance matrix of the model error ii the addition of a random effect in the model in the correlated error spatial or temporal model the error variance of the ols model σ2 i is split into a spatially or temporally structured variance σ2 p f where f is an n x n matrix whose ijth element is f dij and an independent residual variance σ2 l i littell et al 2006 in this study to test the impact of different water treatments and hybrids on asparagus yield different regression models were estimated and compared ordinary least squares ols models and linear mixed effects lme models with spatial and temporal residual autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity schabenberger and gotway 2005 the spatial covariance model was evaluated using a spherical and an exponential function of the distance either for each year and for the whole period ventrella et al 2016 different temporal statistical models were also fitted considering year as a repeated factor and the following variance covariance structures for the residuals were considered and compared i a compound symmetry structure cs model which assumes a single variance σ2 for all time points and a single covariance σ1 for each of the pairs ii a homoscedastic autoregressive structure of order 1 ar 1 with correlations that decline exponentially with the time series rodrigues et al 2013 iii a first order autoregressive structure with heterogeneous variances arh 1 this structure allows variance to change over time with heterogeneity of variances caused by years onofri et al 2016 the year was included in the model also as a fixed effect in order to assess systematic or trend component in crop parameters variation ventrella et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013 null models including the same fixed effects of the repeated models but neglecting any correlation with r σ2 i f 0 were also computed and used as a control for the evaluation of the gain in model fit by the other approaches ritcher and kroschewski 2006 2 5 3 comparison of different models the different models were compared using likelihood ratio test lrt and information criteria based on likelihood estimations castrignanò et al 2005 hu and spilke 2009 ventrella et al 2016 lrt allows the comparison of the model s fit provided that one of the models is hierarchically subordinated to the other i e that the models are nested wolfinger 1993 and has an asymptotic χ2 distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models for comparisons of nested as well not nested models the information criteria based on likelihood estimations were also used and the best model within each category non correlated vs spatial temporal was selected as the one whose 2 log likelihood akaike s information criterion aic akaike s information criterion corrected aicc and schwarz s bayesian information criterion bic were the smallest ones littell et al 2006 schabenberger and pierce 2002 all statistical analyses were performed using sas stat release 9 3 sas institute and the models were estimated using proc mixed the repeated statement controls the covariance structure imposed upon the residuals moser 2004 treatment means were evaluated using the pdiff option in the mixed procedure and interactions using the slice option of sas stat in this way appropriate standard errors of the mean differences for all the comparisons main effects and simple effects were computed and used for mean separation 3 results 3 1 agrometeorological conditions weather conditions during the study are summarised in fig 1 at daily scale and in table 2 at the seasonal scale air daily mean temperature followed the standard pattern of the area ranging between 0 2 and 35 1 c fig 1a vpd showed the same annual dynamics for all seasons with maximum values recorded during summer 2012 fig 1b the daily et0 values penman monteith followed the vpd variations fig 1c the seasonal values of precipitation were higher fig 1d than the reference values only in the 2011 season 195 mm during 2011 season a hailstorm event 30 mm on june 8th caused severe damages to the vegetation of the asparagus experiment setup the average precipitation reference evapotranspiration difference p et0 table 2 does not differ from the long term series 560 mm this excluded that the climatic conditions during the study period could have affected the water deficit treatments 3 2 soil water content fig 2 shows an example of the trend of daily soil water content during 2008 cropping seasons 4 years old at three depths 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m and two irrigation treatments irr and di the soil water content in the top layer 0 1 m shows a greater variation as an effect of irrigation and evaporation effect instead at 0 3 m there is a lower oscillation of the values and it is minimal in the deeper layer 0 5 m in the di treatment from late june soil water content in the three layers varies between readily available water raw threshold and wilting point wp the evolution in time of the soil water content mm into the whole profile showed a similar trend in the six years fig 3 for both treatments irr and di in the irr treatment the soil water content varied between the field capacity fc and the raw threshold seasonal raw of 0 5 was obtained by threshold values p 0 45 tabled in fao56 after correction for et0 in according with allen et al 1998 in the di treatment from late june until august the values of soil water content were distributed between raw threshold and wp the irrigation scheduling of irr treatment allowed to keep the water content values in the soil profile within the raw threshold 174 mm and to avoid water stress in any season the soil water content reached the field capacity after irrigation or rainfall events the differences of soil water content between di and irr irrigated treatments started from the first fern flush in june in di treatment it was always lower respect to irr treatment and it slightly increased after each irrigation event without achieving the fc considering the periods when the irrigation deficit was applied from late june to mid september the soil water content in the well watered treatment was 196 mm 6 year average it was 20 higher than the values observed in the di treatment table 3 3 3 crop evapotranspiration at a seasonal scale etc ranged from a minimum of 680 mm 2010 to a maximum of 820 mm 2012 only in 2007 season 3 year asparagus stand the seasonal etc 691 mm was lower than et0 741 mm value in fact in this season the asparagus crop was 3 year old which can be considered as young asparagus stand with reduced canopy characterized by a lower water consumption fig 4 and table 2 seasonal etc values were instead similar or higher than et0 for all the other seasons from 4 to 8 year old when the asparagus stand get the full vegetation and production potential respect to irr an average 20 reduction of the irrigation volume was observed in the di treatment at a daily scale etc mm d 1 from irr treatment showed the same maximum plateau during the summer periods of all growth seasons fig 4 low values of etc were observed at the beginning and at the end of the vegetative season fig 4 3 4 yield descriptive statistics for marketable yield were computed on the whole set of observations n 192 the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis were close to zero indicating no substantial departure from normal distribution results of bartlett s test indicated that variance was homogeneous over water regimes and hybrids heteroscedasticity was instead observed over years the spatial covariance functions modeled using a spherical and an exponential function both for each year and for the whole period did not converge except for 2008 therefore the spatial covariance function was not included in the final model hong et al 2005 significant temporal covariance structures were instead observed as shown by the likelihood ratio test lrt and information criteria based on likelihood estimations reported in table 4 both the compound symmetry cs structure and the autoregressive model of order 1 ar 1 significantly differed from the null model these results underline the existence of a residual correlation structure over time in addition the lower aic value observed for ar 1 indicated that the autoregressive structure gave a better fitting than cs model finally the autoregressive heteroscedastic model arh 1 allowing a different variance per each year gave a significant better fitting than the homoscedastic model and was selected for fixed effects evaluation table 4 this finding is in line with the results of bartlett test that highlighted the heterogeneity of variance among years statistical analysis of fixed effects indicated that yield varied significantly across experimental years and the response was significantly affected by different water regimes p 0 0001 the effect of hybrid was instead less marked p 0 0279 table 5 the highest average yield for all treatments was observed in 2008 6 8 t ha 1 and the lowest in 2012 3 0 t ha 1 the latter low average response can be attributed to the unfavorable weather conditions and to the hail event occurred in 2011 summer which reduced the vegetation a close average yield response fig 5 and table 5 was observed in the years 2009 2010 and 2013 4 5 and 8 years old higher yields were on average recorded under full restitution of crop water requirements irr 6 4 t ha 1 and lower under rdi1 treatment 4 4 t ha 1 intermediate and not different values were instead observed for di and rdi2 treatments 5 6 and 5 4 t ha 1 respectively p 0 2597 interactions among factors were always highly significant table 5 then simple effects are discussed in detail in the discussion section 3 5 water use efficiency and yield response factor water use efficiency obtained from the asparagus yield and irrigation volume wuei or evapotranspiration wueet was affected by the irrigation strategy and the season table 6 shows that on average the lowest wuei values were obtained with the full restitution of water requirements irr 1 18 kg m 3 these values were lower than 53 of the values obtained under more severe water stress conditions rdi1 2 48 kg m 3 and lower than 25 of the values obtained with di and rdi2 treatments 1 51 and 1 64 kg m 3 respectively in 2012 season 7 years old lower wuei values were obtained due to the unfavorable weather conditions and lower average yields in the other seasons wuei values were similar for the full restitution of water requirements 1 19 to 1 39 kg m 3 and for di treatment 1 52 to 1 84 kg m 3 however the wuei values obtained for the most severe water regime rdi1 were the highest 1 66 3 66 kg m 3 as for the hybrids during all seasons wuei values were on average 10 higher for italo if compared to grande hybrid 1 78 vs 1 63 kg m 3 table 7 shows that wueet values were higher in di treatment 1 00 kg m 3 compared with irr treatment 0 92 kg m 3 with the exception of the 2012 season 7 year old where the wueet values were the lowest for the unfavorable weather conditions these values changed over the studied period as they varied from 0 89 2010 to 1 12 kg m 3 2013 for irr treatment and from 1 0 2010 and 2011 to 1 22 kg m 3 2008 for di treatment furthermore irrigation treatments did not affect wueet of the two hybrids 0 95 and 0 98 kg m 3 yield response factor ky was calculated for marketable yield produced by the asparagus considering the pooled data of the five years 2008 2013 except 2012 season the slopes of the fitted regressions represent the asparagus ky factors the resulting ky value 0 61 indicates that i asparagus marketable yield under semi arid environment is affected by soil water deficit ii the reduction in crop productivity is proportionally less than the relative et deficit 4 discussion multi year and long term field experiments are the typical case of repeated measurements because the traits are measured on the same experimental unit over many years and correlations may arise between the observations in such cases the assumption of independence of the residuals of standard ordinary least squares models ols would be violated ritcher and kroschewski 2006 in addition correlation over space may also be present results of our study comparing different models for the analysis of the asparagus yield response over six growing seasons showed that residuals were not significantly correlated over space whereas a significant correlation over time was present a first order autoregressive structure with heterogeneous variances arh1 showed to be the optimal option to analyze the experimental data confirming also bartlett test results in this case the use of a classical not correlated error model would not have been adequate to investigate the significance of the treatment effects hong et al 2005 the full irrigation on asparagus determined optimum soil water conditions with values between the field capacity and the raw threshold figs 2 and 3 irrigation volume under deficit irrigation treatment resulted in a higher reduction in 2007 22 due to the young stage of asparagus stand and 347 in 2012 season due to table 2 the high air temperatures 23 c and low precipitations 84 mm in mediterranean area there is no data on the asparagus water consumption in terms of evapotranspiration only drost 1996 in a different climate usa had calculate following the pan evaporation methodology seasonal et of 650 mm average of the period 1994 1996 this value is lower than that etc here reported 727 mm however these data are higher when compared with et measured in other crops of mediterranean area having a similar crop cycle in fact measured seasonal et value reported is 650 mm for tomato hanson and may 2006 505 mm for corn katerji et al 2013 418 mm for bean campi et al 2009 and 410 mm for hemp di bari et al 2004 at daily scale in the early stage etc losses can be mainly attributed to the soil evaporation whereas they can be due to the senescence in the final part of the asparagus vegetative cycle when the crop transpiration activity is reduced etc values give an indication of crop water status high etc values stand for a good crop water status and a high stomatal conductance which determines an intense crop transpiration activity in fact during the active crop growth irrigation scheduling in irr treatments fig 4 allowed high etc values up to 11 mm d 1 immediately after each water supply irrigation or rain variability during the dehydration soil cycles affects measured or calculated etc values under the mediterranean climate rana et al 2012 for tomato reports the same range from 10 to 2 mm d 1 of the measured values of etc mastrorilli et al 1998 shows etc values ranging from 7 5 to 1 mm d 1 for a well watered corn crop grown at the same experimental site of asparagus ky value indicates the level of tolerance of a crop to water stress it approaches the value of 1 when yield declines proportionally to et deficit singh et al 2010 asparagus seems to be less sensitive to water deficit than other vegetable crops as an example for eggplant a ky 1 was calculated in a mediterranean region of southern italy lovelli et al 2007 values of ky 1 were reported for tomato 0 49 for total dry biomass and 0 76 for marketable yield in mediterranean area patanè et al 2011 however differences in ky values obtained in different studies also for the same crop can be attributed to variation in cultivars environmental conditions agronomic practices with a regard to water management strategies and phenological phases in which water stress occurred cantore et al 2016 the hybrid behavior was affected by different water availability and differences were enhanced under extreme supplies either optimal irr or suboptimal rdi1 ones grande hybrid furnished on average better yield results than italo hybrid under full restitution of water supplies irr on the contrary under more severe water stress conditions rdi1 italo hybrid showed its superiority respect to grande hybrid giving always higher average yields significant in 4 out of 6 years fig 5 overall italo hybrid seemed to be characterized by a greater stability of yield response under varying water supplies over years these results make the italo hybrid particularly suitable for semi arid mediterranean environments irrigation volumes inducing moderate water stress di and rdi2 and severe water stress rdi1 resulted in 13 and 31 reduction in production respectively as for the comparison of different deficit irrigation approaches the crop response showed that di and rdi2 strategies gave intermediate results respect to the highest and lowest yields obtained with irr and rdi1 fig 6 and table 5 however during the first period of study 2008 2010 3 5 year old rdi2 gave better yield results than di which in 3 and 5 year old asparagus were also not significantly different from those obtained with the full restitution of water requirements irr afterwards the response to this water management strategy decreased with values lower than those obtained with di also than rdi1 in 2011 fig 6 significant interaction between year and irrigation management table 5 an explanation of this behavior is that the complete withholding of water supply from the first half of august could have caused a progressive decrease in reserve accumulation in the root system and consequently a yield decline which becomes evident after the first years this behavior can be also attributed to the interannual climate variability in air temperature and vpd and to the different distributions of precipitation in the summer frequency and intensity excluding the 2012 yield due to the unfavorable weather events occurred in the 2011 summer the average yield levels obtained in irr treatment by grande hybrid 6 9 t ha 1 are close to those reported by mullen et al 2002 in the usa 6 5 t ha 1 and falavigna and palumbo 2001 in southern italy 7 3 t ha 1 however the average yield of the two hybrids 6 4 t ha 1 measured in irr treatment during the full development of asparagus 3 8 year old excluding 7 year old was higher than that reported by sterrett et al 1990 in usa 4 5 t ha 1 since they were obtained from old cultivars and therefore less productive a similar yield 6 6 t ha 1 was found by drost 1996 in utah usa with irrigation treatment of 80 et and by brainard et al 2019 with sub surface drip irrigation in western michigan usa during 2017 season 6 2 t ha 1 in effect more evidences on the effects of soil water stress on asparagus yield in mediterranean area are not reported in literature drost 1996 shows that decreasing the amount of irrigation to asparagus from 80 et to 0 et in the previous year resulted in a linear reduction of the spear yield number and weight of the following spring brainard et al 2019 show that yields of asparagus were influenced by cultivar and irrigation treatments none overhead or sub surface drip the highest yield 7 t ha 1 was obtained under overhead irrigation for the guelph millennium our results show that the irrigation deficit strategies result in a significant reduction in yield from the 3 year old 2008 to the 6 year old 2011 asparagus this involves the development of a smaller canopy because of the water stress therefore the soil water deficit cumulated over years may limit plant growth by decreasing the number of available buds and consequently by decreasing the yield drost 1996 drost and wilcox lee 1997a 1997b however data here shown demonstrate that a mild water deficit allows to use water more efficiently without compromising the marketable value of asparagus after the unfavorable weather conditions of the 2011 summer spears were harvested in small quantities in 2012 and only in the 7th year 2013 yields were restored to average values consequently a greater accumulation of reserve carbohydrates was allowed in the root system in order to preserve the functionality of asparagus crops in subsequent years 5 conclusions the statistical analysis of the multi year dataset showed that asparagus productivity varies significantly over time being affected mainly by meteorological conditions and by water management and at a lesser extent by the hybrid under mediterranean conditions asparagus yield depends on irrigation strategies however this study indicates that reducing irrigation volume depresses yield if compared to the asparagus production harvested from the experimental treatments receiving full irrigation throughout the whole crop cycle since the sustainability of full irrigation techniques is questionable in the mediterranean climate environments alternative approaches are proposed through adequate deficit irrigation techniques it is possible to reduce irrigation water volume and to improve water use efficiency in terms of etc or irrigation volume with minor consequences on the final yield the results of the on field multi year experiment allow to recommend that among the tested irrigation treatments two di and rdi2 out of three demonstrate to save the seasonal irrigation water volumes 34 with the least consequences on the final yield 13 and to increase wuei values 25 on the contrary rdi1 strategy saves the seasonal irrigation water volumes 67 with severe consequences on the final yield 31 from an agronomic point of view the deficit irrigation is confirmed to be a possible option also for the perennial vegetable cropping systems aiming at saving water resources different it is the farmer s point of view at a farm scale the choice between full or deficit irrigation depends on economic convenience i e the balance between less yield and the costs for water and its supplying the choice of the hybrid contributes as well as to the success of the irrigation deficit techniques after the results from this study italo hybrid demonstrated to provide better and more stable productive performances 
11070,a six year study was carried out to assess the effects of deficit di and regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies on yield and water use efficiency of two hybrids of asparagus asparagus officinalis l hybrids grande and italo in a typical semi arid mediterranean environment of southern italy the experimental setup consisted of full irrigation irr restoration of 100 of the crop evapotranspiration etc di restoration of 50 of etc from the first fern flush until the end of the growing season and two rdi 1 no irrigation supply from the first fern flush crop development stage more sensitive to water stress until end of the growing season rdi1 2 no irrigation supply from the second fern flush until the end of the growing season rdi2 treatments the relationships between yield and water regimes in the multi year dataset were analyzed using linear mixed effect models lmm taking into account residual autocorrelation and comparing different variance covariance structures irrigation treatments affected significantly the asparagus productivity the six year average yield was highest under irr treatment 6 4 t ha 1 and lowest under rdi1 treatment 4 4 t ha 1 in comparison with irr treatment di reduced etc by 20 and yield by 13 6 season average six year average yields were similar in di and rdi2 treatments 5 6 and 5 4 t ha 1 respectively asparagus yield varied with hybrid italo hybrid showed higher yield performances 5 6 t ha 1 respect to grande 5 3 t ha 1 the soil water deficit tolerance assessed through the yield response factor ky of the marketable yield was 0 61 and this value indicates that asparagus is mildly negatively affected by sub optimal irrigation regimes on the contrary irrigation water use efficiency wuei was clearly affected by the experimental treatment wuei was higher 2 8 kg m 3 if asparagus experiences the soil water shortage during the first fern flush rdi1 operatively full irrigation maximizes asparagus marketable yield while reduced irrigation volume di or rdi2 treatments seems a promising strategy since it allowed reducing on average the irrigation volume supplies by 34 with asparagus marketable yield loss by 13 keywords water balance crop evapotranspiration crop management linear mixed effects models lmm residual autocorrelation 1 introduction the united nations food and agricultural organization estimates that the world currently uses about 70 of available fresh water for irrigation fao 2017 nowadays traditional irrigation practice i e full irrigation is considered as luxury water consumption for crop production due to limited irrigation water resources in many areas of the world chai et al 2016 an ideal irrigation management should significantly reduce water consumption without losing crop yield pereira et al 2002 there are several water saving practices including deficit irrigation di regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying consoli et al 2017 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 di is an approach that uniformly reduces the applied irrigation below the crop water requirement throughout the growing season capra et al 2008 oweis et al 2011 rdi provides adequate water only during critical growth periods that may affect yields kirda 2002 katerji et al 2008 favorable weather conditions solar radiation and temperature in semi arid climates e g mediterranean basin have allowed the spread of most horticultural crops patanè et al 2011 in these environments di and rdi would allow saving water resources and increasing water productivity oweis and zhang 1998 the study of the effects of the di and rdi requires experimental trials which allow both to identify the relationship between water saving and crop productivity and quantifying water use efficiency oweis and hachum 2001 however the effects of di and rdi at farm scale are site specific depending on the climate and the soil type katerji and mastrorilli 2009 therefore it is important to assess the impact of deficit irrigation strategies with multi year experiments before suggesting the most appropriate irrigation scheduling method to be adopted in any location for a given crop scholberg et al 2000 igbadun et al 2008 moreover the statistical treatment of data from a multi year experiment in particular when involves perennial crops requires appropriate data analysis repeated measurements such as traits measured over the same experimental unit may give rise to correlations that need to be accounted for in statistical analysis piepho et al 2004 in these cases failure to account for residual autocorrelation over space and time in classical analysis of variance and standard linear models may cause inefficient estimation of treatment significance hong et al 2005 this increases the risk of misleading or erroneous inferences hu and spilke 2009 asparagus asparagus officinalis l is a typical perennial crop thus suitable statistical models allowing to take into account residual autocorrelation should be adopted to correctly and comprehensively analyze multi year experimental data the handling of complex models that allow to structure correlations decreasing with the distance in time or space has become feasible in the framework of the mixed model theory using maximum likelihood ml or restricted maximum likelihood reml ritcher and kroschewski 2006 for the availability of correlation variance covariance models more parsimonious than the one implied by manova in glm and for the facility to accommodate several error terms verbeke and molenberghs 2000 in the mediterranean area the growing season of asparagus coincides with the period in which the climate water deficit is the highest consequently asparagus requires irrigation for assuring the productivity in the following harvest seasons few studies have been carried out on asparagus response to di and mainly under climatic conditions different from those of semi arid mediterranean environments such as the research from drost and wilcox lee 1997a and b in usa for this reason their results cannot be easily generalized since this species is recognized as an alternative to current vegetable cropping systems in the mediterranean area spain italy france and greece knowledge on asparagus water requirements merits to be revised for defining appropriate irrigation strategies through systematic studies falavigna and palumbo 2001 research on asparagus irrigation is mainly focused on increasing spear number roth and gardner 1991 takatori et al 1970 and spear size hartmann et al 1990 yield increases associated with irrigation are considered to depend on the increased carbohydrate levels from a greater fern growth hartmann et al 1990 takatori et al 1970 though asparagus is considered a drought tolerant crop drost 1996 water stresses negatively affect the yield and quality yield and quality worsen in terms of decreasing spear size and spear number per plant and increasing spear fiber percentage moreover at a long time scale the asparagus stand duration tends to decrease wilcox lee 1987 wilson et al 1996 with the increase of stress periods during the vegetative seasons from the analysis of the literature above reported a question arises is it possible to apply deficit irrigation strategies on asparagus crop reducing the yield losses the aim of this paper is to evaluate respect to the full irrigation the effects of different deficit irrigation strategies di and rdi on asparagus crop in a mediterranean environment during a six year field study the selected agronomic criteria for comparing the irrigation strategies on asparagus response were seasonal evapotranspiration yield and agronomic perry 2011 water use efficiency wue represented by amount of produced yield using the water unit volume in terms of irrigation wuei or crop evapotranspiration wueet for a deeper understanding of the relationships among yield response to different water regimes in a multi year dataset the mixed model theory is proposed to analyze the yield data such theory allows to structure correlations decreasing with the distance in time or space ritcher and kroschewski 2006 and to efficiently estimate treatment significance 2 materials and methods 2 1 the site the experimental trial was located at rutigliano a karstic area in southern italy lat 40 59 n long 17 01 e alt 147 m a

humidity ranging from 40 15 and 90 100 the annual rainfall is 535 mm it is mainly concentrated in the autumn and late winter periods and it is greatly reduced or absent in the spring summer period campi et al 2012 as a consequence the effective precipitation does not meet the reference evapotranspiration et0 requirements from april to september table 2 the annual average 1984 2006 value of the differences between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration p et0 is 560 mm therefore from april to september most species can be cultivated successfully only by supplying irrigation water campi et al 2016 2 2 crop management and experimental design asparagus seedlings were transplanted in the 2005 season june 29th the final density was 2 5 plants m 2 plant spacing of 1 2 m between the

evapotranspiration the irrigation occurs when ready water availability is exhausted in average once per week in according to allen et al 1998 methodology in particular the tabulated crop coefficients kcini 0 15 kcmed 0 90 kcend 0 20 and depletion fraction value of 0 45 were adopted correction of kcini for precipitation events kcmed and kcend for climatic conditions and crop height was performed according to allen et al 1998 methodology di deficit irrigation irrigation volume reduced by 50 of the control treatment from the first fern flush end of june until the end of the growing season end

irrigation events rdi2 regulated deficit irrigation withholding the irrigation supply from the second fern flush about in the first half of august until the end of the growing season end of september in average after n 11 irrigation events during the crop development seasons 2005 and 2006 1 and 2 years old the irrigation was uniformly applied and scheduled for maintaining the soil under optimal moisture conditions the experimental irrigation treatments were differentiated from full development of crop 3 years old drip irrigation system was adopted with the flow rate of 4 l h 1 per dripper applied to a 0 33 m dripper spacing seasonal irrigation volumes depth mm and number irrigation events n applied for each treatment are reported in table 2 treatments were arranged under a complete block design with four replicates plot size was 40 m2 while the harvest was performed excluding the border plants so the distances between harvest area 29 m2 have been set to avoid the horizontal flow of the water between the treatments relative coordinates of the plot center were recorded to verify the existence of spatial residual autocorrelation 2 3 measurements daily crop evapotranspiration etc mm was estimated by means of water balance equation lhomme and katerji 1991 from may until september for each season runoff and capillary rise are negligible because of the flat ground and the presence of a cracked rocky layer that limits the soil depth 0 60 m the simplified equation for the soil water balance can be expressed at a daily scale as 1 etc δwc p i dr where etc crop water evapotranspiration mm d 1 p effective precipitation mm d 1 i irrigation mm d 1 δwc the difference in volume of soil water content in the whole soil profile mm d 1 explored by the root system measured with tdr time domain reflectometry probes dr drainage mm d 1 dr was estimated as the amount of water exceeding the maximum water capacity in the entire soil profile the seasonal water consumption etc was obtained by cumulating the daily values of etc however roots and water can infiltrate through the cracked layer and go beyond the area were changes in soil moisture were evaluated top 60 cm thus the calculated etc is referred to the 0 6 m top soil layer six tdr coaxial probes 0 3 m in length were installed horizontally into the soil and transversely in the row at 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m from the soil surface only in plots of italo hybrid under irr and di treatments in order to intercept the dynamics of soil water content below the dripping lines the probes were linked to tdr100 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa soil specific calibration curves were used to calculate the volumetric soil water content daily soil water content for the soil profile 0 6 m was determined as an integral of the values measured for each depth since a probe is supposed to detect the water content in a 0 2 m soil layer 2 0 0 6 w c w c 0 1 m 3 m 3 0 2 m w c 0 3 m 3 m 3 0 2 m w c 0 5 m 3 m 3 0 2 m the approach used to measure daily et was previously validated at the same experimental site by mastrorilli et al 1998 in diverse soil water conditions by comparing on a daily scale the et from equation 1 and et measured by the bowen ratio method rana and katerji 2009 differences within 10 15 were measured between the daily et determined by the two independent methods mastrorilli et al 1998 asparagus harvestings were carried out every 2 3 days from mid march until the first week of may depending on weather conditions asparagus spears were harvested about 20 times per season yield observations were conducted on the central three rows 29 m² leaving aside two buffer strips each wide 2 4 m2 according to marketable size spear caliber and height the fresh total yield was divided into extra class spear caliber 32 mm first class spear caliber 16 32 mm second class spear caliber 16 mm and discarded spears fresh marketable yield was represented by extra first and second class spears the height of the fresh marketable spears ranged from 0 22 to 0 27 m it should be underlined that the yield of a season is the result of agronomic management and climate of the previous season in other words the harvest coincides with the beginning of the next vegetative cycle consequently yields data of 2008 2013 are linked to agronomic management and climate of 2007 2012 during the first two years no harvest has been carried out in order to allow a better development of the crop 2 4 water use efficiencies and yield

decrease in et singh et al 2010 seasonal values of the yield response factor ky were calculated for each experimental year as follows stewart et al 1977 5 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ym kg m 2 is yield obtained from fully irrigated treatment irr ya kg m 2 is yield obtained from deficit irrigation treatment di etm m3 m 2 is crop evapotranspiration obtained from fully irrigated treatment irr eta m3 m 2 is crop evapotranspiration determined from di treatment ym and etm were obtained from full irrigation treatment because crops under non limiting soil water conditions show the maximum productivity lovelli et al 2007 patanè et al 2011 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 preliminary statistical analysis for yield response descriptive statistics were computed for commercial yield y to synthesize the main features of data distribution in addition the homogeneity of variance across years water regimes and hybrids was tested using bartlett s test 2 5 2 linear mixed effect model for any yield parameters the ordinary least squares model ols 1 1 y xβ e where y is the vector of the responses x the matrix of the observations β the vector of the unknown fixed effect coefficients and e the vector of independent and identically distributed iid normal random errors assumes that the normal random errors are independent and identically distributed iid or in symbol e n 0 σ2 i where i is identity matrix rodrigues et al 2013 ventrella et al 2016 however often the independence assumption about y residuals is too restrictive because residuals may show correlations linear mixed effect model extends the general linear model by allowing elements of y to be correlated both on space and time this can be achieved through i a specification of the covariance function of e as a function of the distance between two locations or observations i and j dij e n 0 r for both spatial or temporal variability where r the covariance matrix of the model error ii the addition of a random effect in the model in the correlated error spatial or temporal model the error variance of the ols model σ2 i is split into a spatially or temporally structured variance σ2 p f where f is an n x n matrix whose ijth element is f dij and an independent residual variance σ2 l i littell et al 2006 in this study to test the impact of different water treatments and hybrids on asparagus yield different regression models were estimated and compared ordinary least squares ols models and linear mixed effects lme models with spatial and temporal residual autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity schabenberger and gotway 2005 the spatial covariance model was evaluated using a spherical and an exponential function of the distance either for each year and for the whole period ventrella et al 2016 different temporal statistical models were also fitted considering year as a repeated factor and the following variance covariance structures for the residuals were considered and compared i a compound symmetry structure cs model which assumes a single variance σ2 for all time points and a single covariance σ1 for each of the pairs ii a homoscedastic autoregressive structure of order 1 ar 1 with correlations that decline exponentially with the time series rodrigues et al 2013 iii a first order autoregressive structure with heterogeneous variances arh 1 this structure allows variance to change over time with heterogeneity of variances caused by years onofri et al 2016 the year was included in the model also as a fixed effect in order to assess systematic or trend component in crop parameters variation ventrella et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013 null models including the same fixed effects of the repeated models but neglecting any correlation with r σ2 i f 0 were also computed and used as a control for the evaluation of the gain in model fit by the other approaches ritcher and kroschewski 2006 2 5 3 comparison of different models the different models were compared using likelihood ratio test lrt and information criteria based on likelihood estimations castrignanò et al 2005 hu and spilke 2009 ventrella et al 2016 lrt allows the comparison of the model s fit provided that one of the models is hierarchically subordinated to the other i e that the models are nested wolfinger 1993 and has an asymptotic χ2 distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models for comparisons of nested as well not nested models the information criteria based on likelihood estimations were also used and the best model within each category non correlated vs spatial temporal was selected as the one whose 2 log likelihood akaike s information criterion aic akaike s information criterion corrected aicc and schwarz s bayesian information criterion bic were the smallest ones littell et al 2006 schabenberger and pierce 2002 all statistical analyses were performed using sas stat release 9 3 sas institute and the models were estimated using proc mixed the repeated statement controls the covariance structure imposed upon the residuals moser 2004 treatment means were evaluated using the pdiff option in the mixed procedure and interactions using the slice option of sas stat in this way appropriate standard errors of the mean differences for all the comparisons main effects and simple effects were computed and used for mean separation 3 results 3 1 agrometeorological conditions weather conditions during the study are summarised in fig 1 at daily scale and in table 2 at the seasonal scale air daily mean temperature followed the standard pattern of the area ranging between 0 2 and 35 1 c fig 1a vpd showed the same annual dynamics for all seasons with maximum values recorded during summer 2012 fig 1b the daily et0 values penman monteith followed the vpd variations fig 1c the seasonal values of precipitation were higher fig 1d than the reference values only in the 2011 season 195 mm during 2011 season a hailstorm event 30 mm on june 8th caused severe damages to the vegetation of the asparagus experiment setup the average precipitation reference evapotranspiration difference p et0 table 2 does not differ from the long term series 560 mm this excluded that the climatic conditions during the study period could have affected the water deficit treatments 3 2 soil water content fig 2 shows an example of the trend of daily soil water content during 2008 cropping seasons 4 years old at three depths 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m and two irrigation treatments irr and di the soil water content in the top layer 0 1 m shows a greater variation as an effect of irrigation and evaporation effect instead at 0 3 m there is a lower oscillation of the values and it is minimal in the deeper layer 0 5 m in the di treatment from late june soil water content in the three layers varies between readily available water raw threshold and wilting point wp the evolution in time of the soil water content mm into the whole profile showed a similar trend in the six years fig 3 for both treatments irr and di in the irr treatment the soil water content varied between the field capacity fc and the raw threshold seasonal raw of 0 5 was obtained by threshold values p 0 45 tabled in fao56 after correction for et0 in according with allen et al 1998 in the di treatment from late june until august the values of soil water content were distributed between raw threshold and wp the irrigation scheduling of irr treatment allowed to keep the water content values in the soil profile within the raw threshold 174 mm and to avoid water stress in any season the soil water content reached the field capacity after irrigation or rainfall events the differences of soil water content between di and irr irrigated treatments started from the first fern flush in june in di treatment it was always lower respect to irr treatment and it slightly increased after each irrigation event without achieving the fc considering the periods when the irrigation deficit was applied from late june to mid september the soil water content in the well watered treatment was 196 mm 6 year average it was 20 higher than the values observed in the di treatment table 3 3 3 crop evapotranspiration at a seasonal scale etc ranged from a minimum of 680 mm 2010 to a maximum of 820 mm 2012 only in 2007 season 3 year asparagus stand the seasonal etc 691 mm was lower than et0 741 mm value in fact in this season the asparagus crop was 3 year old which can be considered as young asparagus stand with reduced canopy characterized by a lower water consumption fig 4 and table 2 seasonal etc values were instead similar or higher than et0 for all the other seasons from 4 to 8 year old when the asparagus stand get the full vegetation and production potential respect to irr an average 20 reduction of the irrigation volume was observed in the di treatment at a daily scale etc mm d 1 from irr treatment showed the same maximum plateau during the summer periods of all growth seasons fig 4 low values of etc were observed at the beginning and at the end of the vegetative season fig 4 3 4 yield descriptive statistics for marketable yield were computed on the whole set of observations n 192 the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis were close to zero indicating no substantial departure from normal distribution results of bartlett s test indicated that variance was homogeneous over water regimes and hybrids heteroscedasticity was instead observed over years the spatial covariance functions modeled using a spherical and an exponential function both for each year and for the whole period did not converge except for 2008 therefore the spatial covariance function was not included in the final model hong et al 2005 significant temporal covariance structures were instead observed as shown by the likelihood ratio test lrt and information criteria based on likelihood estimations reported in table 4 both the compound symmetry cs structure and the autoregressive model of order 1 ar 1 significantly differed from the null model these results underline the existence of a residual correlation structure over time in addition the lower aic value observed for ar 1 indicated that the autoregressive structure gave a better fitting than cs model finally the autoregressive heteroscedastic model arh 1 allowing a different variance per each year gave a significant better fitting than the homoscedastic model and was selected for fixed effects evaluation table 4 this finding is in line with the results of bartlett test that highlighted the heterogeneity of variance among years statistical analysis of fixed effects indicated that yield varied significantly across experimental years and the response was significantly affected by different water regimes p 0 0001 the effect of hybrid was instead less marked p 0 0279 table 5 the highest average yield for all treatments was observed in 2008 6 8 t ha 1 and the lowest in 2012 3 0 t ha 1 the latter low average response can be attributed to the unfavorable weather conditions and to the hail event occurred in 2011 summer which reduced the vegetation a close average yield response fig 5 and table 5 was observed in the years 2009 2010 and 2013 4 5 and 8 years old higher yields were on average recorded under full restitution of crop water requirements irr 6 4 t ha 1 and lower under rdi1 treatment 4 4 t ha 1 intermediate and not different values were instead observed for di and rdi2 treatments 5 6 and 5 4 t ha 1 respectively p 0 2597 interactions among factors were always highly significant table 5 then simple effects are discussed in detail in the discussion section 3 5 water use efficiency and yield response factor water use efficiency obtained from the asparagus yield and irrigation volume wuei or evapotranspiration wueet was affected by the irrigation strategy and the season table 6 shows that on average the lowest wuei values were obtained with the full restitution of water requirements irr 1 18 kg m 3 these values were lower than 53 of the values obtained under more severe water stress conditions rdi1 2 48 kg m 3 and lower than 25 of the values obtained with di and rdi2 treatments 1 51 and 1 64 kg m 3 respectively in 2012 season 7 years old lower wuei values were obtained due to the unfavorable weather conditions and lower average yields in the other seasons wuei values were similar for the full restitution of water requirements 1 19 to 1 39 kg m 3 and for di treatment 1 52 to 1 84 kg m 3 however the wuei values obtained for the most severe water regime rdi1 were the highest 1 66 3 66 kg m 3 as for the hybrids during all seasons wuei values were on average 10 higher for italo if compared to grande hybrid 1 78 vs 1 63 kg m 3 table 7 shows that wueet values were higher in di treatment 1 00 kg m 3 compared with irr treatment 0 92 kg m 3 with the exception of the 2012 season 7 year old where the wueet values were the lowest for the unfavorable weather conditions these values changed over the studied period as they varied from 0 89 2010 to 1 12 kg m 3 2013 for irr treatment and from 1 0 2010 and 2011 to 1 22 kg m 3 2008 for di treatment furthermore irrigation treatments did not affect wueet of the two hybrids 0 95 and 0 98 kg m 3 yield response factor ky was calculated for marketable yield produced by the asparagus considering the pooled data of the five years 2008 2013 except 2012 season the slopes of the fitted regressions represent the asparagus ky factors the resulting ky value 0 61 indicates that i asparagus marketable yield under semi arid environment is affected by soil water deficit ii the reduction in crop productivity is proportionally less than the relative et deficit 4 discussion multi year and long term field experiments are the typical case of repeated measurements because the traits are measured on the same experimental unit over many years and correlations may arise between the observations in such cases the assumption of independence of the residuals of standard ordinary least squares models ols would be violated ritcher and kroschewski 2006 in addition correlation over space may also be present results of our study comparing different models for the analysis of the asparagus yield response over six growing seasons showed that residuals were not significantly correlated over space whereas a significant correlation over time was present a first order autoregressive structure with heterogeneous variances arh1 showed to be the optimal option to analyze the experimental data confirming also bartlett test results in this case the use of a classical not correlated error model would not have been adequate to investigate the significance of the treatment effects hong et al 2005 the full irrigation on asparagus determined optimum soil water conditions with values between the field capacity and the raw threshold figs 2 and 3 irrigation volume under deficit irrigation treatment resulted in a higher reduction in 2007 22 due to the young stage of asparagus stand and 347 in 2012 season due to table 2 the high air temperatures 23 c and low precipitations 84 mm in mediterranean area there is no data on the asparagus water consumption in terms of evapotranspiration only drost 1996 in a different climate usa had calculate following the pan evaporation methodology seasonal et of 650 mm average of the period 1994 1996 this value is lower than that etc here reported 727 mm however these data are higher when compared with et measured in other crops of mediterranean area having a similar crop cycle in fact measured seasonal et value reported is 650 mm for tomato hanson and may 2006 505 mm for corn katerji et al 2013 418 mm for bean campi et al 2009 and 410 mm for hemp di bari et al 2004 at daily scale in the early stage etc losses can be mainly attributed to the soil evaporation whereas they can be due to the senescence in the final part of the asparagus vegetative cycle when the crop transpiration activity is reduced etc values give an indication of crop water status high etc values stand for a good crop water status and a high stomatal conductance which determines an intense crop transpiration activity in fact during the active crop growth irrigation scheduling in irr treatments fig 4 allowed high etc values up to 11 mm d 1 immediately after each water supply irrigation or rain variability during the dehydration soil cycles affects measured or calculated etc values under the mediterranean climate rana et al 2012 for tomato reports the same range from 10 to 2 mm d 1 of the measured values of etc mastrorilli et al 1998 shows etc values ranging from 7 5 to 1 mm d 1 for a well watered corn crop grown at the same experimental site of asparagus ky value indicates the level of tolerance of a crop to water stress it approaches the value of 1 when yield declines proportionally to et deficit singh et al 2010 asparagus seems to be less sensitive to water deficit than other vegetable crops as an example for eggplant a ky 1 was calculated in a mediterranean region of southern italy lovelli et al 2007 values of ky 1 were reported for tomato 0 49 for total dry biomass and 0 76 for marketable yield in mediterranean area patanè et al 2011 however differences in ky values obtained in different studies also for the same crop can be attributed to variation in cultivars environmental conditions agronomic practices with a regard to water management strategies and phenological phases in which water stress occurred cantore et al 2016 the hybrid behavior was affected by different water availability and differences were enhanced under extreme supplies either optimal irr or suboptimal rdi1 ones grande hybrid furnished on average better yield results than italo hybrid under full restitution of water supplies irr on the contrary under more severe water stress conditions rdi1 italo hybrid showed its superiority respect to grande hybrid giving always higher average yields significant in 4 out of 6 years fig 5 overall italo hybrid seemed to be characterized by a greater stability of yield response under varying water supplies over years these results make the italo hybrid particularly suitable for semi arid mediterranean environments irrigation volumes inducing moderate water stress di and rdi2 and severe water stress rdi1 resulted in 13 and 31 reduction in production respectively as for the comparison of different deficit irrigation approaches the crop response showed that di and rdi2 strategies gave intermediate results respect to the highest and lowest yields obtained with irr and rdi1 fig 6 and table 5 however during the first period of study 2008 2010 3 5 year old rdi2 gave better yield results than di which in 3 and 5 year old asparagus were also not significantly different from those obtained with the full restitution of water requirements irr afterwards the response to this water management strategy decreased with values lower than those obtained with di also than rdi1 in 2011 fig 6 significant interaction between year and irrigation management table 5 an explanation of this behavior is that the complete withholding of water supply from the first half of august could have caused a progressive decrease in reserve accumulation in the root system and consequently a yield decline which becomes evident after the first years this behavior can be also attributed to the interannual climate variability in air temperature and vpd and to the different distributions of precipitation in the summer frequency and intensity excluding the 2012 yield due to the unfavorable weather events occurred in the 2011 summer the average yield levels obtained in irr treatment by grande hybrid 6 9 t ha 1 are close to those reported by mullen et al 2002 in the usa 6 5 t ha 1 and falavigna and palumbo 2001 in southern italy 7 3 t ha 1 however the average yield of the two hybrids 6 4 t ha 1 measured in irr treatment during the full development of asparagus 3 8 year old excluding 7 year old was higher than that reported by sterrett et al 1990 in usa 4 5 t ha 1 since they were obtained from old cultivars and therefore less productive a similar yield 6 6 t ha 1 was found by drost 1996 in utah usa with irrigation treatment of 80 et and by brainard et al 2019 with sub surface drip irrigation in western michigan usa during 2017 season 6 2 t ha 1 in effect more evidences on the effects of soil water stress on asparagus yield in mediterranean area are not reported in literature drost 1996 shows that decreasing the amount of irrigation to asparagus from 80 et to 0 et in the previous year resulted in a linear reduction of the spear yield number and weight of the following spring brainard et al 2019 show that yields of asparagus were influenced by cultivar and irrigation treatments none overhead or sub surface drip the highest yield 7 t ha 1 was obtained under overhead irrigation for the guelph millennium our results show that the irrigation deficit strategies result in a significant reduction in yield from the 3 year old 2008 to the 6 year old 2011 asparagus this involves the development of a smaller canopy because of the water stress therefore the soil water deficit cumulated over years may limit plant growth by decreasing the number of available buds and consequently by decreasing the yield drost 1996 drost and wilcox lee 1997a 1997b however data here shown demonstrate that a mild water deficit allows to use water more efficiently without compromising the marketable value of asparagus after the unfavorable weather conditions of the 2011 summer spears were harvested in small quantities in 2012 and only in the 7th year 2013 yields were restored to average values consequently a greater accumulation of reserve carbohydrates was allowed in the root system in order to preserve the functionality of asparagus crops in subsequent years 5 conclusions the statistical analysis of the multi year dataset showed that asparagus productivity varies significantly over time being affected mainly by meteorological conditions and by water management and at a lesser extent by the hybrid under mediterranean conditions asparagus yield depends on irrigation strategies however this study indicates that reducing irrigation volume depresses yield if compared to the asparagus production harvested from the experimental treatments receiving full irrigation throughout the whole crop cycle since the sustainability of full irrigation techniques is questionable in the mediterranean climate environments alternative approaches are proposed through adequate deficit irrigation techniques it is possible to reduce irrigation water volume and to improve water use efficiency in terms of etc or irrigation volume with minor consequences on the final yield the results of the on field multi year experiment allow to recommend that among the tested irrigation treatments two di and rdi2 out of three demonstrate to save the seasonal irrigation water volumes 34 with the least consequences on the final yield 13 and to increase wuei values 25 on the contrary rdi1 strategy saves the seasonal irrigation water volumes 67 with severe consequences on the final yield 31 from an agronomic point of view the deficit irrigation is confirmed to be a possible option also for the perennial vegetable cropping systems aiming at saving water resources different it is the farmer s point of view at a farm scale the choice between full or deficit irrigation depends on economic convenience i e the balance between less yield and the costs for water and its supplying the choice of the hybrid contributes as well as to the success of the irrigation deficit techniques after the results from this study italo hybrid demonstrated to provide better and more stable productive performances 
11071,unsustainable groundwater withdrawal is a major challenge facing semi arid and arid regions of the world where groundwater is the primary source of irrigation water conversion of some agricultural land to fallow land is one of the possible solutions to reduce the groundwater withdrawal to bring it to safe yield such a solution has a negative economic impact in this study we have developed an optimization approach that can use used to identify the size and type of the agricultural area to be fallowed to ensure sustainable groundwater use for irrigation with as little economic impact as possible this approach is based on the concept of profit productivity which relies on landsat imageries to calculate crop yield and irrigation water withdrawal and available in situ data to calculate energy cost we have applied this approach to the neyshabour basin in iran that has been experiencing unsustainable groundwater withdrawal for the last 30 years our sample results indicate that in order to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawal with minimum economic impact 4 of the agricultural land needs to be converted to fallow land by fallowing most of the agricultural land used for growing tomatoes keywords water energy productivity remote sensing conversion to fallow land sustainable groundwater withdrawal 1 introduction achieving food security is one of the greatest challenges confronting societies in iran and many semi arid and arid parts of the world where water is the limiting resource for agriculture arabi yazdi et al 2009 mousavi baygi et al 2016 considering that iran s mean annual rainfall is only 250 mm and over 80 of its territory is located in arid and semi arid regions it is clear that iran is in a state of chronic water security bannayan et al 2011 the situation could be exacerbated by increased demand for food due to population growth and inefficient use of existing water resources unless corrective actions are taken our study region the neyshabour basin in iran embodies most of the key challenges of water resource management in iran specifically unsustainable use of groundwater and increased demand for water from growing population and urbanization and industrialization groundwater is a critical resource for farmers in the neyshabour basin as it provides 93 5 of the agricultural water used by the basin s farms groundwater withdrawals in the basin have been exceeding the recharge since 1986 hoseini et al 2005 losing more than 200 mcm annually which has resulted in a drop in groundwater level by about 82 cm moghaddam et al 2014 there are a number of promising management options and technologies that could improve water use efficiency to maximize agricultural production and ensure food security geerts and raes 2009 reported that deficit irrigation is successful in increasing water productivity for various crops without causing severe yield reductions photovoltaic water pumping technology is considered as a sustainable solution to provide irrigation water campana et al 2015 2013 closas and rap 2017 niajalili et al 2017 omer 2001 and iran has abundant solar energy cost effective thermal infrared sensors coupled with cellular applications enables effective monitoring of crop water stress and therefore could help guide and improve the efficiency of water usage lee et al 2015 it was reported that the adoption of agricultural technologies are influenced by household socioeconomic institutional and plot level characteristics ahmed et al 2017 teklewold et al 2013 found out that the highest farmers income was achieved when technologies were adopted in combination with crop management practices rather than in isolation teklewold et al 2013 conversion of agricultural land to fallow land is one of the possible solutions to reduce the groundwater withdrawal rate to the safe yield this approach has a negative economic consequence and a guideline needs to be developed for stakeholders to identify the size and type of agricultural areas to be converted to fallow land with minimum economic impact the purpose of this study is to develop an optimized approach that would suggest optimal cropping areas for each dominant crop types while ensuring sustainable use of groundwater resources with minimum economic impact the study relies on satellite imageries groundwater level data from 60 piezometer wells located across the basin meteorological station data and fao reports concerning iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the neyshabour basin is located in the northeast of iran bounded by longitude 58 17 59 30 e latitude 35 40 36 39 n fig 1 the basin area is 73 000 km2 of which 56 is plain area and the rest 46 is mountainous elevation varies from 1050 m a s to 3300 m a s l binaloud heights velayati and tavassloi 1991 climate is characterized as semi arid to arid with mean annual precipitation of 292 mm maximum minimum air temperature of 42 c 24 c annual potential evapotranspiration of 2335 mm bannayan et al 2010 dehghan et al 2011 izady et al 2012 divided the basin into 199 catchments based on their research groundwater is the primary source of freshwater in the basin and covers 93 5 of the irrigated agriculture water demand izady et al 2012 2 2 remote sensing data we used the landsat 8 archive to classify the crop types and calculate the actual evapotranspiration a key component of crop water productivity the landsat visible and infrared bands have a 30 m 30 m pixel size and the thermal bands have a 60 m 60 m pixel size the landsat sensors revisit each location on earth every 16 days the entire study basin is covered by two orbits paths rows 159 35 and 160 35 spaced 7 days apart we put together imageries from the two orbits to form one imagery that covers the entire study area the landsat data were directly downloaded from the center science processing archive espa 2019 n d we downloaded the landsat data for a one year period 1 oct 2014 10 sep 2015 which is our study period 2 3 methodology our methodology to develop crop water productivity involves the following steps 1 crop type classification using landsat imageries 2 evapotranspiration computation using landsat imageries 3 precipitation computation using weather station data 4 crop yield computation using evapotranspiration estimates 5 crop water productivity computation using evapotranspiration and precipitation estimates and last 6 optimize crop area based on two different scenarios the methodologies involved in each step are briefly described below 2 4 crop type classification we selected the landsat 8 data for two different dates 21 may 2015 and 25 august 25 that represent the winter and spring seasons respectively we applied the supervised classification method to the landsat imageries to classify the crop types we created multiband raster images by combining landsat bands 6 5 and 2 peters 2015 the training samples were collected by the experts of the government s agricultural organization who made a field trip to the basin and collected the latitude longitude of each sample using gps and noted the corresponding crop type the training samples table 1 were superimposed on the multiband raster images the decision to assign crop types to each of the landsat pixels was made using the maximum likelihood method that utilizes the training samples and the reflectance in the three bands of the multiband raster images the maximum likelihood method is the most popular classifier and assigns the crop type with a higher probability duda and hart 1973 foody et al 1992 jia et al 2011 there are always errors in such satellite based classifications and we assessed the accuracy of our classification through validation involving additional ground truth data that were not used in the training samples 2 5 actual evapotranspiration eta we estimated the annual actual evapotranspiration eta based on landsat 8 imageries for the period of 1 october 2014 to 10 september 2015 first we downloaded the landsat 8 imageries for clear sky or little cloudy sky conditions i e 10 of the study basin covered with clouds this has resulted in 24 images during the study period or 12 paired images covering the entire basin given that two images cover the basin table 2 presents the date of image acquisition along with other landsat orbit information we applied the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal method for computing eta from the landsat data allen et al 2002a bastiaanssen et al 1998b 1998a the sebal method uses the energy budget equation to calculate the latent heat flux λet as a residue of the energy balance equation over each pixel at the satellite overpass time 1 λ e t r n h g where rn is the net radiation h is the sensible heat flux and g is the soil heat flux all in w m 2 rn is computed as the sum of net shortwave and net longwave radiation components 2 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where r s is the incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 r l is the incoming longwave radiation w m 2 r l is the outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 α is the land surface albedo and ε 0 is the land surface emissivity the main steps and variables involved in estimating rn are shown in the flowchart of fig 2 for the landsat 8 data the land surface albedo was estimated using the following equation liang 2000 smith 2010 zanter 2016 3 α 0 356 ρ 2 0 130 ρ 4 0 373 ρ 5 0 085 ρ 6 0 072 ρ 7 0 0018 0 356 0 130 0 373 0 085 0 072 where ρi represents the reflectance in spectral band i of the landsat 8 satellite sensors for the landsat 8 data the surface temperature at the top of the atmosphere ttoa was obtained from the radiance measurements of landsat 8 thermal bands 10 and 11 using the following equation li et al 2013 4 t t o a k 2 ln k 1 l λ 1 where k1 and k2 are thermal conversion parameters for bands 10 and 11 respectively then the land surface temperature ts is calculated from ttoa using the following equation li et al 2013 5 l s t t t o a 1 w t t o a p ln ε n b where w is the wavelength of emitted radiance 11 5 μm p is a constant of 14380 and εnb is the surface emissivity dimensionless badino 2009 the remaining equations applicable for all thermal based remote sensing data for estimating rn are given in detail in bastiaanssen et al 1998a b and allen et al 2002a among others the soil heat flux g estimated as a fraction of the net radiation g rn is estimated as richard g allen et al 2002a 6 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 n d v i 4 where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index and ts is in c the sensible heat flux h is computed using wind speed observations estimated surface roughness and surface to air temperature differences dt that are obtained through a self calibration between dry and wet pixels following bastiaanssen et al 1998a b in fig 3 we present the iterative process to estimate h from landsat data using the sebal method once rn g and h were estimated the next step was to solve for instantaneous λet for each pixel using eq 1 the instantaneous λet was then scaled to the daily timescale using the following relationship allen et al 2002b 7 e t a e t r λ e t λ e t r where eta denotes the daily actual evapotranspiration etr denotes the daily reference crop evapotranspiration λet is the instantaneous latent heat flux and the subscript r refers to the reference crop in this case well irrigated field etr was obtained by the asce penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and λetr is estimated using the sebal method described above and the crop reference parameter values 2 6 crop yield the actual crop yield ya is estimated following the fao 66 approach steduto et al 2012 8 1 y a y x k y 1 e t a e t x where yx and ya are the maximum and actual yields kg ha etx and eta are the maximum and actual evapotranspiration mm and ky is a yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yield losses the following steps were used to calculate ya i the maximum yield yx was estimated for each crop using the fao 33 approach doorenbos and kassam 1979 ii the maximum evapotranspiration etx was calculated for the entire growing period and considers that the crop water requirements are fully met the hargreaves samani method was used to compute reference evapotranspiration using meteorological data at the station site the potential et for each crop was obtained by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient values which vary by crop type and stage of growth allen et al 1998 iii the actual eta was obtained using the sebal method iv the yield response factor for each crop was obtained from the fao 66 approach steduto et al 2012 the response factor values were 1 05 for wheat barley and tomato and 1 25 for maize 2 7 precipitation daily precipitation data were obtained from 13 meteorological stations in the basin see table 3 we aggregated the data from daily to monthly timescales we estimated the precipitation for each catchment by interpolating the station precipitation data using topo to raster tool 2 8 crop water productivity cwp the crop water productivity cwp kg m3 is defined as the amount of yield per cubic meter of water applied to irrigate the unit area of land m3 the cwp can be calculated using the following equation steduto et al 2012 9 c w p y a 0 1 e t a p e where pe is the effective precipitation that is a portion of the precipitation that is available for crops we assumed that 80 of the precipitation would be effective precipitation 2 9 financial crop productivity financial productivity can be defined differently with respect to the unique situation in this study they are income productivity ip and profit productivity pp as mentioned the objective of this study is to optimize income income productivity function defined as the value of yield in per cubic meter of water that applied to irrigate the crop this can be defined in the form of eq 10 where pe is effective precipitation which has been estimated based on a method provided by maidment and mays 1968 10 i p y a c r o p p r i c e 0 1 e t a p e income productivity only considers farmer s income but what really matters from farmers point of view is the maximum profit that can be obtained therefore another equation was defined called profit productivity thus the farmers initial and continuous investment must be deducted from income estimating the amount of farmers initial investment at basin level is quite impossible due to different management farm size crop variety and other factors to simplify this problem in this study due to global energy price it is assumed that the only investment that farmers should make is the money they should pay for pumping up water from groundwater which is a function of groundwater depth groundwater level changes through the year but its changes are negligible to estimate groundwater level in this study piezometer water level for the whole year was collected and input as a point feature in arcgis software and then was interpolated through the basin to calculate profit productivity as the objective function according to the above mentioned definition eq 11 was used as below 11 p p y a c r o p p r i c e 0 1 e t a p e g w d 9 81 0 0003 1000 e n e r g y p r i c e e t a p e where gwd is the groundwater depth m energy price is the value of each kilowatt hour in the dollar kwh energy price was assumed as 10 cents kwh crop prices were collected based on the latest fao report in 2014 for iran which is 0 32 kg for wheat and barley and 0 34 kg and 0 28 kg for tomato and maize respectively 2 10 optimization of cultivation areas given that the current rate of groundwater use for irrigation is unsustainable i e groundwater use exceeds recharge rate we asked the question to what extent should the cultivation area be reduced to ensure sustainable groundwater use for irrigation with as little economic impact as possible to address this question we used the following objective function 12 m a x p p a m p p a w p p a b p p a t constraints are 1 crop land limits 13 a m a w a b

cultivation areas for all four crops combined ai current is the current cultivation area for each crop type i i maize wheat barley and tomato ac current is the current total cultivation area for all four crops combined abasin is the total area of the basin and pbasin is the basin wide precipitation depth eta c is the total evapotranspiration depth for all the crops combined using the optimal cultivation areas and pe is part of the rainfall that is used by the crops for evapotranspiration constraint 1 ensures that the total cultivation area after optimization must be less than or equal to the total current cultivation area constraint 2 guarantees that the area for each crop type should not be less than 20 of its current cultivation area constraint 3 ensures that the area that would be gained from each crop type due to the optimization would be fallowed and not used for cultivating other crop types constraint 4 is about limiting groundwater withdrawal for irrigation to ensure sustainability two options are considered for this last constraint first option 4a where the maximum groundwater withdrawal is allowed to go as high as the recharge rate but not exceeding the recharge rate and second option 4b is where the maximum groundwater withdrawal is limited to 75 of the recharge rate the objective function eq 12 provides one way of calculating the areas that could be reduced from each crop type in order to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawal for irrigation the objective function is based on maximizing the total profit productivity i e profit in dollar value per unit of water used while meeting all the constraints listed above such objective function tends to affect the cultivation area of crops that have less profit and high crop water requirement fig 4 3 results 3 1 crop type classification the results for crop type classification based on landsat imageries identified four major crop types in the basin maize tomato barley and wheat the areas covered by each crop type resulting from the classification are shown in table 4 the dominant crop types vary by season during the spring season the dominant crop types are tomato and maize accounting for 74 and 15 respectively of the total area covered by crops during the winter season the dominant crop types are wheat and barley accounting for 44 and 40 respectively of the total area covered by crops the classification accuracy overall accuracy of around 85 was deemed acceptable camps valls et al 2014 based on the error matrix results presented in tables 5 and 6 3 2 actual evapotranspiration eta the annual 1 october 2014 to 10 september 2015 eta values for the dominant crop types are shown in fig 5 fig 5a for tomato fig 5b for maize and fig 5c for wheat and barley combined we combined the winter crops wheat and barley since they have a similar length of the growth period crop water requirement and yield response factor tomato has higher eta by about 30 more than the other crops which have similar eta the spatial mean annual eta values were 1406 mm 1063 mm and 1096 for tomato maize and wheat barley respectively tomato has higher spatial variability than the other crops perhaps due to its large areal coverage during spring 74 of the basin s agricultural areas was covered by tomatoes the spatial coefficient variation cv of eta values were 0 97 0 47 and 0 39 for tomato maize and wheat barley crops respectively elevation accounts for most of the spatial variability of eta as the correlation between eta and elevation were 0 62 0 70 and 0 74 for tomato maize and wheat barley respectively high elevation areas receive more rainfall and hence have higher actual evapotranspiration 3 3 crop yield the annual crop yield kg ha values for the dominant crop types are shown in fig 6 a for tomato fig 6b for maize and fig 6c for wheat and barley combined maize had the highest crop yield followed by wheat barley the average crop yield for maize was 90 more than that for wheat and barley and 554 more than that for tomato the spatial mean annual crop yield values were 28 216 kg ha 14 867 kg ha and 4314 kg ha for maize wheat barley and tomato respectively the spatial variability of crop yield was largely explained by elevation differences within the basin as the correlation between crop yield and elevation were 0 69 0 74 and 0 53 for maize wheat barley and tomato respectively 3 4 crop water productivity cwp the corresponding crop water productivity kg m3 values are shown in fig 7 a for tomato fig 7b for maize and fig 7c for wheat and barley combined maize had the highest cwp followed by wheat barley while tomato had very low productivity the cwp of maize is about 30 more than that of wheat barley and 310 more than that of tomato the spatial mean cwp were 22 1 kg m3 16 7 kg m3 and 3 1 kg m3 for maize wheat barley and tomato respectively the spatial variability of cwp is minimum for maize and tomato cv under 0 10 and relatively higher for wheat barley cv of 1 36 3 5 financial productivity fig 9 presents the profit productivity profit in dollar value per cube meter if irrigation water used for the current cropping pattern according to the spatial mean productivity values maize has the largest profit productivity 0 98 m3 on average followed by wheat and barley 0 41 m3 on average whereas tomato has the least profit productivity 0 06 m3 on average it is to be noted that although maize has the lowest crop price 0 28 kg for maize compared to 0 32 kg for wheat and 0 34 kg for tomato and barley its crop yield is much higher than all the other crops 22 kg m3 for maize 11 11 kg m3 for wheat barley and 3 13 kg m3 for tomato in addition the crop water requirement for maize is much lower 967 mm for maize compared to 1502 mm for wheat barley and 1384 mm for tomato all spatial average values by applying eqs 10 and 11 average income and profit productivity for each crop were computed and results are shown in fig 8 a b c and 9 a b c for tomato maize and wheat and barley crops respectively in per cubic meter of water 3 6 optimization of cultivated areas we first examine the current cultivation area for each crop type wheat and barley account for 90 4 of the total cultivation area whereas maize and tomato account for 3 8 and 5 8 respectively the overall profit productivity is 0 48 m3 water and the groundwater withdrawal exceeds the recharge rate result not shown next we examine the optimized cultivation areas for the scenario where the maximum groundwater withdrawal is equal to or less than the recharge rate see eq 16 the optimal results are see table 7 a keep the cultivation area for maize as is b reduce the cultivation area for tomato to the minimum possible in our study 20 of the current size is arbitrarily set as a minimum and c reduce the cultivation area for wheat and barley by 1 this translates to fallowing 1908 2 ha of agricultural area or 4 of the total agricultural area obtained through fallowing 1512 8 ha of the agricultural area used for tomato and fallowing 395 4 ha of the agricultural area used for wheat and barley the overall profit productivity is 0 48 m3 water in addition the optimized cultivation areas ensure that the groundwater withdrawal is within safe yield finally let us examine the optimized cultivation areas for the scenario where the groundwater withdrawal is below 75 of the recharge rate a constraint introduced to gradually increase the groundwater level to bring it to where it was several years ago the optimal results see table 7 are a keep the cultivation area for maize as is b reduce the cultivation area for tomato to the minimum possible in our study 20 of the current size is arbitrarily set as a minimum and c reduce the cultivation area for wheat and barley by 13 this translates to fallowing 7104 6 ha of agricultural area or 15 of the total agricultural area obtained through fallowing 1512 8 ha of the agricultural area used for tomato and fallowing 5601 4 ha of the agricultural area used for wheat and barley the overall profit productivity is 0 48 m3 water in addition the optimized cultivation areas ensure that the groundwater withdrawal is always less than 75 of the recharge rate implying rising groundwater level over time 4 discussions in arid and semi arid regions such as the study area where water is more scarce than arable land the cwp concept provides useful indexes to assess crop production increase or water saving in irrigated agriculture van dam et al 2006 as illustrated in table 1 studied major crops occupied more than 84 of cultivated land which 92 of it is irrigated fields different indexes have been provided to assess crop production increase but in many studies estimating financial crop productivity have been ignored or accomplished at the farm scale not a basin due to its financial and practical difficulties in iran due to recent since 2017 sanction alongside farmers poor income crop financial productivity attracted more attention meanwhile energy is an essential factor for irrigation and considering its price in crop financial productivity is inevitable the new approach presented in this paper not only include crop prices in financial productivity but also consider energy price which has a direct relation with groundwater depth and availability daccache et al 2014 due to the regional variations in et the point observation of et in field experiment has limited application at a regional scale mauser and schädlich 1998 the development of remote sensing technique in recent decades not only has made it possible to estimate the et over regional scale but also make it possible to estimate the water application indexes spatially li et al 2008 peña arancibia et al 2016 some regional studies have been accomplished in past at farm scale not spatially at the basin scale the main scientific contribution of the manuscript is to estimate cwp ip and pp spatially at the basin scale since the studied basin has a very different climate from place to place the current study results give water governors and stakeholders a vision to investigate different crops at suitable hru for sure the method was provided in the manuscript is not new but the spatial distribution of crop water productivity indexes are new information for water governors in iran neyshabour basin has about 500 000 population with fertile soil but little renewable water resources 235 mm year which cannot meet the need as mentioned in section 3 1 crop type classification two sets of satellite images were obtained with 7 days interval to cover the whole basin different images with different properties cause some error to estimate non agricultural classes however in the current study we are only looking for agricultural classes which have not been overestimated by comparing with official reports khorasan razavi agricultural jihad 2015 the aim of this study was to optimize crop area by considering water energy productivity in neyshabur basin since the water shortage has become a major limiting factor for sustainable development of agriculture in the basin li et al 2008 van dam et al 2006 in this respect water energy crop productivity by considering some simplifying assumption was calculated through the basin and then crop area optimization under two scenarios available water are equal to annual renewable water and available water are equal to 75 of annual renewable water were performed to assess water saving in irrigated agriculture to accomplish this study some inevitable simplifying assumptions were considered which affects the results these assumptions including no pesticides and fertilizers were implied by farmers no workers wage no fuel consumption during planting to harvest and farms management are all the same reducing cultivation area as a solution to maintain groundwater level have been suggested in us high plains and central valley esnault et al 2014 scanlon et al 2012 sophocleous 2005 table 7 illustrates 4 and 15 total cultivation area reduction in order to maintain groundwater steady under each scenario maximum groundwater withdrawals are equal or less than the value of renewable water during the water year and maximum groundwater withdrawals assigned to be less than 75 of the renewable water respectively in northern and north eastern of the basin higher productivity value has been estimated but these areas are mostly mountainous so the fewer area has been cultivated this contradiction happened due to higher evapotranspiration value lots of steep valleys full of water are located in northern and north eastern mountains which results in higher yield and consequently higher productivity since the mean value of productivity pixels considered as the average productivity for each hru not the crop cultivation area even a small cultivated area would have a great impact on the final results 5 conclusions the neyshabur basin in iran is facing increasing water scarcity challenges as its groundwater table is declining each year due to unsustainable groundwater withdrawal for irrigation one approach for addressing the unsustainable groundwater withdrawal is to convert some of the agricultural lands to fallow land for example this approach has been implemented in the u s high plain and central valley region esnault et al 2014 scanlon et al 2012 sophocleous 2005 however to be most effective techniques for identifying those agricultural areas that would be converted to fallow land require an optimization strategy that reduces the overall economic impact the purpose of this study was to develop guidance on those agricultural areas that would be reduced to fallow land for policymakers for ensuring sustainable groundwater withdrawal for irrigation we used maximizing profit productivity profit in dollar value per cubic meter of irrigation waters used as an objective function to optimize cultivation areas for each crop type the profit productivity takes into account crop sales obtained by multiplying the crop yield by the unit crop price energy cost for pumping groundwater and irrigation water withdrawal we used landsat satellite imageries to calculate the crop yield and irrigation water withdrawal and available in situ groundwater level and precipitation data to calculate energy costs our results reveal the following maize has the highest profit productivity followed by wheat and barley whereas tomato has the least productivity the profit productivity of maize is 1 36 times higher than that of wheat and barley and 15 times higher than that of a tomato in order to minimize the economic impact of fallowing land we recommend fallowing agricultural lands used for growing tomatoes to the extent it is possible if the additional area is required the areas used for growing wheat and barley can be considered our optimization results indicate that sustainable groundwater withdrawal i e groundwater withdrawal equal to or less than the recharge rate can be achieved by reducing the total cultivation area by only 4 provided that this is obtained through fallowing most of the tomato agricultural land our optimization results for the conservative sustainable groundwater withdrawal scenario i e groundwater withdrawal equal to or less than 75 of the recharge rate can be achieved by reducing the total cultivation area by 15 provided that this is obtained through fallowing most of the tomato agricultural land and significant portion about 13 of the wheat barley agricultural land our optimization approach can be adjusted to suit to various other constraints and requirements set by stakeholders and policymakers 
11071,unsustainable groundwater withdrawal is a major challenge facing semi arid and arid regions of the world where groundwater is the primary source of irrigation water conversion of some agricultural land to fallow land is one of the possible solutions to reduce the groundwater withdrawal to bring it to safe yield such a solution has a negative economic impact in this study we have developed an optimization approach that can use used to identify the size and type of the agricultural area to be fallowed to ensure sustainable groundwater use for irrigation with as little economic impact as possible this approach is based on the concept of profit productivity which relies on landsat imageries to calculate crop yield and irrigation water withdrawal and available in situ data to calculate energy cost we have applied this approach to the neyshabour basin in iran that has been experiencing unsustainable groundwater withdrawal for the last 30 years our sample results indicate that in order to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawal with minimum economic impact 4 of the agricultural land needs to be converted to fallow land by fallowing most of the agricultural land used for growing tomatoes keywords water energy productivity remote sensing conversion to fallow land sustainable groundwater withdrawal 1 introduction achieving food security is one of the greatest challenges confronting societies in iran and many semi arid and arid parts of the world where water is the limiting resource for agriculture arabi yazdi et al 2009 mousavi baygi et al 2016 considering that iran s mean annual rainfall is only 250 mm and over 80 of its territory is located in arid and semi arid regions it is clear that iran is in a state of chronic water security bannayan et al 2011 the situation could be exacerbated by increased demand for food due to population growth and inefficient use of existing water resources unless corrective actions are taken our study region the neyshabour basin in iran embodies most of the key challenges of water resource management in iran specifically unsustainable use of groundwater and increased demand for water from growing population and urbanization and industrialization groundwater is a critical resource for farmers in the neyshabour basin as it provides 93 5 of the agricultural water used by the basin s farms groundwater withdrawals in the basin have been exceeding the recharge since 1986 hoseini et al 2005 losing more than 200 mcm annually which has resulted in a drop in groundwater level by about 82 cm moghaddam et al 2014 there are a number of promising management options and technologies that could improve water use efficiency to maximize agricultural production and ensure food security geerts and raes 2009 reported that deficit irrigation is successful in increasing water productivity for various crops without causing severe yield reductions photovoltaic water pumping technology is considered as a sustainable solution to provide irrigation water campana et al 2015 2013 closas and rap 2017 niajalili et al 2017 omer 2001 and iran has abundant solar energy cost effective thermal infrared sensors coupled with cellular applications enables effective monitoring of crop water stress and therefore could help guide and improve the efficiency of water usage lee et al 2015 it was reported that the adoption of agricultural technologies are influenced by household socioeconomic institutional and plot level characteristics ahmed et al 2017 teklewold et al 2013 found out that the highest farmers income was achieved when technologies were adopted in combination with crop management practices rather than in isolation teklewold et al 2013 conversion of agricultural land to fallow land is one of the possible solutions to reduce the groundwater withdrawal rate to the safe yield this approach has a negative economic consequence and a guideline needs to be developed for stakeholders to identify the size and type of agricultural areas to be converted to fallow land with minimum economic impact the purpose of this study is to develop an optimized approach that would suggest optimal cropping areas for each dominant crop types while ensuring sustainable use of groundwater resources with minimum economic impact the study relies on satellite imageries groundwater level data from 60 piezometer wells located across the basin meteorological station data and fao reports concerning iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the neyshabour basin is located in the northeast of iran bounded by longitude 58 17 59 30 e latitude 35 40 36 39 n fig 1 the basin area is 73 000 km2 of which 56 is plain area and the rest 46 is mountainous elevation varies from 1050 m a s to 3300 m a s l binaloud heights velayati and tavassloi 1991 climate is characterized as semi arid to arid with mean annual precipitation of 292 mm maximum minimum air temperature of 42 c 24 c annual potential evapotranspiration of 2335 mm bannayan et al 2010 dehghan et al 2011 izady et al 2012 divided the basin into 199 catchments based on their research groundwater is the primary source of freshwater in the basin and covers 93 5 of the irrigated agriculture water demand izady et al 2012 2 2 remote sensing data we used the landsat 8 archive to classify the crop types and calculate the actual evapotranspiration a key component of crop water productivity the landsat visible and infrared bands have a 30 m 30 m pixel size and the thermal bands have a 60 m 60 m pixel size the landsat sensors revisit each location on earth every 16 days the entire study basin is covered by two orbits paths rows 159 35 and 160 35 spaced 7 days apart we put together imageries from the two orbits to form one imagery that covers the entire study area the landsat data were directly downloaded from the center science processing archive espa 2019 n d we downloaded the landsat data for a one year period 1 oct 2014 10 sep 2015 which is our study period 2 3 methodology our methodology to develop crop water productivity involves the following steps 1 crop type classification using landsat imageries 2 evapotranspiration computation using landsat imageries 3 precipitation computation using weather station data 4 crop yield computation using evapotranspiration estimates 5 crop water productivity computation using evapotranspiration and precipitation estimates and last 6 optimize crop area based on two different scenarios the methodologies involved in each step are briefly described below 2 4 crop type classification we selected the landsat 8 data for two different dates 21 may 2015 and 25 august 25 that represent the winter and spring seasons respectively we applied the supervised classification method to the landsat imageries to classify the crop types we created multiband raster images by combining landsat bands 6 5 and 2 peters 2015 the training samples were collected by the experts of the government s agricultural organization who made a field trip to the basin and collected the latitude longitude of each sample using gps and noted the corresponding crop type the training samples table 1 were superimposed on the multiband raster images the decision to assign crop types to each of the landsat pixels was made using the maximum likelihood method that utilizes the training samples and the reflectance in the three bands of the multiband raster images the maximum likelihood method is the most popular classifier and assigns the crop type with a higher probability duda and hart 1973 foody et al 1992 jia et al 2011 there are always errors in such satellite based classifications and we assessed the accuracy of our classification through validation involving additional ground truth data that were not used in the training samples 2 5 actual evapotranspiration eta we estimated the annual actual evapotranspiration eta based on landsat 8 imageries for the period of 1 october 2014 to 10 september 2015 first we downloaded the landsat 8 imageries for clear sky or little cloudy sky conditions i e 10 of the study basin covered with clouds this has resulted in 24 images during the study period or 12 paired images covering the entire basin given that two images cover the basin table 2 presents the date of image acquisition along with other landsat orbit information we applied the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal method for computing eta from the landsat data allen et al 2002a bastiaanssen et al 1998b 1998a the sebal method uses the energy budget equation to calculate the latent heat flux λet as a residue of the energy balance equation over each pixel at the satellite overpass time 1 λ e t r n h g where rn is the net radiation h is the sensible heat flux and g is the soil heat flux all in w m 2 rn is computed as the sum of net shortwave and net longwave radiation components 2 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where r s is the incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 r l is the incoming longwave radiation w m 2 r l is the outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 α is the land surface albedo and ε 0 is the land surface emissivity the main steps and variables involved in estimating rn are shown in the flowchart of fig 2 for the landsat 8 data the land surface albedo was estimated using the following equation liang 2000 smith 2010 zanter 2016 3 α 0 356 ρ 2 0 130 ρ 4 0 373 ρ 5 0 085 ρ 6 0 072 ρ 7 0 0018 0 356 0 130 0 373 0 085 0 072 where ρi represents the reflectance in spectral band i of the landsat 8 satellite sensors for the landsat 8 data the surface temperature at the top of the atmosphere ttoa was obtained from the radiance measurements of landsat 8 thermal bands 10 and 11 using the following equation li et al 2013 4 t t o a k 2 ln k 1 l λ 1 where k1 and k2 are thermal conversion parameters for bands 10 and 11 respectively then the land surface temperature ts is calculated from ttoa using the following equation li et al 2013 5 l s t t t o a 1 w t t o a p ln ε n b where w is the wavelength of emitted radiance 11 5 μm p is a constant of 14380 and εnb is the surface emissivity dimensionless badino 2009 the remaining equations applicable for all thermal based remote sensing data for estimating rn are given in detail in bastiaanssen et al 1998a b and allen et al 2002a among others the soil heat flux g estimated as a fraction of the net radiation g rn is estimated as richard g allen et al 2002a 6 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 n d v i 4 where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index and ts is in c the sensible heat flux h is computed using wind speed observations estimated surface roughness and surface to air temperature differences dt that are obtained through a self calibration between dry and wet pixels following bastiaanssen et al 1998a b in fig 3 we present the iterative process to estimate h from landsat data using the sebal method once rn g and h were estimated the next step was to solve for instantaneous λet for each pixel using eq 1 the instantaneous λet was then scaled to the daily timescale using the following relationship allen et al 2002b 7 e t a e t r λ e t λ e t r where eta denotes the daily actual evapotranspiration etr denotes the daily reference crop evapotranspiration λet is the instantaneous latent heat flux and the subscript r refers to the reference crop in this case well irrigated field etr was obtained by the asce penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and λetr is estimated using the sebal method described above and the crop reference parameter values 2 6 crop yield the actual crop yield ya is estimated following the fao 66 approach steduto et al 2012 8 1 y a y x k y 1 e t a e t x where yx and ya are the maximum and actual yields kg ha etx and eta are the maximum and actual evapotranspiration mm and ky is a yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yield losses the following steps were used to calculate ya i the maximum yield yx was estimated for each crop using the fao 33 approach doorenbos and kassam 1979 ii the maximum evapotranspiration etx was calculated for the entire growing period and considers that the crop water requirements are fully met the hargreaves samani method was used to compute reference evapotranspiration using meteorological data at the station site the potential et for each crop was obtained by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient values which vary by crop type and stage of growth allen et al 1998 iii the actual eta was obtained using the sebal method iv the yield response factor for each crop was obtained from the fao 66 approach steduto et al 2012 the response factor values were 1 05 for wheat barley and tomato and 1 25 for maize 2 7 precipitation daily precipitation data were obtained from 13 meteorological stations in the basin see table 3 we aggregated the data from daily to monthly timescales we estimated the precipitation for each catchment by interpolating the station precipitation data using topo to raster tool 2 8 crop water productivity cwp the crop water productivity cwp kg m3 is defined as the amount of yield per cubic meter of water applied to irrigate the unit area of land m3 the cwp can be calculated using the following equation steduto et al 2012 9 c w p y a 0 1 e t a p e where pe is the effective precipitation that is a portion of the precipitation that is available for crops we assumed that 80 of the precipitation would be effective precipitation 2 9 financial crop productivity financial productivity can be defined differently with respect to the unique situation in this study they are income productivity ip and profit productivity pp as mentioned the objective of this study is to optimize income income productivity function defined as the value of yield in per cubic meter of water that applied to irrigate the crop this can be defined in the form of eq 10 where pe is effective precipitation which has been estimated based on a method provided by maidment and mays 1968 10 i p y a c r o p p r i c e 0 1 e t a p e income productivity only considers farmer s income but what really matters from farmers point of view is the maximum profit that can be obtained therefore another equation was defined called profit productivity thus the farmers initial and continuous investment must be deducted from income estimating the amount of farmers initial investment at basin level is quite impossible due to different management farm size crop variety and other factors to simplify this problem in this study due to global energy price it is assumed that the only investment that farmers should make is the money they should pay for pumping up water from groundwater which is a function of groundwater depth groundwater level changes through the year but its changes are negligible to estimate groundwater level in this study piezometer water level for the whole year was collected and input as a point feature in arcgis software and then was interpolated through the basin to calculate profit productivity as the objective function according to the above mentioned definition eq 11 was used as below 11 p p y a c r o p p r i c e 0 1 e t a p e g w d 9 81 0 0003 1000 e n e r g y p r i c e e t a p e where gwd is the groundwater depth m energy price is the value of each kilowatt hour in the dollar kwh energy price was assumed as 10 cents kwh crop prices were collected based on the latest fao report in 2014 for iran which is 0 32 kg for wheat and barley and 0 34 kg and 0 28 kg for tomato and maize respectively 2 10 optimization of cultivation areas given that the current rate of groundwater use for irrigation is unsustainable i e groundwater use exceeds recharge rate we asked the question to what extent should the cultivation area be reduced to ensure sustainable groundwater use for irrigation with as little economic impact as possible to address this question we used the following objective function 12 m a x p p a m p p a w p p a b p p a t constraints are 1 crop land limits 13 a m a w a b

cultivation areas for all four crops combined ai current is the current cultivation area for each crop type i i maize wheat barley and tomato ac current is the current total cultivation area for all four crops combined abasin is the total area of the basin and pbasin is the basin wide precipitation depth eta c is the total evapotranspiration depth for all the crops combined using the optimal cultivation areas and pe is part of the rainfall that is used by the crops for evapotranspiration constraint 1 ensures that the total cultivation area after optimization must be less than or equal to the total current cultivation area constraint 2 guarantees that the area for each crop type should not be less than 20 of its current cultivation area constraint 3 ensures that the area that would be gained from each crop type due to the optimization would be fallowed and not used for cultivating other crop types constraint 4 is about limiting groundwater withdrawal for irrigation to ensure sustainability two options are considered for this last constraint first option 4a where the maximum groundwater withdrawal is allowed to go as high as the recharge rate but not exceeding the recharge rate and second option 4b is where the maximum groundwater withdrawal is limited to 75 of the recharge rate the objective function eq 12 provides one way of calculating the areas that could be reduced from each crop type in order to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawal for irrigation the objective function is based on maximizing the total profit productivity i e profit in dollar value per unit of water used while meeting all the constraints listed above such objective function tends to affect the cultivation area of crops that have less profit and high crop water requirement fig 4 3 results 3 1 crop type classification the results for crop type classification based on landsat imageries identified four major crop types in the basin maize tomato barley and wheat the areas covered by each crop type resulting from the classification are shown in table 4 the dominant crop types vary by season during the spring season the dominant crop types are tomato and maize accounting for 74 and 15 respectively of the total area covered by crops during the winter season the dominant crop types are wheat and barley accounting for 44 and 40 respectively of the total area covered by crops the classification accuracy overall accuracy of around 85 was deemed acceptable camps valls et al 2014 based on the error matrix results presented in tables 5 and 6 3 2 actual evapotranspiration eta the annual 1 october 2014 to 10 september 2015 eta values for the dominant crop types are shown in fig 5 fig 5a for tomato fig 5b for maize and fig 5c for wheat and barley combined we combined the winter crops wheat and barley since they have a similar length of the growth period crop water requirement and yield response factor tomato has higher eta by about 30 more than the other crops which have similar eta the spatial mean annual eta values were 1406 mm 1063 mm and 1096 for tomato maize and wheat barley respectively tomato has higher spatial variability than the other crops perhaps due to its large areal coverage during spring 74 of the basin s agricultural areas was covered by tomatoes the spatial coefficient variation cv of eta values were 0 97 0 47 and 0 39 for tomato maize and wheat barley crops respectively elevation accounts for most of the spatial variability of eta as the correlation between eta and elevation were 0 62 0 70 and 0 74 for tomato maize and wheat barley respectively high elevation areas receive more rainfall and hence have higher actual evapotranspiration 3 3 crop yield the annual crop yield kg ha values for the dominant crop types are shown in fig 6 a for tomato fig 6b for maize and fig 6c for wheat and barley combined maize had the highest crop yield followed by wheat barley the average crop yield for maize was 90 more than that for wheat and barley and 554 more than that for tomato the spatial mean annual crop yield values were 28 216 kg ha 14 867 kg ha and 4314 kg ha for maize wheat barley and tomato respectively the spatial variability of crop yield was largely explained by elevation differences within the basin as the correlation between crop yield and elevation were 0 69 0 74 and 0 53 for maize wheat barley and tomato respectively 3 4 crop water productivity cwp the corresponding crop water productivity kg m3 values are shown in fig 7 a for tomato fig 7b for maize and fig 7c for wheat and barley combined maize had the highest cwp followed by wheat barley while tomato had very low productivity the cwp of maize is about 30 more than that of wheat barley and 310 more than that of tomato the spatial mean cwp were 22 1 kg m3 16 7 kg m3 and 3 1 kg m3 for maize wheat barley and tomato respectively the spatial variability of cwp is minimum for maize and tomato cv under 0 10 and relatively higher for wheat barley cv of 1 36 3 5 financial productivity fig 9 presents the profit productivity profit in dollar value per cube meter if irrigation water used for the current cropping pattern according to the spatial mean productivity values maize has the largest profit productivity 0 98 m3 on average followed by wheat and barley 0 41 m3 on average whereas tomato has the least profit productivity 0 06 m3 on average it is to be noted that although maize has the lowest crop price 0 28 kg for maize compared to 0 32 kg for wheat and 0 34 kg for tomato and barley its crop yield is much higher than all the other crops 22 kg m3 for maize 11 11 kg m3 for wheat barley and 3 13 kg m3 for tomato in addition the crop water requirement for maize is much lower 967 mm for maize compared to 1502 mm for wheat barley and 1384 mm for tomato all spatial average values by applying eqs 10 and 11 average income and profit productivity for each crop were computed and results are shown in fig 8 a b c and 9 a b c for tomato maize and wheat and barley crops respectively in per cubic meter of water 3 6 optimization of cultivated areas we first examine the current cultivation area for each crop type wheat and barley account for 90 4 of the total cultivation area whereas maize and tomato account for 3 8 and 5 8 respectively the overall profit productivity is 0 48 m3 water and the groundwater withdrawal exceeds the recharge rate result not shown next we examine the optimized cultivation areas for the scenario where the maximum groundwater withdrawal is equal to or less than the recharge rate see eq 16 the optimal results are see table 7 a keep the cultivation area for maize as is b reduce the cultivation area for tomato to the minimum possible in our study 20 of the current size is arbitrarily set as a minimum and c reduce the cultivation area for wheat and barley by 1 this translates to fallowing 1908 2 ha of agricultural area or 4 of the total agricultural area obtained through fallowing 1512 8 ha of the agricultural area used for tomato and fallowing 395 4 ha of the agricultural area used for wheat and barley the overall profit productivity is 0 48 m3 water in addition the optimized cultivation areas ensure that the groundwater withdrawal is within safe yield finally let us examine the optimized cultivation areas for the scenario where the groundwater withdrawal is below 75 of the recharge rate a constraint introduced to gradually increase the groundwater level to bring it to where it was several years ago the optimal results see table 7 are a keep the cultivation area for maize as is b reduce the cultivation area for tomato to the minimum possible in our study 20 of the current size is arbitrarily set as a minimum and c reduce the cultivation area for wheat and barley by 13 this translates to fallowing 7104 6 ha of agricultural area or 15 of the total agricultural area obtained through fallowing 1512 8 ha of the agricultural area used for tomato and fallowing 5601 4 ha of the agricultural area used for wheat and barley the overall profit productivity is 0 48 m3 water in addition the optimized cultivation areas ensure that the groundwater withdrawal is always less than 75 of the recharge rate implying rising groundwater level over time 4 discussions in arid and semi arid regions such as the study area where water is more scarce than arable land the cwp concept provides useful indexes to assess crop production increase or water saving in irrigated agriculture van dam et al 2006 as illustrated in table 1 studied major crops occupied more than 84 of cultivated land which 92 of it is irrigated fields different indexes have been provided to assess crop production increase but in many studies estimating financial crop productivity have been ignored or accomplished at the farm scale not a basin due to its financial and practical difficulties in iran due to recent since 2017 sanction alongside farmers poor income crop financial productivity attracted more attention meanwhile energy is an essential factor for irrigation and considering its price in crop financial productivity is inevitable the new approach presented in this paper not only include crop prices in financial productivity but also consider energy price which has a direct relation with groundwater depth and availability daccache et al 2014 due to the regional variations in et the point observation of et in field experiment has limited application at a regional scale mauser and schädlich 1998 the development of remote sensing technique in recent decades not only has made it possible to estimate the et over regional scale but also make it possible to estimate the water application indexes spatially li et al 2008 peña arancibia et al 2016 some regional studies have been accomplished in past at farm scale not spatially at the basin scale the main scientific contribution of the manuscript is to estimate cwp ip and pp spatially at the basin scale since the studied basin has a very different climate from place to place the current study results give water governors and stakeholders a vision to investigate different crops at suitable hru for sure the method was provided in the manuscript is not new but the spatial distribution of crop water productivity indexes are new information for water governors in iran neyshabour basin has about 500 000 population with fertile soil but little renewable water resources 235 mm year which cannot meet the need as mentioned in section 3 1 crop type classification two sets of satellite images were obtained with 7 days interval to cover the whole basin different images with different properties cause some error to estimate non agricultural classes however in the current study we are only looking for agricultural classes which have not been overestimated by comparing with official reports khorasan razavi agricultural jihad 2015 the aim of this study was to optimize crop area by considering water energy productivity in neyshabur basin since the water shortage has become a major limiting factor for sustainable development of agriculture in the basin li et al 2008 van dam et al 2006 in this respect water energy crop productivity by considering some simplifying assumption was calculated through the basin and then crop area optimization under two scenarios available water are equal to annual renewable water and available water are equal to 75 of annual renewable water were performed to assess water saving in irrigated agriculture to accomplish this study some inevitable simplifying assumptions were considered which affects the results these assumptions including no pesticides and fertilizers were implied by farmers no workers wage no fuel consumption during planting to harvest and farms management are all the same reducing cultivation area as a solution to maintain groundwater level have been suggested in us high plains and central valley esnault et al 2014 scanlon et al 2012 sophocleous 2005 table 7 illustrates 4 and 15 total cultivation area reduction in order to maintain groundwater steady under each scenario maximum groundwater withdrawals are equal or less than the value of renewable water during the water year and maximum groundwater withdrawals assigned to be less than 75 of the renewable water respectively in northern and north eastern of the basin higher productivity value has been estimated but these areas are mostly mountainous so the fewer area has been cultivated this contradiction happened due to higher evapotranspiration value lots of steep valleys full of water are located in northern and north eastern mountains which results in higher yield and consequently higher productivity since the mean value of productivity pixels considered as the average productivity for each hru not the crop cultivation area even a small cultivated area would have a great impact on the final results 5 conclusions the neyshabur basin in iran is facing increasing water scarcity challenges as its groundwater table is declining each year due to unsustainable groundwater withdrawal for irrigation one approach for addressing the unsustainable groundwater withdrawal is to convert some of the agricultural lands to fallow land for example this approach has been implemented in the u s high plain and central valley region esnault et al 2014 scanlon et al 2012 sophocleous 2005 however to be most effective techniques for identifying those agricultural areas that would be converted to fallow land require an optimization strategy that reduces the overall economic impact the purpose of this study was to develop guidance on those agricultural areas that would be reduced to fallow land for policymakers for ensuring sustainable groundwater withdrawal for irrigation we used maximizing profit productivity profit in dollar value per cubic meter of irrigation waters used as an objective function to optimize cultivation areas for each crop type the profit productivity takes into account crop sales obtained by multiplying the crop yield by the unit crop price energy cost for pumping groundwater and irrigation water withdrawal we used landsat satellite imageries to calculate the crop yield and irrigation water withdrawal and available in situ groundwater level and precipitation data to calculate energy costs our results reveal the following maize has the highest profit productivity followed by wheat and barley whereas tomato has the least productivity the profit productivity of maize is 1 36 times higher than that of wheat and barley and 15 times higher than that of a tomato in order to minimize the economic impact of fallowing land we recommend fallowing agricultural lands used for growing tomatoes to the extent it is possible if the additional area is required the areas used for growing wheat and barley can be considered our optimization results indicate that sustainable groundwater withdrawal i e groundwater withdrawal equal to or less than the recharge rate can be achieved by reducing the total cultivation area by only 4 provided that this is obtained through fallowing most of the tomato agricultural land our optimization results for the conservative sustainable groundwater withdrawal scenario i e groundwater withdrawal equal to or less than 75 of the recharge rate can be achieved by reducing the total cultivation area by 15 provided that this is obtained through fallowing most of the tomato agricultural land and significant portion about 13 of the wheat barley agricultural land our optimization approach can be adjusted to suit to various other constraints and requirements set by stakeholders and policymakers 
11072,the accurate determination of crop evapotranspiration etc is important for improving irrigation water use efficiency and optimizing fruit quality in solar greenhouses taking drip irrigated tomato in a solar greenhouse as an example this study simulated the variations of etc by the shuttleworth wallace s w and dual crop coefficient dual kc models at initial development mid and late stages in 2015 and 2016 respectively continuous measurements of crop etc with weighing lysimeter and sap flow system combined with micro lysimeter were used to validate the performance of two approaches results indicated that the total soil evaporation accounted for 25 of etc over the whole growth period and decreased gradually with the increasing of canopy coverage ratio the locally developed basal crop coefficients values during the initial mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively the variations of the estimated etc from s w and dual kc models were similar to the measured etc the s w model performed well in estimating etc when lai was between 0 5 and 2 7 but slightly overestimated and underestimated at initial and mid stages respectively additionally the performance of the s w model was also better under different weather conditions as well as after irrigation however the dual kc method was superior to the s w model in estimating daily soil evaporation and daily plant transpiration the good agreements were found between the predicted etc using the dual kc method and the measurements for the greenhouse tomato with the coefficients of regression of 1 03 r2 0 93 in 2015 and 0 96 r2 0 93 in 2016 therefore the dual kc method was finally recommended for estimating evapotranspiration of tomato cultivated

to determine the irrigation schedule the reasonable control of irrigation time and amount can increase the yield and improve the quality of the fruit especially for greenhouse crops yuan et al 2001 yan et al 2018 in the north china plain most of the solar greenhouses are low cost structures covered with plastic film and many crops are still grown on soil without mulching thus the etc should include soil evaporation and plant transpiration the soil evaporation account for a large part of etc and cannot be fully ignored even for the dense vegetable in solar greenhouses gong et al 2017 qiu et al 2015 reported that the soil evaporation cannot be ignored although the soil surface was covered plastic mulch and it accounts for 17 8 26 4 of the etc for greenhouse hot pepper soil evaporation is an important component of etc under drip irrigation conditions martins et al 2013 indicated that the ratio of soil evaporation to etc is above 10 and cannot be ignored soil evaporation is also affected by the fraction of soil wetted drip irrigation system modify the amount of fraction of soil wetted with irrigation so the global values is preferred rosa et al 2012a however some studies on the etc of greenhouse crops mainly focused on canopy level without considering the soil evaporation zhang and lemeur 1992 orgaza et al 2005 or only on the simulation of the plant transpiration rouphael and colla 2004 medrano et al 2005 qiu et al 2013a it is not suitable for solar greenhouses with a soil grown crops therefore accurately modeling soil evaporation and plant transpiration in a solar greenhouses are critical for hydrologists and agronomist to address the issues the etc as we know was mainly measured by instruments or estimated by mathematical models since measurement of crop etc is limited by temporal and spatial factors thus the mathematical modeling of etc is an effective method to answer many of the important questions many models have been developed to estimate crop etc allen et al 1998 orgaza et al 2005 fernandez et al 2010 2011 yan et al 2017 but the two layer shuttleworth wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and the dual crop coefficient dual kc method in fao 56 allen et al 1998 are common approaches that can simulate soil evaporation and plant transpiration separately the s w model is a direct model for estimating etc components and its theoretical basis is the penman monteith equation including two parts i e one for the soil surface and the other for the plant surface these two parts are weighted by a set of coefficients that represent the combination of soil and canopy resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the canopy and soil surface resistances rs c and rs c are introduced simultaneously into the s w model to regulate the transfer of energy from plants and soil respectively additionally three aerodynamic resistances ra a ra c ra s are also introduced simultaneously to regulate the transfer between these surfaces and the atmosphere iritza et al 1999 so the s w model provides the possibility to partition etc into plant transpiration and soil evaporation and can simulate the two parts separately previous studies indicated that the s w model performed well in estimating etc of vineyard ortega farias et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 orchard li et al 2010 liu et al 2013b row crops farahani and bausch 1995 gardiol et al 2003 and clumping crops wallace et al 1990 as can be seen that the s w model was more widely used for crops with a partial ground cover for soil grown crops of a solar greenhouse however there is yet to be studied about whether the s w model can be used to separately estimate soil evaporation and plant transpiration at different growth stages except for s w model the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao proposed a method to estimate etc and further described it in the paper fao 56 allen et al 1998 the actual etc was obtained by calculating the product of reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc and it includes two approaches one is a single crop coefficient method and the other one is a dual crop coefficient method in the single crop coefficient method the effect of soil evaporation and plant transpiration are combined into a single crop coefficient and the coefficient integrates differences in the soil evaporation and plant transpiration rate between the crop and the reference surface in the dual crop coefficient dual kc method the effects of soil evaporation and plant transpiration are determined separately and divide crop coefficient into basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke due to practical simplicity and robustness of the dual kc method this method has been widely used to estimate etc in different types of sparse crops and climatic regions rosa et al 2012a ding et al 2013 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2016 beyond these studies rosa et al 2012a developed a simdualkc model based on the dual kc approach for making irrigation scheduling it has been tested for irrigated maize rainfed and surface irrigated wheat furrow irrigated cotton rosa et al 2012b and humulus lupulus fandino et al 2015 the performance of the simdualkc model was also assessed in a solar greenhouse for estimating hot pepper etc qiu et al 2015 however there are few studies about the dual kc method evaluation using long term independent measurements of etc and the comparison of different models to estimate crop etc for the soil grown crops in a solar greenhouse especially at different growth stages from the existing literatures the research on modeling crop etc in greenhouses mainly focused on the application of penman monteith model while the application of the dual kc and s w models in greenhouses was relatively rare considering the differences of climatic region and greenhouse type the etc simulation in a natural ventilated solar greenhouse cannot be well presented according to the current research results therefore this research has certain practical significance the objectives of this work are to 1 evaluate the applicability of the s w model for estimating tomato etc in a solar greenhouse 2 compare the estimation accuracies of the s w model and dual kc method 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design field trials were conducted in a solar greenhouse during the tomato crop growing seasons from march to july 2015 and 2016 at the experimental station of the farmland irrigation research

annual precipitation of 548 mm annual potential evaporation of 1908 mm mean temperature of 14 5 c sunshine duration of 2398 h the materials of the solar greenhouse is steel frame and covering an area of 510 m2 60 m in length 8 5 m in width and covered by a 0 2 mm thick non drop polyethylene sheet the roof of the solar greenhouse is quilt with 2 5 cm thick cotton wadding and heat insulating materials are embedded in the walls to maintain the interior temperature the ventilation system is provided to maintain the air temperature mean value was above 25 c and relative humidity inside it mean value was 65 80 the experimental soil is silt loam iuss working group wrb 2014 with a mean bulk density of 1 49 g cm 3 field soil water capacity of 0 32 m3 m 3 and wilting point water content of 0 09 m3 m 3 in the depth of 0 1 0 m textural and basic soil hydraulic properties are presented in table 1 tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv jingding was planted in a plot with an area of 8 8 m2 8 0 m in length 1 1 m in width with 50 plants planted in two rows six plots as a treatment and four repetitions were implemented in this experiment the planting pattern is a wide narrow row with a width of the wide and narrow rows of 65 cm and 45 cm respectively tomato seedlings were transplanted on march 10 2015 and march 9 2016 and irrigated with drip irrigation system where irrigation amount and frequency was determined based on an accumulated evaporation of 20 cm pan placed above the canopy irrigation event was performed when the cumulative pan evaporation reaches to 20 2 mm in order to improve the survival rate of seedlings 20 mm of irrigation water was supplied by drip irrigation after crop transplanting then irrigation events was performed before flowering fruit bearing stage before april 15 2015 and april 9 2016 clark et al 1991 tomato crops were irrigated 14 times with total irrigation amount of 282 4 mm and 280 7 mm during the whole growth stage in 2015 and 2016 respectively similar agronomic management was conducted during the experimental period such as fertilization pollination pest control 2 2 measurements of soil evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration the soil evaporation and plant transpiration were measured by micro lysimeter and sap flow system respectively additionally two weighing lysimeters were used to measure crop evapotranspiration etc in 2016 the detailed measurements are as follows plant transpiration is measured by sap flow system flow32 1k system dynamax houston tx usa eight health plants were randomly selected and sap flow was monitored during may 15 to july 15 in 2015 and april 14 to july 10 in 2016 respectively the sap flow meters were fixed at 20 cm above the ground surface to avoid the influence of surface heat flux for accurate measurement to ensure a close contact between the gauges and the crop stems the dimensions of gauges should meet the requirements of stem diameter a detailed data processing method can be found in gao et al 2013 the sap flow data were collected every 15 min by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa in the first stage plant transpiration was obtained by minus the soil evaporation from etc which measured by water balance approach in 2015 and weighing lysimeter in 2016 daily soil evaporation was measured from march 17 to july 15 in 2015 and march 10 to july 10 in 2016 by micro lysimeter which made from galvanized iron and consisted of an inner and outer cylinder the diameters of inner and outer cylinder were 10 cm and 12 cm respectively with 15 cm in length to ensure easy operation without destroying the soil structure the outer cylinder was fixed into the soil with its top edge leveled with the soil surface the inner cylinder was pushed into the soil till the top level with the soil surface and the base of the inner cylinder was sealed with a plastic foil when pulled out determination of soil evaporation by calculating the difference of two weights and an electronic balance with a precision of 0 1 g was used same operation was performed every day at 8 00 am to ensure the accuracy of the measurement the soil of inner cylinder was replaced in every two days as well as after irrigation in each plot the middle of two crop rows and the middle within row aligned at the center of strip were measured three measurements were implemented for each treatment in the same solar greenhouse the etc was measured by two weighing lysimeters 1 0 m in length 1 0 m in width and 1 2 m in depth located in the center of the plots from march 9 to july 10 in 2016 the soil profile in lysimeters reproduced that of the outside area described above to a depth of 1 0 m six health plants were randomly selected and the planting pattern was same as outside to avoid the error of measurements the plants inside the weighing lysimeter were supported by bamboo poles the data were recorded every 1 h by a micro computer 2 3 other measurements the solar radiation rs net radiation rn relative humidity rh air temperature ta and air speed u were constantly monitored with an automatic weather station at 2 0 m height above ground level inside the greenhouse the rs and rn were measured by a radiometer li200x usa and net radiometer nr lite2 holland respectively the ta and rh were recorded by a temperature and relative humidity recorder cs215 usa and the u was monitored by an air velocity meter gill wind sonic uk with an accuracy of 0 02 m s 1 the soil heat flux g was measured at two points inserted at 5 cm below the ground surface in the row and between two plants by heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux holland respectively all data were collected by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa every 10 s and 30 min averages were calculated measurements were made continuously from march to july in both study seasons 2015 and 2016 the average meteorological factors of greenhouse grown tomato at different growth stages in 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 2 volumetric soil moisture content was continuously monitored using five ech2o sensors 5te decagon devices inc usa distributed below the soil surface at 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm and collected every 30 min using a em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa two repetitions were implemented for each treatment the ech2o sensors were strictly calibrated before installation the leaf area was measured manually at an interval of 7 days and 6 plants were sampled at the center of each plot it was measured 19 times during the whole growth period the leaf length l and maximum width wm were measured with a ruler then multiplying a reduction coefficient 0 64 a detailed calculation method of reduction coefficient can be found in liu et al 2013a thus the leaf area index lai was calculated as follows 1 l a i l w m s r s p where sr is the row spacing 0 55 m sp is the plant spacing 0 33 m leaf stomatal resistance was observed using a leaf porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc usa six functional leaves of healthy plants were randomly selected from each treatment and a total of 24 leaves were measured measurements were performed at the intervals of 7 10 days during the periods before the first irrigation later observations were made in two days interval after irrigation and until the next irrigation extinction coefficient was measured using two photosynthetic active radiation sensors li cor lincoln nebraska usa two sensors were positioned at 20 cm above the canopy and the ground surface photosynthetic active radiation was continuously measured between 06 00 and 19 00 every 7 to 10 days from the emergence to harvest of the tomato crops it was measured only on sunny days and recorded by a li 1400 data logger at 15 min intervals the detailed calculation method of extinction coefficient can be found in gao et al 2010 3 evapotranspiration models and parameters 3 1 shuttleworth wallace model and its parameters the detailed calculation method about the shuttleworth wallace model can be found in appendix 1 3 1 1 canopy and soil surface resistance solar radiation rs vapour pressure deficit d and air temperature ta are the main meteorological factors affecting the crop stomatal resistance r st jarvis 1976 stanghellini 1987 for a greenhouse tomato boulard et al 1991 indicated that the r st could be correctly calculated by rs and d thus the surface canopy resistance r c c can be expressed as follows 2 r c c r s t m i n f r s f d l a i e where the r stmin is the minimal stomatal resistance s m 1 under optimal conditions taken as 60 s m 1 in our study the effective leaf area index laie can be set as follows laie equals to lai when lai 2 laie equals to 2 when 2 lai 4 and laie equals to lai 2 when lai 4 respectively gardiol et al 2003 the f rs and f d are mathematical functions which represent the evolutions of the r st with the variations of the rs and d and can be expressed as follows 3 f r s 1 exp a 1 r s b 1 1 4 f d 1 a 2 exp b 2 d d m a x the values chosen for the parameters were dmax of 1 kpa for air saturation deficit and the coefficients of a1 a2 b1 and b2 were derived from experimental data fitting using a non linear algorithm stanghellini 1987 in our study the value of a 1 and b 1 were 0 006 and 260 673 coefficient of determination r2 0 88 the sample numbers n 70 a 2 and b 2 were 1 121 and 1 137 r 2 0 84 n 70 respectively the soil surface resistance r s s was calculated using the anadranistakis model anadranistakis et al 2000 which is expressed as follows 5 r s s r s m i n s f θ s r s m i n s 2 5 θ f c θ s 1 5 where the r s s min is the minimum soil surface resistance which corresponds to the soil water content at field capacity its value can be set as 100 s m 1 camillo and gurney 1986 θ fc is the surface soil field capacity measured by cutting ring method m3 m 3 θ s is the surface soil water content measured by a gravimetric method for the surface soil layer 0 0 10 m 3 1 2 aerodynamic resistances in our study same approach was used to calculate the three aerodynamic resistances i e ra s ra c and ra a as descripted in shuttleworth and wallace 1985 3 2 dual crop coefficient method and its parameters in dual crop coefficient dual kc method crop etc was defined as the product of crop coefficient kc and reference evapotranspiration eto and kc was divided into soil evaporation coefficient ke and plant transpiration coefficient kcb allen et al 1998 2005 the calculation of the etc is implemented as 6 e t k c e t o k c b k e e t o where kcb is the basal crop coefficient ke is the soil evaporation coefficient eto is the reference evapotranspiration 3 2 1 reference evapotranspiration for the characteristics of low air speed in the solar greenhouse fernández et al 2010 2011 considered that the eto can be better estimated by penman monteith equation with a fixed ra of 295 s m 1 it was also applied in a solar greenhouse in the arid desert region of northwest china qiu et al 2013b the eto can be expressed as 7 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 628 v p d t a 273 δ 1 24 γ 3 2 2 basal crop coefficient considering the senescence of tomato leaves in the late growth stage the kcb was calculated using an improved method by ding et al 2013 8 k c b 1 f s k c b m i n k c c k c b f u l l k c b m i n where kcb min is the minimum value of basal crop coefficient for bare soil 0 1 kcb full is the basal crop coefficient when crop having nearly full ground cover k cc is the canopy cover coefficient f s is the leaf senescence factor 0 2 for end of season the kcb full needs to be adjusted for local climatic conditions where the minimum relative humidity rhmin differs from 45 or where the mean air speed is different from 2 m s 1 the calculation methods of adjustment kcb full and k cc can be found in appendix 2 the kcb can also be obtained according to the ratio of plant transpiration measured by sap flow system to eto several studies indicated that using the measured kcb values based on sap flow measurements can improve the performance of the dual kc method in olive orchards and vineyards er raki et al 2010 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 the performance of this method will be tested in a solar greenhouse in this study 3 2 3 soil evaporation coefficient and water stress coefficient the soil evaporation coefficient ke is the maximum when the topsoil was wet following canopy was small less water is available for soil evaporation when the topsoil was dries and a reduction in soil evaporation is proportional to the amount of water remaining in the topsoil rosa et al 2012a or 9 k e k r k c m a x k c b f e w k c m a x where kr is a dimensionless evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on the cumulative depth of water depleted from the topsoil f ew is the fraction of soil that is both exposed and wetted i e the fraction of soil surface from which most evaporation occurs kc max is the maximum value of kc following irrigation event kr few and kc max calculation equations are presented in table 3 the soil water stress coefficient ks is expressed as a linear function of root zone depletion when depletion exceeds the readily available water in the effective root zone and the calculation equations are as follows allen et al 1998 2005 10 k s t a w d r t a w r a w t a w d r 1 p t a w f o r d r r a w 11 k s 1 f o r d r r a w where taw and raw are the total and readily available soil water mm respectively dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the depletion fraction at the initiation of stress

rooting depth m and zr contains ze raw is estimated as 13 r a w p t a w where raw has units of taw mm in our study the same approach was used to calculate these parameters as rosa et al 2012a standard initial and calibrated basal crop coefficients p depletion fractions soil evaporation parameters for the greenhouse tomato are presented in table 4 3 3 evaluation of model performance the coefficients of regression b 0 and determination r 2 relating observed and predicted data were used to assess the performance of the s w model and dual kc method they can be defined as follows 14 b 0 i 1 n o i p i i n o i p i 15 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 where oi and pi i 1 2 n represent pairs of observed and predicted values for a given variable and o and p are the respective mean values when b0 and r2 are close to 1 0 indicating that predicted and observed values are statistically similar in addition a set of indicators were also used considering the residual estimation errors rosa et al 2012b fandino et al 2015 they can be defined as follows the mean absolute error mae can reflect the actual prediction error 16 m a e 1 n i 1 n o i p the root mean square error rsme which characterizes the variance of the estimation error 17 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n 0 5 the ratio rsr of the rmse to the standard deviation of observed data sd that standardizes rmse using the sd of

i o 2 the ef and dl close to 1 0 indicates that the residual variance is much smaller than the measured data variance the maximum and best value for ef and dl are 1 0 4 results 4 1 the ratio of evaporation to evapotranspiration and lai the seasonal variations of the ratio of evaporation to evapotranspiration e etc and lai at different growing stage of tomato plants are presented in fig 1 it showed an opposite tendency between e etc and lai and e etc decreased significantly with the increasing in lai the average values of e etc was around 0 25 over the whole growing stage the changes of the e etc at different growing stages are shown as follows at initial stage crop cover was low creating a large fraction of wetted soil that was exposed to radiation thus favoring evaporation the e etc was between 0 21 and 0 97 with the average value of 0 56 in 2015 and 0 59 in 2016 during the development stage the e etc was decreasing significantly due to the rapid growth of lai the e etc was between 0 03 and 0 32 with the average value of 0 20 in 2015 and 0 18 in 2016 at mid and late stages e etc decreased to the lowest level as the lai reached the maximum the e etc was between 0 01 and 0 35 with the average value of 0 12 in 2015 and 0 11 in 2016 additionally because the water content of soil surface was larger after irrigation thus the value of soil evaporation increased significantly and the average value of e etc was 0 31 and 0 29 after irrigation during the whole growing stage in 2015 and 2016 respectively 4 2 basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke the basal crop coefficient kcb adjusted by eq 8 kcb cal measured by sap flow system kcb sap and recommended by fao 56 kcb fao in 2015 and 2016 are presented in fig 2 results showed that there was a wide dispersion between kcb cal and kcb sap which explained the limitation that the kcb sap could be used to calculate the tomato etc cultivated in the solar greenhouse following the proposed segment approach in the fao 56 tomato growing stages can be described as follows the initial and mid stages were characterized by horizontal line segments while the development and late stages were characterized by rising and falling line segments the kcb fao proposed in fao 56 for the tomato crop were 0 15 1 10 and 0 70 at initial mid and late stages respectively allen et al 1998 while the values of kcb cal at initial mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively table 4 the values of the kcb cal at mid stage were smaller than kcb fao during the both study years for ke it was generally affected by surface soil water content and canopy coverage ratio rosa et al 2012b at initial stage due to the small lai and large surface exposed area the ke was between 0 06 and 0 43 while the soil evaporation was changes from 0 08 to 1 19 mm d 1 at development stage the soil evaporation decreased gradually with the increasing in canopy coverage ratio varying between 0 07 and 1 40 mm d 1 while the ke was between 0 15 and 0 34 these values however increased obviously after irrigation at mid and late stages the ke was between 0 07 and 0 19 while the soil evaporation oscillated between 0 03 and 1 28 mm d 1 fig 2 the stable variation of ke was related to the topsoil moisture especially after irrigation 4 3 comparison of hourly etc estimated by s w model and measured by weighing lysimeter comparison and correlation hourly etc between estimated by the s w model and measured by weighing lysimeter ws at different growing stages in 2016 are presented in fig 3 and table 5 results showed that diurnal variation of the estimated etc was similar to the measured etc but there existed differences in the magnitudes the b0 and r2 during the whole growing stage was 0 90 and 0 88 indicated that the predicted and observed values were statistically similar and most of the variance was explained by the model mae and rmse values were quite low 21 31 and 37 41 w m 2 respectively thus indicated that errors of estimation were small these values combined with low rsr ratios 0 37 thus indicated low residual errors the aae and are were 21 35 w m 2 and 50 2 thus being also quite small the pbias was relatively low indicating a slight over estimation bias pbias 8 4 ef and dl was very high ef 0 88 dl 0 97 thus indicated that the residual variance was much smaller than the variance of measured data however the s w model slightly overestimated etc by 17 9 at initial stage with the b0 of 1 12 and pbias of 14 9 additionally the s w model slightly underestimated etc by 16 6 at mid stage with the b0 of 0 85 and pbias of 19 5 at development and late stages the b 0 was close to 1 with the values of 0 95 and 0 97 respectively indicated that the simulation accuracies of the s w model at these two stages were higher than the initial and mid stages other indicators of goodness of fit are presented in table 5 fig 4 shows the diurnal variations of the etc estimated by s w model and measured by ws in sky clear days a overcast days b and after irrigation c results showed that the s w model tended to follow the general trend of the measured etc under different conditions but there was a little dispersion during the period of 12 00 to 14 00 except for the overcast days taken 13 00 as an example the s w model slightly underestimated etc by 11 4 on sky clear day and 8 1 after irrigation 4 4 comparison of daily etc estimated by s w model and dual kc method comparison and correlation daily etc of tomato cultivated in the solar greenhouse between estimated by s w and dual kc methods and measured by sap flow system combined with micro lysimeter in 2015 and ws in 2016 respectively are presented in fig 5 and table 6 results showed that the s w model underestimated daily etc by only 5 1 in both study years 2015 and 2016 the b0 was close to 1 0 and the r2 ranged between 0 82 0 83 the mae and rmse were 0 48 mm d 1 and 0 63 mm d 1 in 2015 and 0 48 mm d 1 and 0 61 mm d 1 in 2016 the rsr were 0 41 and 0 40 in 2015 and 2016 respectively aae values for both study years were 0 48 mm d 1 the are values ranged from 1 41 to 24 1 with a positive pbias for both study years indicating a slight over estimation bias ef and dl indicators were also high ef 0 83 dl 0 95 in two years the estimates of daily etc from dual kc method were better than the s w model with the b0 and of 1 03 in 2015 and 0 96 in 2016 r2 was the same in both study years 0 93 mae rmse rsr aae and are values were quite low they were 0 36 0 39 mm d 1 0 44 0 47 mm d 1 0 23 0 27 0 27 0 33 mm d 1 and 11 1 16 2 respectively the pbias were very low results show a slight under estimation bias in 2015 pbias 2 1 and a slightly over estimation bias in 2016 pbias 2 8 thus the model does not show a trend for under or over estimation bias ef and dl was very high than the s w model ef 0 92 dl 0 98 for two years thus indicating a good model simulation performance therefore the dual kc method can be used as an appropriate way to estimate daily crop etc in greenhouses and may be further used to improve irrigation scheduling for tomato grown in the solar greenhouses 5 discussion 5 1 the performance of the s w model since soil surface resistance and canopy surface resistance were introduced simultaneously in the s w model thus the s w model could better reflect the actual soil evaporation and plant transpiration however there were still some differences between estimated etc by s w model and measured etc by weighing lysimeter the s w model overestimated etc by 17 9 at initial stage and underestimated etc by 16 6 at mid stage respectively table 3 the possible reasons for the etc overestimated by s w model are the following 1 at initial stage the lai of tomato was lower than 0 5 the s w model may overestimate the available energy intercepted by the canopy 2 to enhance the root system of tomato crops only 20 mm water was supplied after transplanting and no irrigation events performed during the period between seedling and flowering fruit bearing stage yuan et al 2001 liu et al 2013a the canopy surface resistance may be underestimated under the water stress condition while the effect of water stress on canopy surface resistance was not considered in the s w model previous studies indicated that the canopy surface resistance was the most sensitive variable relative to the other resistance variables in the s w model ortega farias et al 2007 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 thus we believe that the overestimation of s w model at initial stage was mainly due to the error induced by the canopy surface resistance similar results were also reported by other studies gardiol et al 2003 anadranistakis et al 2000 additionally li et al 2013 indicated that the s w model and the adjusted s w model significantly overestimated etc at the initial stage of maize due to the underestimation of the canopy surface resistance under water stress condition in addition to these reasons because the s w model does not distinguish the reflectivity and long wave radiation between soil and canopy which may also produce a difference between the estimated etc by the s w model and measured etc zhang et al 2008 juhász and hrotkó 2014 indicated that the s w model slightly underestimated the plant transpiration compared with the measurements of sap flow system in our study the s w model also slightly underestimated the plant transpiration at mid stage figs 6 and 7 which resulted in the underestimation of etc ortega farias et al 2010 also reported that the s w model underestimated the vineyard etc under drip irrigation condition in mediterranean semiarid climate at mid stage the canopy coverage ratio of tomato crops reached the peak lai 2 7 and plant transpiration accounted for more than 90 of total etc the s w model underestimated the plant transpiration by 16 6 and 26 0 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the b0 and r2 was 0 84 and 0 91 in 2015 0 76 and 0 94 in 2016 thus indicating that predicted and observed transpiration values were statistically similar and most of the variance were explained by the s w model figs 6 and 7 additionally juhász and hrotkó 2014 also believed that the s w model underestimated the etc under the conditions of cloudy and rainy days as well as on high vapor pressure deficit days as stated above the application of the s w model in solar greenhouses should consider the combined effects of meteorological elements crop growth conditions and soil water status additionally establishment of canopy surface resistance model played a critical role in determining the performance of the s w model especially under water stress condition so how to consider the effect of water stress on canopy resistance remains to be investigated in our study however when the lai was between 0 5 and 2 7 the s w model performed well in estimating tomato etc cultivated in the solar greenhouse 5 2 the performance of the dual kc method the base crop coefficient kcb was affected by many factors such as climatic conditions crop types soil surface mulching water and salt stress allen et al 1998 2005 rosa et al 2012a the kcb was calculated by ding et al 2013 method kcb cal results showed that the kcb cal at initial mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively the values of kcb cal were lower than the standard values at mid stage recommended by fao 56 kcb fao in both study years fig 2 and table 4 similar results have been validated in different crops such as vineyard poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 cotton yang et al 2016 wheat and maize ding et al 2013 liu and luo 2010 greenhouse tomato and pepper hanson and may 2006 qiu et al 2013b the possible reasons for the kcb cal lower than the kcb fao in the solar greenhouse are the following 1 higher humidity and lower air transfer in the solar greenhouse can result in lower kcb values allen et al 1998 2 in order to manage tomato plants easily the walkway about 30 cm was set thus there was no plant transpiration in walkway areas which lowered the kcb qiu et al 2013b 3 the reduction at mid stage relative to the starting value from fao56 may reflect a slight reduction in kcb mid caused by impacts of water stress plant variety or reduced vigor or may be an artifact of soil water measurement error rosa et al 2012b the soil evaporation coefficient ke was maximum during the initial stage because the lai was low which created a large wetted soil surface area that was exposed to sun radiation rosa et al 2012b also indicated that the ke was maximum when the topsoil was wet following irrigation and canopy was small qiu et al 2015 indicated that the soil evaporation has exceeded 2 0 mm d 1 at the initial stage in which case ke was around 0 6 for greenhouse hot pepper the maximum ke was above 1 0 for fully irrigated maize under basin irrigation when soil evaporation exceeded 3 0 mm d 1 rosa et al 2012b fandino et al 2015 indicated that high ke values were observed during the initial stage for hop crop it can be seen that daily ke was significant during the crop initial stage the estimates of daily soil evaporation and plant transpiration from the dual kc method were in a good agreement with the measurements thus indicating that the estimates of daily etc from dual kc method were better than s w model correlation daily soil evaporation between estimated by the dual kc method and measured by micro lysimeters in both study years results showed that the mae and rmse were 0 18 mm d 1 and 0 24 mm d 1 respectively which slightly lower than the daily soil evaporation estimated by s w model mae of 0 21 mm d 1 and rmse of 0 34 mm d 1 fig 8 the daily plant transpiration estimated by dual kc method also was better than the s w model with the mae and rmse of 0 41 mm d 1 and 0 54 mm d 1 for dual kc method 0 59 mm d 1 and 0 76 mm d 1 for the s w model fig 8 therefore the dual kc method had better performance in estimating daily soil evaporation and plant transpiration than the s w model possible reason is that soil evaporation is a function of variation in surface soil water content in the dual kc method while it is mainly affected by soil surface resistance in the s w model which is not accurate enough especially for wetting soil zhao et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 also indicated that the daily soil evaporation estimated by dual kc method was more variable in time than those simulated by the s w model especially around wetting events in our study both s w model and dual kc method can be used in estimating the daily etc in solar greenhouse but considering the precision and simplicity the dual kc method was finally recommended 6 conclusions 1 soil evaporation cannot be ignored for soil grown tomato in the solar greenhouse and the average value of e etc was around 0 25 during the whole growth period 2 the base crop coefficient at initial development mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively which were lower than the standard values recommended by fao 56 at mid stage 3 the s w model slightly overestimated and underestimated etc at initial and mid stages respectively but it performed well when the lai was between 0 5 and 2 7 in addition the precision of the s w model was also better at different weather conditions as well as after irrigation 4 both the s w model and dual kc method can be used to estimate daily etc of tomato cultivated in the solar greenhouse but considering the simplicity of using the dual kc method to develop irrigation schedule this method was finally recommended acknowledgements we acknowledge

11072,the accurate determination of crop evapotranspiration etc is important for improving irrigation water use efficiency and optimizing fruit quality in solar greenhouses taking drip irrigated tomato in a solar greenhouse as an example this study simulated the variations of etc by the shuttleworth wallace s w and dual crop coefficient dual kc models at initial development mid and late stages in 2015 and 2016 respectively continuous measurements of crop etc with weighing lysimeter and sap flow system combined with micro lysimeter were used to validate the performance of two approaches results indicated that the total soil evaporation accounted for 25 of etc over the whole growth period and decreased gradually with the increasing of canopy coverage ratio the locally developed basal crop coefficients values during the initial mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively the variations of the estimated etc from s w and dual kc models were similar to the measured etc the s w model performed well in estimating etc when lai was between 0 5 and 2 7 but slightly overestimated and underestimated at initial and mid stages respectively additionally the performance of the s w model was also better under different weather conditions as well as after irrigation however the dual kc method was superior to the s w model in estimating daily soil evaporation and daily plant transpiration the good agreements were found between the predicted etc using the dual kc method and the measurements for the greenhouse tomato with the coefficients of regression of 1 03 r2 0 93 in 2015 and 0 96 r2 0 93 in 2016 therefore the dual kc method was finally recommended for estimating evapotranspiration of tomato cultivated

to determine the irrigation schedule the reasonable control of irrigation time and amount can increase the yield and improve the quality of the fruit especially for greenhouse crops yuan et al 2001 yan et al 2018 in the north china plain most of the solar greenhouses are low cost structures covered with plastic film and many crops are still grown on soil without mulching thus the etc should include soil evaporation and plant transpiration the soil evaporation account for a large part of etc and cannot be fully ignored even for the dense vegetable in solar greenhouses gong et al 2017 qiu et al 2015 reported that the soil evaporation cannot be ignored although the soil surface was covered plastic mulch and it accounts for 17 8 26 4 of the etc for greenhouse hot pepper soil evaporation is an important component of etc under drip irrigation conditions martins et al 2013 indicated that the ratio of soil evaporation to etc is above 10 and cannot be ignored soil evaporation is also affected by the fraction of soil wetted drip irrigation system modify the amount of fraction of soil wetted with irrigation so the global values is preferred rosa et al 2012a however some studies on the etc of greenhouse crops mainly focused on canopy level without considering the soil evaporation zhang and lemeur 1992 orgaza et al 2005 or only on the simulation of the plant transpiration rouphael and colla 2004 medrano et al 2005 qiu et al 2013a it is not suitable for solar greenhouses with a soil grown crops therefore accurately modeling soil evaporation and plant transpiration in a solar greenhouses are critical for hydrologists and agronomist to address the issues the etc as we know was mainly measured by instruments or estimated by mathematical models since measurement of crop etc is limited by temporal and spatial factors thus the mathematical modeling of etc is an effective method to answer many of the important questions many models have been developed to estimate crop etc allen et al 1998 orgaza et al 2005 fernandez et al 2010 2011 yan et al 2017 but the two layer shuttleworth wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and the dual crop coefficient dual kc method in fao 56 allen et al 1998 are common approaches that can simulate soil evaporation and plant transpiration separately the s w model is a direct model for estimating etc components and its theoretical basis is the penman monteith equation including two parts i e one for the soil surface and the other for the plant surface these two parts are weighted by a set of coefficients that represent the combination of soil and canopy resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the canopy and soil surface resistances rs c and rs c are introduced simultaneously into the s w model to regulate the transfer of energy from plants and soil respectively additionally three aerodynamic resistances ra a ra c ra s are also introduced simultaneously to regulate the transfer between these surfaces and the atmosphere iritza et al 1999 so the s w model provides the possibility to partition etc into plant transpiration and soil evaporation and can simulate the two parts separately previous studies indicated that the s w model performed well in estimating etc of vineyard ortega farias et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 orchard li et al 2010 liu et al 2013b row crops farahani and bausch 1995 gardiol et al 2003 and clumping crops wallace et al 1990 as can be seen that the s w model was more widely used for crops with a partial ground cover for soil grown crops of a solar greenhouse however there is yet to be studied about whether the s w model can be used to separately estimate soil evaporation and plant transpiration at different growth stages except for s w model the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao proposed a method to estimate etc and further described it in the paper fao 56 allen et al 1998 the actual etc was obtained by calculating the product of reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc and it includes two approaches one is a single crop coefficient method and the other one is a dual crop coefficient method in the single crop coefficient method the effect of soil evaporation and plant transpiration are combined into a single crop coefficient and the coefficient integrates differences in the soil evaporation and plant transpiration rate between the crop and the reference surface in the dual crop coefficient dual kc method the effects of soil evaporation and plant transpiration are determined separately and divide crop coefficient into basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke due to practical simplicity and robustness of the dual kc method this method has been widely used to estimate etc in different types of sparse crops and climatic regions rosa et al 2012a ding et al 2013 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2016 beyond these studies rosa et al 2012a developed a simdualkc model based on the dual kc approach for making irrigation scheduling it has been tested for irrigated maize rainfed and surface irrigated wheat furrow irrigated cotton rosa et al 2012b and humulus lupulus fandino et al 2015 the performance of the simdualkc model was also assessed in a solar greenhouse for estimating hot pepper etc qiu et al 2015 however there are few studies about the dual kc method evaluation using long term independent measurements of etc and the comparison of different models to estimate crop etc for the soil grown crops in a solar greenhouse especially at different growth stages from the existing literatures the research on modeling crop etc in greenhouses mainly focused on the application of penman monteith model while the application of the dual kc and s w models in greenhouses was relatively rare considering the differences of climatic region and greenhouse type the etc simulation in a natural ventilated solar greenhouse cannot be well presented according to the current research results therefore this research has certain practical significance the objectives of this work are to 1 evaluate the applicability of the s w model for estimating tomato etc in a solar greenhouse 2 compare the estimation accuracies of the s w model and dual kc method 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design field trials were conducted in a solar greenhouse during the tomato crop growing seasons from march to july 2015 and 2016 at the experimental station of the farmland irrigation research

annual precipitation of 548 mm annual potential evaporation of 1908 mm mean temperature of 14 5 c sunshine duration of 2398 h the materials of the solar greenhouse is steel frame and covering an area of 510 m2 60 m in length 8 5 m in width and covered by a 0 2 mm thick non drop polyethylene sheet the roof of the solar greenhouse is quilt with 2 5 cm thick cotton wadding and heat insulating materials are embedded in the walls to maintain the interior temperature the ventilation system is provided to maintain the air temperature mean value was above 25 c and relative humidity inside it mean value was 65 80 the experimental soil is silt loam iuss working group wrb 2014 with a mean bulk density of 1 49 g cm 3 field soil water capacity of 0 32 m3 m 3 and wilting point water content of

0 m in length 1 1 m in width with 50 plants planted in two rows six plots as a treatment and four repetitions were implemented in this experiment the planting pattern is a wide narrow row with a width of the wide and narrow rows of 65 cm and 45 cm respectively tomato seedlings were transplanted on march 10 2015 and march 9 2016 and irrigated with drip irrigation system where irrigation amount and frequency was determined based on an accumulated evaporation of 20 cm pan placed above the canopy irrigation event was performed when the cumulative pan evaporation reaches to 20 2 mm in order to improve the survival rate of seedlings 20 mm of irrigation water was supplied by drip irrigation after crop transplanting then irrigation events was performed before flowering fruit bearing stage before april 15 2015 and april 9 2016 clark et al 1991 tomato crops were irrigated 14 times with total irrigation amount of 282 4 mm and 280 7 mm during the whole growth stage in 2015 and 2016 respectively similar agronomic management was conducted during the experimental period such as fertilization pollination pest control 2 2 measurements of soil evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration the soil evaporation and plant transpiration were measured by micro lysimeter and sap flow system respectively additionally two weighing lysimeters were used to measure crop evapotranspiration etc in 2016 the detailed measurements are as follows plant transpiration is measured by sap flow system flow32 1k system dynamax houston tx usa eight health plants were randomly selected and sap flow was monitored during may 15 to july 15 in 2015 and april 14 to july 10 in 2016 respectively the sap flow meters were fixed at 20 cm above the ground surface to avoid the influence of surface heat flux for accurate measurement to ensure a close contact between the gauges and the crop stems the dimensions of gauges should meet the requirements of stem diameter a detailed data processing method can be found in gao et al 2013 the sap flow data were collected every 15 min by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa in the first stage plant transpiration was obtained by minus the soil evaporation from etc which measured by water balance approach in 2015 and weighing lysimeter in 2016 daily soil evaporation was measured from march 17 to july 15 in 2015 and march 10 to july 10 in 2016 by micro lysimeter which made from galvanized iron and consisted of an inner and outer cylinder the diameters of inner and outer cylinder were 10 cm and 12 cm respectively with 15 cm in length to ensure easy operation without destroying the soil structure the outer cylinder was fixed into the soil with its top edge leveled with the soil surface the inner cylinder was pushed into the soil till the top level with the soil surface and the base of the inner cylinder was sealed with a plastic foil when pulled out determination of soil evaporation by calculating the difference of two weights and an electronic balance with a precision of 0 1 g was used same operation was performed every day at 8 00 am to ensure the accuracy of the measurement the soil of inner cylinder was replaced in every two days as well as after irrigation in each plot the middle of two crop rows and the middle within row aligned at the center of strip were measured three measurements were implemented for each treatment in the same solar greenhouse the etc was measured by two weighing lysimeters 1 0 m in length 1 0 m in width and 1 2 m in depth located in the center of the plots from march 9 to july 10 in 2016 the soil profile in lysimeters reproduced that of the outside area described above to a depth of 1 0 m six health plants were randomly selected and the planting pattern was same as outside to avoid the error of measurements the plants inside the weighing lysimeter were supported by bamboo poles the data were recorded every 1 h by a micro computer 2 3 other measurements the solar radiation rs net radiation rn relative humidity rh air temperature ta and air speed u were constantly monitored with an automatic weather station at 2 0 m height above ground level inside the greenhouse the rs and rn were measured by a radiometer li200x usa and net radiometer nr lite2 holland respectively the ta and rh were recorded by a temperature and relative humidity recorder cs215 usa and the u was monitored by an air velocity meter gill wind sonic uk with an accuracy of 0 02 m s 1 the soil heat flux g was measured at two points inserted at 5 cm below the ground surface in the row and between two plants by heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux holland respectively all data were collected by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa every 10 s and 30 min averages were calculated measurements were made continuously from march to july in both study seasons 2015 and 2016 the average meteorological factors of greenhouse grown tomato at different growth stages in 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 2 volumetric soil moisture content was continuously monitored using five ech2o sensors 5te decagon devices inc usa distributed below the soil surface at 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm and collected every 30 min using a em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa two repetitions were implemented for each treatment the ech2o sensors were strictly calibrated before installation the leaf area was measured manually at an interval of 7 days and 6 plants were sampled at the center of each plot it was measured 19 times during the whole growth period the leaf length l and maximum width wm were measured with a ruler then multiplying a reduction coefficient 0 64 a detailed calculation method of reduction coefficient can be found in liu et al 2013a thus the leaf area index lai was calculated as follows 1 l a i l w m s r s p where sr is the row spacing 0 55 m sp is the plant spacing 0 33 m leaf stomatal resistance was observed using a leaf porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc usa six functional leaves of healthy plants were randomly selected from each treatment and a total of 24 leaves were measured measurements were performed at the intervals of 7 10 days during the periods before the first irrigation later observations were made in two days interval after irrigation and until the next irrigation extinction coefficient was measured using two photosynthetic active radiation sensors li cor lincoln nebraska usa two sensors were positioned at 20 cm above the canopy and the ground surface photosynthetic active radiation was continuously measured between 06 00 and 19 00 every 7 to 10 days from the emergence to harvest of the tomato crops it was measured only on sunny days and recorded by a li 1400 data logger at 15 min intervals the detailed calculation method of extinction coefficient can be found in gao et al 2010 3 evapotranspiration models and parameters 3 1 shuttleworth wallace model and its parameters the detailed calculation method about the shuttleworth wallace model can be found in appendix 1 3 1 1 canopy and soil surface resistance solar radiation rs vapour pressure deficit d and air temperature ta are the main meteorological factors affecting the crop stomatal resistance r st jarvis 1976 stanghellini 1987 for a greenhouse tomato boulard et al 1991 indicated that the r st could be correctly calculated by rs and d thus the surface canopy resistance r c c can be expressed as follows 2 r c c r s t m i n f r s f d l a i e where the r stmin is the minimal stomatal resistance s m 1 under optimal conditions taken as 60 s m 1 in our study the effective leaf area index laie can be set as follows laie equals to lai when lai 2 laie equals to 2 when 2 lai 4 and laie equals to lai 2 when lai 4 respectively gardiol et al 2003 the f rs and f d are mathematical functions which represent the evolutions of the r st with the variations of the rs and d and can be expressed as follows 3 f r s 1 exp a 1 r s b 1 1 4 f d 1 a 2 exp b 2 d d m a x the values chosen for the parameters were dmax of 1 kpa for air saturation deficit and the coefficients of a1 a2 b1 and b2 were derived from experimental data fitting using a non linear algorithm stanghellini 1987 in our study the value of a 1 and b 1 were 0 006 and 260 673 coefficient of determination r2 0 88 the sample numbers n 70 a 2 and b 2 were 1 121 and 1 137 r 2 0 84 n 70 respectively the soil surface resistance r s s was calculated using the anadranistakis model anadranistakis et al 2000 which is expressed as follows 5 r s s r s m i n s f θ s r s m i n s 2 5 θ f c θ s 1 5 where the r s s min is the minimum soil surface resistance which corresponds to the soil water content at field capacity its value can be set as 100 s m 1 camillo and

coefficient method and its parameters in dual crop coefficient dual kc method crop etc was defined as the product of crop coefficient kc and reference evapotranspiration eto and kc was divided into soil evaporation coefficient ke and plant transpiration coefficient kcb allen et al 1998 2005 the calculation of the etc is implemented as 6 e t k c e t o k c b k e e t o where kcb is the basal crop coefficient ke is the soil evaporation coefficient eto is the reference evapotranspiration 3 2 1 reference evapotranspiration for the characteristics of low air speed in the solar greenhouse fernández et al 2010 2011 considered that the eto can be better estimated by penman monteith equation with a fixed ra of 295 s m 1 it was also applied in a solar greenhouse in the arid desert region of northwest china qiu et al 2013b the eto can be expressed as 7 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 628 v p d t a 273 δ 1 24 γ 3 2 2 basal crop coefficient considering the senescence of tomato leaves in the late growth stage the kcb was calculated using an improved method by ding et al 2013 8 k c b 1 f s k c b m i n k c c k c b f u l l k c b m i n where kcb min is the minimum value of basal crop coefficient for bare soil 0 1 kcb full is the basal crop coefficient when crop having nearly full ground cover k cc is the canopy cover coefficient f s is the leaf senescence factor 0 2 for end of season the kcb full needs to be adjusted for local climatic conditions where the minimum relative humidity rhmin differs from 45 or where the mean air speed is different from 2 m s 1 the calculation methods of adjustment kcb full and k cc can be found in appendix 2 the kcb can also be obtained according to the ratio of plant transpiration measured by sap flow system to eto several studies indicated that using the measured kcb values based on sap flow measurements can improve the performance of the dual kc method in olive orchards and vineyards er raki et al 2010 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 the performance of this method will be tested in a solar greenhouse in this study 3 2 3 soil evaporation coefficient and water stress coefficient the soil evaporation coefficient ke is the maximum when the topsoil was wet following canopy was small less water is available for soil evaporation when the topsoil was dries and a reduction in soil evaporation is proportional to the

initial and calibrated basal crop coefficients p depletion fractions soil evaporation parameters for the greenhouse tomato are presented in table 4 3 3 evaluation of model performance the coefficients of regression b 0 and determination r 2 relating observed and predicted data were used to assess the performance of the s w model and dual kc method they can be defined as follows 14 b 0 i 1 n o i p i

values when b0 and r2 are close to 1 0 indicating that predicted and observed values are statistically similar in addition a set of indicators were also used considering the residual estimation errors rosa et al 2012b fandino et al 2015 they can be defined as follows the mean absolute error mae can reflect the actual prediction error 16 m a e 1 n i 1 n o i p the root mean square error rsme which

evaporation to evapotranspiration and lai the seasonal variations of the ratio of evaporation to evapotranspiration e etc and lai at different growing stage of tomato plants are presented in fig 1 it showed an opposite tendency between e etc and lai and e etc decreased significantly with the increasing in lai the average values of e etc was around 0 25 over the whole growing stage the changes of the e etc at different growing stages are shown as follows at initial stage crop cover was low creating a large fraction of wetted soil that was exposed to radiation thus favoring evaporation the e etc was between 0 21 and 0 97 with the average value of 0 56 in 2015 and 0 59 in 2016 during the development stage the e etc was decreasing significantly due to the rapid growth of lai the e etc was between 0 03 and 0 32 with the average value of 0 20 in 2015 and 0 18 in 2016 at mid and late stages e etc decreased to the lowest level as the lai reached the maximum the e etc was between 0 01 and 0 35 with the average value of 0 12 in 2015 and 0 11 in 2016 additionally because the water content of soil surface was larger after irrigation thus the value of soil evaporation increased significantly and the average value of e etc was 0 31 and 0 29 after irrigation during the whole growing stage in 2015 and 2016 respectively 4 2 basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke the basal crop coefficient kcb adjusted by eq 8 kcb cal measured by sap flow system kcb sap and recommended by fao 56 kcb fao in 2015 and 2016 are presented in fig 2 results showed that there was a wide dispersion between kcb cal and kcb sap which explained the limitation that the kcb sap could be used to calculate the tomato etc cultivated in the solar greenhouse following the proposed segment approach in the fao 56 tomato growing stages can be described as follows the initial and mid stages were characterized by horizontal line segments while the development and late stages were characterized by rising and falling line segments the kcb fao proposed in fao 56 for the tomato crop were 0 15 1 10 and 0 70 at initial mid and late stages respectively allen et al 1998 while the values of kcb cal at initial mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively table 4 the values of the kcb cal at mid stage were smaller than kcb fao during the both study years for ke it was generally affected by surface soil water content and canopy coverage ratio rosa et al 2012b at initial stage due to the small lai and large surface exposed area the ke was between 0 06 and 0 43 while the soil evaporation was changes from 0 08 to 1 19 mm d 1 at development stage the soil evaporation decreased gradually with the increasing in canopy coverage ratio varying between 0 07 and 1 40 mm d 1 while the ke was between 0 15 and 0 34 these values however increased obviously after irrigation at mid and late stages the ke was between 0 07 and 0 19 while the soil evaporation oscillated between 0 03 and 1 28 mm d 1 fig 2 the stable variation of ke was related to the topsoil moisture especially after irrigation 4 3 comparison of hourly etc estimated by s w model and measured by weighing lysimeter comparison and correlation hourly etc between estimated by the s w model and measured by weighing lysimeter ws at different growing stages in 2016 are presented in fig 3 and table 5 results showed that diurnal variation of the estimated etc was similar to the measured etc but there existed differences in the magnitudes the b0 and r2 during the whole growing stage was 0 90 and 0 88 indicated that the predicted and observed values were statistically similar and most of the variance was explained by the model mae and rmse values were quite low 21 31 and 37 41 w m 2 respectively thus indicated that errors of estimation were small these values combined with low rsr ratios 0 37 thus indicated low residual errors the aae and are were 21 35 w m 2 and 50 2 thus being also quite small the pbias was relatively low indicating a slight over estimation bias pbias 8 4 ef and dl was very high ef 0 88 dl 0 97 thus indicated that the residual variance was much smaller than the variance of measured data however the s w model slightly overestimated etc by 17 9 at initial stage with the b0 of 1 12 and pbias of 14 9 additionally the s w model slightly underestimated etc by 16 6 at mid stage with the b0 of 0 85 and pbias of 19 5 at development and late stages the b 0 was close to 1 with the values of 0 95 and 0 97 respectively indicated that the simulation accuracies of the s w model at these two stages were higher than the initial and mid stages other indicators of goodness of fit are presented in table 5 fig 4 shows the diurnal variations of the etc estimated by s w model and measured by ws in sky clear days a overcast days b and after irrigation c results showed that the s w model tended to follow the general trend of the measured etc under different conditions but there was a little dispersion during the period of 12 00 to 14 00 except for the overcast days taken 13 00 as an example the s w model slightly underestimated etc by 11 4 on sky clear day and 8 1 after irrigation 4 4 comparison of daily etc estimated by s w model and dual kc method comparison and correlation daily etc of tomato cultivated in the solar greenhouse between estimated by s w and dual kc methods and measured by sap flow system combined with micro lysimeter in 2015 and ws in 2016 respectively are presented in fig 5 and table 6 results showed that the s w model underestimated daily etc by only 5 1 in both study years 2015 and 2016 the b0 was close to 1 0 and the r2 ranged between 0 82 0 83 the mae and rmse were 0 48 mm d 1 and 0 63 mm d 1 in 2015 and 0 48 mm d 1 and 0 61 mm d 1 in 2016 the rsr were 0 41 and 0 40 in 2015 and 2016 respectively aae values for both study years were 0 48 mm d 1 the are values ranged from 1 41 to 24 1 with a positive pbias for both study years indicating a slight over estimation bias ef and dl indicators were also high ef 0 83 dl 0 95 in two years the estimates of daily etc from dual kc method were better than the s w model with the b0 and of 1 03 in 2015 and 0 96 in 2016 r2 was the same in both study years 0 93 mae rmse rsr aae and are values were quite low they were 0 36 0 39 mm d 1 0 44 0 47 mm d 1 0 23 0 27 0 27 0 33 mm d 1 and 11 1 16 2 respectively the pbias were very low results show a slight under estimation bias in 2015 pbias 2 1 and a slightly over estimation bias in 2016 pbias 2 8 thus the model does not show a trend for under or over estimation bias ef and dl was very high than the s w model ef 0 92 dl 0 98 for two years thus indicating a good model simulation performance therefore the dual kc method can be used as an appropriate way to estimate daily crop etc in greenhouses and may be further used to improve irrigation scheduling for tomato grown in the solar greenhouses 5 discussion 5 1 the performance of the s w model since soil surface resistance and canopy surface resistance were introduced simultaneously in the s w model thus the s w model could better reflect the actual soil evaporation and plant transpiration however there were still some differences between estimated etc by s w model and measured etc by weighing lysimeter the s w model overestimated etc by 17 9 at initial stage and underestimated etc by 16 6 at mid stage respectively table 3 the possible reasons for the etc overestimated by s w model are the following 1 at initial stage the lai of tomato was lower than 0 5 the s w model may overestimate the available energy intercepted by the canopy 2 to enhance the root system of tomato crops only 20 mm water was supplied after transplanting and no irrigation events performed during the period between seedling and flowering fruit bearing stage yuan et al 2001 liu et al 2013a the canopy surface resistance may be underestimated under the water stress condition while the effect of water stress on canopy surface resistance was not considered in the s w model previous studies indicated that the canopy surface resistance was the most sensitive variable relative to the other resistance variables in the s w model ortega farias et al 2007 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 thus we believe that the overestimation of s w model at initial stage was mainly due to the error induced by the canopy surface resistance similar results were also reported by other studies gardiol et al 2003 anadranistakis et al 2000 additionally li et al 2013 indicated that the s w model and the adjusted s w model significantly overestimated etc at the initial stage of maize due to the underestimation of the canopy surface resistance under water stress condition in addition to these reasons because the s w model does not distinguish the reflectivity and long wave radiation between soil and canopy which may also produce a difference between the estimated etc by the s w model and measured etc zhang et al 2008 juhász and hrotkó 2014 indicated that the s w model slightly underestimated the plant transpiration compared with the measurements of sap flow system in our study the s w model also slightly underestimated the plant transpiration at mid stage figs 6 and 7 which resulted in the underestimation of etc ortega farias et al 2010 also reported that the s w model underestimated the vineyard etc under drip irrigation condition in mediterranean semiarid climate at mid stage the canopy coverage ratio of tomato crops reached the peak lai 2 7 and plant transpiration accounted for more than 90 of total etc the s w model underestimated the plant transpiration by 16 6 and 26 0 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the b0 and r2 was 0 84 and 0 91 in 2015 0 76 and 0 94 in 2016 thus indicating that predicted and observed transpiration values were statistically similar and most of the variance were explained by the s w model figs 6 and 7 additionally juhász and hrotkó 2014 also believed that the s w model underestimated the etc under the conditions of cloudy and rainy days as well as on high vapor pressure deficit days as stated above the application of the s w model in solar greenhouses should consider the combined effects of meteorological elements crop growth conditions and soil water status additionally establishment of canopy surface resistance model played a critical role in determining the performance of the s w model especially under water stress condition so how to consider the effect of water stress on canopy resistance remains to be investigated in our study however when the lai was between 0 5 and 2 7 the s w model performed well in estimating tomato etc cultivated in the solar greenhouse 5 2 the performance of the dual kc method the base crop coefficient kcb was affected by many factors such as climatic conditions crop types soil surface mulching water and salt stress allen et al 1998 2005 rosa et al 2012a the kcb was calculated by ding et al 2013 method kcb cal results showed that the kcb cal at initial mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively the values of kcb cal were lower than the standard values at mid stage recommended by fao 56 kcb fao in both study years fig 2 and table 4 similar results have been validated in different crops such as vineyard poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 cotton yang et al 2016 wheat and maize ding et al 2013 liu and luo 2010 greenhouse tomato and pepper hanson and may 2006 qiu et al 2013b the possible reasons for the kcb cal lower than the kcb fao in the solar greenhouse are the following 1 higher humidity and lower air transfer in the solar greenhouse can result in lower kcb values allen et al 1998 2 in order to manage tomato plants easily the walkway about 30 cm was set thus there was no plant transpiration in walkway areas which lowered the kcb qiu et al 2013b 3 the reduction at mid stage relative to the starting value from fao56 may reflect a slight reduction in kcb mid caused by impacts of water stress plant variety or reduced vigor or may be an artifact of soil water measurement error rosa et al 2012b the soil evaporation coefficient ke was maximum during the initial stage because the lai was low which created a large wetted soil surface area that was exposed to sun radiation rosa et al 2012b also indicated that the ke was maximum when the topsoil was wet following irrigation and canopy was small qiu et al 2015 indicated that the soil evaporation has exceeded 2 0 mm d 1 at the initial stage in which case ke was around 0 6 for greenhouse hot pepper the maximum ke was above 1 0 for fully irrigated maize under basin irrigation when soil evaporation exceeded 3 0 mm d 1 rosa et al 2012b fandino et al 2015 indicated that high ke values were observed during the initial stage for hop crop it can be seen that daily ke was significant during the crop initial stage the estimates of daily soil evaporation and plant transpiration from the dual kc method were in a good agreement with the measurements thus indicating that the estimates of daily etc from dual kc method were better than s w model correlation daily soil evaporation between estimated by the dual kc method and measured by micro lysimeters in both study years results showed that the mae and rmse were 0 18 mm d 1 and 0 24 mm d 1 respectively which slightly lower than the daily soil evaporation estimated by s w model mae of 0 21 mm d 1 and rmse of 0 34 mm d 1 fig 8 the daily plant transpiration estimated by dual kc method also was better than the s w model with the mae and rmse of 0 41 mm d 1 and 0 54 mm d 1 for dual kc method 0 59 mm d 1 and 0 76 mm d 1 for the s w model fig 8 therefore the dual kc method had better performance in estimating daily soil evaporation and plant transpiration than the s w model possible reason is that soil evaporation is a function of variation in surface soil water content in the dual kc method while it is mainly affected by soil surface resistance in the s w model which is not accurate enough especially for wetting soil zhao et al 2015 gharsallah et al 2013 also indicated that the daily soil evaporation estimated by dual kc method was more variable in time than those simulated by the s w model especially around wetting events in our study both s w model and dual kc method can be used in estimating the daily etc in solar greenhouse but considering the precision and simplicity the dual kc method was finally recommended 6 conclusions 1 soil evaporation cannot be ignored for soil grown tomato in the solar greenhouse and the average value of e etc was around 0 25 during the whole growth period 2 the base crop coefficient at initial development mid and late stages were 0 15 0 94 and 0 65 in 2015 and 0 15 1 02 and 0 70 in 2016 respectively which were lower than the standard values recommended by fao 56 at mid stage 3 the s w model slightly overestimated and underestimated etc at initial and mid stages respectively but it performed well when the lai was between 0 5 and 2 7 in addition the precision of the s w model was also better at different weather conditions as well as after irrigation 4 both the s w model and dual kc method can be used to estimate daily etc of tomato cultivated in the solar greenhouse but considering the simplicity of using the dual kc method to develop irrigation schedule this method was finally recommended acknowledgements we acknowledge

11073,in regional water resources allcoation problems the uncertainties of hydrological variables and socio economic parameters are bringing huge challenges to water managers so far the stochastic programming models have difficulty in addressing uncertain problems in which there are two correlated random variables in order to address regional water resources allocation under two hydrological random variables and interval parameters a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method is proposed the cibsp method includes several key steps first the marginal distributions of the two hydrological variables are analyzed and hydrological scenarios are set then the copula is chosen to analyze joint probability distribution of the two hydrological variables and the joint probabilities of scenarios are calculated last an interval bistochastic model is formulated by incorporating two stage stochastic programming interval parameter programming and bivariate joint distribution the cibsp method can describe the probability of occurrence of a hydrological scenario and then make an optimized water allocation scheme under uncertainties to demonstrate its applicability the cibsp method is applied to the zhanghe irrigation district located in china to optimize available water allocation under the uncertainties of the annual inflow volume of the zhanghe reservoir and annual rainfall volume in the irrigated district an appropriate water allocation plan can be obtained by the method which provides a foundation to water managers for managing water resources in zhanghe irrigation district moreover other two hypothetical situations named independence hypothetical situation and linear relationship hypothetical situation are discussed the difference in the results between the two hypothetical situations and the case study indicates that an appropriate description of the joint probability of the annual inflow volume and annual rainfall volume by using cibsp method is important for water resource allocation under uncertainties keywords copula interval parameter programming bivariate joint distribution two stage stochastic programming uncertainty water allocation 1 introduction water is one of the most important natural resources for sustainable development particularly in areas of water scarcity widomski 2014 with the rapid socio economic development and global population growth the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources is more and more outstanding in many countries and regions nandalal and simonovic 2003 moreover the decrease of available water resource due to climate change aggravates the problem in some areas zhang et al 2011 water shortage has become a major barrier to socio economic developmentsocio bronstert et al 2000 therefore there is an urgent need to develop sound management plans to address the competition for water among municipal industrial hydropower and agricultural users which has challenged water resources managers for years wheater and gober 2015 various deterministic optimization models have been employed for water resources allocation over the past decades singh 2012 for example linear programming non linear programming or dynamic programming optimization models have been used for irrigation management kaviani et al 2015 shangguan et al 2002 reservoir systems operation ahmed and sarma 2005 mousavi and ramamurthy 2000 reddy and kumar 2006 groundwater management ahlfeld et al 1988 ayvaz 2009 surface ground water conjunctive planning haimes and dreizin 1977 montazar et al 2010 however the above deterministic optimization models have difficulties in handling various uncertainties existing in water resources allocation such as available water rainfall water demands corresponding costs and benefits of water supply and policy regulations some uncertainties can be expressed as probability density functions while some others may exist as ambiguous intervals bekri et al 2015 in order to deal with the uncertainties the interval parameter programming fu et al 2014 loáiciga et al 2015 the stochastic mathematical programming alaya et al 2003 davidsen et al 2015 lee et al 1992 marques et al 2009 mujumdar and ramesh 1997 stedinger et al 1984 vedula and kumar 1996 and the interval stochastic programming chen et al 2015 guo et al 2010 li et al 2014 lu et al 2008 maqsood et al 2005 were proposed for water resources allocation among these methods interval two stage stochastic programming itsp is a widely used method due to the integration of interval parameter programming and two stage stochastic programming the itsp can address the uncertainties expressed as both probability density functions and ambiguous intervals li et al 2010 in itsp a decision is first undertaken to maximize the benefits before values of random variables are known then after random events have occurred a second decision is made to minimize penalties that may appear due to infeasibility huang and loucks 2000 in most previous studies on water resources allocation only one random variable was considered for example li and zhang 2015 considered available water to be random variable and developed an inexact two stage model for optimal water allocation to multi user chen et al 2017a considered rainfall to be random variable and proposed an interval multistage water allocation model for irrigation planning however in real world problems especially for multiple sources water supply system there are usually two or more main random variables to solve uncertain problems under two random variables li et al 2009 proposed a multistage scenario based interval stochastic programming model for joint operation of two reservoirs in which the annual inflow volumes of the two reservoirs were treated as independent random variables chen et al 2017b formulated an interval multistage classified model for regional water allocation in which the available water and local rainfall volume were treated as two random variables and there was a linear relationship between them however due to spatial relationship the random variables are correlated in many actual problems raynalvillasenor and raynalgutierrez 2001 in addition the correlation generally cannot be described by a linear function therefore the above two methods are no longer applicable to such problems in order to address regional water resources allocation under two correlated hydrological random variables and interval parameters a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method is proposed in cibsp method the copula is chosen to analyze and obtain the bivariate joint distribution of two stochastic variables exacting in the problem the interval bistochastic model is developed by incorporating two stage stochastic programming interval programming and bivariate joint distribution to tackle the uncertainties expressed as intervals and a bivariate joint distribution function to demonstrate the applicability the cibsp method is applied to the zhanghe irrigation district located in hubei province yangtze river basin of china to optimally allocate available water resources to the municipality industry hydropower and agriculture the optimal solutions obtained can help managers to develop an appropriate allocation plan for different water users under uncertainties 2 research methodology 2 1 method summary consider a problem in which the water manager is charged with allocating available water to multiple users the users are expanding their activities and need to know how much water they can expect given that available water is a random variable and corresponding costs and benefits of water supply are intervals an interval two stage stochastic programming itsp model can be used to solve the problem 1 max f k 1 n u t k b k e k 1 n u s k ξ c k s t w a ξ k 1 n u t k s k ξ t k s k ξ 0 i where and superscripts represent lower and upper bounds of an interval parameter variable respectively f is the expected net system benefit rmb rmb is the legal currency of china ξ is the hydrological random variable k index for water user nu is the total number of water users t k is the water allocation target to user k m3 decision variable in first stage b k is the net benefit for water user k per unit of water allocated rmb m3 e is the expect value of penalty function s k ξ is the water allocation target not delivered for water user k m3 decision variable in second stage c k is the reduction of net benefit penalty for water user k per unit of water allocation target not delivered rmb m3 w a ξ is the total available water m3 it varies according to whatever value ξ takes on in order to simplify the solution of eq 1 the continuous random variable ξ should be estimated as discrete random variable huang and loucks 2000 divide ξ into nl levels and let ξ take on value ξr with probability pr for r 1 2 n l then expect value of penalty function can be written as 2 e k 1 n u s k ξ c k k 1 n u c k r 1 n l p r s k r where p r r 1 2 n l s k r is the water allocation target not delivered for water user k under level r m3 thus the eq 1 can be simplified as 3 max f k 1 n u t k b k k 1 n u r 1 n l p r s k r c k s t w a r k 1 n u t k s k r r t k s k r 0 k r where w a r is the total available water under level r m3 from above description the itsp model can only solve problems of water resources allocation under one random variable however there are usually two or more main correlated hydrological random variables in real word problems for example in a two reservoir water supply systems the annual inflow volumes of these two reservoirs may be two correlated random variables in a single reservoir irrigation system the annual inflow volume of the reservoir and local annual rainfall volume may also be two correlated random variables in order to address regional water resources allocation under two correlated hydrological random variables a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method is proposed the flow diagram of cibsp method is shown in fig 1 there are several key steps set scenarios construct a bivariate joint distribution and create an interval bistochastic model which will be described in detail in the following sections 2 2 hydrological scenarios for each hydrological random variable a marginal probability distribution can be obtained through fitting the historical time series by an appropriate distribution then according to the marginal distribution a random variable can be divided into several levels by selected percentiles in china four percentiles used for dry wet year division are 12 5th 37 5th 62 5th and 87 5th thus these four percentiles are used to divide a hydrological random variable into five levels very low low medium high and very high the probabilities are 0 125 0 25 0 25 0 25 and 0 125 respectively the gamma distribution shape parameter and scale parameter are equal to 10 and 3 respectively is taken as example to show the principle of level division see fig 2 suppose the two hydrological random variables are x and y respectively after finishing division of the two variables let scenario i j represent the scenario when level i for variable x and level j for variable y occur at the same time since each variable has 5 levels there are 25 scenarios in total 2 3 bivariate joint distribution the copula is a function for capturing the dependence of two or more stochastic variables which was developed by sklar 1959 every joint distribution can be written in a copula and univariate marginal distributions thus the copula is chosen to construct the joint distribution of the two hydrological random variables in this study follow sklar s theorem the joint behavior of the two random variables x y with marginal distributions fx x and fy y can be characterized uniquely by a copula c given as follow 4 f x y x y c f x x f y y many different families of copulas with different linking functions have been proposed and described during the past few decades nelsen 2006 salvadori et al 2007 among all the families the archimedean copula family is found to be more suitable for hydrological series zhang and singh 2006 due to its simple structure and good performance in many applicaitons li et al 2013 the gumbel hougaard gh copula that is a member of archimedean copula family is the most commonly used for analyzing the dependence of hydrological variables karmakar and simonovic 2009 kong et al 2015 the gh copula is written as 5 c u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where u and v are cumulative distribution functions of the two stochastic variables respectively θ is the dependence parameter of gh copula which can range from 1 to among the methods used to estimate the dependence parameter the parameter estimation based on kendall s rank correlation coefficient is a sample and effective method to estimate dependence parameter of a binary copula when the two marginal distributions are known genest and rivest 1993 the relationship between dependence parameter of gh copula and kendall s rank correlation coefficient can be given as 6 τ 1 1 θ where τ is kendall s correlation coefficient between the two random variables 2 4 interval bistochastic model in order to address the uncertainty expressed as a bivariate joint distribution function an interval bistochastic model is developed by introducing bivariate joint distribution into two stage stochastic programming and interval parameter programming the model can be written as follow 7 max f k 1 k t k b k k 1 k p i j s k i j c k s t w a i j k 1 k t k s k i j i j t k s k i j 0 k i j where i is the index for level of variable x i 1 2 i i is the total number of scenarios of variable x j is the index for level of variable y j 1 2 j j is the total number of scenarios of variable y p i j is the probability of occurrence of scenario i j the situation when level i for variable x and level j for variable y occur at the same time with p i j 0 and p i j 1 s k i j is the water allocation target not delivered for water user k under scenario i j m3 w a i j is the total water available under scenario i j m3 other symbols have the same meaning as in eq 1 the interval bistochastic model can be transformed into two deterministic sub models by introducing a decision variable z k which correspond to the lower and upper bounds of the desired objective function value this transformation process is based on an interactive algorithm according to huang and loucks 2000 since the objective is to maximize the net system benefit the sub model corresponding to the upper bound objective function value is first determined as follows 8 max f k 1 k t k δ t k z k b k k 1 k p i j s k i j c k s t w a i j k 1 k t k δ t k z k s k i j i j t k δ t k z k s k i j 0 k i j 0 z k 1 k where δ t k t k t k s k i j and z k are decision variables suppose s k i j o p t z k o p t and f o p t are the solutions of the eq 8 then the sub model corresponding to lower bound can be presented as follows 9 max f k 1 k t k δ t k z k b k k 1 k p i j s k i j c k s t w a i j k 1 k t k δ t k z k s k i j i j t k δ t k z k s k i j 0 k i j where s k i j is decision variable assume s k i j o p t and f o p t are the solutions of the eq 9 thus solutions for the interval bistochastic model can be obtained as follows 10 f o p t f o p t f o p t t k o p t t k δ t k z k o p t k s k i j o p t s k i j o p t s k i j o p t k i j 3 case study 3 1 problem description the selected study area is the zhanghe irrigation district zid which is located in hubei province yangtze river basin of china see fig 3 this region has drawn international attention because it has been managed to sustain rice production with gradually decreasing agricultural water roost et al 2008 zhanghe reservoir is the mainly water source for agriculture municipality industry and hydropower in the zid in addition the zid can be divided into seven sub districts according to the administrative division see fig 3 in each sub district there are some small and medium reservoirs used for irrigation in this problem the water manager is responsible for allocating the available water from the zhanghe reservoir to three nonagricultural users municipality industry and hydropower and three main corps semi late rice winter rape and cotton in seven irrigated sub districts at annual scale because the zhanghe reservoir annual inflow volume zrai is a random variable it is hard to optimized the water allocation before the value of the inflow volume is known in addition agricultural water requirements are affected by annual rainfall volume in the irrigation district idar which also is a random variable moreover many socio economic parameters such as electricity price per capital water consumption crop prices and potential yield are also uncertain these factors lead to a number of challenging questions for optimal allocation of the available water such as i how to accurately describe the dependence of the two stochastic variables zrai and idar ii how to appropriately calculate agricultural water requirement targets under uncertainty of idar iii how to find an optimal allocation policy to obtain the maximum benefit with the minimal risk of violating the targets given the uncertainties of both zrai and idar and iv how to deal with the uncertainties of socio economic parameters 3 2 problem solution considering each aspect the problem can be solved by the cibsp method there are four main steps analyze marginal distributions of zrai and idar and set 25 scenarios construct a joint distribution of zrai and idar and analyze the probability of each scenario classify water users to agricultural users and non agricultural users and establish a suitable ibs model determine model parameter and solve the model 3 2 1 marginal distributions analysis given that the pearson type three distribution was the most suitable one for hydrologic variables such as rainfall and streamflow in china li et al 2013 it was applied to fit idar and zrai historical series which both have the length of 53 years the degree of fit can be evaluated by using a normal quantile quantile plot of residuals wilks 1993 fig 4 a and b demonstrate satisfactory good agreements between the fitted pearson type three distributions with idar with aic of 718 26 and zrai witth aic of 1274 45 historical series respectively with the data points primarily aligned on the 45 degree lines solid lines according to the fitted marginal probability distributions the idar and zrai were divided into five levels with corresponding probabilities based on the method presented in section 2 2 the results of level division are shown in table 1 3 2 2 construction of the joint distribution following the method presented in section 2 3 the gh copula was used to obtain the joint distribution of zrai and idar fig 4c shows the normal quantile quantile plot of fitting residuals by using gh copula which also illustrates a satisfactory degree of fit with aic of 986 38 let scenario i j represents the situation when rainfall level i for idar and inflow level j for zrai occur at the same time for example scenario medium medium represents both idar and zrai are under medium level according to the fitted joint probability distribution the probability under each scenario was obtained and is shown in table 2 it can be seen that there are 8 scenarios with probabilities of zero which indicates only 17 scenarios may occur 3 2 3 creation of the interval bistochastic model to allocate the available water from zhanghe reservoir to three non agricultural users and three crops in seven irrigated sub districts under uncertainties of zrai idar and socio economic parameters a suitable ibs model should be established given that agricultural water requirement targets are affected by idar the water users were classified into agricultural users and non agricultural users and irrigated area targets and water allocation targets were treated as first stage decision variables respectively chen et al 2017b the interval bistochastic model is given as follow 11 max f l 1 3 t n a l b n a l m 1 7 n 1 3 t a m n b a m n l 1 3 p i j s n a l i j c n a l m 1 7 n 1 3 p i j s a m n i

q m i is the available irrigation water from small and medium sized reservoirs in sub district m under rainfall level i m3 ηm is the overall project efficiency in sub district m ηrm is the conveyance efficiency of canal between the zhanghe reservoir and sub district m the model can be solved by the improved artificial bee colony algorithm developed by chen et al 2016 which can be realized in matlab 3 2 4 parameter determination and model solution there are many parameters that should be determined to run the established interval bistochastic model the available water from zhanghe reservoir under each inflow level was calculated by annual inflow minus water loss and is shown in table 3 crop irrigation quota under each rainfall level was obtained according to the irrigation test data in the zid table 4 table 4 also shows the available irrigation water from small and medium sized reservoirs in each sub district under each rainfall level which was obtained by analyzing historic rainfall inflow data table 5 shows the water allocation target benefit and penalty for each non agricultural user table 6 presents the irrigated area target benefit and penalty for each agricultural water user for each agricultural water user penalty mainly comes from the expense of cultivation when the promised irrigated area is not delivered therefore the penalty for a certain crop is assumed to the same for different sub districts the above targets of municipal industrial and agricultural users were estimated from the statistical analysis of historical records from 2010 to 2014 the lower bound was calculated from mean values minus the standard deviation and the upper bound was calculated from mean values plus the standard deviation for hydropower the lower bound of the target was set as the lowest environmental water demand in the downstream river and the upper bound was set as the water required for the maximum power generation of the power station the benefits and penalties are approximated from socio economic parameters such as water consumption perten thousand yuan industrial output value electricity price and per capita water consumption for non agricultural water users crop price potential yield and the expense of cultivation for agricultural water users in order to solve the eq 11 it was transformed into two deterministic sub models according to the method presented in section 2 4 then each sub model was solved by the improved artificial bee colony abc algorithm developed by chen et al 2016 the improved abc algorithm is an integration of original abc algorithm differential evolution de algorithm and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm because it absorbs the advantages of above three algorithms the improved abc algorithm has the characteristics of fast convergence high robustness and high accuracy the main steps are i initialize food sources ii send employed bees to explore food sources by using de strategy iii send onlooker bees to explore food sources by using neighborhood dithering strategy iv send the scout bee to discover a new food source by using pso strategy the parameters that have a great influence on the algorithm are total number of food sources limit parameter scaling factor crossover factor and study factor in this study they were set as 100 100 0 8 0 2 and 2 respectively 4 results analysis 4 1 optimal allocation target for water users in this study the water manager could set the water allocation target t n a l for each non agricultural user and irrigated area target t a m n for each crop in each sub district t n a l and t a m n can be determined by introducing allocation coefficients znal and zamn as decision variables when allocation coefficient approaches 1 high income could be obtained if the promised water object irrigated area is delivered but a high recourse cost might have to be paid if the water target irrigated area target is not satisfied when allocation coefficient approaches 0 a lower benefit can be gained when the water target irrigated area target is satisfied while a lower recourse cost should be paid if the promised water object irrigated area is not delivered optimal allocation coefficients and optimal targets are presented in table 7 it can be seen that optimal water allocation targets for municipality and industry are set as their upper bounds while the target for hydropower is much less than the upper bound the optimal irrigated area targets for winter rape and cotton in all the sub districts are set at their upper bounds while the optimal irrigated area targets for semi late rice are less than their upper bounds except in zhangheand dangyang the greater the optimal allocation coefficient the greater its priority for using water municipality and industry have the highest priorities due to their largest benefits and hydropower has the lowest priority due to least benefit for agriculture winter rape and cotton have higher priorities than semi late rice due to their lower irrigation quotas for different sub districts zhanghe and dangyang have higher priorities than other sub districts due to their larger benefits the optimal targets can provide a foundation to water manager for developing the water use plan under uncertainties 4 2 optimal water allocationfor non agricultural user if the available water cannot meet the regulated targets water shortages for non agricultural users would occur optimal water allocation for each non agricultural user under each scenario was obtained and corresponding water shortage was calculated by optimal target minus optimal water allocation fig 5 shows the water shortage ratio calculated by dividing optimal water shortage by optimal target for each non agricultural user under five typical scenarios the results are presented as interval values which reflect the uncertainties that exist as ambiguous intervals in this water allocation problem for municipality and industry with optimal allocation coefficients of 1 the promised water targets are satisfied and water shortages never occur under all the scenarios however the water shortage ratio for hydropower that has the relative small optimal allocation coefficient 0 68 is very large under all the scenarios except scenario very high very high scenario the results indicate that the larger the optimal allocation coefficient the less likelihood of water shortage for hydropower the lower bound and upper bound of water shortage are the same under scenarios very low very low low low and medium medium which is because only the minimum water requirement will be allocated for hydropower under these scenarios the optimal water allocationprovide a basis for optimally allocating water to non agricultural users after the occurrence of a certain scenario 4 3 optimal non irrigated area and irrigation water allocation for agricultural user if there is not enough water under a certain scenario part of the aimed irrigated area for some crops cannot be irrigated fig 6 demonstrates non irrigated area ratio that is calculated by dividing optimal area without irrigation by irrigated area target for each crop under five typical scenarios because all the aimed area can be irrigated under the high high and very high very high scenarios the figure does not depict the optimal area without irrigation under these two scenarios the results are also presented as interval values fig 6a presents the non irrigated area ratios under the very low very low scenarios for semi late rice both the lower bound and upper bound of non irrigated area ratio are very large in most sub districts for winter rape the lower bound is zero in all the sub districts while the upper bound is very large in most sub districts however both the lower bound and upper bound are zero in most sub districts for cotton the non irrigated area ratios under the scenario low low are shown in fig 6b for winter rape and cotton both the lower and upper bounds are zero which indicates the optimized area targets are satisfied in all the sub districts however for semi late rice the lower bound is zero in dongbao duodao dangyang and zhanghe while the upper bound in zhanghe is zero the results indicate the aimed area for semi late rice still cannot be irrigated in all the sub districts except in zh fig 6c illustrates the non irrigated area ratios under the scenario medium medium similarly the aimed area for winter rape and cotton can be irrigated in all the sub districts for semi late rice both the lower bound and upper bound are zero in dongbao duodao dangyang and zhanghe while the upper bound is still a little large in jingzhou shayang and zhongxiang from fig 6 it can be seen that the larger the optimal allocation coefficient of a certain water user the greater the likelihood of the target being satisfied for a same sub district such as zhongxiang the irrigated area targets of cotton and winter rape are satisfied under all the scenarios except very low very low scenario while non irrigated area ratio of semi late rice is very large under the three scenarios especially under the very low very low and low low scenarios for a same crop such as semi late rice the irrigated area target in zhanghe can be satisfied under all the scenarios except very low very low scenario while non irrigated area ratios in jingzhou shayang and zhongxiang are very large under the three scenarios that is because the itbs model can make a tradeoff between the benefits and penalties the actual irrigation water allocation for each sub district is decided by the irrigated area target non irrigated area and available water from small and medium sized reservoirs fig 7 demonstrates the optimal irrigation water to each sub district under different scenarios it can be seen that the actual water allocated to sy is the largest due to its highest irrigated area target for each sub district the actual allocated water increases with idar and zrai and usually reaches a peak when idar and zrai are both under medium level it then begins to decrease with increasing idar and zrai that is because there is not enough water allocated to agricultural users under the very low very low low low and medium medium scenarios while the irrigation water requirement is low under the high high and very high very high scenarios the above results provide a basis to water manager for optimally allocating water to agricultural users after the occurrence of a certain scenario 5 discussion to demonstrate the benefit of considering the joint distribution of zrai and idar the following two hypothetical situations were analyzed a independence hypothetical situation idar and zrai are independent li et al 2009 b linear relationship hypothetical situation there is linear relationship between idar and zrai chen et al 2017a 2017b the probabilities under these two hypothetical situations are shown in table 8 which are very different from that in the case study see table 2 additionally it can be seen that the probabilities of all 25 scenarios are not equal to zero which indicates that each scenario is likely to occur under independence hypothetical situation however the probabilities of only five scenarios are not equal to zero which indicates only these five scenarios may occur under linear relationship hypothetical situation the optimal allocation coefficients under the two hypothetical situations are shown in table 9 although optimal targets for municipality industry winter rape and cotton under the two assumed situations are the same with that in the case study see table 7 the optimal targets for hydropower and semi late rice are very different for independence hypothetical situation the optimal target for hydropower is lower while the optimal targets for semi late rice in most sub districts are higher than thatin the case study that is because it underestimates the total probability of scenarios very low very low low very low medium very low very low low low low medium low very low medium low medium and medium medium under which the target for semi late rice is not satisfied therefore it then underestimates the penalty caused by optimal target not satisfied for semi late rice in addition the independent situation underestimates the probability of scenario very high very high under which the target for hydropower is only satisfied therefore it then overestimates the penalty caused by optimal target not satisfied for hydropower for linear relationship hypothetical situation the optimal target for hydropower is higher while the optimal targets for semi late rice in most sub districts are lower than that under the actual situation that is because it overestimates the total probability of above nine scenarios and overestimates the probability of the scenario very high very high the optimal schemes from the two hypothetical situations are not suitable for guiding the development of water use plan thus an appropriate description of the joint probability of idar and zrai by using cibsp method is important for water resources allocation in zid under uncertainty this study is based on a research program named the efficient utilization mechanism of water resources in irrigation district that is sponsored by national natural science foundation of china the cibsp method is mainly proposed to address uncertainties of annual inflow volume of the key water source and local annual rainfall volume in irrigation district the methodology can be applied to optimize water allocation between different crops under uncertainties in an irrigation district which satisfies the following conditions i there is only one key irrigation water source and the historical data of annual inflow volume of the water source can be obtained ii rainfall can be considered to be uniform in the irrigated district and the historical data of rainfall can be obtained iii socio economic parameters can be expressed as interval numbers the optimized water allocation plan can help to improve net benefit in the irrigation district in addition the cibsp can also be applied to a two source urban water supply system in which the two inflows are correlated hydrological random variables although cibsp method can solve some certain problems there are still research questions to be addressed in the case study the aimed area for each crop is considered to be either full irrigation or no irrigation which may underestimate the benefit because sometimes a larger area with inadequate irrigation is more productive than a smaller area with full irrigation in addition the cibsp method only considers two common uncertainties existing in the water resources management which are expressed as probability density functions and ambiguous intervals however there are other uncertainties such as fuzzy information which can neither be determined as an exact number nor an interval number other methods should be introduced to tackle this uncertainty such as fuzzy programming mousavi et al 2004 srivastava and singh 2015 and robust programming li et al 2011 watkins and mckinney 1997 moreover the continuous random variables are simplified into five levels to deal with uncertainties expressed as probability density functions which may result in loss of information of random variables furthermore the socio economic parameters such as benefits and penalties have a great impact on the results however it is hard to estimate these parameters in many actual management problems which hinders the application of the cibsp method the above issues should be addressed in the further research 6 conclusions this study proposes a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method to deal with uncertainties in water allocation the method consists of two core modules the joint distribution analysis and the interval bivariate stochastic model the copula that has the ability to capture the dependence of mutiple stochastic variables is selected to model the joint probability distribution of two hydrological random variables in water resources allocation by incorporating two stage stochastic programming interval parameter programming and bivariate joint distribution the interval bistochastic model can not only deal with the uncertainties expressed as interval parameters but can also address the uncertainty expressed as a bivariate joint distribution function the cibsp method was applied to the zhanghe irrigation district to optimally allocate the available water from zhanghe reservoir to municipality industry hydropower and three crops in seven irrigated sub districts the optimal targets can provide a foundation to water manager for developing the water allocation schemeunder uncertainty the optimal water allocation for non agricultural user and irrigation water allocation for agricultural user provide a basis for optimally allocating available water after the occurrence of a certain scenario in addition the difference in the resultsbetween the two hypothetical situations and the case study which have different joint probability under each scenario demonstrates that it is helpful to analyze the joint distribution of the inflow and rainfall before water allocation conflict of interest no conflict of

11073,in regional water resources allcoation problems the uncertainties of hydrological variables and socio economic parameters are bringing huge challenges to water managers so far the stochastic programming models have difficulty in addressing uncertain problems in which there are two correlated random variables in order to address regional water resources allocation under two hydrological random variables and interval parameters a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method is proposed the cibsp method includes several key steps first the marginal distributions of the two hydrological variables are analyzed and hydrological scenarios are set then the copula is chosen to analyze joint probability distribution of the two hydrological variables and the joint probabilities of scenarios are calculated last an interval bistochastic model is formulated by incorporating two stage stochastic programming interval parameter programming and bivariate joint distribution the cibsp method can describe the probability of occurrence of a hydrological scenario and then make an optimized water allocation scheme under uncertainties to demonstrate its applicability the cibsp method is applied to the zhanghe irrigation district located in china to optimize available water allocation under the uncertainties of the annual inflow volume of the zhanghe reservoir and annual rainfall volume in the irrigated district an appropriate water allocation plan can be obtained by the method which provides a foundation to water managers for managing water resources in zhanghe irrigation district moreover other two hypothetical situations named independence hypothetical situation and linear relationship hypothetical situation are discussed the difference in the results between the two hypothetical situations and the case study indicates that an appropriate description of the joint probability of the annual inflow volume and annual rainfall volume by using cibsp method is important for water resource allocation under uncertainties keywords copula interval parameter programming bivariate joint distribution two stage stochastic programming uncertainty water allocation 1 introduction water is one of the most important natural resources for sustainable development particularly in areas of water scarcity widomski 2014 with the rapid socio economic development and global population growth the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources is more and more outstanding in many countries and regions nandalal and simonovic 2003 moreover the decrease of available water resource due to climate change aggravates the problem in some areas zhang et al 2011 water shortage has become a major barrier to socio economic developmentsocio bronstert et al 2000 therefore there is an urgent need to develop sound management plans to address the competition for water among municipal industrial hydropower and agricultural users which has challenged water resources managers for years wheater and gober 2015 various deterministic optimization models have been employed for water resources allocation over the past decades singh 2012 for example linear programming non linear programming or dynamic programming optimization models have been used for irrigation management kaviani et al 2015 shangguan et al 2002 reservoir systems operation ahmed and sarma 2005 mousavi and ramamurthy 2000 reddy and kumar 2006 groundwater management ahlfeld et al 1988 ayvaz 2009 surface ground water conjunctive planning haimes and dreizin 1977 montazar et al 2010 however the above deterministic optimization models have difficulties in handling various uncertainties existing in water resources allocation such as available water rainfall water demands corresponding costs and benefits of water supply and policy regulations some uncertainties can be expressed as probability density functions while some others may exist as ambiguous intervals bekri et al 2015 in order to deal with the uncertainties the interval parameter programming fu et al 2014 loáiciga et al 2015 the stochastic mathematical programming alaya et al 2003 davidsen et al 2015 lee et al 1992 marques et al 2009 mujumdar and ramesh 1997 stedinger et al 1984 vedula and kumar 1996 and the interval stochastic programming chen et al 2015 guo et al 2010 li et al 2014 lu et al 2008 maqsood et al 2005 were proposed for water resources allocation among these methods interval two stage stochastic programming itsp is a widely used method due to the integration of interval parameter programming and two stage stochastic programming the itsp can address the uncertainties expressed as both probability density functions and ambiguous intervals li et al 2010 in itsp a decision is first undertaken to maximize the benefits before values of random variables are known then after random events have occurred a second decision is made to minimize penalties that may appear due to infeasibility huang and loucks 2000 in most previous studies on water resources allocation only one random variable was considered for example li and zhang 2015 considered available water to be random variable and developed an inexact two stage model for optimal water allocation to multi user chen et al 2017a considered rainfall to be random variable and proposed an interval multistage water allocation model for irrigation planning however in real world problems especially for multiple sources water supply system there are usually two or more main random variables to solve uncertain problems under two random variables li et al 2009 proposed a multistage scenario based interval stochastic programming model for joint operation of two reservoirs in which the annual inflow volumes of the two reservoirs were treated as independent random variables chen et al 2017b formulated an interval multistage classified model for regional water allocation in which the available water and local rainfall volume were treated as two random variables and there was a linear relationship between them however due to spatial relationship the random variables are correlated in many actual problems raynalvillasenor and raynalgutierrez 2001 in addition the correlation generally cannot be described by a linear function therefore the above two methods are no longer applicable to such problems in order to address regional water resources allocation under two correlated hydrological random variables and interval parameters a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method is proposed in cibsp method the copula is chosen to analyze and obtain the bivariate joint distribution of two stochastic variables exacting in the problem the interval bistochastic model is developed by incorporating two stage stochastic programming interval programming and bivariate joint distribution to tackle the uncertainties expressed as intervals and a bivariate joint distribution function to demonstrate the applicability the cibsp method is applied to the zhanghe irrigation district located in hubei province yangtze river basin of china to optimally allocate available water resources to the municipality industry hydropower and agriculture the optimal solutions obtained can help managers to develop an appropriate allocation plan for different water users under uncertainties 2 research methodology 2 1 method summary consider a problem in which the water manager is charged with allocating available water to multiple users the users are expanding their activities and need to know how much water they can expect given that available water is a random variable and corresponding costs and benefits of water supply are intervals an interval two stage stochastic programming itsp model can be used to solve the problem 1 max f k 1 n u t k b k e k 1 n u s k ξ c k s t w a ξ k 1 n u t k s k ξ t k s k ξ 0 i where and superscripts represent lower and upper bounds of an interval parameter variable respectively f is the expected net system benefit rmb rmb is the legal currency of china ξ is the hydrological random variable k index for water user nu is the total number of water users t k is the water allocation target to user k m3 decision variable in first stage b k is the net benefit for water user k per unit of water allocated rmb m3 e is the expect value of penalty function s k ξ is the water allocation target not delivered for water user k m3 decision variable in second stage c k is the reduction of net benefit penalty for water user k per unit of water allocation target not delivered rmb m3 w a ξ is the total available water m3 it varies according to whatever value ξ takes on in order to simplify the solution of eq 1 the continuous random variable ξ should be estimated as discrete random variable huang and loucks 2000 divide ξ into nl levels and let ξ take on value ξr with probability pr for r 1 2 n l then expect value of penalty function can be written as 2 e k 1 n u s k ξ c k k 1 n u c k r 1 n l p r s k r where p r r 1 2 n l s k r is the water allocation target not delivered for water user k under level r m3 thus the eq 1 can be simplified as 3 max f k 1 n u t k b k k 1 n u r 1 n l p r s k r c k s t w a r k 1 n u t k s k r r t k s k r 0 k r where w a r is the total available water under level r m3 from above description the itsp model can only solve problems of water resources allocation under one random variable however there are usually two or more main correlated hydrological random variables in real word problems for example in a two reservoir water supply systems the annual inflow volumes of these two reservoirs may be two correlated random variables in a single reservoir irrigation system the annual inflow volume of the reservoir and local annual rainfall volume may also be two correlated random variables in order to address regional water resources allocation under two correlated hydrological random variables a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method is proposed the flow diagram of cibsp method is shown in fig 1 there are several key steps set scenarios construct a bivariate joint distribution and create an interval bistochastic model which will be described in detail in the following sections 2 2 hydrological scenarios for each hydrological random variable a marginal probability distribution can be obtained through fitting the historical time series by an appropriate distribution then according to the marginal distribution a random variable can be divided into several levels by selected percentiles in china four percentiles used for dry wet year division are 12 5th 37 5th 62 5th and 87 5th thus these four percentiles are used to divide a hydrological random variable into five levels very low low medium high and very high the probabilities are 0 125 0 25 0 25 0 25 and 0 125 respectively the gamma distribution shape parameter and scale parameter are equal to 10 and 3 respectively is taken as example to show the principle of level division see fig 2 suppose the two hydrological random variables are x and y respectively after finishing division of the two variables let scenario i j represent the scenario when level i for variable x and level j for variable y occur at the same time since each variable has 5 levels there are 25 scenarios in total 2 3 bivariate joint distribution the copula is a function for capturing the dependence of two or more stochastic variables which was developed by sklar 1959 every joint distribution can be written in a copula and univariate marginal distributions thus the copula is chosen to construct the joint distribution of the two hydrological random variables in this study follow sklar s theorem the joint behavior of the two random variables x y with marginal distributions fx x and fy y can be characterized uniquely by a copula c given as follow 4 f x y x y c f x x f y y many different families of copulas with different linking functions have been proposed and described during the past few decades nelsen 2006 salvadori et al 2007 among all the families the archimedean copula family is found to be more suitable for hydrological series zhang and singh 2006 due to its simple structure and good performance in many applicaitons li et al 2013 the gumbel hougaard gh copula that is a member of archimedean copula family is the most commonly used for analyzing the dependence of hydrological variables karmakar and simonovic 2009 kong et al 2015 the gh copula is written as 5 c u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where u and v are cumulative distribution functions of the two stochastic variables respectively θ is the dependence parameter of gh copula which can range from 1 to among the methods used to estimate the dependence parameter the parameter estimation based on kendall s rank correlation coefficient is a sample and effective method to estimate dependence parameter of a binary copula when the two marginal distributions are known genest and rivest 1993 the relationship between dependence parameter of gh copula and kendall s rank correlation coefficient can be given as 6 τ 1 1 θ where τ is kendall s correlation coefficient between the two random variables 2 4 interval bistochastic model in order to address the uncertainty expressed as a bivariate joint distribution function an interval bistochastic model is developed by introducing bivariate joint distribution into two stage stochastic programming and interval parameter programming the model can be written as follow 7 max f k 1 k t k b k k 1 k p i j s k i j c k s t w a i j k 1 k t k s k i j i j t k s k i j 0 k i j where i is the index for level of variable x i 1 2 i i is the total number of scenarios of variable x j is the index for level of variable y j 1 2 j j is the total number of scenarios of variable y p i j is the probability of occurrence of scenario i j the situation when level i for variable x and level j for variable y occur at the same time with p i j 0 and p i j 1 s k i j is the water allocation target not delivered for water user k under scenario i j m3 w a i j is the total water available under scenario i j m3 other symbols have the same meaning as in eq 1 the interval bistochastic model can be transformed into two deterministic sub models by introducing a decision variable z k which correspond to the lower and upper bounds of the desired objective function value this transformation process is based on an interactive algorithm according to huang and loucks 2000 since the objective is to maximize the net system benefit the sub model corresponding to the upper bound objective function value is first determined as follows 8 max f k 1 k t k δ t k z k b k k 1 k p i j s k i j c k s t w a i j k 1 k t k δ t k z k s k i j i j t k δ t k z k s k i j 0 k i j 0 z k 1 k where δ t k t k t k s k i j and z k are decision variables suppose s k i j o p t z k o p t and f o p t are the solutions of the eq 8 then the sub model corresponding to lower bound can be presented as follows 9 max f k 1 k t k δ t k z k b k k 1 k p i j s k i j c k s t w a i j k 1 k t k δ t k z k s k i j i j t k δ t k z k s k i j 0 k i j where s k i j is decision variable assume s k i j o p t and f o p t are the solutions of the eq 9 thus solutions for the interval bistochastic model can be obtained as follows 10 f o p t f o p t f o p t t k o p t t k δ t k z k o p t k s k i j o p t s k i j o p t s k i j o p t k i j 3 case study 3 1 problem description the selected study area is the zhanghe irrigation district zid which is located in hubei province yangtze river basin of china see fig 3 this region has drawn international attention because it has been managed to sustain rice production with gradually decreasing agricultural water roost et al 2008 zhanghe reservoir is the mainly water source for agriculture municipality industry and hydropower in the zid in addition the zid can be divided into seven sub districts according to the administrative division see fig 3 in each sub district there are some small and medium reservoirs used for irrigation in this problem the water manager is responsible for allocating the available water from the zhanghe reservoir to three nonagricultural users municipality industry and hydropower and three main corps semi late rice winter rape and cotton in seven irrigated sub districts at annual scale because the zhanghe reservoir annual inflow volume zrai is a random variable it is hard to optimized the water allocation before the value of the inflow volume is known in addition agricultural water requirements are affected by annual rainfall volume in the irrigation district idar which also is a random variable moreover many socio economic parameters such as electricity price per capital water consumption crop prices and potential yield are also uncertain these factors lead to a number of challenging questions for optimal allocation of the available water such as i how to accurately describe the dependence of the two stochastic variables zrai and idar ii how to appropriately calculate agricultural water requirement targets under uncertainty of idar iii how to find an optimal allocation policy to obtain the maximum benefit with the minimal risk of violating the targets given the uncertainties of both zrai and idar and iv how to deal with the uncertainties of socio economic parameters 3 2 problem solution considering each aspect the problem can be solved by the cibsp method there are four main steps analyze marginal distributions of zrai and idar and set 25 scenarios construct a joint distribution of zrai and idar and analyze the probability of each scenario classify water users to agricultural users and non agricultural users and establish a suitable ibs model determine model parameter and solve the model 3 2 1 marginal distributions analysis given that the pearson type three distribution was the most suitable one for hydrologic variables such as rainfall and streamflow in china li et al 2013 it was applied to fit idar and zrai historical series which both have the length of 53 years the degree of fit can be evaluated by using a normal quantile quantile plot of residuals wilks 1993 fig 4 a and b demonstrate satisfactory good agreements between the fitted pearson type three distributions with idar with aic of 718 26 and zrai witth aic of 1274 45 historical series respectively with the data points primarily aligned on the 45 degree lines solid lines according to the fitted marginal probability distributions the idar and zrai were divided into five levels with corresponding probabilities based on the method presented in section 2 2 the results of level division are shown in table 1 3 2 2 construction of the joint distribution following the method presented in section 2 3 the gh copula was used to obtain the joint distribution of zrai and idar fig 4c shows the normal quantile quantile plot of fitting residuals by using gh copula which also illustrates a satisfactory degree of fit with aic of 986 38 let scenario i j represents the situation when rainfall level i for idar and inflow level j for zrai occur at the same time for example scenario medium medium represents both idar and zrai are under medium level according to the fitted joint probability distribution the probability under each scenario was obtained and is shown in table 2 it can be seen that there are 8 scenarios with probabilities of zero which indicates only 17 scenarios may occur 3 2 3 creation of the interval bistochastic model to allocate the available water from zhanghe reservoir to three non agricultural users and three crops in seven irrigated sub districts under uncertainties of zrai idar and socio economic parameters a suitable ibs model should be established given that agricultural water requirement targets are affected by idar the water users were classified into agricultural users and non agricultural users and irrigated area targets and water allocation targets were treated as first stage decision variables respectively chen et al 2017b the interval bistochastic model is given as follow 11 max f l 1 3 t n a l b n a l m 1 7 n 1 3 t a m n b a m n l 1 3 p i j s n a l i j c n a l m 1 7 n 1 3 p i j s a m n i

q m i is the available irrigation water from small and medium sized reservoirs in sub district m under rainfall level i m3 ηm is the overall project efficiency in sub district m ηrm is the conveyance efficiency of canal between the zhanghe reservoir and sub district m the model can be solved by the improved artificial bee colony algorithm developed by chen et al 2016 which can be realized in matlab 3 2 4 parameter determination and model solution there are many parameters that should be determined to run the established interval bistochastic model the available water from zhanghe reservoir under each inflow level was calculated by annual inflow minus water loss and is shown in table 3 crop irrigation quota under each rainfall level was obtained according to the irrigation test data in the zid table 4 table 4 also shows the available irrigation water from small and medium sized reservoirs in each sub district under each rainfall level which was obtained by analyzing historic rainfall inflow data table 5 shows the water allocation target benefit and penalty for each non agricultural user table 6 presents the irrigated area target benefit and penalty for each agricultural water user for each agricultural water user penalty mainly comes from the expense of cultivation when the promised irrigated area is not delivered therefore the penalty for a certain crop is assumed to the same for different sub districts the above targets of municipal industrial and agricultural users were estimated from the statistical analysis of historical records from 2010 to 2014 the lower bound was calculated from mean values minus the standard deviation and the upper bound was calculated from mean values plus the standard deviation for hydropower the lower bound of the target was set as the lowest environmental water demand in the downstream river and the upper bound was set as the water required for the maximum power generation of the power station the benefits and penalties are approximated from socio economic parameters such as water consumption perten thousand yuan industrial output value electricity price and per capita water consumption for non agricultural water users crop price potential yield and the expense of cultivation for agricultural water users in order to solve the eq 11 it was transformed into two deterministic sub models according to the method presented in section 2 4 then each sub model was solved by the improved artificial bee colony abc algorithm developed by chen et al 2016 the improved abc algorithm is an integration of original abc algorithm differential evolution de algorithm and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm because it absorbs the advantages of above three algorithms the improved abc algorithm has the characteristics of fast convergence high robustness and high accuracy the main steps are i initialize food sources ii send employed bees to explore food sources by using de strategy iii send onlooker bees to explore food sources by using neighborhood dithering strategy iv send the scout bee to discover a new food source by using pso strategy the parameters that have a great influence on the algorithm are total number of food sources limit parameter scaling factor crossover factor and study factor in this study they were set as 100 100 0 8 0 2 and 2 respectively 4 results analysis 4 1 optimal allocation target for water users in this study the water manager could set the water allocation target t n a l for each non agricultural user and irrigated area target t a m n for each crop in each sub district t n a l and t a m n can be determined by introducing allocation coefficients znal and zamn as decision variables when allocation coefficient approaches 1 high income could be obtained if the promised water object irrigated area is delivered but a high recourse cost might have to be paid if the water target irrigated area target is not satisfied when allocation coefficient approaches 0 a lower benefit can be gained when the water target irrigated area target is satisfied while a lower recourse cost should be paid if the promised water object irrigated area is not delivered optimal allocation coefficients and optimal targets are presented in table 7 it can be seen that optimal water allocation targets for municipality and industry are set as their upper bounds while the target for hydropower is much less than the upper bound the optimal irrigated area targets for winter rape and cotton in all the sub districts are set at their upper bounds while the optimal irrigated area targets for semi late rice are less than their upper bounds except in zhangheand dangyang the greater the optimal allocation coefficient the greater its priority for using water municipality and industry have the highest priorities due to their largest benefits and hydropower has the lowest priority due to least benefit for agriculture winter rape and cotton have higher priorities than semi late rice due to their lower irrigation quotas for different sub districts zhanghe and dangyang have higher priorities than other sub districts due to their larger benefits the optimal targets can provide a foundation to water manager for developing the water use plan under uncertainties 4 2 optimal water allocationfor non agricultural user if the available water cannot meet the regulated targets water shortages for non agricultural users would occur optimal water allocation for each non agricultural user under each scenario was obtained and corresponding water shortage was calculated by optimal target minus optimal water allocation fig 5 shows the water shortage ratio calculated by dividing optimal water shortage by optimal target for each non agricultural user under five typical scenarios the results are presented as interval values which reflect the uncertainties that exist as ambiguous intervals in this water allocation problem for municipality and industry with optimal allocation coefficients of 1 the promised water targets are satisfied and water shortages never occur under all the scenarios however the water shortage ratio for hydropower that has the relative small optimal allocation coefficient 0 68 is very large under all the scenarios except scenario very high very high scenario the results indicate that the larger the optimal allocation coefficient the less likelihood of water shortage for hydropower the lower bound and upper bound of water shortage are the same under scenarios very low very low low low and medium medium which is because only the minimum water requirement will be allocated for hydropower under these scenarios the optimal water allocationprovide a basis for optimally allocating water to non agricultural users after the occurrence of a certain scenario 4 3 optimal non irrigated area and irrigation water allocation for agricultural user if there is not enough water under a certain scenario part of the aimed irrigated area for some crops cannot be irrigated fig 6 demonstrates non irrigated area ratio that is calculated by dividing optimal area without irrigation by irrigated area target for each crop under five typical scenarios because all the aimed area can be irrigated under the high high and very high very high scenarios the figure does not depict the optimal area without irrigation under these two scenarios the results are also presented as interval values fig 6a presents the non irrigated area ratios under the very low very low scenarios for semi late rice both the lower bound and upper bound of non irrigated area ratio are very large in most sub districts for winter rape the lower bound is zero in all the sub districts while the upper bound is very large in most sub districts however both the lower bound and upper bound are zero in most sub districts for cotton the non irrigated area ratios under the scenario low low are shown in fig 6b for winter rape and cotton both the lower and upper bounds are zero which indicates the optimized area targets are satisfied in all the sub districts however for semi late rice the lower bound is zero in dongbao duodao dangyang and zhanghe while the upper bound in zhanghe is zero the results indicate the aimed area for semi late rice still cannot be irrigated in all the sub districts except in zh fig 6c illustrates the non irrigated area ratios under the scenario medium medium similarly the aimed area for winter rape and cotton can be irrigated in all the sub districts for semi late rice both the lower bound and upper bound are zero in dongbao duodao dangyang and zhanghe while the upper bound is still a little large in jingzhou shayang and zhongxiang from fig 6 it can be seen that the larger the optimal allocation coefficient of a certain water user the greater the likelihood of the target being satisfied for a same sub district such as zhongxiang the irrigated area targets of cotton and winter rape are satisfied under all the scenarios except very low very low scenario while non irrigated area ratio of semi late rice is very large under the three scenarios especially under the very low very low and low low scenarios for a same crop such as semi late rice the irrigated area target in zhanghe can be satisfied under all the scenarios except very low very low scenario while non irrigated area ratios in jingzhou shayang and zhongxiang are very large under the three scenarios that is because the itbs model can make a tradeoff between the benefits and penalties the actual irrigation water allocation for each sub district is decided by the irrigated area target non irrigated area and available water from small and medium sized reservoirs fig 7 demonstrates the optimal irrigation water to each sub district under different scenarios it can be seen that the actual water allocated to sy is the largest due to its highest irrigated area target for each sub district the actual allocated water increases with idar and zrai and usually reaches a peak when idar and zrai are both under medium level it then begins to decrease with increasing idar and zrai that is because there is not enough water allocated to agricultural users under the very low very low low low and medium medium scenarios while the irrigation water requirement is low under the high high and very high very high scenarios the above results provide a basis to water manager for optimally allocating water to agricultural users after the occurrence of a certain scenario 5 discussion to demonstrate the benefit of considering the joint distribution of zrai and idar the following two hypothetical situations were analyzed a independence hypothetical situation idar and zrai are independent li et al 2009 b linear relationship hypothetical situation there is linear relationship between idar and zrai chen et al 2017a 2017b the probabilities under these two hypothetical situations are shown in table 8 which are very different from that in the case study see table 2 additionally it can be seen that the probabilities of all 25 scenarios are not equal to zero which indicates that each scenario is likely to occur under independence hypothetical situation however the probabilities of only five scenarios are not equal to zero which indicates only these five scenarios may occur under linear relationship hypothetical situation the optimal allocation coefficients under the two hypothetical situations are shown in table 9 although optimal targets for municipality industry winter rape and cotton under the two assumed situations are the same with that in the case study see table 7 the optimal targets for hydropower and semi late rice are very different for independence hypothetical situation the optimal target for hydropower is lower while the optimal targets for semi late rice in most sub districts are higher than thatin the case study that is because it underestimates the total probability of scenarios very low very low low very low medium very low very low low low low medium low very low medium low medium and medium medium under which the target for semi late rice is not satisfied therefore it then underestimates the penalty caused by optimal target not satisfied for semi late rice in addition the independent situation underestimates the probability of scenario very high very high under which the target for hydropower is only satisfied therefore it then overestimates the penalty caused by optimal target not satisfied for hydropower for linear relationship hypothetical situation the optimal target for hydropower is higher while the optimal targets for semi late rice in most sub districts are lower than that under the actual situation that is because it overestimates the total probability of above nine scenarios and overestimates the probability of the scenario very high very high the optimal schemes from the two hypothetical situations are not suitable for guiding the development of water use plan thus an appropriate description of the joint probability of idar and zrai by using cibsp method is important for water resources allocation in zid under uncertainty this study is based on a research program named the efficient utilization mechanism of water resources in irrigation district that is sponsored by national natural science foundation of china the cibsp method is mainly proposed to address uncertainties of annual inflow volume of the key water source and local annual rainfall volume in irrigation district the methodology can be applied to optimize water allocation between different crops under uncertainties in an irrigation district which satisfies the following conditions i there is only one key irrigation water source and the historical data of annual inflow volume of the water source can be obtained ii rainfall can be considered to be uniform in the irrigated district and the historical data of rainfall can be obtained iii socio economic parameters can be expressed as interval numbers the optimized water allocation plan can help to improve net benefit in the irrigation district in addition the cibsp can also be applied to a two source urban water supply system in which the two inflows are correlated hydrological random variables although cibsp method can solve some certain problems there are still research questions to be addressed in the case study the aimed area for each crop is considered to be either full irrigation or no irrigation which may underestimate the benefit because sometimes a larger area with inadequate irrigation is more productive than a smaller area with full irrigation in addition the cibsp method only considers two common uncertainties existing in the water resources management which are expressed as probability density functions and ambiguous intervals however there are other uncertainties such as fuzzy information which can neither be determined as an exact number nor an interval number other methods should be introduced to tackle this uncertainty such as fuzzy programming mousavi et al 2004 srivastava and singh 2015 and robust programming li et al 2011 watkins and mckinney 1997 moreover the continuous random variables are simplified into five levels to deal with uncertainties expressed as probability density functions which may result in loss of information of random variables furthermore the socio economic parameters such as benefits and penalties have a great impact on the results however it is hard to estimate these parameters in many actual management problems which hinders the application of the cibsp method the above issues should be addressed in the further research 6 conclusions this study proposes a couple based interval bistochastic programming cibsp method to deal with uncertainties in water allocation the method consists of two core modules the joint distribution analysis and the interval bivariate stochastic model the copula that has the ability to capture the dependence of mutiple stochastic variables is selected to model the joint probability distribution of two hydrological random variables in water resources allocation by incorporating two stage stochastic programming interval parameter programming and bivariate joint distribution the interval bistochastic model can not only deal with the uncertainties expressed as interval parameters but can also address the uncertainty expressed as a bivariate joint distribution function the cibsp method was applied to the zhanghe irrigation district to optimally allocate the available water from zhanghe reservoir to municipality industry hydropower and three crops in seven irrigated sub districts the optimal targets can provide a foundation to water manager for developing the water allocation schemeunder uncertainty the optimal water allocation for non agricultural user and irrigation water allocation for agricultural user provide a basis for optimally allocating available water after the occurrence of a certain scenario in addition the difference in the resultsbetween the two hypothetical situations and the case study which have different joint probability under each scenario demonstrates that it is helpful to analyze the joint distribution of the inflow and rainfall before water allocation conflict of interest no conflict of

11074,the additions of biochar and inorganic fertiliser to agricultural soils have been reported to enhance soil fertility and crop production under rainfed and irrigation conditions however it is unclear how biochar improve the growth yield irrigation and crop water use efficiency of a field grown maize under deficit irrigation the objective of this study is to determine the main and interactive effects of biochar and fertiliser on the maize growth yield crop water use efficiency cwue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue under deficit irrigation which has been scarcely studied therefore a field experiment which consisted of factorial combination of irrigation 100 full irrigation fi 80 fi and 60 fi biochar 0 and 20 t ha and fertiliser 0 and 300 kg ha was conducted over two growing seasons the 100 fi 80 of fi and 60 of fi received 1 0 8 and 0 6 of the estimated irrigation need required to bring the soil water to field capacity respectively effect of the soil amendments were determined on the crop evapotranspiration water use soil hydrophysical and chemical properties maize growth parameters were determined weekly while the yield components were determined at harvest results showed that the application of the soil amendments improved the soil hydro physical chemical properties and water use by maize plant which consequently resulted in increased maize growth yield iwue and cwue under all irrigation treatments combined addition of the soil amendments gave significant p 0 05 improvement on the maize grain yield biomass yield cwue and iwue compared to the unamnded plot in all irrigation treatments also insignificant interaction occurred between biochar and irrigation on maize productivities therefore amending soil with biochar under limited water supply might be a novel approach for enhancing maize yield and water use efficiencies by minimizing the negative impact of drought stress keywords soil amendments soil fertility hydrophysical properties maize water use maize productivity water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity and poor soil fertility have been identified as the two critical factors affecting crop production particularly in the tropics li 2009 ray et al 2013 therefore there is increasing demand for scientist to evolve strategies that will improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil in areas of low soil fertility improve water retention in the soil as well as improve water use efficiency by the plants oki and kanae 2006 one widely agreed management option with this 3 prong functions is the amendment of the soil with biochar oguntunde et al 2004 lehmann and joseph 2009 ajayi et al 2016 biochar is pyrolysed biomass produced for the purpose of amending agricultural soils bridgwater 2003 sohi et al 2010 adding biochar to the soil has been shown to modify some physical properties of the soil such as bulk density porosity texture and particle size distribution thus impacting the soil structure the modification in these soil physical properties might be attributed to the physical dilution of the biochar with soil oguntunde et al 2004 ajayi et al 2016 this affects important soil functions such as infiltration hydraulic conductivity water holding capacity aeration redox potential and therefore plant growth and yield glaser et al 2002 atkinson et al 2010 biederman and harpole 2013 jeffery et al 2011 ajayi et al 2016 notably biochar addition improves soil water retention and available water capacity novak et al 2009a ajayi and horn 2016 this is commonly observed in coarse textured soils or soils with large amounts of macropores although the amount of biochar often required to enhance water retention is high and vary with soil type glaser et al 2002 addition of biochar to soils also reported to enhance the soil chemical properties laird et al 2010 van et al 2010 it improves the soil cation exchange capacity ph and reduce nutrient leaching and thus improve fertility and nutrient use efficiency chan et al 2007 the ability of the biochar to retain soil nutrients and improve water holding capacity of soil may have direct effects on increasing crop yield and water use efficiency this is because soil amendment with biochar may consequently retain more water from irrigation and also reduce the frequency of irrigation hence sustaining and optimizing the limited water available for crop production in addition to soil amendment different innovative strategies to improve cwue yield per unit area divided by crop evapotranspiration during the growing season t ha mm and iwue yield per unit area divided by total amount of water applied t ha mm of maize zea mays l which is an important economic crop commonly grown have been proposed these include deficit irrigation di strategies and fertilization deficit irrigation practices are used to sustain crop productivity under reduced water application oktem 2008 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 karimi and gomrokchi 2011 by improving soil water extraction by plant roots this is because full irrigation fi practice is considered as water luxury which is not sustainable in water limited environment crop management practices such as application of fertiliser has been reported to improve water use efficiency of maize dawe et al 2000 ogola et al 2002 regmi et al 2002 these researchers attributed the improvement in water use efficiency of maize after fertilization to reduction in evaporation due to concomitant increase in leaf area index lai in both rainfed and irrigated conditions although biochar amendment has been shown to improve water retention its standalone and integrative effects with inorganic fertiliser on the growth yield iwue and cwue of maize has not been well documented under deficit irrigation in a field study moreover there are still some clear knowledge gap on how biochar improve the growth yield iwue and cwue of maize under any form of irrigation particularly with the practice of deficit irrigation strategy in a field soil recently there has been an increase in the use of integrated approaches of applying biochar and fertiliser to improve crops yield and irrigation water use efficiency in order to alleviate the problems of inadequate water supply drought and poor soil fertility uzoma et al 2011 akhtar et al 2014 agbna et al 2017 many of the aforementioned studies determined the effects of biochar amendment on the productivities and irrigation water use efficiency of different crops under greenhouse conditions uzoma et al 2011 agbna et al 2017 and in pot experiments akhtar et al 2014 the effect of biochar on water use crop evapotranspiration and crop water use efficiency of maize have not been documented under control environment green house and in field experiments using irrigation to date there is dearth information on the effects of biochar on the yield irrigation and crop water use efficiency of maize particularly in a field study under deficit irrigation therefore we hypothesised that the integration of irrigation with soil amendments biochar and fertiliser could improve the iwue and cwue of maize under deficit irrigation of a field soil moreso it appears that the interaction effects between biochar and deficit irrigation has not yet been documented for maize grown in a field soil in order to grow maize successfully with biochar where water resources is limiting thus the objective of the study is to investigate the main and interactive effects of biochar and fertiliser applications on the growth yield iwue and cwue of a field grown maize under drip irrigation the mechanism by which biochar improve yield irrigation and crop water use efficiency of crops are poorly understood under deficit irrigation in a field soil therefore we tested our hypothesis by estimating i the effects of biochar when applied alone and when combined with fertiliser on the water use crop evapotranspiration of maize in a field experiment and ii determine the improvement of hydro physical and chemical properties of an acidic field soil when biochar was applied in comparison to the unamended soil 2 materials and methods the field experiments were conducted during dry season of 2017 february may and 2017 2018 november february at the teaching and research farm 7 16 n 5 13 e of the department of agricultural and environmental engineering federal university of technology akure nigeria the averages of weather parameter over the study site during the experimental period is given in table 1 soil texture up to the 60 cm depth at the experimental site is sandy clay loam table 2 according to soil survey staff 2006 and the available water is about 102 42 mm the available water aw was calculated as the difference between water held at field capacity and permanent wilting point below the 60 cm depth the site is characterised by a hard pan which could limit root development and water extraction the field capacity was determined in the field when the ceramic tip tensiometer irrometer inc reading was 10 kpa according to marcos et al 2009 for predominantly sandy soils while the permanent wilting point was derived from previous study at the experimental site fasinmirin et al 2014 the van genuchten 1980 model eq 1 which is widely used for soil water retention curve was used for the calibration of soil water content with the soil water potential tensiometer readings at 0 10 20 30 40 50 65 70 and 75 kpa for the experimental soil table 2 before planting maize in order to schedule irrigation the soil tension could not read beyond 80 kpa in the predominantly sandy field soil marcos et al 2009 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m where θ cm3 cm3 is the measured soil water content θr is residual water content cm3 cm3 θs is saturated water content cm3 cm3 α cm 1 n and m are the van genuchten parameters respectively while ψ is the logarithm of soil water tension the van genuchten model was fitted using matlab software version 2013 2 1 biochar production and characterisation the process of obtaining maize cob residues and chemical characterisation of the maize cob residue biochar has been described in our previous paper faloye et al 2017 the maize cob residues was pyrolysed at 500 c with the heating rate of 2 08 c min a residence time of 1 h using a fixed bed batch type pyrolysis system was maintained the biochar was ground into smaller fraction in a metallic box using a sledge hammer the chemical properties according to the international biochar initiative ibi 2011 procedures are presented in table 3 the soil physico chemical properties at soil depth of 0 20 cm are also presented in table 3 the biochar bulk density was determined by standard method astm e873 2013 a standard sampling core was filled with samples and compressed such that biochar occupy the volume of the cylinder the core lid was carefully closed and biochar was oven dried at 105 c to a constant weight cooled and weighed the bulk density was calculated by dividing the mass of the oven dried biochar by the volume of the core the biochar particle size distribution was determined using sieves of 2 mm using sieve shaking machine model number 62 020 sieves of sizes 2 0 95 0 05 0 003 0 002 and 0 0015 mm were used for biochar size distribution the portion of biochar retained by the 2 mm sieve was not included in the size distribution analysis since biochar 2 mm was not used to amend the field soil the biochar sizes used in the experiment was classified into macro pore 0 05 2 mm meso pore 0 002 0 05 mm and micro pore 0 002 mm 2 2 field experimentation a 40 m x 40 m portion of the farm was ploughed and harrowed for effective seed bed formation thirty six seed beds measuring 2 2 m wide 2 5 m long each with 0 6 m intra spacing and 0 9 m inter spacing formed the drip irrigation field the biochar material in application rates of 0 and 20 t ha was incorporated into the top 0 2 m and was evenly mixed with the soil at the different rates manually these low application rates were comparable with that of ndor et al 2015 and major et al 2010 and was reported appropriate and effective for increased maize production in a sandy soil that is nutrient deficient an improved maize seeds zea mays l variety suwan 1 sr were manually sown on february 13th 2017 and november 7th 2017 three maize seeds were sown per hole and thinned to two plants 2 weeks after planting the plant population in this experiment is close to the recommended plants population of 53 333 by iita 2014 which is obtainable with plant spacing of 50 cm by 75 cm npk fertiliser was only applied once a week after planting using the ring method the npk fertiliser was applied in combination with the biochar inorder to investigate the effectiveness of biochar made from maize cob residues to retain the nutrient supplied by the npk fertiliser under deficit irrigation especially in a predominantly sandy soil which is associated with prolific leaching used in this study the treatments consisted of two levels of biochar 0 and 20 t ha two levels of inorganic fertiliser npk 0 and 300 kg ha 15 15 15 and three irrigation treatments 100 80 and 60 full irrigation treatment fit which was factorially combined together to form a total of eleven 11 treatments and a control unamended table 4 replicated three times forming a total of 36 plots in both growing seasons full and deficit irrigation were imposed after planting maize the inorganic fertiliser used for the experiment is a water soluble compound fertiliser with brand name golden fertiliser produced in nigeria the experimental design was 3 2 x 2 full factorial combination of irrigation fertiliser and biochar replicated 3 times and arranged in a strip plot design irrigation treatments were arranged orthogonally to fertiliser only biochar only biochar fertiliser and no biochar no fertiliser which were applied as strips biochar at application rate of 20 t ha was incorporated into the 20 cm x 40 cm x 20 cm pit before planting maize which is equivalent to 7 4 g kg 1 of biochar to soil mass ratio the biochar mixing rates were calculated based on the soil depth and bulk density values of 20 cm and 1 35 g cm3 irrigation water was pumped from a reservoir into two over head connected tanks by means of a surface pump installed at about 200 m away from the experimental field the over head tanks consisted of 2000 l capacity each positioned at a height of 2 m above the ground level irrigation water from the overhead tanks was delivered to the field through drip laterals connected to the submain pipes by gravity and control valve connected to the main pipe was used to regulate the flow of water the drip lateral was made of polyethylene material 13 mm diameter and 0 6 m emitter spacing with an average discharge of 0 71 l h at operational pressure of 20kpa pre planting irrigation was carried out to bring the crop root zone to field capacity so as to promote germination and early crop establishment the unamended soil and soil biochar mixture bulk density total porosity and water holding capacity was determined in triplicate at 14 days after mixing biochar with soil in both growing seasons before this time other field operations were being carried out the water holding capacity determined at soil water tension of 0 10 50 and 75 kpa at the different soil depth 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were selected among other tension reading since it investigate the effectiveness of biochar in improving the soil whc at saturation field capacity moderately stress and severely stressed level of soil water the installed ceramic tip tensiometers irrometer inc were used for the soil water tension measurements with the tensiometer reading ranging from 0 100 kpa because of the small range of soil water tension we could not establish the soil water retention curve up to the wilting point for soil at the experimental site the unamended soil and soil biochar mixture water content at saturation 0 kpa was used for the determination total porosity tp ratio of volume of water occupied by pore to the total volume of the core and bulk density the cores are 5 cm in diameter and 20 cm in height core samples were put in the oven at 105 c for 24 h to obtain the dry mass of samples to determine the water holding capacity thereafter the bulk density was calculated by dividing the oven dry mass by volume of the core 5 cm diameter and 20 cm height blake and hartage 1986 after planting maize each plot was scheduled to be irrigated to field capacity fc when about 50 of fc has been depleted this 0 5 fc served as the maximum allowable deficiency mad before irrigation in this study in the full irrigation treatment of the unamended plot therefore maize plant was then irrigated when the difference between the tensiometer reading threshold before irrigation and tensiometer daily reading is within 5 similar to the approach of gheysari et al 2015 the tensiometer reading threshold before irrigation was 62 kpa the ceramic tip tensiometers irrometer inc were installed at the depths 20 40 and 60 cm in the unamended control plots for the scheduling readings from the tensiometers installed at 20 and 40 cm soil depth were used for scheduling irrigation at the seedling 0 20 dap and vegetative growth stages 21 45 dap while readings from the tensiometer installed at the 60 cm depth was used for scheduling irrigation for the remaining growth stages i e flowering grain filling and maturity 46 77 dap since the maize plant root increases with day after planting or stages of growth this approach of scheduling irrigation at 20 cm soil depth during seedling growth stage and at deeper soil depth remaining growing stages is in agreement with the report of gheysari et al 2015 in scheduling irrigation when to apply water van genuchten 1980 soil water calibration model between the soil water content and tensiometer readings which had already been established for soil at the experimental site before the commencement of the experiments was used for the determination of the tensiometer reading at 50 of field capacity fc at the different soil depth 20 40 and 60 cm in the full irrigation treatment 100 fi 100 amount of water required to bring the soil water to field capacity was applied when about 50 fc has been depleted in the unamended plot while in the deficit irrigation treatment that is 80 and 60 fi water was applied on the same day as the full irrigation treatment but the irrigation depth was reduced to 80 and 60 of the full irrigation equal amount of water was applied to all biochar fertiliser and unamended plots according to irrigation treatments similar to the approach of akhtar et al 2014 to determine the duration of irrigation ta during each irrigation event the gross irrigation irg was determined by dividing the irrigation amounts ia by the irrigation application efficiency ea the irrigation amount ia i e the volume of irrigation water applied in litres l per irrigation event was calculated from eq 2 2 i a w a i where wa is the wetted area m2 by emitters and i is irrigation mm irrigation application efficiency of 80 was used asae 1990 the irrigation application efficiency account possible losses between the tank and emitters thus the ta was calculated using eq 3 3 t a i r g n p q 0 5 where ta is the duration of irrigation per event h np is number of emitter s per plant irg l is the gross irrigation and q is the emitter discharge l h in this study one emitter was used per two plants therefore we used a factor of 0 5 to multiply np soil water contents were determined gravimetrically on biweekly basis during the growing season at depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm in the replicates of each treatment the gravimetric water content obtained were converted to volumetric water content by multiplying them by the bulk density of the soil at the respective layer the volumetric water content obtained in each layer was multiplied by the depth of each soil layer in order to convert the soil water contents to depth basis mm the total crop evapotranspiration et was estimated in each of the treatments using the soil water balance ogola et al 2002 igbadun 2012 eq 4 4 e t p i c d r w i 1 w i where et is total crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm determined at the experimental site with the use of installed manual rain gauges c is capillarity i is the irrigation amount mm which was applied to bring the soil water to field capacity d is deep percolation mm which was assumed negligible r is the runoff mm and wi 1 wi is the change in soil water storage mm determined based on the difference in soil water content between two successive measurements in the soil depth of 0 60 cm in the replicates of each treatment the wi and wi 1 are the first and next successive soil water contents respectively deep percolation was assumed to be negligible since the experiment was carried out in the dry season characterized by little or no rainfall and drainage below the root zone was considered negligible under drip irrigation the contribution from ground water due to capillarity was ignored because the ground water table was deeper than 60 cm to determine possible runoff from the unamended plot a runoff collector described in igbadun 2012 was installed the philip s two term equation was used to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k using mini disc infiltrometer the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soil was calculated using the method of zhang 1997 the method requires measuring the cumulative infiltration versus time and fitting the results with the infiltration function eq 5 the volume of water at regular time intervals 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 and 300 s as the water infiltrates were recorded at 2 cm suction rate the soil suction rate of 2 cm used in this study is in accordance with the recommendation of zhang 1997 5 i c 1 t c 2 t 1 2 where i is infiltration t is time in seconds c1 is related to hydraulic conductivity m s c2 is soil sorptivity mms 1 2 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil k q mm h was computed using the relationship in eq 6 6 k q c 1 a where c1 is the slope of the curve of the cumulative infiltration versus the square root and a is a value relating the van genuchten parameters for a given soil type to the suction rate and radius of the infiltrometer disc which is computed using the equation eq 7 given below 7 a 11 65 n 0 1 exp 7 5 1 9 n α h 0 α r 0 0 91 n 1 9 where n and α are the van genuchten parameters for the soil table 2 for the 0 20 cm soil depth r0 is the disc radius and h0 is the suction at the disc surface the radius of the disc was 2 25 cm soil sorptivity to water sw was determined from the slope of the cumulative infiltration i vs square root of time t using eq 8 8 i s w t the average plant height number n of leaves per stand length l and width w of leaves from 4 selected maize plants per plot were monitored on weekly basis at the centre of the middle row in each plot the leaf area la was calculated following the procedure of stewart and dwyer 1999 by multiplying the length of leaf by the widest width and by a factor 0 743 eq 9 9 la l w 0 743 the leaf area index lai was computed by dividing the total leaf area la of the maize plants by the land area occupied by the maize plants equal plot size of each replicate at maturity all maize plants were hand harvested to determine the grain yield the maize plants were also cut at the ground level in each plot to determine the biomass yield stem leaves tassel and maize cob residue the maize plants were conveyed to the laboratory for curing until the biomass was dried and the maize grain had attained 13 5 on dry basis the dry matters were then weighed and the maize cob residue yield in each plot was measured separately since the quantification productivity of the maize cob residue would provide information about its further reuse for biochar production which would largely depend on its response to biochar and fertiliser applications under irrigation the efficiency terms cwue and iwue were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of fertiliser and biochar amendments under drip irrigation the cwue and iwue were determined using eqs 10 and 11 kijne et al 2003 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 howell 2006 10 c w u e y i e l d t h a e t m m 11 i w u e g r a i n y i e l d t o t a l w a t e r a p p l i e d 2 3 statistical analysis t test analyses was used to compare the means of unamended soil total porosity bulk density and water holding capacity with that of soil biochar mixture one way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the means of the maize growth parameters yield components iwue and cwue between the unamended plot and the amended plot in each of the irrigation treatment at 5 significance level using tukey s test the maize growth parameters plant height number of leaves la lai yield components iwue and cwue were analyzed by full factorial analysis of variance anova using tukey s test at 5 level of significance a three way anova was used to test for main and interactive effects of irrigation biochar addition and fertilizer addition on growth components and yield components two way anova was used to test for the interaction effects between biochar and fertiliser fertiliser and irrigation as well as biochar and irrigation on the growth parameters and yield parameters all the data were analysed using minitab version 17 minitab inc 3 results 3 1 biochar particle size distribution and the effect of biochar on soil physical properties bulk density total porosity and water holding capacity whc the average yield of maize cob residue biochar recovered by weight was about 26 of the biomass used the percentage of the biochar particle sizes were 25 79 56 50 and 14 39 for biochar particle size 0 05 0 002 0 05 and 0 002 mm respectively average bulk density significantly p 0 05 decreased with increase in the rate of biochar amendment table 5 using t test the highest bulk density was 1 35 g cm3 for the unamended plot and decreasing to 1 25 g cm3 in the biochar amended plot this imply that the bulk density decreased by 7 4 in soil treated with biochar compared to the unamended plot compared to the unamended plot the addition of biochar to the field soil insignificantly p 0 05 increase the soil porosity by 3 81 using t test the van genuchten model predicted the soil water content well table 2 with r2 ranging from 0 92 to 0 97 in the sandy clay loam soil the range of soil tension 0 75 kpa used for the calibration of soil water tension with the soil water content might be responsible for the negative value predicted for θr the residual volumetric water content represents the volumetric water content of a soil where further increase in soil water tension does not produce significant changes in water content which can be better predicted when higher tension is considered biochar amendment also improved the water holding capacity whc at soil water tension of 0 10 50 and 75 kpa as illustrated in table 6 the soil water holding capacity also insignificantly p 0 05 increased with increase the amount of added biochar the percentage increase in whc with respect to soil water tensions of 0 10 50 and 75 kpa ranged from 3 58 to 8 70 3 2 effects of biochar and fertiliser on soil hydrological properties unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity in both growing seasons the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k q was insigniﬁcantly affected by the biochar and fertiliser application rates p 0 05 table 7 the k q mean values ranged from 19 40 mm h for f300b20 to 31 00 mm h for the b0f0 in 2017 growing season while the mean values ranged from 25 00 mm h for f300b20 to 34 60 mm h for the b0f0 in 2017 18 growing season on average relative to the k q of the control 32 79 mm h f300b0 f0b20 f300b20 treatments reduced the k q by 9 6 28 24 and 32 64 respectively table 7 in both growing seasons the soil water sorptivity sw was signiﬁcantly p 0 05 affected by the combined applications of biochar and fertiliser table 8 the sw mean values ranged from 0 54 mm s1 2 for f300b20 to 0 74 mm s1 2 for the b0f0 based on the average values of both seasons on average relative to the sw of the control 0 82 mm s1 2 f300b0 f0b20 f300b20 treatments reduced the sw by 9 75 20 73 and 34 15 respectively table 8 3 3 influence of biochar and fertiliser on soil water content the changes in soil water content with respect to dap is shown in fig 1 a and b soil treated with biochar enhanced the soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil depth compared to the unamended plot the depletion caused by fertiliser application in the root zone of maize was reduced when biochar and fertiliser were applied together thus higher value of soil water content were recorded when biochar and fertiliser were applied together compared to water content obtained in treatment plot were only fertiliser was applied application of biochar improved the soil water content compare to the unamended plot 3 4 main and interactive effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation on maize growth components the maize plants responded positively to both biochar fertiliser and irrigation applications for averaged plant height number of leaves stand leaf area and leaf area index measured during the growing seasons tables 9 and 10 biochar fertiliser and irrigation main effects on average plant height number of leaves stand leaf area and leaf area index were highly significant p 0 05 the lowest maize lai was recorded in the unamended plot under the irrigation treatments in both growing seasons the plant height number of leaves leaf area and leaf area index serve as important indices that directly reﬂect the growth of the maize plants the growth parameters were signiﬁcantly p 0 05 increased with increase in irrigation biochar and fertiliser applications but interactions between the three factors fertiliser x biochar x irrigation were not signiﬁcant also there was no significant p 0 05 interaction effect of irrigation x biochar biochar x fertiliser and fertiliser x irrigation on ph nl la and lai the tallest plant with the greatest number of leaves leaf area and leaf area index were obtained at the f300b20i100 while the lowest was obtained at the f0b0i60 treatment with least irrigation with no biochar and fertiliser applications in both growing seasons 3 5 main and interactive effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation on maize yield components biochar and fertiliser applications also increased the yield components grain biomass and maize cob yield of maize over the control tables 11 and 12 in all the irrigation treatments in both growing seasons the highest yield component was recorded at f300b20i100 while the lowest was recorded in treatment f0b0i60 the highest yield components was recorded in each irrigation treatment where biochar and fertiliser were applied together and the lowest yield components were obtained in the unamended plot of each irrigation treatment during the 2017 growing season maize grain biomass and cob yield ranged from 3 88 to 6 35 t ha 11 76 to 17 57 t ha and 3 65 to 4 95 t ha respectively in the 100 fit in the 80 fit the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 3 75 to 6 00 t ha 11 33 to 17 24 t ha and 3 31 to 4 75 t ha respectively also in 60 fit maizee grain biomass and cob yield ranged from 2 57 to 3 75 t ha 7 20 to 11 33 t ha and 1 98 to 4 14 t ha respectively in the 2017 2018 growing season the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 3 85 to 5 24 t ha 6 06 to 10 35 t ha and 2 55 to 3 39 t ha respectively for 100 fit for 80 fit the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 3 70 to 4 92 t ha 3 73 to 10 27 t ha and 2 09 to 3 37 t ha respectively also in 60 fit the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 2 53 to 4 34 t ha 2 13 to 7 62 t ha and 1 11 to 3 15 t ha respectively in all higher yields were obtained in 2017 growing season compared to the 2017 18 growing season this might be as a result of higher precipitation that accompany the 2017 growing season experiment under all irrigation treatments in both growing seasons combined addition of biochar and fertiliser led to a signiﬁcant increase p 0 05 in the grain biomass and maize cob yield in relation to the unamended plot in all the irrigation treatments although there were no signiﬁcant diﬀ erences p 0 05 in the grain of maize plants grown under soil treated with biochar alone compared to the unamended plot in both growing seasons insigniﬁcant interactive eﬀ ects p 0 05 were observed for biochar x irrigation and the three way interaction of biochar fertilizer irrigation on grain yield in the 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons also effects of the irrigation treatments without soil amendment on grain yield is represented table 13 the result of the analysis showed that there is no significant difference between maize yield at 100 and 80 fit which implies that 20 of irrigation water could be saved to irrigate additional land the significant main effect p 0 05 for the factors and insigniﬁcant interactive eﬀ ects p 0 05 observed for biochar fertilizer biochar x irrigation and the three way interaction of biochar fertilizer irrigation on grain yield in the 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons imply that where water is limited biochar could be added to soil to improve the maize yield and minimize the impact of drought stress 3 6 effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation on maize water use iwue and cwue in 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons the addition of biochar and fertiliser increased the et of maize compared to the unamended plot additional increase in the et was observed when biochar and fertiliser were applied together in all the irrigation treatments 100 fit 80 fit and 60 fit tables 14 and 15 the negative change in storage shows that the soil water content at planting was higher than soil water content at harvest the main effect of irrigation and fertiliser were significant on the crop water use while the biochar application effect was not significant on the crop water use by the maize plant in both growing seasons 2017 and 2017 2018 the iwue and cwue increased with biochar and fertiliser applications p 0 05 tables 16 and 17 under all irrigation treatments significant increase p 0 05 were observed for the combined addition of biochar and fertiliser on iwue and cwue compared to the unamended plot in all irrigation treatments including the water stressed treatments the main effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation were significant p 0 05 on the iwue and cwue insigniﬁcant interactive eﬀ ects p 0 05 were observed for two factor interaction of biochar fertilizer biochar irrigation as well as the three factors interaction of the three factors on iwue and cwue in both growing seasons 3 7 effect of biochar on soil chemical properties and soil organic matter som the averaged data of the soil chemical properties 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons determined at harvest showed that application of biochar and fertiliser improved the soil chemical at harvest table 18 there was additional increase when biochar and fertiliser were applied together compared to standalone application of biochar fertiliser and compared to the control the biochar application significantly p 0 05 increased the soil ph som and cec compared to the control plot the increase in the soil ph might be attributed to the liming effect of the biochar used 4 discussion several meta analysis and reviews have documented the modification of some physical chemical and hydrological properties of biochar amended soil such as bulk density texture particle size distribution total porosity cec n p k and ph they further described the consequences of these changes on the hydraulic behaviour of the substrates such infiltration water retention hydraulic conductivity and among others laghari et al 2015 liu et al 2017 this field study similarly confirms some of the findings and further provides insight into how some of these changes improves maize production and efficient water use by maize plant under full and limited water conditions 4 1 biochar production by weight particle size distribution and impact of biochar on the soil physical properties bulk density and porosity the average biochar yield of 26 was recovered in this study which is close to the values of 20 and 33 5 yield of biochar made from pine sawdust through a fast pyrolysis at 400 c reported by desisto et al 2010 biochar yield quantity and quality depends on the production conditions heating rate pyrolysis temperature residence time and the biomass used demirbas 2004 also reported that biochar yield vary with the size of biomass the fine biochar particles obtained in this study might be as a result of biomass used and production conditions sohi et al 2009 reported that wood based feed stocks generate biochars that are coarser and predominantly xylemic in nature while biochars from crop residues rye and maize and manures offer a finer and more brittle structure therefore the fine particle of biochar used in this study contributed to the alteration of the soil physical and chemical properties the decrease in bulk density in biochar amended treatments could be related to physical dilution effects of the biochar the magnitude of the decrease in bulk density correlates to the amount of added biochar particularly owing to the texture and characteristic of the added biochar ajayi and horn 2016 in our study the significant p 0 05 decrease in the bulk density observed upon biochar addition may be premised on the amount and the low bulk density of the added biochar see table 3 njoku et al 2015 observed that the decrease in bulk density was not significant p 0 05 at biochar application rates of 5 10 and 15 t ha in predominantly sandy soil the result of our study corroborate the findings of sun et al 2013 who reported significant decrease in soil bulk density upon biochar addition at 20 t ha when the application rate is higher the dilution effect of the biochar is stronger due to its relatively lower bulk density compared to soil mineral particles lehmann et al 2011 moreover highly stable organic carbon is expected to reduce soil bulk density and thus increase total soil porosity biochar pyrolysis conditions such as heating rate and pyrolysis temperature determine the stability of organic carbon in soil after biochar addition the increase in soil porosity observed in this study upon biochar addition corroborate the findings of several researchers jones et al 2011 karhu et al 2011 dempster et al 2012 the increase in the total porosity observed in this study might be as a result of finer particles of biochar added to the coarse field soil which is predominantly sandy 4 2 impact of the soil amendments on soil hydraulic hydrological properties the van genuchten parameters n and α values obtained for the calibration of soil water tension with the soil water content is close to the values reported by carsel and parrish 1988 for sandy clay loam soil the low whc of the field soil used in this experiment was probably due to low soil organic matter and coarse texture predominantly sandy the particle size of the biochar was finer in size with highest texture in the mesopore range 2 50 μm after the biochar amendment of the field soil the fine particles of the biochar probably filled the pore spaces of the field soil hence the biochar addition insignificantly p 0 05 increased the whc of the field soil several researchers jones et al 2011 laird et al 2010 uzoma et al 2011 have reported alterations in whc and water retention in biochar amended soils with as low as 0 5 g g biochar application rate however the response is biochar and soil specific briggs et al 2012 reported that biochar amended plot improve whc by 4 2 compared to the unamended plot with the application rate of 0 5 g g in a laboratory experiment which is within the range of whc improvement reported in this study sun et al 2013 also reported improvement of biochar amended soil whc in a field experiment similar improvement in whc in our field study in the biochar amended soil resulted in higher amount of water use by maize plants meanwhile the biochar reduced soil k q prevent rapid movement of water into the soil and also improved whc of the field soil hence it resulted in increased water use by the maize plant under biochar amended soils due to the increased in the water use by the crop savings of irrigation water and higher crop yields were recorded in the biochar amend soils compared to the unamended plot soil hydraulic conductivity primarily governs the soil water movement and retention bodner et al 2013 compared to other soil textures i e clayey and silty sandy soils for example sandy clay loam exhibit high downward water movement similarly several researchers lichner et al 2013 ibrahim et al 2013 reported reductions in hydraulic saturation following the biochar application at 500 c in a sandy loam soil this might be as a result of finer particles of the biochar added to the soil glaser et al 2002 sun et al 2012 high water adsorption of soil treated with biochar might be another cause of reduced hydraulic conductivity herth et al 2013 compared to the unamended plot the soil water sorptivity depicts the ability of the biochar treated soil to absorb water on the other hand the reduced hydraulic conductivity recorded in soil treated with fertiliser compared to the unamended plot might be as a result of higher leaf area index lai recorded in the fertiliser treated soil the possible explanation could be as a result of larger leaf surface area which tend to intercept the solar radiation therefore reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the soil surface and making the soil surface treated with fertiliser wetter compared to the soil water content of the uamended plot with lower lai this does not make the subsoil wetter compared to the unamended plot since the dominant factor affecting the soil water content of the subsoil is transpiration while that of the top soil is evaporation this corroborate the findings of several researchers ceballos et al 2002 darvishan et al 2015 who reported that initial moisture content is one of the effective factors on soil infiltration the low soil water sorptivity in the sandy clay loam amended with biochar showed that hydrophobic nature of the biochar organic matter slowly absorb water because of the low wettability of the soil particles which are coated with hydrophobic organic substances this is in agreement with the report of leonard 2013 who attributed reduction in hydraulic conductivity of biochar treated soil to hydrophobicity of biochar used 4 3 influence of biochar and fertiliser on soil water the result from this study showed that biochar improved soil water status in the increasing order of amount of added biochar this is consistent with the report of several researchers jeffery et al 2011 and these are mainly attributed to the ability of biochar to modify soil pores structure the increase in soil water observed up to 60 cm soil depth in biochar treated soil corroborate the finding of agbna et al 2017 this may be due to the fact that biochar alters the water holding capacity and improve the hydrological properties of the soil such as the soil water sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity are usually high in sandy soils when biochar is added to soil the downward movement of water is altered and might hold the water against gravitation pull added biochar due to its lower particles sizes will in most instances fill in larger sized pores and thereby modify water flux on the other hand the increase in water content observed at the 0 60 cm soil depth in the soil treated with combined addition of biochar and fertiliser compared to soil treated with only fertiliser may be mostly attributed to the ability of biochar to reduce soil water depletion caused by fertiliser application depletion of soil water 0 60 cm depth by maize plant root was more in the unamended plot compared to soil treated with biochar in this study addition of biochar reduced depletion in the root zone of maize compared to the unamended plot therefore making more water available for plant uptake the addition of biochar to the soil might have offered some advantages to the development of the crop especially during sensitive periods flowering and grain filling stages of the plant growth when soil water is most important also decline in soil water content observed in the 2017 2018 growing season might be as a result of the maize plant root growing deeper with days after planting and therefore extracting more water deeper below the soil surface but the nature of soil water content plot with dap in 2017 growing season was sinusoidal rising and falling which was majorly as a result of rainfall that accompany the irrigation events 4 4 growth grain and biomass yield of the maize plant biochar and fertiliser improved the growth and yield of maize in all the irrigation treatments the maize grain 2 53 6 35 t ha and total biomass biomass grain yield of 4 66 23 92 t ha obtained in this study is comparable with the range of 3 31 5 77 t ha for grain yield and 10 10 17 60 for total biomass reported by abedinpour et al 2014 the differences in the yield may be as a result of soil climatic condition and the field management practices the increase in growth and grain yield recorded in the biochar treated soil compared to the unamended plot might be attributed to improvement in the maize water use and nutrient availabity as a result of biochar addition our results are in agreement with those of major et al 2010 and ndor et al 2015 who reported increased in grain yield upon biochar application the high ph value of the biochar used in amending the strong acidic soil might have also significantly influenced the maize yield this is in agreement with the report from a meta analysis where significant increase in average crop yield was reported after addition of biochar to soil of 5 ph liu et al 2013 another meta analysis showed that plant available water and ph increase along with increased nutrient retention which are the most important factors explaining the effect of biochar addition on plant growth and yield jeffery et al 2011 faloye et al 2017 also reported improvement in soil chemical properties including soil ph upon biochar application the synergistic grain yield obtained in this study when biochar and fertiliser were applied together under both full and deficit irrigation treatments might be as a result of biochar ability to retain the nutrient supplied by the inorganic fertiliser in a recent publication faloye et al 2017 reported the effectiveness of maize cob residue in retaining nutrients supplied by the inorganic fertiliser under irrigation the insignificant interaction effect between the biochar and inorganic fertiliser applications on grain yield implies that the effect of fertiliser does not differ on grain yield considering the levels of biochar applied therefore biochar could be applied where fertiliser are scarce to improve the yield maize plant the insignificant interaction effect might be as a result of the timing frequency and quantity of fertiliser applied this is in line with the report of several researchers amali and namo 2015 who reported that the time frequency and quantity of fertiliser application affect fertiliser performance on maize plant soil texture is also another important possible explanation for the insignificant interaction effect between the biochar and fertiliser on grain yield the predominantly sandy soil used in this study is coarse hence might be characterised by low nutrient and water holding capacity due to its coarseness which could necessitate frequent fertiliser application for the plant use to reach higher crop yields especially with essential cereal crop like maize in that its growth and yield are highly nutrient demanding carsky and iwuafor 1999 this might necessitate splitting of fertiliser application in a coarse soil grown with maize bello et al 2011 reported the effectiveness of splitting application of inorganic fertiliser on maize plant during the growing season therefore the main and interactive effects which could exist between fertiliser frequency and biochar applications on maize growth and yield under any form of irrigation is suggested for further investigation in order to determine the optimum fertiliser frequency for maize in a low nutrient and water holding capacity soil such as the textural type of soil used in this study fertiliser was only applied once in this study with the synergistic effect of combined applications of biochar and fertiliser on grain yield revealing that frequent application of fertiliser could be reduced when both biochar and fertiliser are applied together the insignificant interaction between the two factor interaction biochar x irrigation and the three factor interaction biochar x fertiliser x irrigation implies that where water is limiting biochar could be applied to improve grain yield and minimize drought stress on the maize plant the improvement of crops consequent upon biochar addition largely depend on several factors such as biochar rate environmental and weather condition biochar feed stock and soil glaser et al 2002 gaskin et al 2010 downie et al 2009 major et al 2010 4 5 water use iwue and cwue of the maize plant biochar addition improve water use evapotranspiration in all the irrigation treatments the range of water use et obtained during the maize growing seasons is comparable with the range of 300 460 mm reported by alatise and olufayo 2005 in the same location it is also consistent with the range between 289 and 483 mm reported by oiganji et al 2016 who worked on the et of maize under drip irrigation the variation in the water use might be as a result of the field management and irrigation water management adopted the insignificant main effect of biochar on the crop water use by maize plant might be as a result of the insignificant difference obtained on the whc of the field soil also insignificant difference in the interaction between biochar and irrigation on the iwue and cwue implies that where water is limited biochar could be added to soil in order to improve water use efficiencies iwue and cwue of maize and minimize the negative impact of drought condition on the maize plant the results of this study indicated that the 60 fit deficit irrigation can be successfully employed along with maize cob residue biochar application the findings of this study are important because it establishes biochar as an effective soil amendment for improving irrigation effectiveness and efficiency therefore there is a need for a shift in conventional irrigation practice to a more integrative approach or method of improving maize growth yield iwue and cwue which may be achieved through the amendment of soils with biochar and fertiliser in areas with limited water supply and poor soil fertility in addition the increased growth yield iwue and cwue observed in the fertilised plot compare to the unamended plots might be as a result of fertiliser ability to promote root growth and longer root that can extract soil moisture deep down the soil depth this in turn resulted to depletion of soil water in the root zone of maize the extracted soil moisture might have resulted to rapid leave development stem elongation and yield due to fertiliser application thus transpiration may increase in the fertiliser treated plots ogola et al 2002 which might have led to significant improvement in yield iwue and cwue under all the irrigation treatments with organic fertiliser addition additional increase in growth yield iwue and cwue observed in soil treated with combined application of biochar and fertiliser compared to the unamended plot might be attributed to effectiveness of biochar produced from maize cob residues to improve the soil nutrient faloye et al 2017 and water use evapotranspiration by the maize plant the improvement in the whc total porosity and bulk density also affect some of the soil functions such as hydraulic conductivity ajayi and horn 2017 sun et al 2013 thus consequently enhanced the water use by maize plant it decreased further soil water depletion caused by fertiliser application in the root zone of maize when both biochar and fertiliser were applied together this is in agreement with the report of akhtar et al 2014 who also reported an increase in relative water content of tomato after biochar addition which resulted in elevated photosynthesis activities thus the significant effect of combined addition of biochar and fertiliser on iwue and cwue improvement under all irrigation treatments might be attributed to influence of biochar on the water use evapotranspiration by the plant hydro physical and chemical properties of the soil ajayi and horn 2016 faloye et al 2017 this might have resulted to the improvement in the iwue and cwue recorded under all the irrigation treatments the lower iwue and cwue in the control treatment f0b0 may be due to lower grain yield see tables 11 and 12 the lower grain yield obtained compared to biochar amended plots may be attributed to lower soil nutrient and water use by maize plant the results obtained in this field study showed that biochar and fertiliser played major roles in increasing thegrowth yield iwue and cwue of maize in a field study under irrigation these increases are based on the improvement of biochar on the plant water use soil hydro physical and chemical nutrient availability properties hence hypothesis i and ii were fulfilled in term of the improved field water use by maize plant soil hydro physical and chemical properties upon biochar addition despite the extreme drought condition in 2017 2018 growing season little rainfall biochar addition improved the yield of maize by minimizing the impact of drought stress the extent by which biochar could improve growth yield iwue and cwue under deficit irrigation may largely depend on the quantity of biochar added weather condition extent of drought stress and irrigation management strategy therefore combination of limited water supply with biochar might be a promising approach for enhancing crop water use efficiency crop effectiveness in using more water which translated to increased productivity of the maize in a field soil 5 conclusions with growing water demand and increasing signs of water scarcity there is an urgent need to achieve higher yield per unit water applied and used by crops fortunately there is an ample scope to improve irrigation and crop water productivity particularly in areas where yields are currently low as a result of soil infertility and limited water supply in this study the main and interactive effects of maize cob residue biochar and fertiliser on the growth yield iwue and cwue of maize was investigated in a sandy clay loam in a field experiment the main effects of the maize cob residue biochar and fertiliser were significant on the growth yield and water productivities iwue and cwue of maize under all the irrigation treatments which was attributed to improvement in the maize plant water use soil hydro physical soil water content soil bulk density total porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil water sorptivity and chemical properties nutrient availability consequent upon biochar addition also significant main effects of the soil amendments and insignificant interaction effects of the two factors biochar x fertiliser biochar x irrigation as well as the three factors are not significant p 0 05 in their effects on the growth parameters grain yield iwue and cwue showed that biochar could be used were water is limiting to improve maize growth yield iwue and cwue by minimizing drought condition on maize plant further research is in fact needed on a long term to establish the reproducibility of our results under similar and or different environmental and weather conditions as well as for meaningful and robust generalisation of our findings therefore combination of limited water supply with biochar might be a promising approach for enhancing crop water use and consequently enhancing productivity of field grown maize acknowledgement we appreciate the research grant from the tertiary education trust fund tetfund nigeria which was used to fund part of this research 
11074,the additions of biochar and inorganic fertiliser to agricultural soils have been reported to enhance soil fertility and crop production under rainfed and irrigation conditions however it is unclear how biochar improve the growth yield irrigation and crop water use efficiency of a field grown maize under deficit irrigation the objective of this study is to determine the main and interactive effects of biochar and fertiliser on the maize growth yield crop water use efficiency cwue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue under deficit irrigation which has been scarcely studied therefore a field experiment which consisted of factorial combination of irrigation 100 full irrigation fi 80 fi and 60 fi biochar 0 and 20 t ha and fertiliser 0 and 300 kg ha was conducted over two growing seasons the 100 fi 80 of fi and 60 of fi received 1 0 8 and 0 6 of the estimated irrigation need required to bring the soil water to field capacity respectively effect of the soil amendments were determined on the crop evapotranspiration water use soil hydrophysical and chemical properties maize growth parameters were determined weekly while the yield components were determined at harvest results showed that the application of the soil amendments improved the soil hydro physical chemical properties and water use by maize plant which consequently resulted in increased maize growth yield iwue and cwue under all irrigation treatments combined addition of the soil amendments gave significant p 0 05 improvement on the maize grain yield biomass yield cwue and iwue compared to the unamnded plot in all irrigation treatments also insignificant interaction occurred between biochar and irrigation on maize productivities therefore amending soil with biochar under limited water supply might be a novel approach for enhancing maize yield and water use efficiencies by minimizing the negative impact of drought stress keywords soil amendments soil fertility hydrophysical properties maize water use maize productivity water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity and poor soil fertility have been identified as the two critical factors affecting crop production particularly in the tropics li 2009 ray et al 2013 therefore there is increasing demand for scientist to evolve strategies that will improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil in areas of low soil fertility improve water retention in the soil as well as improve water use efficiency by the plants oki and kanae 2006 one widely agreed management option with this 3 prong functions is the amendment of the soil with biochar oguntunde et al 2004 lehmann and joseph 2009 ajayi et al 2016 biochar is pyrolysed biomass produced for the purpose of amending agricultural soils bridgwater 2003 sohi et al 2010 adding biochar to the soil has been shown to modify some physical properties of the soil such as bulk density porosity texture and particle size distribution thus impacting the soil structure the modification in these soil physical properties might be attributed to the physical dilution of the biochar with soil oguntunde et al 2004 ajayi et al 2016 this affects important soil functions such as infiltration hydraulic conductivity water holding capacity aeration redox potential and therefore plant growth and yield glaser et al 2002 atkinson et al 2010 biederman and harpole 2013 jeffery et al 2011 ajayi et al 2016 notably biochar addition improves soil water retention and available water capacity novak et al 2009a ajayi and horn 2016 this is commonly observed in coarse textured soils or soils with large amounts of macropores although the amount of biochar often required to enhance water retention is high and vary with soil type glaser et al 2002 addition of biochar to soils also reported to enhance the soil chemical properties laird et al 2010 van et al 2010 it improves the soil cation exchange capacity ph and reduce nutrient leaching and thus improve fertility and nutrient use efficiency chan et al 2007 the ability of the biochar to retain soil nutrients and improve water holding capacity of soil may have direct effects on increasing crop yield and water use efficiency this is because soil amendment with biochar may consequently retain more water from irrigation and also reduce the frequency of irrigation hence sustaining and optimizing the limited water available for crop production in addition to soil amendment different innovative strategies to improve cwue yield per unit area divided by crop evapotranspiration during the growing season t ha mm and iwue yield per unit area divided by total amount of water applied t ha mm of maize zea mays l which is an important economic crop commonly grown have been proposed these include deficit irrigation di strategies and fertilization deficit irrigation practices are used to sustain crop productivity under reduced water application oktem 2008 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 karimi and gomrokchi 2011 by improving soil water extraction by plant roots this is because full irrigation fi practice is considered as water luxury which is not sustainable in water limited environment crop management practices such as application of fertiliser has been reported to improve water use efficiency of maize dawe et al 2000 ogola et al 2002 regmi et al 2002 these researchers attributed the improvement in water use efficiency of maize after fertilization to reduction in evaporation due to concomitant increase in leaf area index lai in both rainfed and irrigated conditions although biochar amendment has been shown to improve water retention its standalone and integrative effects with inorganic fertiliser on the growth yield iwue and cwue of maize has not been well documented under deficit irrigation in a field study moreover there are still some clear knowledge gap on how biochar improve the growth yield iwue and cwue of maize under any form of irrigation particularly with the practice of deficit irrigation strategy in a field soil recently there has been an increase in the use of integrated approaches of applying biochar and fertiliser to improve crops yield and irrigation water use efficiency in order to alleviate the problems of inadequate water supply drought and poor soil fertility uzoma et al 2011 akhtar et al 2014 agbna et al 2017 many of the aforementioned studies determined the effects of biochar amendment on the productivities and irrigation water use efficiency of different crops under greenhouse conditions uzoma et al 2011 agbna et al 2017 and in pot experiments akhtar et al 2014 the effect of biochar on water use crop evapotranspiration and crop water use efficiency of maize have not been documented under control environment green house and in field experiments using irrigation to date there is dearth information on the effects of biochar on the yield irrigation and crop water use efficiency of maize particularly in a field study under deficit irrigation therefore we hypothesised that the integration of irrigation with soil amendments biochar and fertiliser could improve the iwue and cwue of maize under deficit irrigation of a field soil moreso it appears that the interaction effects between biochar and deficit irrigation has not yet been documented for maize grown in a field soil in order to grow maize successfully with biochar where water resources is limiting thus the objective of the study is to investigate the main and interactive effects of biochar and fertiliser applications on the growth yield iwue and cwue of a field grown maize under drip irrigation the mechanism by which biochar improve yield irrigation and crop water use efficiency of crops are poorly understood under deficit irrigation in a field soil therefore we tested our hypothesis by estimating i the effects of biochar when applied alone and when combined with fertiliser on the water use crop evapotranspiration of maize in a field experiment and ii determine the improvement of hydro physical and chemical properties of an acidic field soil when biochar was applied in comparison to the unamended soil 2 materials and methods the field experiments were conducted during dry season of 2017 february may and 2017 2018 november february at the teaching and research farm 7 16 n 5 13 e of the department of agricultural and environmental engineering federal university of technology akure nigeria the averages of weather parameter over the study site during the experimental period is given in table 1 soil texture up to the 60 cm depth at the experimental site is sandy clay loam table 2 according to soil survey staff 2006 and the available water is about 102 42 mm the available water aw was calculated as the difference between water held at field capacity and permanent wilting point below the 60 cm depth the site is characterised by a hard pan which could limit root development and water extraction the field capacity was determined in the field when the ceramic tip tensiometer irrometer inc reading was 10 kpa according to marcos et al 2009 for predominantly sandy soils while the permanent wilting point was derived from previous study at the experimental site fasinmirin et al 2014 the van genuchten 1980 model eq 1 which is widely used for soil water retention curve was used for the calibration of soil water content with the soil water potential tensiometer readings at 0 10 20 30 40 50 65 70 and 75 kpa for the experimental soil table 2 before planting maize in order to schedule irrigation the soil tension could not read beyond 80 kpa in the predominantly sandy field soil marcos et al 2009 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m where θ cm3 cm3 is the measured soil water content θr is residual water content cm3 cm3 θs is saturated water content cm3 cm3 α cm 1 n and m are the van genuchten parameters respectively while ψ is the logarithm of soil water tension the van genuchten model was fitted using matlab software version 2013 2 1 biochar production and characterisation the process of obtaining maize cob residues and chemical characterisation of the maize cob residue biochar has been described in our previous paper faloye et al 2017 the maize cob residues was pyrolysed at 500 c with the heating rate of 2 08 c min a residence time of 1 h using a fixed bed batch type pyrolysis system was maintained the biochar was ground into smaller fraction in a metallic box using a sledge hammer the chemical properties according to the international biochar initiative ibi 2011 procedures are presented in table 3 the soil physico chemical properties at soil depth of 0 20 cm are also presented in table 3 the biochar bulk density was determined by standard method astm e873 2013 a standard sampling core was filled with samples and compressed such that biochar occupy the volume of the cylinder the core lid was carefully closed and biochar was oven dried at 105 c to a constant weight cooled and weighed the bulk density was calculated by dividing the mass of the oven dried biochar by the volume of the core the biochar particle size distribution was determined using sieves of 2 mm using sieve shaking machine model number 62 020 sieves of sizes 2 0 95 0 05 0 003 0 002 and 0 0015 mm were used for biochar size distribution the portion of biochar retained by the 2 mm sieve was not included in the size distribution analysis since biochar 2 mm was not used to amend the field soil the biochar sizes used in the experiment was classified into macro pore 0 05 2 mm meso pore 0 002 0 05 mm and micro pore 0 002 mm 2 2 field experimentation a 40 m x 40 m portion of the farm was ploughed and harrowed for effective seed bed formation thirty six seed beds measuring 2 2 m wide 2 5 m long each with 0 6 m intra spacing and 0 9 m inter spacing formed the drip irrigation field the biochar material in application rates of 0 and 20 t ha was incorporated into the top 0 2 m and was evenly mixed with the soil at the different rates manually these low application rates were comparable with that of ndor et al 2015 and major et al 2010 and was reported appropriate and effective for increased maize production in a sandy soil that is nutrient deficient an improved maize seeds zea mays l variety suwan 1 sr were manually sown on february 13th 2017 and november 7th 2017 three maize seeds were sown per hole and thinned to two plants 2 weeks after planting the plant population in this experiment is close to the recommended plants population of 53 333 by iita 2014 which is obtainable with plant spacing of 50 cm by 75 cm npk fertiliser was only applied once a week after planting using the ring method the npk fertiliser was applied in combination with the biochar inorder to investigate the effectiveness of biochar made from maize cob residues to retain the nutrient supplied by the npk fertiliser under deficit irrigation especially in a predominantly sandy soil which is associated with prolific leaching used in this study the treatments consisted of two levels of biochar 0 and 20 t ha two levels of inorganic fertiliser npk 0 and 300 kg ha 15 15 15 and three irrigation treatments 100 80 and 60 full irrigation treatment fit which was factorially combined together to form a total of eleven 11 treatments and a control unamended table 4 replicated three times forming a total of 36 plots in both growing seasons full and deficit irrigation were imposed after planting maize the inorganic fertiliser used for the experiment is a water soluble compound fertiliser with brand name golden fertiliser produced in nigeria the experimental design was 3 2 x 2 full factorial combination of irrigation fertiliser and biochar replicated 3 times and arranged in a strip plot design irrigation treatments were arranged orthogonally to fertiliser only biochar only biochar fertiliser and no biochar no fertiliser which were applied as strips biochar at application rate of 20 t ha was incorporated into the 20 cm x 40 cm x 20 cm pit before planting maize which is equivalent to 7 4 g kg 1 of biochar to soil mass ratio the biochar mixing rates were calculated based on the soil depth and bulk density values of 20 cm and 1 35 g cm3 irrigation water was pumped from a reservoir into two over head connected tanks by means of a surface pump installed at about 200 m away from the experimental field the over head tanks consisted of 2000 l capacity each positioned at a height of 2 m above the ground level irrigation water from the overhead tanks was delivered to the field through drip laterals connected to the submain pipes by gravity and control valve connected to the main pipe was used to regulate the flow of water the drip lateral was made of polyethylene material 13 mm diameter and 0 6 m emitter spacing with an average discharge of 0 71 l h at operational pressure of 20kpa pre planting irrigation was carried out to bring the crop root zone to field capacity so as to promote germination and early crop establishment the unamended soil and soil biochar mixture bulk density total porosity and water holding capacity was determined in triplicate at 14 days after mixing biochar with soil in both growing seasons before this time other field operations were being carried out the water holding capacity determined at soil water tension of 0 10 50 and 75 kpa at the different soil depth 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were selected among other tension reading since it investigate the effectiveness of biochar in improving the soil whc at saturation field capacity moderately stress and severely stressed level of soil water the installed ceramic tip tensiometers irrometer inc were used for the soil water tension measurements with the tensiometer reading ranging from 0 100 kpa because of the small range of soil water tension we could not establish the soil water retention curve up to the wilting point for soil at the experimental site the unamended soil and soil biochar mixture water content at saturation 0 kpa was used for the determination total porosity tp ratio of volume of water occupied by pore to the total volume of the core and bulk density the cores are 5 cm in diameter and 20 cm in height core samples were put in the oven at 105 c for 24 h to obtain the dry mass of samples to determine the water holding capacity thereafter the bulk density was calculated by dividing the oven dry mass by volume of the core 5 cm diameter and 20 cm height blake and hartage 1986 after planting maize each plot was scheduled to be irrigated to field capacity fc when about 50 of fc has been depleted this 0 5 fc served as the maximum allowable deficiency mad before irrigation in this study in the full irrigation treatment of the unamended plot therefore maize plant was then irrigated when the difference between the tensiometer reading threshold before irrigation and tensiometer daily reading is within 5 similar to the approach of gheysari et al 2015 the tensiometer reading threshold before irrigation was 62 kpa the ceramic tip tensiometers irrometer inc were installed at the depths 20 40 and 60 cm in the unamended control plots for the scheduling readings from the tensiometers installed at 20 and 40 cm soil depth were used for scheduling irrigation at the seedling 0 20 dap and vegetative growth stages 21 45 dap while readings from the tensiometer installed at the 60 cm depth was used for scheduling irrigation for the remaining growth stages i e flowering grain filling and maturity 46 77 dap since the maize plant root increases with day after planting or stages of growth this approach of scheduling irrigation at 20 cm soil depth during seedling growth stage and at deeper soil depth remaining growing stages is in agreement with the report of gheysari et al 2015 in scheduling irrigation when to apply water van genuchten 1980 soil water calibration model between the soil water content and tensiometer readings which had already been established for soil at the experimental site before the commencement of the experiments was used for the determination of the tensiometer reading at 50 of field capacity fc at the different soil depth 20 40 and 60 cm in the full irrigation treatment 100 fi 100 amount of water required to bring the soil water to field capacity was applied when about 50 fc has been depleted in the unamended plot while in the deficit irrigation treatment that is 80 and 60 fi water was applied on the same day as the full irrigation treatment but the irrigation depth was reduced to 80 and 60 of the full irrigation equal amount of water was applied to all biochar fertiliser and unamended plots according to irrigation treatments similar to the approach of akhtar et al 2014 to determine the duration of irrigation ta during each irrigation event the gross irrigation irg was determined by dividing the irrigation amounts ia by the irrigation application efficiency ea the irrigation amount ia i e the volume of irrigation water applied in litres l per irrigation event was calculated from eq 2 2 i a w a i where wa is the wetted area m2 by emitters and i is irrigation mm irrigation application efficiency of 80 was used asae 1990 the irrigation application efficiency account possible losses between the tank and emitters thus the ta was calculated using eq 3 3 t a i r g n p q 0 5 where ta is the duration of irrigation per event h np is number of emitter s per plant irg l is the gross irrigation and q is the emitter discharge l h in this study one emitter was used per two plants therefore we used a factor of 0 5 to multiply np soil water contents were determined gravimetrically on biweekly basis during the growing season at depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm in the replicates of each treatment the gravimetric water content obtained were converted to volumetric water content by multiplying them by the bulk density of the soil at the respective layer the volumetric water content obtained in each layer was multiplied by the depth of each soil layer in order to convert the soil water contents to depth basis mm the total crop evapotranspiration et was estimated in each of the treatments using the soil water balance ogola et al 2002 igbadun 2012 eq 4 4 e t p i c d r w i 1 w i where et is total crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm determined at the experimental site with the use of installed manual rain gauges c is capillarity i is the irrigation amount mm which was applied to bring the soil water to field capacity d is deep percolation mm which was assumed negligible r is the runoff mm and wi 1 wi is the change in soil water storage mm determined based on the difference in soil water content between two successive measurements in the soil depth of 0 60 cm in the replicates of each treatment the wi and wi 1 are the first and next successive soil water contents respectively deep percolation was assumed to be negligible since the experiment was carried out in the dry season characterized by little or no rainfall and drainage below the root zone was considered negligible under drip irrigation the contribution from ground water due to capillarity was ignored because the ground water table was deeper than 60 cm to determine possible runoff from the unamended plot a runoff collector described in igbadun 2012 was installed the philip s two term equation was used to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k using mini disc infiltrometer the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soil was calculated using the method of zhang 1997 the method requires measuring the cumulative infiltration versus time and fitting the results with the infiltration function eq 5 the volume of water at regular time intervals 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 and 300 s as the water infiltrates were recorded at 2 cm suction rate the soil suction rate of 2 cm used in this study is in accordance with the recommendation of zhang 1997 5 i c 1 t c 2 t 1 2 where i is infiltration t is time in seconds c1 is related to hydraulic conductivity m s c2 is soil sorptivity mms 1 2 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil k q mm h was computed using the relationship in eq 6 6 k q c 1 a where c1 is the slope of the curve of the cumulative infiltration versus the square root and a is a value relating the van genuchten parameters for a given soil type to the suction rate and radius of the infiltrometer disc which is computed using the equation eq 7 given below 7 a 11 65 n 0 1 exp 7 5 1 9 n α h 0 α r 0 0 91 n 1 9 where n and α are the van genuchten parameters for the soil table 2 for the 0 20 cm soil depth r0 is the disc radius and h0 is the suction at the disc surface the radius of the disc was 2 25 cm soil sorptivity to water sw was determined from the slope of the cumulative infiltration i vs square root of time t using eq 8 8 i s w t the average plant height number n of leaves per stand length l and width w of leaves from 4 selected maize plants per plot were monitored on weekly basis at the centre of the middle row in each plot the leaf area la was calculated following the procedure of stewart and dwyer 1999 by multiplying the length of leaf by the widest width and by a factor 0 743 eq 9 9 la l w 0 743 the leaf area index lai was computed by dividing the total leaf area la of the maize plants by the land area occupied by the maize plants equal plot size of each replicate at maturity all maize plants were hand harvested to determine the grain yield the maize plants were also cut at the ground level in each plot to determine the biomass yield stem leaves tassel and maize cob residue the maize plants were conveyed to the laboratory for curing until the biomass was dried and the maize grain had attained 13 5 on dry basis the dry matters were then weighed and the maize cob residue yield in each plot was measured separately since the quantification productivity of the maize cob residue would provide information about its further reuse for biochar production which would largely depend on its response to biochar and fertiliser applications under irrigation the efficiency terms cwue and iwue were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of fertiliser and biochar amendments under drip irrigation the cwue and iwue were determined using eqs 10 and 11 kijne et al 2003 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 howell 2006 10 c w u e y

biochar amended plot this imply that the bulk density decreased by 7 4 in soil treated with biochar compared to the unamended plot compared to the unamended plot the addition of biochar to the field soil insignificantly p 0 05 increase the soil porosity by 3 81 using t test the van genuchten model predicted the soil water content well table 2 with r2 ranging from 0 92 to 0 97 in the sandy clay loam soil the range of soil tension 0 75 kpa used for the calibration of soil water tension with the soil water content might be responsible for the negative value predicted for θr the residual volumetric water content represents the volumetric water content of a soil where further increase in soil water tension does not produce significant changes in water content which can be better predicted when higher tension is considered biochar amendment also improved the water holding capacity whc at soil water tension of 0 10 50 and 75 kpa as illustrated in table 6 the soil water holding capacity also insignificantly p 0 05 increased with increase the amount of added biochar the percentage increase in whc with respect to soil water tensions of 0 10 50 and 75 kpa ranged from 3 58 to 8 70 3 2 effects of biochar and fertiliser on soil hydrological properties unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity in both growing seasons the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k q was insigniﬁcantly affected by the biochar and fertiliser application rates p 0 05 table 7 the k q mean values ranged from 19 40 mm h for f300b20 to 31 00 mm h for the b0f0 in 2017 growing season while the mean values ranged from 25 00 mm h for f300b20 to 34 60 mm h for the b0f0 in 2017 18 growing season on average relative to the k q of the control 32 79 mm h f300b0 f0b20 f300b20 treatments reduced the k q by 9 6 28 24 and 32 64 respectively table 7 in both growing seasons the soil water sorptivity sw was signiﬁcantly p 0 05 affected by the combined applications of biochar and fertiliser table 8 the sw mean values ranged from 0 54 mm s1 2 for f300b20 to 0 74 mm s1 2 for the b0f0 based on the average values of both seasons on average relative to the sw of the control 0 82 mm s1 2 f300b0 f0b20 f300b20 treatments reduced the sw by 9 75 20 73 and 34 15 respectively table 8 3 3 influence of biochar and fertiliser on soil water content the changes in soil water content with respect to dap is shown in fig 1 a and b soil treated with biochar enhanced the soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil depth compared to the unamended plot the depletion caused by fertiliser application in the root zone of maize was reduced when biochar and fertiliser were applied together thus higher value of soil water content were recorded when biochar and fertiliser were applied together compared to water content obtained in treatment plot were only fertiliser was applied application of biochar improved the soil water content compare to the unamended plot 3 4 main and interactive effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation on maize growth components the maize plants responded positively to both biochar fertiliser and irrigation applications for averaged plant height number of leaves stand leaf area and leaf area index measured during the growing seasons tables 9 and 10 biochar fertiliser and irrigation main effects on average plant height number of leaves stand leaf area and leaf area index were highly significant p 0 05 the lowest maize lai was recorded in the unamended plot under the irrigation treatments in both growing seasons the plant height number of leaves leaf area and leaf area index serve as important indices that directly reﬂect the growth of the maize plants the growth parameters were signiﬁcantly p 0 05 increased with increase in irrigation biochar and fertiliser applications but interactions between the three factors fertiliser x biochar x irrigation were not signiﬁcant also there was no significant p 0 05 interaction effect of irrigation x biochar biochar x fertiliser and fertiliser x irrigation on ph nl la and lai the tallest plant with the greatest number of leaves leaf area and leaf area index were obtained at the f300b20i100 while the lowest was obtained at the f0b0i60 treatment with least irrigation with no biochar and fertiliser applications in both growing seasons 3 5 main and interactive effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation on maize yield components biochar and fertiliser applications also increased the yield components grain biomass and maize cob yield of maize over the control tables 11 and 12 in all the irrigation treatments in both growing seasons the highest yield component was recorded at f300b20i100 while the lowest was recorded in treatment f0b0i60 the highest yield components was recorded in each irrigation treatment where biochar and fertiliser were applied together and the lowest yield components were obtained in the unamended plot of each irrigation treatment during the 2017 growing season maize grain biomass and cob yield ranged from 3 88 to 6 35 t ha 11 76 to 17 57 t ha and 3 65 to 4 95 t ha respectively in the 100 fit in the 80 fit the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 3 75 to 6 00 t ha 11 33 to 17 24 t ha and 3 31 to 4 75 t ha respectively also in 60 fit maizee grain biomass and cob yield ranged from 2 57 to 3 75 t ha 7 20 to 11 33 t ha and 1 98 to 4 14 t ha respectively in the 2017 2018 growing season the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 3 85 to 5 24 t ha 6 06 to 10 35 t ha and 2 55 to 3 39 t ha respectively for 100 fit for 80 fit the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 3 70 to 4 92 t ha 3 73 to 10 27 t ha and 2 09 to 3 37 t ha respectively also in 60 fit the grain biomass and maize cob yield ranged from 2 53 to 4 34 t ha 2 13 to 7 62 t ha and 1 11 to 3 15 t ha respectively in all higher yields were obtained in 2017 growing season compared to the 2017 18 growing season this might be as a result of higher precipitation that accompany the 2017 growing season experiment under all irrigation treatments in both growing seasons combined addition of biochar and fertiliser led to a signiﬁcant increase p 0 05 in the grain biomass and maize cob yield in relation to the unamended plot in all the irrigation treatments although there were no signiﬁcant diﬀ erences p 0 05 in the grain of maize plants grown under soil treated with biochar alone compared to the unamended plot in both growing seasons insigniﬁcant interactive eﬀ ects p 0 05 were observed for biochar x irrigation and the three way interaction of biochar fertilizer irrigation on grain yield in the 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons also effects of the irrigation treatments without soil amendment on grain yield is represented table 13 the result of the analysis showed that there is no significant difference between maize yield at 100 and 80 fit which implies that 20 of irrigation water could be saved to irrigate additional land the significant main effect p 0 05 for the factors and insigniﬁcant interactive eﬀ ects p 0 05 observed for biochar fertilizer biochar x irrigation and the three way interaction of biochar fertilizer irrigation on grain yield in the 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons imply that where water is limited biochar could be added to soil to improve the maize yield and minimize the impact of drought stress 3 6 effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation on maize water use iwue and cwue in 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons the addition of biochar and fertiliser increased the et of maize compared to the unamended plot additional increase in the et was observed when biochar and fertiliser were applied together in all the irrigation treatments 100 fit 80 fit and 60 fit tables 14 and 15 the negative change in storage shows that the soil water content at planting was higher than soil water content at harvest the main effect of irrigation and fertiliser were significant on the crop water use while the biochar application effect was not significant on the crop water use by the maize plant in both growing seasons 2017 and 2017 2018 the iwue and cwue increased with biochar and fertiliser applications p 0 05 tables 16 and 17 under all irrigation treatments significant increase p 0 05 were observed for the combined addition of biochar and fertiliser on iwue and cwue compared to the unamended plot in all irrigation treatments including the water stressed treatments the main effects of biochar fertiliser and irrigation were significant p 0 05 on the iwue and cwue insigniﬁcant interactive eﬀ ects p 0 05 were observed for two factor interaction of biochar fertilizer biochar irrigation as well as the three factors interaction of the three factors on iwue and cwue in both growing seasons 3 7 effect of biochar on soil chemical properties and soil organic matter som the averaged data of the soil chemical properties 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons determined at harvest showed that application of biochar and fertiliser improved the soil chemical at harvest table 18 there was additional increase when biochar and fertiliser were applied together compared to standalone application of biochar fertiliser and compared to the control the biochar application significantly p 0 05 increased the soil ph som and cec compared to the control plot the increase in the soil ph might be attributed to the liming effect of the biochar used 4 discussion several meta analysis and reviews have documented the modification of some physical chemical and hydrological properties of biochar amended soil such as bulk density texture particle size distribution total porosity cec n p k and ph they further described the consequences of these changes on the hydraulic behaviour of the substrates such infiltration water retention hydraulic conductivity and among others laghari et al 2015 liu et al 2017 this field study similarly confirms some of the findings and further provides insight into how some of these changes improves maize production and efficient water use by maize plant under full and limited water conditions 4 1 biochar production by weight particle size distribution and impact of biochar on the soil physical properties bulk density and porosity the average biochar yield of 26 was recovered in this study which is close to the values of 20 and 33 5 yield of biochar made from pine sawdust through a fast pyrolysis at 400 c reported by desisto et al 2010 biochar yield quantity and quality depends on the production conditions heating rate pyrolysis temperature residence time and the biomass used demirbas 2004 also reported that biochar yield vary with the size of biomass the fine biochar particles obtained in this study might be as a result of biomass used and production conditions sohi et al 2009 reported that wood based feed stocks generate biochars that are coarser and predominantly xylemic in nature while biochars from crop residues rye and maize and manures offer a finer and more brittle structure therefore the fine particle of biochar used in this study contributed to the alteration of the soil physical and chemical properties the decrease in bulk density in biochar amended treatments could be related to physical dilution effects of the biochar the magnitude of the decrease in bulk density correlates to the amount of added biochar particularly owing to the texture and characteristic of the added biochar ajayi and horn 2016 in our study the significant p 0 05 decrease in the bulk density observed upon biochar addition may be premised on the amount and the low bulk density of the added biochar see table 3 njoku et al 2015 observed that the decrease in bulk density was not significant p 0 05 at biochar application rates of 5 10 and 15 t ha in predominantly sandy soil the result of our study corroborate the findings of sun et al 2013 who reported significant decrease in soil bulk density upon biochar addition at 20 t ha when the application rate is higher the dilution effect of the biochar is stronger due to its relatively lower bulk density compared to soil mineral particles lehmann et al 2011 moreover highly stable organic carbon is expected to reduce soil bulk density and thus increase total soil porosity biochar pyrolysis conditions such as heating rate and pyrolysis temperature determine the stability of organic carbon in soil after biochar addition the increase in soil porosity observed in this study upon biochar addition corroborate the findings of several researchers jones et al 2011 karhu et al 2011 dempster et al 2012 the increase in the total porosity observed in this study might be as a result of finer particles of biochar added to the coarse field soil which is predominantly sandy 4 2 impact of the soil amendments on soil hydraulic hydrological properties the van genuchten parameters n and α values obtained for the calibration of soil water tension with the soil water content is close to the values reported by carsel and parrish 1988 for sandy clay loam soil the low whc of the field soil used in this experiment was probably due to low soil organic matter and coarse texture predominantly sandy the particle size of the biochar was finer in size with highest texture in the mesopore range 2 50 μm after the biochar amendment of the field soil the fine particles of the biochar probably filled the pore spaces of the field soil hence the biochar addition insignificantly p 0 05 increased the whc of the field soil several researchers jones et al 2011 laird et al 2010 uzoma et al 2011 have reported alterations in whc and water retention in biochar amended soils with as low as 0 5 g g biochar application rate however the response is biochar and soil specific briggs et al 2012 reported that biochar amended plot improve whc by 4 2 compared to the unamended plot with the application rate of 0 5 g g in a laboratory experiment which is within the range of whc improvement reported in this study sun et al 2013 also reported improvement of biochar amended soil whc in a field experiment similar improvement in whc in our field study in the biochar amended soil resulted in higher amount of water use by maize plants meanwhile the biochar reduced soil k q prevent rapid movement of water into the soil and also improved whc of the field soil hence it resulted in increased water use by the maize plant under biochar amended soils due to the increased in the water use by the crop savings of irrigation water and higher crop yields were recorded in the biochar amend soils compared to the unamended plot soil hydraulic conductivity primarily governs the soil water movement and retention bodner et al 2013 compared to other soil textures i e clayey and silty sandy soils for example sandy clay loam exhibit high downward water movement similarly several researchers lichner et al 2013 ibrahim et al 2013 reported reductions in hydraulic saturation following the biochar application at 500 c in a sandy loam soil this might be as a result of finer particles of the biochar added to the soil glaser et al 2002 sun et al 2012 high water adsorption of soil treated with biochar might be another cause of reduced hydraulic conductivity herth et al 2013 compared to the unamended plot the soil water sorptivity depicts the ability of the biochar treated soil to absorb water on the other hand the reduced hydraulic conductivity recorded in soil treated with fertiliser compared to the unamended plot might be as a result of higher leaf area index lai recorded in the fertiliser treated soil the possible explanation could be as a result of larger leaf surface area which tend to intercept the solar radiation therefore reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the soil surface and making the soil surface treated with fertiliser wetter compared to the soil water content of the uamended plot with lower lai this does not make the subsoil wetter compared to the unamended plot since the dominant factor affecting the soil water content of the subsoil is transpiration while that of the top soil is evaporation this corroborate the findings of several researchers ceballos et al 2002 darvishan et al 2015 who reported that initial moisture content is one of the effective factors on soil infiltration the low soil water sorptivity in the sandy clay loam amended with biochar showed that hydrophobic nature of the biochar organic matter slowly absorb water because of the low wettability of the soil particles which are coated with hydrophobic organic substances this is in agreement with the report of leonard 2013 who attributed reduction in hydraulic conductivity of biochar treated soil to hydrophobicity of biochar used 4 3 influence of biochar and fertiliser on soil water the result from this study showed that biochar improved soil water status in the increasing order of amount of added biochar this is consistent with the report of several researchers jeffery et al 2011 and these are mainly attributed to the ability of biochar to modify soil pores structure the increase in soil water observed up to 60 cm soil depth in biochar treated soil corroborate the finding of agbna et al 2017 this may be due to the fact that biochar alters the water holding capacity and improve the hydrological properties of the soil such as the soil water sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity are usually high in sandy soils when biochar is added to soil the downward movement of water is altered and might hold the water against gravitation pull added biochar due to its lower particles sizes will in most instances fill in larger sized pores and thereby modify water flux on the other hand the increase in water content observed at the 0 60 cm soil depth in the soil treated with combined addition of biochar and fertiliser compared to soil treated with only fertiliser may be mostly attributed to the ability of biochar to reduce soil water depletion caused by fertiliser application depletion of soil water 0 60 cm depth by maize plant root was more in the unamended plot compared to soil treated with biochar in this study addition of biochar reduced depletion in the root zone of maize compared to the unamended plot therefore making more water available for plant uptake the addition of biochar to the soil might have offered some advantages to the development of the crop especially during sensitive periods flowering and grain filling stages of the plant growth when soil water is most important also decline in soil water content observed in the 2017 2018 growing season might be as a result of the maize plant root growing deeper with days after planting and therefore extracting more water deeper below the soil surface but the nature of soil water content plot with dap in 2017 growing season was sinusoidal rising and falling which was majorly as a result of rainfall that accompany the irrigation events 4 4 growth grain and biomass yield of the maize plant biochar and fertiliser improved the growth and yield of maize in all the irrigation treatments the maize grain 2 53 6 35 t ha and total biomass biomass grain yield of 4 66 23 92 t ha obtained in this study is comparable with the range of 3 31 5 77 t ha for grain yield and 10 10 17 60 for total biomass reported by abedinpour et al 2014 the differences in the yield may be as a result of soil climatic condition and the field management practices the increase in growth and grain yield recorded in the biochar treated soil compared to the unamended plot might be attributed to improvement in the maize water use and nutrient availabity as a result of biochar addition our results are in agreement with those of major et al 2010 and ndor et al 2015 who reported increased in grain yield upon biochar application the high ph value of the biochar used in amending the strong acidic soil might have also significantly influenced the maize yield this is in agreement with the report from a meta analysis where significant increase in average crop yield was reported after addition of biochar to soil of 5 ph liu et al 2013 another meta analysis showed that plant available water and ph increase along with increased nutrient retention which are the most important factors explaining the effect of biochar addition on plant growth and yield jeffery et al 2011 faloye et al 2017 also reported improvement in soil chemical properties including soil ph upon biochar application the synergistic grain yield obtained in this study when biochar and fertiliser were applied together under both full and deficit irrigation treatments might be as a result of biochar ability to retain the nutrient supplied by the inorganic fertiliser in a recent publication faloye et al 2017 reported the effectiveness of maize cob residue in retaining nutrients supplied by the inorganic fertiliser under irrigation the insignificant interaction effect between the biochar and inorganic fertiliser applications on grain yield implies that the effect of fertiliser does not differ on grain yield considering the levels of biochar applied therefore biochar could be applied where fertiliser are scarce to improve the yield maize plant the insignificant interaction effect might be as a result of the timing frequency and quantity of fertiliser applied this is in line with the report of several researchers amali and namo 2015 who reported that the time frequency and quantity of fertiliser application affect fertiliser performance on maize plant soil texture is also another important possible explanation for the insignificant interaction effect between the biochar and fertiliser on grain yield the predominantly sandy soil used in this study is coarse hence might be characterised by low nutrient and water holding capacity due to its coarseness which could necessitate frequent fertiliser application for the plant use to reach higher crop yields especially with essential cereal crop like maize in that its growth and yield are highly nutrient demanding carsky and iwuafor 1999 this might necessitate splitting of fertiliser application in a coarse soil grown with maize bello et al 2011 reported the effectiveness of splitting application of inorganic fertiliser on maize plant during the growing season therefore the main and interactive effects which could exist between fertiliser frequency and biochar applications on maize growth and yield under any form of irrigation is suggested for further investigation in order to determine the optimum fertiliser frequency for maize in a low nutrient and water holding capacity soil such as the textural type of soil used in this study fertiliser was only applied once in this study with the synergistic effect of combined applications of biochar and fertiliser on grain yield revealing that frequent application of fertiliser could be reduced when both biochar and fertiliser are applied together the insignificant interaction between the two factor interaction biochar x irrigation and the three factor interaction biochar x fertiliser x irrigation implies that where water is limiting biochar could be applied to improve grain yield and minimize drought stress on the maize plant the improvement of crops consequent upon biochar addition largely depend on several factors such as biochar rate environmental and weather condition biochar feed stock and soil glaser et al 2002 gaskin et al 2010 downie et al 2009 major et al 2010 4 5 water use iwue and cwue of the maize plant biochar addition improve water use evapotranspiration in all the irrigation treatments the range of water use et obtained during the maize growing seasons is comparable with the range of 300 460 mm reported by alatise and olufayo 2005 in the same location it is also consistent with the range between 289 and 483 mm reported by oiganji et al 2016 who worked on the et of maize under drip irrigation the variation in the water use might be as a result of the field management and irrigation water management adopted the insignificant main effect of biochar on the crop water use by maize plant might be as a result of the insignificant difference obtained on the whc of the field soil also insignificant difference in the interaction between biochar and irrigation on the iwue and cwue implies that where water is limited biochar could be added to soil in order to improve water use efficiencies iwue and cwue of maize and minimize the negative impact of drought condition on the maize plant the results of this study indicated that the 60 fit deficit irrigation can be successfully employed along with maize cob residue biochar application the findings of this study are important because it establishes biochar as an effective soil amendment for improving irrigation effectiveness and efficiency therefore there is a need for a shift in conventional irrigation practice to a more integrative approach or method of improving maize growth yield iwue and cwue which may be achieved through the amendment of soils with biochar and fertiliser in areas with limited water supply and poor soil fertility in addition the increased growth yield iwue and cwue observed in the fertilised plot compare to the unamended plots might be as a result of fertiliser ability to promote root growth and longer root that can extract soil moisture deep down the soil depth this in turn resulted to depletion of soil water in the root zone of maize the extracted soil moisture might have resulted to rapid leave development stem elongation and yield due to fertiliser application thus transpiration may increase in the fertiliser treated plots ogola et al 2002 which might have led to significant improvement in yield iwue and cwue under all the irrigation treatments with organic fertiliser addition additional increase in growth yield iwue and cwue observed in soil treated with combined application of biochar and fertiliser compared to the unamended plot might be attributed to effectiveness of biochar produced from maize cob residues to improve the soil nutrient faloye et al 2017 and water use evapotranspiration by the maize plant the improvement in the whc total porosity and bulk density also affect some of the soil functions such as hydraulic conductivity ajayi and horn 2017 sun et al 2013 thus consequently enhanced the water use by maize plant it decreased further soil water depletion caused by fertiliser application in the root zone of maize when both biochar and fertiliser were applied together this is in agreement with the report of akhtar et al 2014 who also reported an increase in relative water content of tomato after biochar addition which resulted in elevated photosynthesis activities thus the significant effect of combined addition of biochar and fertiliser on iwue and cwue improvement under all irrigation treatments might be attributed to influence of biochar on the water use evapotranspiration by the plant hydro physical and chemical properties of the soil ajayi and horn 2016 faloye et al 2017 this might have resulted to the improvement in the iwue and cwue recorded under all the irrigation treatments the lower iwue and cwue in the control treatment f0b0 may be due to lower grain yield see tables 11 and 12 the lower grain yield obtained compared to biochar amended plots may be attributed to lower soil nutrient and water use by maize plant the results obtained in this field study showed that biochar and fertiliser played major roles in increasing thegrowth yield iwue and cwue of maize in a field study under irrigation these increases are based on the improvement of biochar on the plant water use soil hydro physical and chemical nutrient availability properties hence hypothesis i and ii were fulfilled in term of the improved field water use by maize plant soil hydro physical and chemical properties upon biochar addition despite the extreme drought condition in 2017 2018 growing season little rainfall biochar addition improved the yield of maize by minimizing the impact of drought stress the extent by which biochar could improve growth yield iwue and cwue under deficit irrigation may largely depend on the quantity of biochar added weather condition extent of drought stress and irrigation management strategy therefore combination of limited water supply with biochar might be a promising approach for enhancing crop water use efficiency crop effectiveness in using more water which translated to increased productivity of the maize in a field soil 5 conclusions with growing water demand and increasing signs of water scarcity there is an urgent need to achieve higher yield per unit water applied and used by crops fortunately there is an ample scope to improve irrigation and crop water productivity particularly in areas where yields are currently low as a result of soil infertility and limited water supply in this study the main and interactive effects of maize cob residue biochar and fertiliser on the growth yield iwue and cwue of maize was investigated in a sandy clay loam in a field experiment the main effects of the maize cob residue biochar and fertiliser were significant on the growth yield and water productivities iwue and cwue of maize under all the irrigation treatments which was attributed to improvement in the maize plant water use soil hydro physical soil water content soil bulk density total porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil water sorptivity and chemical properties nutrient availability consequent upon biochar addition also significant main effects of the soil amendments and insignificant interaction effects of the two factors biochar x fertiliser biochar x irrigation as well as the three factors are not significant p 0 05 in their effects on the growth parameters grain yield iwue and cwue showed that biochar could be used were water is limiting to improve maize growth yield iwue and cwue by minimizing drought condition on maize plant further research is in fact needed on a long term to establish the reproducibility of our results under similar and or different environmental and weather conditions as well as for meaningful and robust generalisation of our findings therefore combination of limited water supply with biochar might be a promising approach for enhancing crop water use and consequently enhancing productivity of field grown maize acknowledgement we appreciate the research grant from the tertiary education trust
