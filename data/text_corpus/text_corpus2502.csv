12510,eutrophication is a globally faced environmental issue against which water resources need to be protected as it impairs water quality threatens the safety of drinking water and hinders the sustainable development of the regional economy given severe environmental impacts and risks of eutrophication there is an urgent need for an effective method to restore eutrophic surface water bodies this study proposed an effective technical program for a composite iron carbon constructed wetland combined with a photocatalytic film wic pf to restore eutrophic water the removal efficiencies of wic pf were estimated at 81 77 6 98 for ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 79 18 5 58 for total nitrogen tn 80 45 5 55 total phosphorus tp 80 12 5 87 for chemical oxygen demand cod and 93 96 4 68 for chlorophyll a according to the experimental results compared with the pre treatment water quality the post treatment water quality improved significantly a large number of microalgae growing on wic pf exerted a significant reoxygenation effect on the treated water improving the self purification capacity of the receiving water body boosting the pollutant removal efficiency via enhancing the hydraulic performance of constructed wetlands as well as the activity of photocatalytic films may serve to improve the remediation of eutrophic water bodies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords eutrophication constructed wetland photocatalytic film reoxygenation hydraulic performance data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the eutrophication of surface water bodies has always been one of the main threats to global water security the environmental issues caused by the eutrophication of water bodies are complex for example the explosive reproduction of toxic algae 1 2 causes the death of aquatic organisms 3 4 generates water turbidity and fetid odors and destroys biodiversity 5 not only does water eutrophication adversely affect the habitat of wild life and threatens the safety of drinking water 6 8 but it also restricts the development of regional economies 9 currently surface water resources in all continents face serious water eutrophication according to an earlier survey lakes at risk of eutrophication are 54 in asia 53 in europe 28 in africa 41 in south america and 48 in north america 10 to restore eutrophic water bodies it is necessary not only to remove surplus nutrients and algae but also to mimic the original aquatic structure function ecological balance and biodiversity however it is difficult to achieve ideal results by relying on a single method 11 constructed wetlands are widely used in the field of water treatment as a green method 12 which can effectively remove pollutants and algae 13 and water bodies treated by a constructed wetland can be better restored to its original healthy state 14 in the constructed wetlands using iron carbon as the medium under the action of fec microelectrolysis fe2 produced by the anode can reduce the nitro group present in the wastewater and decompose some macromolecular organic matter into small micromolecular compounds during which fe2 and fe3 form fe3 po4 2 and fepo4 precipitating with po4 3 while fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 colloids produced by the cathode can adsorb small molecular pollutants and form large particle precipitates 15 the iron carbon constructed wetlands can better remove pollutants than the traditional constructed wetlands 16 previous studies have mainly employed the iron carbon constructed wetlands in the treatment of polluted groundwater industrial wastewater and farmland wastewater with most of the wastewater sources belonging to simulated wastewater which is different from actual wastewater but has rarely been used in the restoration of eutrophic water bodies 15 17 18 semiconductor photocatalysis is an efficient method for water treatment and has widely been used 19 its principle is based on the excitation of light under which semiconductor materials form photogenerated electrons and holes through the transition of electrons and decompose pollutants in wastewater into h2o n2 co2 and other substances through the oxidation reduction of photogenerated electron hole pairs 20 compared with other wastewater treatment technologies semiconductor photocatalysis has the advantages of simple operation mild reaction conditions green environmental protection and absence of secondary pollution 19 previous studies on semiconductor photocatalysis have mainly been carried out in indoor stable environmental conditions however semiconductor photocatalysis has rarely been applied to wastewater treatment in natural environments in previous studies most light sources of photocatalytic reactions were ultraviolet lamps 21 22 which have limited application in practical situations and are not cost effective currently there are many studies on the unilateral application of the constructed wetlands and semiconductor photocatalysis technology in wastewater treatment but only few on the application of their combination to the restoration of eutrophic water bodies this study combined an iron carbon constructed wetland with a semiconductor photocatalytic film to restore eutrophic water in the natural environment and simulated the hydraulic performance of the constructed wetland and its drivers the objective of this study was to provide a new approach for the restoration of eutrophic water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design of constructed wetland microcosms the source of influent water was a small lake at the qishan campus of fuzhou university china the water body of this lake exhibits turbidity and a gradual state of eutrophication throughout the year due to the vigorous growth of phytoplankton to improve the water quality of this lake the following three sets of composite constructed wetland systems a b and c were established near the lake and compared to select the best treatment plan a a composite iron carbon constructed wetland combined with a photocatalytic film wic pf b a composite gravel constructed wetland combined with a photocatalytic film wg pf and c a composite iron carbon constructed wetland wic the wetlands a b and c consisted of vertical and horizontal subsurface flows with a and b containing the semiconductor photocatalytic film to enhance the treatment of the water body the media of the vertical flow constructed wetland was composed of upper middle and lower layers with an effective volume of 35 l the upper layer of the media was divided into the following two types wic used iron carbon sintered into spherical shape according to the mass ratio of fe c 3 2 and wg used gravel with the media layer thickness of 20 cm and media size of 0 5 0 8 cm for the upper layer and the media layer thickness of 10 cm and 5 cm and gravel size of 1 1 8 cm and 2 3 cm for the middle and lower gravel layers respectively the media of the horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland was also composed of upper middle and lower layers with an effective volume of 30 l its upper and lower gravel media had the media layer thickness of 10 cm and 5 cm and gravel size of 1 1 8 cm and 4 6 cm respectively the middle layer media was divided into the following two types wic used iron carbon sintered into ellipsoidal shape according to the mass ratio of fe c 3 2 and wg used gravel with the media layer thickness of 20 cm and media size of 2 3 cm other parameters of the media used are listed in table s1 all the constructed wetlands were planted with cyperus alternifolius at a height of approximately 0 4 m with two plants per wetland c alternifolius belongs to the cyperaceous family which shows low soil requirements a strong ability to adapt to the environment and a developed root system conducive to absorbing nutrients in sewage and suitable for planting in wetlands 23 the design of the constructed wetlands is illustrated in fig s1 semiconductor photocatalysis was applied in the form of a photocatalytic film pf the semiconductor photocatalyst tio2 was loaded on a mesh material and the photocatalytic film was spread on the water surface to reduce the influence of water color and turbidity on light intensity 2 2 operation of experimentally constructed wetland microcosms after all the constructed wetlands were established water from the lake was directly introduced into the constructed wetland system to start the experiments the quality of the lake water is shown in table s2 hydraulic retention time hrt and experimental period are listed in table s3 considering the stability of the constructed wetlands during the initial phase of operation the running time for hrt 0 5 d was set to 39 d and the remaining time was set to 21 d 2 3 water sampling and analysis water samples were collected every three days from the start of the experiment the sampling times ranged from 14 00 to 15 00 immediately after the collection of the water samples they were sent to the laboratory for analysis of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n tn tp and cod were measured by using an ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer in accordance with relevant standards 24 chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured in situ using a portable meter and probes used in the portable analyzer were calibrated before each experiment 2 4 statistical and model analysis in this study we used origin software for visualization and image rendering and spss software for descriptive statistical analysis and analysis of variance anova at a significance level p of 0 05 solidworks software was used to build the constructed wetland model integrated computer aided engineering and manufacturing icem computational fluid dynamics cfd software was used to divide the constructed wetland model into grids fluent software was used to simulate the flow patterns in the constructed wetlands computational fluid dynamics cfd post software was used to generate the flow field distribution map 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance 3 1 1 nitrogen removal fig 1a and 1c shows the removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf for nh4 n and tn from the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 1a during the stable operation phase the overall nh4 n removal efficiency of wic pf was 81 77 6 98 significantly higher than that of wg pf 74 01 7 03 in phase i wic pf and wg pf showed similar removal efficiencies significantly higher than that of wg pf because the addition of fe increased the amount of ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase the presence of these two enzymes was beneficial for the nitration of nh4 n 25 while the high do concentration was also beneficial for the aerobic nitrification of nh4 n fig 5 26 the photocatalytic removal efficiency for nh4 n rose with the increased ph fig 6 27 in phase iii wic pf achieved the best removal efficiency for nh4 n 89 10 4 86 since the do concentration and ph of the effluent from wic pf peaked in this phase figs 5 and 6 conducive to the aerobic nitration and photocatalytic removal of nh4 n the removal effect of wic pf on nh4 n performed worse in phase iv than in phase iii mainly due to the decreased do concentration and ph which adversely affected the aerobic nitrification and photocatalytic removal efficiency for nh4 n figs 5 and 6 as shown in fig 1c during the stable operation phase the overall removal efficiency of wic pf for tn was 79 18 5 58 higher than that of wg pf 75 62 6 11 in phase i wic pf and wg pf showed similar tn removal efficiencies in the last three phases the removal efficiency of wic pf for tn was better than that of wg pf due to the strengthening of the chemical reduction of no3 n by fec microelectrolysis fig 7 28 29 in phase iii wic pf achieved the best tn removal efficiency 82 20 4 70 in contrast the removal efficiency of wic pf was better for nh4 n than for tn mainly due to the nitrification of nh4 n the tn removal efficiency of wic pf performed worse in phase iv than in phase iii due to the decreased photocatalytic removal efficiency for nh4 n as fe continued to be consumed the effect of fec microelectrolysis weakened thereby affecting the chemical reduction of no3 n as shown in fig 1b and 1d wic pf and wic differed in the removal efficiency for nh4 n and tn as shown in fig 1b during the stable operation phase the overall removal efficiency of wic pf for nh4 n was significantly higher than that of wic 76 24 7 98 mainly due to the addition of the photocatalytic film to increase the do concentration of the water fig 5 thereby strengthening the aerobic nitrification of nh4 n and photocatalysis may also have increased the nh4 n removal efficiency as shown in fig 1d following the stable operation phase the overall removal efficiency of wic pf for tn was higher than that of wic 76 09 7 88 after the addition of the photocatalytic film the wic pf induced increase was lower in the removal efficiency for tn 3 09 than that for nh4 n 5 53 mainly due to the increased aerobic nitrification of nh4 n overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis the nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies of wic pf were significantly higher than those of wg pf and the nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies of wic pf achieved the best performance in phase iii fec microelectrolysis strengthened the chemical reduction of no3 n and the addition of the photocatalytic film effectively increased the do concentration of the water thus raising the nh4 n removal efficiency of wic pf simultaneously the photocatalytic reaction enhanced the nh4 n removal efficiency however the instability of outdoor light intensity significantly impacted the photocatalytic effect 30 3 1 2 phosphorus removal fig 2a shows the tp removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf in the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 2a during the stable operation phase the overall removal efficiency of wic pf for tp was 80 45 5 55 significantly higher than that of wg pf 61 44 5 50 mainly because fe2 and fe3 produced by fec microelectrolysis were beneficial to the precipitation of po4 3 31 32 the tp removal efficiency of wic pf was slightly higher in phase iii 83 67 4 35 than in the other phases probably since ph of this phase was slightly higher than that of the other phases fig 6 which could promote the precipitation of po4 3 thus increasing the tp removal efficiency 33 as shown in fig 2d wic pf and wic differed in the tp removal efficiency during the stable operation phase the removal efficiency of wic pf for tp remained almost same compared to wic 80 37 5 49 due to the low tp concentration in the influent water after the front end constructed wetland treatment the tp concentration of the water body was close to zero thus making it difficult to reflect the effect of photocatalysis overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis the tp removal efficiency was significantly higher with wic pf than with wg pf regardless of hrt increased water ph was beneficial for the removal of tp however in this experiment the removal of tp by the photocatalytic film was not significant due to the low organic p content of the water 3 1 3 cod removal fig 3a shows the cod removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf in the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 3a during the stable operation phase the cod removal efficiency of wic pf was 80 12 5 87 significantly higher than that of wg pf 74 56 7 30 mainly due to the effect of fec microelectrolysis 15 in the first three phases the cod removal efficiency of wic pf showed a slow upward trend reaching a maximum of 83 55 4 69 in phase iii the cod removal efficiency of wic pf performed worse in phase iv than in phase iii because the decreased do concentration which affected the degradation of organic matter by aerobic microorganisms fig 5 34 as fe continued to be consumed the effect of fec microelectrolysis weakened thereby affecting the cod removal efficiency fig 3b shows the difference between the cod removal efficiencies of wic before and after the combined photocatalytic film during the stable operation phase the cod removal efficiency of wic pf was higher than that of wic 76 20 6 10 because the addition of the photocatalytic film significantly increased the do concentration of the water thereby creating favorable conditions for aerobic microorganisms to degrade organic matter 34 overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis the cod removal efficiency of wic pf was significantly higher than that of wg pf but was not significantly affected by hrt the addition of the photocatalytic film effectively increased the do concentration of the water and enhanced the degradation of organic matter by aerobic microorganisms thus improving the cod removal efficiency 3 1 4 chlorophyll a removal fig 4a shows the removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf for chlorophyll a in the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 4a during the stable operation phase the chlorophyll a removal efficiency of wic pf was 93 96 4 68 significantly higher than that of wg pf 78 67 8 54 throughout the entire process wic pf maintained a high level of removal efficiency with its highest value of 99 81 this result was because the iron carbon media had a rough surface with a larger specific surface area thus exerting a better adsorption and interception effect on algae than the other media the removal of chlorophyll a from water was mainly achieved through adsorption on and interception by algae 35 fig 4b shows the difference between the chlorophyll a removal efficiencies of wic before and after the combined photocatalytic film during the stable operation phase the removal efficiency of wic for chlorophyll a reached 93 82 5 62 with a maximum of 99 71 basically the same as that of wic pf therefore the photocatalytic film exerted no significant effect on the removal of chlorophyll a overall owing to its better adsorption and interception ability the chlorophyll a removal efficiency of wic pf was significantly better than that of wg pf but remained almost unaffected by hrt the adsorption and interception ability of the media determined the chlorophyll a removal efficiency therefore the addition of the photocatalytic film could not increase its removal efficiency 3 2 changes in the physicochemical environment 3 2 1 changes in do based on the analysis in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 3 the change in the do concentration affected the nitrification of nh4 n and the degradation of cod by aerobic microorganisms thereby affecting the removal efficiency for nh4 n and cod 26 34 as shown in fig 5 under different hrt conditions wic pf and wg pf exerted a reoxygenation effect on the treated water body with the effect of wic pf being stronger than that of wg pf the photocatalytic film played an important role in the reoxygenation of the water body because a large number of microalgae grew on the surface of the photocatalytic film fig s2 this process in turn increased the growth density of microalgae in the water theoretically the higher the growth density of microalgae the higher the oxygen concentration produced by photosynthesis and the more favorable the reoxygenation of water 36 simultaneously photocatalysis may decompose a part of water increasing its do concentration in addition fe2 and fe3 generated by fec microelectrolysis can promote the growth of plant roots whose oxygen secretion is one of the factors affecting the do concentration of the constructed wetlands 37 the increased do concentration was beneficial for the survival of aerobic microorganisms thereby increasing the removal efficiency for nh4 n and cod as shown in fig 5 the do concentration of the effluent water of wic pf was higher than that of wic in all the phases this result also verified the key role of the added photocatalytic film in the reoxygenation of the water overall wic pf and wg pf exerted a significant reoxygenation effect on the water body through photosynthesis the photocatalytic film indirectly and effectively increased the do concentration of the water fec microelectrolysis also promoted the oxygen secretion by plant roots the increased do concentration improved the nh4 n and cod removal efficiencies and the physicochemical environment of the water body 38 thus increasing the self purification capacity of the water body 3 2 2 changes in ph similarly the changing water ph affected the pollutant removal efficiency as shown in fig 6 under different hrt conditions ph of the wic pf effluent was significantly higher than that of the influent and the wg pf effluent because with the help of fec microelectrolysis a large amount of oh was generated in neutral or alkaline water thereby increasing the water ph 15 in addition microalgae attached to the surface of the photocatalytic film increased the ph value of the water body through photosynthesis 39 based on the analysis in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the increased ph value improved the photocatalytic removal efficiency for nh4 n and the removal efficiency for tp as well as the removal of some pathogens in the water 40 the change in ph affected the survival of aerobic microorganisms and the nh4 n and cod removal efficiencies in this experiment the ph value of the wic pf effluent varied between 8 10 and 8 53 suitable for the survival of eutrophic microorganisms since the most suitable ph value for the living environment is in the range of 6 5 8 5 as shown in fig 6 the ph value of the wic pf effluent was slightly higher than that of the wic effluent after the addition of the photocatalytic film this finding confirmed that the microalgae on the surface of the photocatalytic film increased the ph value of the water body through photosynthesis overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis ph of the wic pf effluent was significantly higher than that of the wg pf effluent oh generated by fec microelectrolysis effectively increased the water ph additionally ph of the wic pf effluent was also suitable for the survival of aerobic microorganisms which increased the nh4 n cod and tp removal efficiencies simultaneously the photocatalytic film indirectly increased the water ph through photosynthesis properly increasing the water ph can help to reduce pathogens in the water and improve the physicochemical environment of the water 3 3 microbial community analysis according to the microscope based detection of plankton sampled from the lake water the density of phytoplankton was estimated to be 9040 cells l 1 and the dominant species were navicula sp and microcystis sp with a density of 2560 cells l 1 table s12 the dominant zooplankton species in the lake water was sinodiaptomus sarsi with a density of 720 ind l 1 table s13 purified tailwater was analyzed under the microscope and plankton were not detected in the water sample due to their low density the photocatalytic film was covered with zoogloea the dominant species on the photocatalytic film were condylostoma vorticella and melosira granulata which increased the do concentration in a limited volume of water through photosynthesis 3 4 simulation of hydraulic properties the hydraulic performance of the constructed wetlands affects the pollutant removal efficiency 41 the hydraulic performance of the constructed wetland is positively correlated with hydraulic efficiency the better the hydraulic performance inside the wetland the stronger the ability of the wetland to remove pollutants 42 therefore the hydraulic performance of the horizontal subsurface constructed wetland in wic pf was analyzed via computational fluid dynamics as shown in figs 7 and 8 the water in wic pf mainly flows horizontally in the middle and lower layers and the flow pattern was close to plug flow however the velocity of the water flow in the upper part of the constructed wetland was extremely small and the flow state was close to static the reason for this phenomenon was that the set inlet water flow rate was low whereas the particle size and porosity of the middle and lower layer media were large and the viscous resistance and inertial resistance were small conducive to the water flow the viscous and inertial resistances of the media are determined by their particle size and porosity 43 44 from the point of view of the flow pattern horizontal thrust flow is the most ideal flow pattern 45 which can increase the hydraulic efficiency and is most beneficial for the removal of pollutants however from the perspective of the flow velocity distribution the flow velocity distribution in the horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland exhibits pronounced stratification thus resulting in a certain dead zone which decreases the hydraulic efficiency and is not conducive to the removal of pollutants 41 the results of the hydraulic performance analysis for the horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands are listed in table s14 4 conclusion this study proposed a new method of composite iron carbon constructed wetlands combined with the photocatalytic film wic pf to restore eutrophic water bodies the removal efficiencies of wic pf reached 81 77 6 98 for nh4 n 79 18 5 58 for tn 80 45 5 55 for tp 80 12 5 87 for cod and 93 96 4 68 for chlorophyll a previous studies on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies have mostly focused on how to effectively remove pollutants and have given limited importance to the do concentration of the water body to improve its self purification capacity 46 48 from the experimental results not only did wic pf effectively remove the pollutants but it also exerted a pronounced reoxygenation effect on the treated water body which improved the self purification capacity of the receiving water body an enriched restoration effect of eutrophic water can be achieved by improving the hydraulic performance of the constructed wetlands boosting the activity of the photocatalytic films is also a feasible method for improving the performance ethical approval this article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors credit

3 1 overall treatment performance 3 1 1 nitrogen removal fig 1a and 1c shows the removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf for nh4 n and tn from the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 1a during the stable operation phase the overall nh4 n removal efficiency of wic pf was 81 77 6 98 significantly higher than that of wg pf 74 01 7 03 in phase i wic pf and wg pf showed similar removal efficiencies significantly higher than that of wg pf because the addition of fe increased the amount of ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase the presence of these two

in phase iv than in phase iii due to the decreased photocatalytic removal efficiency for nh4 n as fe continued to be consumed the effect of fec microelectrolysis weakened thereby affecting the chemical reduction of no3 n as shown in fig 1b and 1d wic pf and wic differed in the removal efficiency for nh4 n and tn as shown in fig 1b during the stable operation phase the overall removal efficiency of wic pf for nh4 n was significantly higher than that of wic 76 24 7 98 mainly due to the addition of the photocatalytic film to increase the do concentration of the water fig 5 thereby strengthening the aerobic nitrification of nh4 n and photocatalysis may also have increased the nh4 n removal efficiency as shown in fig 1d following the stable operation phase the overall removal efficiency of wic pf for tn was higher than that of wic 76 09 7 88 after the addition of the photocatalytic film the wic pf induced increase was lower in the removal efficiency for tn 3 09 than that for nh4 n 5 53 mainly due to the increased aerobic nitrification of nh4 n overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis the nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies of wic pf were significantly higher than those of wg pf and the nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies of wic pf achieved the best performance in phase iii fec microelectrolysis strengthened the chemical reduction of no3 n and the addition of the photocatalytic film effectively increased the do concentration of the water thus raising the nh4 n removal efficiency of wic pf simultaneously the photocatalytic reaction enhanced the nh4 n removal efficiency however the instability of outdoor light intensity significantly impacted the photocatalytic effect 30 3 1 2 phosphorus removal fig 2a shows the tp removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf in the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 2a during the stable operation phase the overall removal efficiency of wic pf for tp was 80 45 5 55 significantly higher than that of wg pf 61 44 5 50 mainly because fe2 and fe3 produced by fec microelectrolysis were beneficial to the precipitation of po4 3 31 32 the tp removal efficiency of wic pf was slightly higher in phase iii 83 67 4 35 than in the other phases probably since ph of this phase was slightly higher than that of the other phases fig 6 which could promote the precipitation of po4 3 thus increasing the tp removal efficiency 33 as shown in fig 2d wic pf and wic differed in the tp removal efficiency during the stable operation phase the removal efficiency of wic pf for tp remained almost same compared to wic 80 37 5 49 due to the low tp concentration in the influent water after the front end constructed wetland treatment the tp concentration of the water body was close to zero thus making it difficult to reflect the effect of photocatalysis overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis the tp removal efficiency was significantly higher with wic pf than with wg pf regardless of hrt increased water ph was beneficial for the removal of tp however in this experiment the removal of tp by the photocatalytic film was not significant due to the low organic p content of the water 3 1 3 cod removal fig 3a shows the cod removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf in the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 3a during the stable operation phase the cod removal efficiency of wic pf was 80 12 5 87 significantly higher than that of wg pf 74 56 7 30 mainly due to the effect of fec microelectrolysis 15 in the first three phases the cod removal efficiency of wic pf showed a slow upward trend reaching a maximum of 83 55 4 69 in phase iii the cod removal efficiency of wic pf performed worse in phase iv than in phase iii because the decreased do concentration which affected the degradation of organic matter by aerobic microorganisms fig 5 34 as fe continued to be consumed the effect of fec microelectrolysis weakened thereby affecting the cod removal efficiency fig 3b shows the difference between the cod removal efficiencies of wic before and after the combined photocatalytic film during the stable operation phase the cod removal efficiency of wic pf was higher than that of wic 76 20 6 10 because the addition of the photocatalytic film significantly increased the do concentration of the water thereby creating favorable conditions for aerobic microorganisms to degrade organic matter 34 overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis the cod removal efficiency of wic pf was significantly higher than that of wg pf but was not significantly affected by hrt the addition of the photocatalytic film effectively increased the do concentration of the water and enhanced the degradation of organic matter by aerobic microorganisms thus improving the cod removal efficiency 3 1 4 chlorophyll a removal fig 4a shows the removal efficiencies of wic pf and wg pf for chlorophyll a in the eutrophic water under different hrt conditions as shown in fig 4a during the stable operation phase the chlorophyll a removal efficiency of wic pf was 93 96 4 68 significantly higher than that of wg pf 78 67 8 54 throughout the entire process wic pf maintained a high level of removal efficiency with its highest value of 99 81 this result was because the iron carbon media had a rough surface with a larger specific surface area thus exerting a better adsorption and interception effect on algae than the other media the removal of chlorophyll a from water was mainly achieved through adsorption on and interception by algae 35 fig 4b shows the difference between the chlorophyll a removal efficiencies of wic before and after the combined photocatalytic film during the stable operation phase the removal efficiency of wic for chlorophyll a reached 93 82 5 62 with a maximum of 99 71 basically the same as that of wic pf therefore the photocatalytic film exerted no significant effect on the removal of chlorophyll a overall owing to its better adsorption and interception ability the chlorophyll a removal efficiency of wic pf was significantly better than that of wg pf but remained almost unaffected by hrt the adsorption and interception ability of the media determined the chlorophyll a removal efficiency therefore the addition of the photocatalytic film could not increase its removal efficiency 3 2 changes in the physicochemical environment 3 2 1 changes in do based on the analysis in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 3 the change in the do concentration affected the nitrification of nh4 n and the degradation of cod by aerobic microorganisms thereby affecting the removal efficiency for nh4 n and cod 26 34 as shown in fig 5 under different hrt conditions wic pf and wg pf exerted a reoxygenation effect on the treated water body with the effect of wic pf being stronger than that of wg pf the photocatalytic film played an important role in the reoxygenation of the water body because a large number of microalgae grew on the surface of the photocatalytic film fig s2 this process in turn increased the growth density of microalgae in the water theoretically the higher the growth density of microalgae the higher the oxygen concentration produced by photosynthesis and the more favorable the reoxygenation of water 36 simultaneously photocatalysis may decompose a part of water increasing its do concentration in addition fe2 and fe3 generated by fec microelectrolysis can promote the growth of plant roots whose oxygen secretion is one of the factors affecting the do concentration of the constructed wetlands 37 the increased do concentration was beneficial for the survival of aerobic microorganisms thereby increasing the removal efficiency for nh4 n and cod as shown in fig 5 the do concentration of the effluent water of wic pf was higher than that of wic in all the phases this result also verified the key role of the added photocatalytic film in the reoxygenation of the water overall wic pf and wg pf exerted a significant reoxygenation effect on the water body through photosynthesis the photocatalytic film indirectly and effectively increased the do concentration of the water fec microelectrolysis also promoted the oxygen secretion by plant roots the increased do concentration improved the nh4 n and cod removal efficiencies and the physicochemical environment of the water body 38 thus increasing the self purification capacity of the water body 3 2 2 changes in ph similarly the changing water ph affected the pollutant removal efficiency as shown in fig 6 under different hrt conditions ph of the wic pf effluent was significantly higher than that of the influent and the wg pf effluent because with the help of fec microelectrolysis a large amount of oh was generated in neutral or alkaline water thereby increasing the water ph 15 in addition microalgae attached to the surface of the photocatalytic film increased the ph value of the water body through photosynthesis 39 based on the analysis in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the increased ph value improved the photocatalytic removal efficiency for nh4 n and the removal efficiency for tp as well as the removal of some pathogens in the water 40 the change in ph affected the survival of aerobic microorganisms and the nh4 n and cod removal efficiencies in this experiment the ph value of the wic pf effluent varied between 8 10 and 8 53 suitable for the survival of eutrophic microorganisms since the most suitable ph value for the living environment is in the range of 6 5 8 5 as shown in fig 6 the ph value of the wic pf effluent was slightly higher than that of the wic effluent after the addition of the photocatalytic film this finding confirmed that the microalgae on the surface of the photocatalytic film increased the ph value of the water body through photosynthesis overall with the help of fec microelectrolysis ph of the wic pf effluent was significantly higher than that of the wg pf effluent oh generated by fec microelectrolysis effectively increased the water ph additionally ph of the wic pf effluent was also suitable for the survival of aerobic microorganisms which increased the nh4 n cod and tp removal efficiencies simultaneously the photocatalytic film indirectly increased the water ph through photosynthesis properly increasing the water ph can help to reduce pathogens in the water and improve the physicochemical environment of the water 3 3 microbial community analysis according to the microscope based detection of plankton sampled from the lake water the density of phytoplankton was estimated to be 9040 cells l 1 and the dominant species were navicula sp and microcystis sp with a density of 2560 cells l 1 table s12 the dominant zooplankton species in the lake water was sinodiaptomus sarsi with a density of 720 ind l 1 table s13 purified tailwater was analyzed under the microscope and plankton were not detected in the water sample due to their low density the photocatalytic film was covered with zoogloea the dominant species on the photocatalytic film were condylostoma vorticella and melosira granulata which increased the do concentration in a limited volume of water through photosynthesis 3 4 simulation of hydraulic properties the hydraulic performance of the constructed wetlands affects the pollutant removal efficiency 41 the hydraulic performance of the constructed wetland is positively correlated with hydraulic efficiency the better the hydraulic performance inside the wetland the stronger the ability of the wetland to remove pollutants 42 therefore the hydraulic performance of the horizontal subsurface constructed wetland in wic pf was analyzed via computational fluid dynamics as shown in figs 7 and 8 the water in wic pf mainly flows horizontally in the middle and lower layers and the flow pattern was close to plug flow however the velocity of the water flow in the upper part of the constructed wetland was extremely small and the flow state was close to static the reason for this phenomenon was that the set inlet water flow rate was low whereas the particle size and porosity of the middle and lower layer media were large and the viscous resistance and inertial resistance were small conducive to the water flow the viscous and inertial resistances of the media are determined by their particle size and porosity 43 44 from the point of view of the flow pattern horizontal thrust flow is the most ideal flow pattern 45 which can increase the hydraulic efficiency and is most beneficial for the removal of pollutants however from the perspective of the flow velocity distribution the flow velocity distribution in the horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland exhibits pronounced stratification thus resulting in a certain dead zone which decreases the hydraulic efficiency and is not conducive to the removal of pollutants 41 the results of the hydraulic performance analysis for the horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands are listed in table s14 4 conclusion this study proposed a new method of composite iron carbon constructed wetlands combined with the photocatalytic film wic pf to restore eutrophic water bodies the removal efficiencies of wic pf reached 81 77 6 98 for nh4 n 79 18 5 58 for tn 80 45 5 55 for tp 80 12 5 87 for cod and 93 96 4 68 for chlorophyll a previous studies on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies have mostly focused on how to effectively remove pollutants and have given limited importance to the do concentration of the water body to improve its self purification capacity 46 48 from the experimental results not only did wic pf effectively remove the pollutants but it also exerted a pronounced reoxygenation effect on the treated water body which improved the self purification capacity of the receiving water body an enriched restoration effect of eutrophic water can be achieved by improving the hydraulic performance of the constructed wetlands boosting the activity of the photocatalytic films is also a feasible method for improving the performance ethical approval this article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors credit

12511,evapotranspiration et is a natural phenomenon of water loss through plants which can influence the treatment performance of constructed wetlands integrated with microbial fuel cells cw mfc the influence of et on the electrochemical performance and treatment performance of cw mfc in an actual field with real wastewater has never been studied in detail thus this research aims to explore the effects of water loss ascribed by et on different performance indicators of a cw mfc fed with municipal wastewater in actual field conditions for instance voltage and power generation internal resistance and wastewater treatment during the first 48 h of the operation of cw mfc a significant drop in the water level by 336 mm from 15 mm to 351 mm from the top surface in the cathode electrode zone due to et was recorded this water loss at the cathode enhanced cathodic reduction kinetics by increasing the oxygen saturation at the cathode thereby improving the voltage generation from 182 5 12 5 mv first 6 h when the cathode was more water saturated to 800 13 47 mv after 48 h when the cathode was air saturated due to loss of water which corresponds to the current and power density of 85 71 ma m3 and 25 71 mw m3 respectively together with this significant coulombic efficiency ce and net energy recovery ner of 11 95 and 2 44 wh kg cod was achieved the internal resistance of cw mfc was also noted to decrease from 1000 ω in the first 6 h to 700 ω at the end of 48 h after 48 h of the observation period the cw mfc could achieve chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency of 80 7 98 73 17 5 01 and 75 60 1 65 respectively this study demonstrates a substantial effect on the performance of cw mfc due to et water loss in the actual field thus et is a critical aspect and worth considering for large scale implementation of cw mfcs especially in tropical regions or with dense plantations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords evapotraspiration wastewater treatment bioelectricity generation cathode kinetics water level internal resistance data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rapid population growth and intensive industrialization have elevated a growing need for new resources and thus forced society to consider wastewater as one of the potential sources of water energy and nutrients 1 annually around 1000 km3 of wastewater is generated around the world in which municipal wastewater contributes to 300 km3 mainly containing organics and some nutrients thus municipal wastewater can be considered a futuristic source of fresh water 2 however present wastewater treatment technologies are usually cost and energy intensive thus there is an imperative need to consider an approach that is less complex cost effective eco friendly and sustainable 1 in this context constructed wetlands cws have been widely used as wastewater treatment systems due to their intrinsic properties to remove a wide range of organic matter and nutrients 3 cws have also been acknowledged as recreational aesthetic and eco friendly technology that can promote ecological balance 4 among different types of cws the subsurface flow cws are renowned mainly for treating municipal wastewater 5 however large land area requirement by cws for wastewater treatment is still a bottleneck of the technology resulting from low treatment efficiency by largely dominated slow anaerobic processes 6 thus to achieve a higher treatment efficiency cws need an extensive surface area 6 meanwhile microbial fuel cells mfcs have drawn increasing attention among researchers during the last decade to adopt as a sustainable device for wastewater treatment with a low carbon footprint and energy recovery mfcs utilize electroactive microorganisms as a catalyst at solid conductive material based anodes as electron acceptors for the oxidation of organic and inorganic pollutants in an anaerobic environment with the generation of bioelectricity 7 nevertheless mfcs are still struggling to be scaled up due to several challenges among which the electrode redox kinetics reactor configurations and process parameters are the persisting challenges to be addressed 6 integration of mfcs with cws creates a new synergy between these two complementary technologies and thus divulges higher probabilities towards practical applications in wastewater treatment sectors 6 8 for instance an amalgamated technology i e cw mfc was first introduced in 2010 and demonstrated its promising approach for updating the traditional cws containing both the aerobic and anaerobic zones suitable to maintain the cathodic and the anodic environment respectively 9 this new approach not only found the potential to enhance pollutant removal efficiency but also revealed an ability to extract waste energy within the flux of wastewater in the form of electricity 10 13 52 as far as the design is concerned a typical cw mfc consists of an anode which is buried in a deeper zone anaerobic of the treatment bed whereas the cathode is placed at air water interface at the anode and the cathode electrode graphite granules are utilized which can assist i vegetation support ii high biofilm formation due to its porous nature and iii filtration of pollutants 14 furthermore the presence of electrically conductive material i e anode granular graphite in the anaerobic region improves the availability of electron acceptor thereby enhancing redox kinetics 6 cw mfcs has been explored widely in the past few years for wastewater treatment efficiency but only a handful of studies have tested cw mfc with municipal wastewater in scaled up pilot scale project as listed in table 1 in mfcs the performance of the cathode is generally considered a bottleneck due to sluggish oxygen reduction reaction orr therefore several researchers have tried to develop sustainable catalysts to improve the orr in mfcs 15 16 however in the case of cw mfcs the water column thickness at the cathode is highly important for oxygen diffusion a thin water column could be enriched with diffused oxygen hence avoiding substrate limitation to achieve high orr kinetics for example in 2016 corbella et al 5 explored the effect of water level variation at the cathode by changing the position of the cathode on the performance of phragmites australis planted cw mfc the study revealed 40 lower electricity generation at high water levels lesser air diffusion due to higher water saturation in comparison to lower water lever higher diffusion due to lesser water saturation 5 however there is no study in the actual field with real municipal wastewater in tropical conditions where et is a major factor et majorly changes the air diffusion level in the cathode by changing the water level inside the cw mfc moreover in contrast with unplanted cw mfcs planted cw mfcs can naturally exhibit higher variation in water column thickness through et et is the aggregate sum of evaporation and transpiration where evaporation takes place from the substrate soil gravel etc and transpiration occurs by the plant system via the plant leaf stem and root substrate system 17 the et allows movement of water from the soil system to plant then plant to the atmosphere eventually assisting biomass production in plants at the same time the process of et leads to water loss in the water column although daily water loss could not be the same since et is influenced by several environmental factors mainly temperature and humidity 18 19 in planted cw mfcs it has been reported that when the water loss due to evapotranspiration exceeds 2 5 mm d then it can significantly affect the treatment efficiency 20 the daily water loss estimated by yang et al 21 in planted cw mfc was about 13 73 10 82 and 1 71 higher than unplanted cw mfc with iris pseudacorus lythrum salicaria and phragmites australis planted systems respectively whereas in another cw mfc study by yang et al 22 with similar vegetation it was reported to 4 4 for iris pseudacorus and 1 78 for phragmites australis higher compared to unplanted control cw mfc these studies indicate that in planted cw mfc et could play a crucial role in changing the water level at the cathode zone and thus the availability of diffused oxygen for instance higher et can lower the water level at the cathode therefore higher oxygen saturation at the cathode can be expected which can enhance the redox kinetics eventually enhancing the electricity generation 5 23 24 in fact water loss due to et can also dramatically change the concentration of contaminants in the wastewater which will also have a certain effect on the treatment efficiency 3 altogether et is a critical aspect to be considered particularly for large scale cw mfcs with dense plantations 25 so far most of the cw mfc studies were investigated in the lab environment and utilized synthetic wastewater instead of real domestic or municipal wastewater until now no study has collectively investigated the effect of et on the treatment and electrochemical performance of scaled up cw mfc in an real field setting with real wastewater treatment therefore for the first time this study investigated the performance of canna indica planted scaled up cw mfc fed with real municipal wastewater the aim of this study was to find out the influence and correlation of different parameters such as temperature relative humidity water level air cathode volume and et on the overall performance of cw mfc in terms of bioelectricity generation and wastewater treatment best of our knowledge this is the first study that explores the effects of et on different treatment and electrochemical performance indicators of a scaled up cw mfc system 16 7 l with real municipal wastewater in the actual field for advancing the cw mfc towards realistic application in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction of cw mfc mesocosm a cylindrical shape cw mfc was fabricated using a linear low density polyethylene lldpe container measuring 60 cm high and 32 5 cm in diameter lisa plastics patia bhubaneswar india the cw mfc had three sampling ports the first port was placed at 5 5 cm from the water freeboard the second port at 33 cm and the bottom port at 57 cm the bottom most region of cw mfc was bedded with boulders of an average diameter of 20 25 mm up to 10 cm height to serve as a supporting layer and avoid clogging just over the boulder layer a pvc pipe of 20 mm ø was placed to serve as i gas vent ii water level measurement due to et loss and iii running of continuous up flow systems if required later a 15 cm thick layer of graphite granules 5 8 mm ø to act as an anodic layer was placed on top of the boulder bed a cylindrical graphite rod 15 cm 1 cm diameter height of 400 55 cm2 area was inserted in this layer to function as electron charge collector thereafter gravel separation gravel ø 5 8 mm of 20 cm was given through double lining of a perforated average 10 holes of 5 0 mm ø high density polyethylene hdpe liner at both ends of gravel layers on top of the upper hdpe layer of the liner a 15 cm of granular graphite layer is placed for working as the cathode a sapling of canna indica was planted in the cathodic zone of cw mfc as shown in fig 1 a at the cathode a cylindrical graphite rod was placed in cathode zone as electron charge dispenser 15 cm 1 cm diameter height 3 canna indica sapling was rinsed five times with running tap water to remove the dirt its root length shoot length and weight was measured as 14 cm 77 cm and 130 g respectively uprooted c indica had an average of 3 leaves before transplantation to cw mfc graphite granules were washed with diluted acid and later with tap water to remove dirt and unwanted chemicals and introduce exfoliation to enhance the surface area both anode and cathode charge collector dispenser was connected with insulated copper wire of 1 5 mm diameter and sealed with epoxy at one end another end is left open for continuous voltage and current measurement as shown in fig 1 a the net void volume of scaled up cw mfc was 16 7 l in fig 1 a a

monitoring and measurements cw mfc was fed with real municipal wastewater thus possessing fluctuating characteristic condition with cod ammonium and phosphate lying in the average range of 125 35 77 93 mg l 16 79 6 08 mg l and 5 12 2 43 mg l respectively throughout the course of the experiment initially cw mfc was operated for 180 days in batch mode with municipal wastewater for acclimation to stable voltage generation and canna indica vegetation growth during the acclimatization period wastewater was changed every alternate day and voltage was recorded to determine the steady state condition of cw mfc once the steady performance was achieved cw mfc was connected with external resistance of 1000 ω equivalent to internal resistance evaluated through polarization further the same cw mfc with already matured biofilm was used to test the effects of et on the performance during the entire experiment wastewater was collected from institute s csir institute minerals and materials technology sewage chamber into a 100 l llpde tank and mixed well manually with bamboo sticks approximately 50 ml was collected as influent wastewater in a polyethylene bottle thereafter collected wastewater was fed to the cw mfc system the initial working volume of the system was 16 7 l this time cw mfc filling was considered as 0 h of batch loading wastewater was fed to cw mfc for various contact times such as 8 h 24 h and 48 h collection of treated sample and feeding of new loads of wastewater was done using the following procedure i cw mfc was entirely decanted in llpde tank after each contact time ii decanted wastewater was mixed thoroughly before sample collection volume collected 25 ml iii decanted volume was also measured for evaluation of evapotranspiration et and iv cw mfc was refilled again with the same decanted wastewater this entire cycle of 48 h was carried out once in a week after end of rainy season and continued for a period of 6 months from september to february further collected samples at each 6 h 24 h and 48 h were stored at 4 c in 50 ml polyethylene bottle and analyzed on the day followed by sample collection for chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 3 using apha standard protocols i e 5220d closed reflux colorimetric method 4500f phenate method and 4500 p d stannous chloride method respectively 26 thereafter the percentage removal of ammonium cod and phosphate was estimated the performance parameters including water level measurement mm voltage generation mv temperature c relative humidity internal resistance ω and et l were also measured temperature c and relative humidity rh were measured by means of a hygrometer ct thmo h11j 029160 digital temperature humidity meter india voltage generation was recorded on a daily basis with a digital handheld multimeter fluke 17b usa the polarization experiment was performed at different points of time viz at 0 h 24 h and 48 h using variable external resistances ranging from 10 kω to 100 ω the internal resistances were determined using ohm s law measuring the tangent value of the voltage vs current curve current density and power density were calculated by dividing generated current and power with an anodic volume of cw mfc further coulombic efficiency ce was calculated using eq 1 which represents amount of organic matter converted to electrical current

80 c till no longer weight reduction was observed dry weight dw plant biomass production was measured further it is very important to note that the entire experiment was carried out in winter season from september to february in the east region of india i e bhubaneswar odisha which experiences a typical tropical climate and remains hot and humid throughout the year and winters are often marked by hot sunshine and persistent humidity lying 65 throughout the year for a better understanding of the approaches involved in the experimentation for influence of et on municipal wastewater treatment efficiency and simultaneous electricity generation performance of upscaled cw mfc in a tropical region a detailed flow chart is presented in supplementary file fig s1 2 3 et and treatment efficiency assessment most of the reported cw mfc studies have not considered et during the calculation of treatment efficiency large loss of water can be experienced by the cw mfc systems operating in the actual field due to et and can significantly influence the removal efficiency of the system to determine treatment efficiency influenced by et the following eqs 3 4 and 5 were used for calculating

mg l 3 result and discussion 3 1 plant growth assessment canna indica was chosen as the model plant for cw mfc due to its water loving feature and versatile growing pattern in the indian environment we have noted with the visual observation that there was continuous growth in the plants throughout the experimental period the summer season was reported to be optimum for the growth of this plant whereas in winter a few leaves turned yellow may be due to lower atmospheric temperature at the time of harvest canna indica roots were found to be tightly bound to the graphite granules with significantly dense root system compared to initially planted sapling at the cathodic region revealing graphite granules as a plant compatible material capable of supporting vegetation growth fig 1 c 28 at the end of the experiment i e 180 days significant growth in the plant in terms of stem and root was observed during this period the stem grew up from 77 0 cm to 131 06 cm and the root length from 14 0 cm to 36 57 cm the dry biomass of canna indica planted in cw mfc above ground stem and leaves and underground roots was noted to be 392 8 g and 105 9 g respectively accordingly the net total dry biomass production was found to be 48 89 kg m2 of planted area in cw mfc at the end of the experimental period which was significantly higher than other vegetation types used in cw mfc such as iris pseudacorus 3 60 kg m2 lythrum salicaria 2 37 kg m2 and phragmites australis 0 49 kg m2 21 higher canna indica biomass production in the cw mfc matrix could improve the overall performance via the following possible mechanisms i high et due to higher growth of the plants and higher leave surface area of canna indica ii enhanced oxygen reduction reaction by root aeration due to high root biomass growth thereby enhancing bioelectricity production 3 iii supporting the growth of electroactive bacteria in the root zone helping to improve bio catalytic reaction 1 iv reduce the internal resistance of the reactor by enhancing biodegradation potential and current flux 1 and v assimilate high nutrients matter overall improving the pollutant removing efficiency 3 besides the presence of vegetation in cw mfcs also provides an additional advantage as it is a co2 neutral process due to the ability of plants to sequester atmospheric co2 into biomass 29 3 2 effect of temperature and humidity on evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is a combination of two processes viz evaporation water loss from open water bodies and transpiration water loss from living plant surface et process is dependent on several important factors such as net solar radiation wind speed the surface area of the water body type and density of vegetation cover root depth moisture availability and season of the year 30 in this study wastewater volume was estimated at different time intervals of 0 h 6 h 24 h 30 h and 48 h for determination of water loss through et starting at 12 00 pm noon as 0 h since environmental factors like rh and temperature influence et water volume loss differed for different time intervals at 0 h 16 7 l effluent was fed to the cw mfc system which gradually decreased by 3 1 0 26 l during the first 6 h another 1 3 0 3 l during 12 24 h another 1 95 0 29 l during 24 30 h and another 1 1 0 25 l during 42 48 h this means that during 48 h the total et volume loss was 7 45 l which decreased the actual effluent volume from 16 7 l to 9 25 l from fig 2 it can be noted that the highest et loss took place in 0 6 h i e 12 00 h to 18 00 h but the highest relative humidity and temperature were recorded between 42 and 48 h and 24 and 30 h of operation respectively at the same time the second highest et loss occurred at the highest temperature hours 24 30 h corbella et al 5 also reported similar et loss from 12 00 h to 18 00 h in a pilot scale cw mfc planted with phragmites australis vegetation in addition pedescoll et al 24 even reported a shift in et peak in cws planted with different vegetation while considering day night variations where et increased from 0 mm day in the early morning and reached the peak of 80 mm day and 60 mm day in mid day and decreased progressively to 40 mm day and 15 mm day in the night time with typha augustifolia and phragmites australis planted hydroponic cw also et rates could vary depending on the water use efficiency of different vegetation for above ground biomass production the highest et loss in the initial hours 0 6 h could be due to high surface evaporation along with transpiration since the water level was high however with time surface evaporation decreased with a gradual decrease in water level which may have resulted in low et during the final hours of the experiment similar results of decreased et with an increase in water table depth were also reported in a field scale et study 31 in fig 2 it can also be seen that high rh hours 42 48 h enforced the lowest et loss this could be due to the lower and negative correlation of et with rh as reported by papaevangelou et al 32 3 3 effect of evapotranspiration on cathode exposed to air fig 3 depicts the increment in the depth of air exposed cathode with water loss due to et from the system from 0 h to 48 h it is observed that the highest water loss due to et was observed at the end of 6 h but surprisingly highest cathode water column height reduction of 99 mm was noticed in 24 30 h this is possible due to the high environment temperature recorded around 36 83 1 06 c during 24 30 h which caused in evaporation of water the least reduction in the water column was observed between 42 and 48 h corresponding to the least water loss through et due to comparatively lower environmental temperature 34 96 1 48 c and water level reaching far from the root system however the water column was significantly reduced up to 336 mm at the end of 48 h which enhanced the availability of oxygen dissolved oxygen at the cathode due to the high diffusion of atmospheric air into the cathode zone water loss due to et in canna indica planted cw mfc system has induced notable variation in water level in the cathode zone and therefore it can influence redox conditions of the anode and cathode zones of the cw mfc system the decreased water level at the cathode in cw mfc implies an increase of cathode exposure in air thus could promote oxygen diffusion in the empty cathode suggesting improvement in cathode kinetics which generally act as a limitation in cw mfc due to slow kinetics resulting from oxygen scarcity 5 23 33 these results are in agreement with the findings of pedescoll et al 24 revealing a positive relationship with linear regression between et and the redox state of horizontal cws planted with different vegetation which promoted the natural aeration of filter medium due to et thus favorable oxidized conditions confirm the influence of vegetation not only on et rates but also on the redox state of cws 3 4 effect of cathode exposed to air on voltage generation cw mfc voltage was noted to increase with the decrease in water level owing to an increase in exposure of cathode with air in cw mfc fig 4 during the first 6 h of the study after decanting and restarting the cw mfc for et test experiments steady cell voltage was not observed which is possibly due to the time required to induce the natural mediators for microbial growth or overcoming the air diffusion shock during decanting it is generally considered a lag phase period 34 this lag phase can also be favorable for maintaining the redox potential gradient between the anodic and cathodic region of cw mfc which is lost due to easy diffusion of oxygen while decanting and restarting the reactor for et experiments at 0 h 7 at the start of 24 h cell voltage increased to 182 5 12 5 mv which gradually increased to 540 22 31 mv by the end of 30 h to 625 mv 24 12 on 42 h and finally up to 800 mv 13 47 at the end of 48 h it can be noted that the output cell voltages were higher in the daytime as compared to night time this could be possible because in the daytime wetland plants release oxygen from root exudates creating more suitable aerobic conditions at the cathode which enhance of electrical output 35 another possible reason could be a substantial decrement in water level at the daytime resulting from et loss which enhanced oxygen diffusion in the cathodic region and hence enhanced the oxygen reduction kinetics this voltage generation at 48 h was significantly higher compared to a similar kind of recent study in which cw mfc planted with canna indica could produce an average voltage of 231 53 mv during 48 h of hydraulic retention time 36 in addition an increase in cathode column exposure to air played a vital role this study noted a linear increase in cell voltage after 24 h followed by a reduction of the water column in the cathode side that apparently increased dissolved oxygen concentration due to air diffusion in this zone the achieved results are in agreement with corbella et al 5 displaying the major governing factor for enhanced voltage generation as the availability of oxygen at the cathode which was related to water level variation caused by the plant s evapotranspiration although after the end of the experimental period i e 180 days when plants were harvested a significant drop in cell voltage from 800 13 47 mv to 80 50 45 mv was observed in 48 h of the experimental period this could be possibly due to i disturbance in the cathodic region since roots were tightly bound to graphite granules and were passively aerating the cathode after their removal i e after harvesting oxygen was heavily depleted which reduced the oxygen reduction rate considerably and thereby the overall decrease in cell voltage was observed and ii low diffusion of atmospheric oxygen in the cathode column due to significant reduction in water level drop in cathode region from 336 mm with planted cw mfc to just 25 10 mm after harvesting in 48 h a very lower water level drop in the cw mfc system after the harvesting of plants is because water loss can occur only through evaporation which was also very less as the water surface was not directly exposed to the atmosphere due to subsurface constructed wetlands conditions in current cw mfc 3 5 influence of cathode exposure to air on internal resistance and electricity generation as discussed earlier the water level profile was noted to be decreased with time at the cathode side due to et based water loss which in turn affected the electrical performance of cw mfc on the positive side as a result of more oxygen availability due to air diffusion to the spaces which was vacated by water polarization was conducted to study the power generation profile of cw mfc at different times viz 0 h 24 h and 48 h in association with the et losses similar to those performed by other researchers 15 16 in general due to irreversible losses i e overpotentials the actual output cell voltage is always less than the theoretically calculated voltage of the redox reactions occurring at the cathode and anode 37 overpotentials can arise in both the cathode and anode however the cathodic overpotential losses primarily limit the performance of cw mfc or mfc these overpotentials are defined as activation losses concentration overpotential and ohmic losses which can be identified in polarization curves 37 in particular cathodic activation losses are attributed to reaction interface area temperature and oxidant concentration whereas cathodic ohmic losses are due to the charge transfer resistance of the system while concentration and activation overpotential is related to the energy required for the supply of oxygen in the reaction interface followed by the energy requirement for its reduction 5 23 thus both activation and concentration overpotential rely on oxygen concentration results revealed a high potential of 800 13 47 mv at 48 h followed by 540 22 31 for 24 h and 182 5 12 5 mv for 0 h fig 5 fig 5 also revealed that the internal resistance decreased from 1000 ω 0 h to 900 ω 24 h and eventually to 700 ω at the end of 48 h which is clearly indicating that the cw mfc in 48 h had lowest ohmic overpotential losses with a gradual decrease in the internal resistances enhancement in current density was found and noted as 85 71 ma m3 65 71 ma m3 and 8 28 ma m3 for 48 h 24 h and 0 h respectively following a similar trend at 48 h cw mfc could achieve a maximum power density of 25 71 mw m3 which significantly surpassed the value of 15 11 mw m3 and 0 480 mw m3 for 24 h and 0 h it is confirmed from the results that water losses with time by et provide vacant space for more oxygen diffusion at the cathode with time which eventually increases the oxygen saturation thereby enhancing cathode performance furthermore the columbic efficiency ce of cw mfc was also computed at 24 h and 48 h this study noted an increase in the ce from 3 8 at 24 h to 11 95 at 48 h of the experimental period three times increase in ce also confirmed enhanced cathodic performance which resulted in a high current recovery in addition to this the ner of cw mfc mesocosm at 48 h was calculated as 2 44 wh kg cod moreover the achieved ce in the present research work is significantly higher than other pilot scales scaled up cw mfc studies undertaken as listed in table 1 3 6 pollutant removal efficiency cod ammonium and phosphate removal efficiencies were estimated at 6 h 24 h and 48 h in comparison to the initial concentration of pollutants 0 h in municipal wastewater this study estimated pollutant concentration considering the et losses using eqs 3 4 and 5 table s2 represents pollutant removal efficiencies with and without considering et in the supplementary file the overall removal efficiency of cod ammonium and phosphate was noted to be 80 7 98 73 17 5 01 and 75 60 1 65 respectively in 48 h duration fig 6 in particular the effluent cod removal efficiency of 57 06 5 11 73 30 2 87 and 80 1 98 was observed in 6 h 24 h and 48 h respectively with the corresponding final concentration of 85 11 2 mg l 80 4 70 mg l and 39 2 29 mg l respectively the results are in accordance with a recently published study where a high cod removal of 88 1 was achieved in a batch mode operated canna indica planted vertical cw mfc 18 likewise corbella et al 5 reported cod removal of 61 19 when the cathode was positioned 5 cm below the water level and 60 10 when the cathode was placed at the same level of water in phragmites australis planted pilot scale cw mfc in the case of cod removal plant roots might have played a role by providing a microaerobic zone for more organic degradation along with the availability of a high surface area for microbial growth and activity 18 48 this might have led to direct cod reduction by heterotrophic and electroactive bacteria available in the root zone area 3 in addition the high biomass of canna indica assisted the availability of more carbon sources as fuel for microorganisms to support microbial activity 1 similar results were demonstrated in a study where the impact on different plant species of a saline environment was investigated in cws canna indica provided a large surface area for microbial growth along with high average root activity 49 moreover the presence of conductive materials both charge collector and graphite granules supported high microbial attachment for biofilm growth owing to its porous nature and act as artificial electron acceptors in the anodic zone of cw mfc thus promoting the degradation of organic materials 6 ammonium removal efficiency in contact time of 48 h was noted to be 73 13 5 01 which was relatively higher than what was obtained in 6 h and 24 h i e 59 39 2 21 68 73 4 01 and respectively these results are also in agreement with other findings wherein the highest ammonium removal of 88 7 2 5 was achieved with iris pseudacorus planted cw mfc and least with unplanted cw mfc i e 43 5 9 1 also iris pseudacorus accounted highest biomass growth along with the highest uptake of nutrients 21 similarly other researchers reported average ammonium removal efficiency of 60 40 with variations in cathode position respective to the water level in planted cw mfc 5 generally due to the absence of electron acceptors anaerobic reactions are usually slow in cws 45 however the reasonable explanation for high ammonium removal in canna indica planted cw mfc could be i conductive material acting as an electron acceptor in absent or oxygen deficient regions thus assisting electron transport mechanism for the microbes 50 ii better environment for the growth of nitrifying bacteria i e nitrobacter nitrosomonas in high biomass canna indica rhizosphere where oxidation of ammonium to nitrate could take place in the aerobic microsites adjacent to roots and rhizomes 3 iii high oxygen diffusion in the cw mfc column due to increase in exposure of cathode with air because of high et 33 iv uptake of ammonium as a nutrient by highly grown canna indica 1 and v adsorption on high biomass produced in the wetland matrix by canna indica vegetation 21 ammonium removal is also advantageous for easy assimilation in the microbial and plant biomass due to its less mobile and biologically amenable nature among several other forms of nitrogen 29 phosphate removal was estimated as 67 16 5 33 71 10 2 17 and 75 60 1 65 for 6 h 24 h and 48 h respectively phosphorus uptake through canna indica could be the probable reason for high phosphate removal along with adsorption on filter media various studies also support this phenomenon due to the well known fact that water loving macrophytes aquatic plants like canna indica have a binding capacity to uptake phosphorous from wastewater to their tissues 51 4 conclusion considerable bio electricity enhancement and efficient pollutant removal efficiency were observed with canna indica planted cw mfc water losses via et exposed cathode with air due to water level drop in cathode affects the performance of canna indica planted cw mfc in a positive direction high water loss from the cathode zone creates vacant spaces which were filled by atmospheric air by diffusion and expose the cathode to atmospheric oxygen this situation has developed air cathode like conditions in canna indica planted cw mfc producing 25 71 mw m3 power density and 85 71 ma m3 current density with a ce of 11 95 in contact time of 48 h in canna indica planted cw mfc a drop in the water level by 336 mm in the cathode electrode zone was recorded this water loss at the cathode improved cathodic reduction kinetics it improves the voltage generation from 182 5 12 5 mv to 800 13 47 mv at the same time pollutant concentration in terms of cod ammonium and phosphate substantially reduced to 80 7 98 73 17 5 01 and 75 60 1 65 respectively this study suggests an important role of et in the performance of cw mfc which should be considered while designing large scale systems for real life applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests

12511,evapotranspiration et is a natural phenomenon of water loss through plants which can influence the treatment performance of constructed wetlands integrated with microbial fuel cells cw mfc the influence of et on the electrochemical performance and treatment performance of cw mfc in an actual field with real wastewater has never been studied in detail thus this research aims to explore the effects of water loss ascribed by et on different performance indicators of a cw mfc fed with municipal wastewater in actual field conditions for instance voltage and power generation internal resistance and wastewater treatment during the first 48 h of the operation of cw mfc a significant drop in the water level by 336 mm from 15 mm to 351 mm from the top surface in the cathode electrode zone due to et was recorded this water loss at the cathode enhanced cathodic reduction kinetics by increasing the oxygen saturation at the cathode thereby improving the voltage generation from 182 5 12 5 mv first 6 h when the cathode was more water saturated to 800 13 47 mv after 48 h when the cathode was air saturated due to loss of water which corresponds to the current and power density of 85 71 ma m3 and 25 71 mw m3 respectively together with this significant coulombic efficiency ce and net energy recovery ner of 11 95 and 2 44 wh kg cod was achieved the internal resistance of cw mfc was also noted to decrease from 1000 ω in the first 6 h to 700 ω at the end of 48 h after 48 h of the observation period the cw mfc could achieve chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency of 80 7 98 73 17 5 01 and 75 60 1 65 respectively this study demonstrates a substantial effect on the performance of cw mfc due to et water loss in the actual field thus et is a critical aspect and worth considering for large scale implementation of cw mfcs especially in tropical regions or with dense plantations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords evapotraspiration wastewater treatment bioelectricity generation cathode kinetics water level internal resistance data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rapid population growth and intensive industrialization have elevated a growing need for new resources and thus forced society to consider wastewater as one of the potential sources of water energy and nutrients 1 annually around 1000 km3 of wastewater is generated around the world in which municipal wastewater contributes to 300 km3 mainly containing organics and some nutrients thus municipal wastewater can be considered a futuristic source of fresh water 2 however present wastewater treatment technologies are usually cost and energy intensive thus there is an imperative need to consider an approach that is less complex cost effective eco friendly and sustainable 1 in this context constructed wetlands cws have been widely used as wastewater treatment systems due to their intrinsic properties to remove a wide range of organic matter and nutrients 3 cws have also been acknowledged as recreational aesthetic and eco friendly technology that can promote ecological balance 4 among different types of cws the subsurface flow cws are renowned mainly for treating municipal wastewater 5 however large land area requirement by cws for wastewater treatment is still a bottleneck of the technology resulting from low treatment efficiency by largely dominated slow anaerobic processes 6 thus to achieve a higher treatment efficiency cws need an extensive surface area 6 meanwhile microbial fuel cells mfcs have drawn increasing attention among researchers during the last decade to adopt as a sustainable device for wastewater treatment with a low carbon footprint and energy recovery mfcs utilize electroactive microorganisms as a catalyst at solid conductive material based anodes as electron acceptors for the oxidation of organic and inorganic pollutants in an anaerobic environment with the generation of bioelectricity 7 nevertheless mfcs are still struggling to be scaled up due to several challenges among which the electrode redox kinetics reactor configurations and process parameters are the persisting challenges to be addressed 6 integration of mfcs with cws creates a new synergy between these two complementary technologies and thus divulges higher probabilities towards practical applications in wastewater treatment sectors 6 8 for instance an amalgamated technology i e cw mfc was first introduced in 2010 and demonstrated its promising approach for updating the traditional cws containing both the aerobic and anaerobic zones suitable to maintain the cathodic and the anodic environment respectively 9 this new approach not only found the potential to enhance pollutant removal efficiency but also revealed an ability to extract waste energy within the flux of wastewater in the form of electricity 10 13 52 as far as the design is concerned a typical cw mfc consists of an anode which is buried in a deeper zone anaerobic of the treatment bed whereas the cathode is placed at air water interface at the anode and the cathode electrode graphite granules are utilized which can assist i vegetation support ii high biofilm formation due to its porous nature and iii filtration of pollutants 14 furthermore the presence of electrically conductive material i e anode granular graphite in the anaerobic region improves the availability of electron acceptor thereby enhancing redox kinetics 6 cw mfcs has been explored widely in the past few years for wastewater treatment efficiency but only a handful of studies have tested cw mfc with municipal wastewater in scaled up pilot scale project as listed in table 1 in mfcs the performance of the cathode is generally considered a bottleneck due to sluggish oxygen reduction reaction orr therefore several researchers have tried to develop sustainable catalysts to improve the orr in mfcs 15 16 however in the case of cw mfcs the water column thickness at the cathode is highly important for oxygen diffusion a thin water column could be enriched with diffused oxygen hence avoiding substrate limitation to achieve high orr kinetics for example in 2016 corbella et al 5 explored the effect of water level variation at the cathode by changing the position of the cathode on the performance of phragmites australis planted cw mfc the study revealed 40 lower electricity generation at high water levels lesser air diffusion due to higher water saturation in comparison to lower water lever higher diffusion due to lesser water saturation 5 however there is no study in the actual field with real municipal wastewater in tropical conditions where et is a major factor et majorly changes the air diffusion level in the cathode by changing the water level inside the cw mfc moreover in contrast with unplanted cw mfcs planted cw mfcs can naturally exhibit higher variation in water column thickness through et et is the aggregate sum of evaporation and transpiration where evaporation takes place from the substrate soil gravel etc and transpiration occurs by the plant system via the plant leaf stem and root substrate system 17 the et allows movement of water from the soil system to plant then plant to the atmosphere eventually assisting biomass production in plants at the same time the process of et leads to water loss in the water column although daily water loss could not be the same since et is influenced by several environmental factors mainly temperature and humidity 18 19 in planted cw mfcs it has been reported that when the water loss due to evapotranspiration exceeds 2 5 mm d then it can significantly affect the treatment efficiency 20 the daily water loss estimated by yang et al 21 in planted cw mfc was about 13 73 10 82 and 1 71 higher than unplanted cw mfc with iris pseudacorus lythrum salicaria and phragmites australis planted systems respectively whereas in another cw mfc study by yang et al 22 with similar vegetation it was reported to 4 4 for iris pseudacorus and 1 78 for phragmites australis higher compared to unplanted control cw mfc these studies indicate that in planted cw mfc et could play a crucial role in changing the water level at the cathode zone and thus the availability of diffused oxygen for instance higher et can lower the water level at the cathode therefore higher oxygen saturation at the cathode can be expected which can enhance the redox kinetics eventually enhancing the electricity generation 5 23 24 in fact water loss due to et can also dramatically change the concentration of contaminants in the wastewater which will also have a certain effect on the treatment efficiency 3 altogether et is a critical aspect to be considered particularly for large scale cw mfcs with dense plantations 25 so far most of the cw mfc studies were investigated in the lab environment and utilized synthetic wastewater instead of real domestic or municipal wastewater until now no study has collectively investigated the effect of et on the treatment and electrochemical performance of scaled up cw mfc in an real field setting with real wastewater treatment therefore for the first time this study investigated the performance of canna indica planted scaled up cw mfc fed with real municipal wastewater the aim of this study was to find out the influence and correlation of different parameters such as temperature relative humidity water level air cathode volume and et on the overall performance of cw mfc in terms of bioelectricity generation and wastewater treatment best of our knowledge this is the first study that explores the effects of et on different treatment and electrochemical performance indicators of a scaled up cw mfc system 16 7 l with real municipal wastewater in the actual field for advancing the cw mfc towards realistic application in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction of cw mfc mesocosm a cylindrical shape cw mfc was fabricated using a linear low density polyethylene lldpe container measuring 60 cm high and 32 5 cm in diameter lisa plastics patia bhubaneswar india the cw mfc had three sampling ports the first port was placed at 5 5 cm from the water freeboard the second port at 33 cm and the bottom port at 57 cm the bottom most region of cw mfc was bedded with boulders of an average diameter of 20 25 mm up to 10 cm height to serve as a supporting layer and avoid clogging just over the boulder layer a pvc pipe of 20 mm ø was placed to serve as i gas vent ii water level measurement due to et loss and iii running of continuous up flow systems if required later a 15 cm thick layer of graphite granules 5 8 mm ø to act as an anodic layer was placed on top of the boulder bed a cylindrical graphite rod 15 cm 1 cm diameter height of 400 55 cm2 area was inserted in this layer to function as electron charge collector thereafter gravel separation gravel ø 5 8 mm of 20 cm was given through double lining of a perforated average 10 holes of 5 0 mm ø high density polyethylene hdpe liner at both ends of gravel layers on top of the upper hdpe layer of the liner a 15 cm of granular graphite layer is placed for working as the cathode a sapling of canna indica was planted in the cathodic zone of cw mfc as shown in fig 1 a at the cathode a cylindrical graphite rod was placed in cathode zone as electron charge dispenser 15 cm 1 cm diameter height 3 canna indica sapling was rinsed five times with running tap water to remove the dirt its root length shoot length and weight was measured as 14 cm 77 cm and 130 g respectively uprooted c indica had an average of 3 leaves before transplantation to cw mfc graphite granules were washed with diluted acid and later with tap water to remove dirt and unwanted chemicals and introduce exfoliation to enhance the surface area both anode and cathode charge collector dispenser was connected with insulated copper wire of 1 5 mm diameter and sealed with epoxy at one end another end is left open for continuous voltage and current measurement as shown in fig 1 a the net void volume of scaled up cw mfc was 16 7 l in fig 1 a a

monitoring and measurements cw mfc was fed with real municipal wastewater thus possessing fluctuating characteristic condition with cod ammonium and phosphate lying in the average range of 125 35 77 93 mg l 16 79 6 08 mg l and 5 12 2 43 mg l respectively throughout the course of the experiment initially cw mfc was operated for 180 days in batch mode with municipal wastewater for acclimation to stable voltage generation and canna indica vegetation growth during the acclimatization period wastewater was changed every alternate day and voltage was recorded to determine the steady state condition of cw mfc once the steady performance was achieved cw mfc was connected with external resistance of 1000 ω equivalent to internal resistance evaluated through polarization further the same cw mfc with already matured biofilm was used to test the effects of et on the performance during the entire experiment wastewater was collected from institute s csir institute minerals and materials technology sewage chamber into a 100 l llpde tank and mixed well manually with bamboo sticks approximately 50 ml was collected as influent wastewater in a polyethylene bottle thereafter collected wastewater was fed to the cw mfc system the initial working volume of the system was 16 7 l this time cw mfc filling was considered as 0 h of batch loading wastewater was fed to cw mfc for various contact times such as 8 h 24 h and 48 h collection of treated sample and feeding of new loads of wastewater was done using the following procedure i cw mfc was entirely decanted in llpde tank after each contact time ii decanted wastewater was mixed thoroughly before sample collection volume collected 25 ml iii decanted volume was also measured for evaluation of evapotranspiration et and iv cw mfc was refilled again with the same decanted wastewater this entire cycle of 48 h was carried out once in a week after end of rainy season and continued for a period of 6 months from september to february further collected samples at each 6 h 24 h and 48 h were stored at 4 c in 50 ml polyethylene bottle and analyzed on the day followed by sample collection for chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 3 using apha standard protocols i e 5220d closed reflux colorimetric method 4500f phenate method and 4500 p d stannous chloride method respectively 26 thereafter the percentage removal of ammonium cod and phosphate was estimated the performance parameters including water level measurement mm voltage generation mv temperature c relative humidity internal resistance

on a daily basis with a digital handheld multimeter fluke 17b usa the polarization experiment was performed at different points of time viz at 0 h 24 h and 48 h using variable external resistances ranging from 10 kω to 100 ω the internal resistances were determined using ohm s law measuring the tangent value of the voltage vs current curve current density and power density were calculated by dividing generated current and power with an anodic volume of cw mfc further coulombic efficiency ce was calculated using eq 1 which represents amount of organic matter converted to electrical current

from september to february in the east region of india i e bhubaneswar odisha which experiences a typical tropical climate and remains hot and humid throughout the year and winters are often marked by hot sunshine and persistent humidity lying 65 throughout the year for a better understanding of the approaches involved in the experimentation for influence of et on municipal wastewater treatment efficiency and simultaneous electricity generation performance of upscaled cw mfc in a tropical region a detailed flow chart is presented in supplementary file fig s1 2 3 et and treatment efficiency assessment most of the reported cw mfc studies have not considered et during the calculation of treatment efficiency large loss of water can be experienced by the cw mfc systems operating in the actual field due to et and can significantly influence the removal efficiency of the system to determine treatment efficiency influenced by et the following eqs 3 4 and 5 were used for calculating

mg l 3 result and discussion 3 1 plant growth assessment canna indica was chosen as the model plant for cw mfc due to its water loving feature and versatile growing pattern in the indian environment we have noted with the visual observation that there was continuous growth in the plants throughout the experimental period the summer season was reported to be optimum for the growth of this plant whereas in winter a few leaves turned yellow may be due to lower atmospheric temperature at the time of harvest canna indica roots were found to be tightly bound to the graphite granules with significantly dense root system compared to initially planted sapling at the cathodic region revealing graphite granules as a plant compatible material capable of supporting vegetation growth fig 1 c 28 at the end of the experiment i e 180 days significant growth in the plant in terms of stem and root was observed during this period the stem grew up from 77 0 cm to 131 06 cm and the root length from 14 0 cm to 36 57 cm the dry biomass of canna indica planted in cw mfc above ground stem and leaves and underground roots was noted to be 392 8 g and 105 9 g respectively accordingly the net total dry biomass production was found to be 48 89 kg m2 of planted area in cw mfc at the end of the experimental period which was significantly higher than other vegetation types used in cw mfc such as iris pseudacorus 3 60 kg m2 lythrum salicaria 2 37 kg m2 and phragmites australis 0 49 kg m2 21 higher canna indica biomass production in the cw mfc matrix could improve the overall performance via the following possible mechanisms i high et due to higher growth of the plants and higher leave surface area of canna indica ii enhanced oxygen reduction reaction by root aeration due to high root biomass growth thereby enhancing bioelectricity production 3 iii supporting the growth of electroactive bacteria in the root zone helping to improve bio catalytic reaction 1 iv reduce the internal resistance of the reactor by enhancing biodegradation potential and current flux 1 and v assimilate high nutrients matter overall improving the pollutant removing efficiency 3 besides the presence of vegetation in cw mfcs also provides an additional advantage as it is a co2 neutral process due to the ability of plants to sequester atmospheric co2 into biomass 29 3 2 effect of temperature and humidity on evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is a combination of two processes viz evaporation water loss from open water bodies and transpiration water loss from living plant surface et process is dependent on several important factors such as net solar radiation wind speed the surface area of the water body type and density of vegetation cover root depth moisture availability and season of the year 30 in this study wastewater volume was estimated at different time intervals of 0 h 6 h 24 h 30 h and 48 h for determination of water loss through et starting at 12 00 pm noon as 0 h since environmental factors like rh and temperature influence et water volume loss differed for different time intervals at 0 h 16 7 l effluent was fed to the cw mfc system which gradually decreased by 3 1 0 26 l during the first 6 h another 1 3 0 3 l during 12 24 h another 1 95 0 29 l during 24 30 h and another 1 1 0 25 l during 42 48 h this means that during 48 h the total et volume loss was 7 45 l which decreased the actual effluent volume from 16 7 l to 9 25 l from fig 2 it can be noted that the highest et loss took place in 0 6 h i e 12 00 h to 18 00 h but the highest relative humidity and temperature were recorded between 42 and 48 h and 24 and 30 h of operation respectively at the same time the second highest et loss occurred at the highest temperature hours 24 30 h corbella et al 5 also reported similar et loss from 12 00 h to 18 00 h in a pilot scale cw mfc planted with phragmites australis vegetation in addition pedescoll et al 24 even reported a shift in et peak in cws planted with different vegetation while considering day night variations where et increased from 0 mm day in the early morning and reached the peak of 80 mm day and 60 mm day in mid day and decreased progressively to 40 mm day and 15 mm day in the night time with typha augustifolia and phragmites australis planted hydroponic cw also et rates could vary depending on the water use efficiency of different vegetation for above ground biomass production the highest et loss in the initial hours 0 6 h could be due to high surface evaporation along with transpiration since the water level was high however with time surface evaporation decreased with a gradual decrease in water level which may have resulted in low et during the final hours of the experiment similar results of decreased et with an increase in water table depth were also reported in a field scale et study 31 in fig 2 it can also be seen that high rh hours 42 48 h enforced the lowest et loss this could be due to the lower and negative correlation of et with rh as reported by papaevangelou et al 32 3 3 effect of evapotranspiration on cathode exposed to air fig 3 depicts the increment in the depth of air exposed cathode with water loss due to et from the system from 0 h to 48 h it is observed that the highest water loss due to et was observed at the end of 6 h but surprisingly highest cathode water column height reduction of 99 mm was noticed in 24 30 h this is possible due to the high environment temperature recorded around 36 83 1 06 c during 24 30 h which caused in evaporation of water the least reduction in the water column was observed between 42 and 48 h corresponding to the least water loss through et due to comparatively lower environmental temperature 34 96 1 48 c and water level reaching far from the root system however the water column was significantly reduced up to 336 mm at the end of 48 h which enhanced the availability of oxygen dissolved oxygen at the cathode due to the high diffusion of atmospheric air into the cathode zone water loss due to et in canna indica planted cw mfc system has induced notable variation in water level in the cathode zone and therefore it can influence redox conditions of the anode and cathode zones of the cw mfc system the decreased water level at the cathode in cw mfc implies an increase of cathode exposure in air thus could promote oxygen diffusion in the empty cathode suggesting improvement in cathode kinetics which generally act as a limitation in cw mfc due to slow kinetics resulting from oxygen scarcity 5 23 33 these results are in agreement with the findings of pedescoll et al 24 revealing a positive relationship with linear regression between et and the redox state of horizontal cws planted with different vegetation which promoted the natural aeration of filter medium due to et thus favorable oxidized conditions confirm the influence of vegetation not only on et rates but also on the redox state of cws 3 4 effect of cathode exposed to air on voltage generation cw mfc voltage was noted to increase with the decrease in water level owing to an increase in exposure of cathode with air in cw mfc fig 4 during the first 6 h of the study after decanting and restarting the cw mfc for et test experiments steady cell voltage was not observed which is possibly due to the time required to induce the natural mediators for microbial growth or overcoming the air diffusion shock during decanting it is generally considered a lag phase period 34 this lag phase can also be favorable for maintaining the redox potential gradient between the anodic and cathodic region of cw mfc which is lost due to easy diffusion of oxygen while decanting and restarting the reactor for et experiments at 0 h 7 at the start of 24 h cell voltage increased to 182 5 12 5 mv which gradually increased to 540 22 31 mv by the end of 30 h to 625 mv 24 12 on 42 h and finally up to 800 mv 13 47 at the end of 48 h it can be noted that the output cell voltages were higher in the daytime as compared to night time this could be possible because in the daytime wetland plants release oxygen from root exudates creating more suitable aerobic conditions at the cathode which enhance of electrical output 35 another possible reason could be a substantial decrement in water level at the daytime resulting from et loss which enhanced oxygen diffusion in the cathodic region and hence enhanced the oxygen reduction kinetics this voltage generation at 48 h was significantly higher compared to a similar kind of recent study in which cw mfc planted with canna indica could produce an average voltage of 231 53 mv during 48 h of hydraulic retention time 36 in addition an increase in cathode column exposure to air played a vital role this study noted a linear increase in cell voltage after 24 h followed by a reduction of the water column in the cathode side that apparently increased dissolved oxygen concentration due to air diffusion in this zone the achieved results are in agreement with corbella et al 5 displaying the major governing factor for enhanced voltage generation as the availability of oxygen at the cathode which was related to water level variation caused by the plant s evapotranspiration although after the end of the experimental period i e 180 days when plants were harvested a significant drop in cell voltage from 800 13 47 mv to 80 50 45 mv was observed in 48 h of the experimental period this could be possibly due to i disturbance in the cathodic region since roots were tightly bound to graphite granules and were passively aerating the cathode after their removal i e after harvesting oxygen was heavily depleted which reduced the oxygen reduction rate considerably and thereby the overall decrease in cell voltage was observed and ii low diffusion of atmospheric oxygen in the cathode column due to significant reduction in water level drop in cathode region from 336 mm with planted cw mfc to just 25 10 mm after harvesting in 48 h a very lower water level drop in the cw mfc system after the harvesting of plants is because water loss can occur only through evaporation which was also very less as the water surface was not directly exposed to the atmosphere due to subsurface constructed wetlands conditions in current cw mfc 3 5 influence of cathode exposure to air on internal resistance and electricity generation as discussed earlier the water level profile was noted to be decreased with time at the cathode side due to et based water loss which in turn affected the electrical performance of cw mfc on the positive side as a result of more oxygen availability due to air diffusion to the spaces which was vacated by water polarization was conducted to study the power generation profile of cw mfc at different times viz 0 h 24 h and 48 h in association with the et losses similar to those performed by other researchers 15 16 in general due to irreversible losses i e overpotentials the actual output cell voltage is always less than the theoretically calculated voltage of the redox reactions occurring at the cathode and anode 37 overpotentials can arise in both the cathode and anode however the cathodic overpotential losses primarily limit the performance of cw mfc or mfc these overpotentials are defined as activation losses concentration overpotential and ohmic losses which can be identified in polarization curves 37 in particular cathodic activation losses are attributed to reaction interface area temperature and oxidant concentration whereas cathodic ohmic losses are due to the charge transfer resistance of the system while concentration and activation overpotential is related to the energy required for the supply of oxygen in the reaction interface followed by the energy requirement for its reduction 5 23 thus both activation and concentration overpotential rely on oxygen concentration results revealed a high potential of 800 13 47 mv at 48 h followed by 540 22 31 for 24 h and 182 5 12 5 mv for 0 h fig 5 fig 5 also revealed that the internal resistance decreased from 1000 ω 0 h to 900 ω 24 h and eventually to 700 ω at the end of 48 h which is clearly indicating that the cw mfc in 48 h had lowest ohmic overpotential losses with a gradual decrease in the internal resistances enhancement in current density was found and noted as 85 71 ma m3 65 71 ma m3 and 8 28 ma m3 for 48 h 24 h and 0 h respectively following a similar trend at 48 h cw mfc could achieve a maximum power density of 25 71 mw m3 which significantly surpassed the value of 15 11 mw m3 and 0 480 mw m3 for 24 h and 0 h it is confirmed from the results that water losses with time by et provide vacant space for more oxygen diffusion at the cathode with time which eventually increases the oxygen saturation thereby enhancing cathode performance furthermore the columbic efficiency ce of cw mfc was also computed at 24 h and 48 h this study noted an increase in the ce from 3 8 at 24 h to 11 95 at 48 h of the experimental period three times increase in ce also confirmed enhanced cathodic performance which resulted in a high current recovery in addition to this the ner of cw mfc mesocosm at 48 h was calculated as 2 44 wh kg cod moreover the achieved ce in the present research work is significantly higher than other pilot scales scaled up cw mfc studies undertaken as listed in table 1 3 6 pollutant removal efficiency cod ammonium and phosphate removal efficiencies were estimated at 6 h 24 h and 48 h in comparison to the initial concentration of pollutants 0 h in municipal wastewater this study estimated pollutant concentration considering the et losses using eqs 3 4 and 5 table s2 represents pollutant removal efficiencies with and without considering et in the supplementary file the overall removal efficiency of cod ammonium and phosphate was noted to be 80 7 98 73 17 5 01 and 75 60 1 65 respectively in 48 h duration fig 6 in particular the effluent cod removal efficiency of 57 06 5 11 73 30 2 87 and 80 1 98 was observed in 6 h 24 h and 48 h respectively with the corresponding final concentration of 85 11 2 mg l 80 4 70 mg l and 39 2 29 mg l respectively the results are in accordance with a recently published study where a high cod removal of 88 1 was achieved in a batch mode operated canna indica planted vertical cw mfc 18 likewise corbella et al 5 reported cod removal of 61 19 when the cathode was positioned 5 cm below the water level and 60 10 when the cathode was placed at the same level of water in phragmites australis planted pilot scale cw mfc in the case of cod removal plant roots might have played a role by providing a microaerobic zone for more organic degradation along with the availability of a high surface area for microbial growth and activity 18 48 this might have led to direct cod reduction by heterotrophic and electroactive bacteria available in the root zone area 3 in addition the high biomass of canna indica assisted the availability of more carbon sources as fuel for microorganisms to support microbial activity 1 similar results were demonstrated in a study where the impact on different plant species of a saline environment was investigated in cws canna indica provided a large surface area for microbial growth along with high average root activity 49 moreover the presence of conductive materials both charge collector and graphite granules supported high microbial attachment for biofilm growth owing to its porous nature and act as artificial electron acceptors in the anodic zone of cw mfc thus promoting the degradation of organic materials 6 ammonium removal efficiency in contact time of 48 h was noted to be 73 13 5 01 which was relatively higher than what was obtained in 6 h and 24 h i e 59 39 2 21 68 73 4 01 and respectively these results are also in agreement with other findings wherein the highest ammonium removal of 88 7 2 5 was achieved with iris pseudacorus planted cw mfc and least with unplanted cw mfc i e 43 5 9 1 also iris pseudacorus accounted highest biomass growth along with the highest uptake of nutrients 21 similarly other researchers reported average ammonium removal efficiency of 60 40 with variations in cathode position respective to the water level in planted cw mfc 5 generally due to the absence of electron acceptors anaerobic reactions are usually slow in cws 45 however the reasonable explanation for high ammonium removal in canna indica planted cw mfc could be i conductive material acting as an electron acceptor in absent or oxygen deficient regions thus assisting electron transport mechanism for the microbes 50 ii better environment for the growth of nitrifying bacteria i e nitrobacter nitrosomonas in high biomass canna indica rhizosphere where oxidation of ammonium to nitrate could take place in the aerobic microsites adjacent to roots and rhizomes 3 iii high oxygen diffusion in the cw mfc column due to increase in exposure of cathode with air because of high et 33 iv uptake of ammonium as a nutrient by highly grown canna indica 1 and v adsorption on high biomass produced in the wetland matrix by canna indica vegetation 21 ammonium removal is also advantageous for easy assimilation in the microbial and plant biomass due to its less mobile and biologically amenable nature among several other forms of nitrogen 29 phosphate removal was estimated as 67 16 5 33 71 10 2 17 and 75 60 1 65 for 6 h 24 h and 48 h respectively phosphorus uptake through canna indica could be the probable reason for high phosphate removal along with adsorption on filter media various studies also support this phenomenon due to the well known fact that water loving macrophytes aquatic plants like canna indica have a binding capacity to uptake phosphorous from wastewater to their tissues 51 4 conclusion considerable bio electricity enhancement and efficient pollutant removal efficiency were observed with canna indica planted cw mfc water losses via et exposed cathode with air due to water level drop in cathode affects the performance of canna indica planted cw mfc in a positive direction high water loss from the cathode zone creates vacant spaces which were filled by atmospheric air by diffusion and expose the cathode to atmospheric oxygen this situation has developed air cathode like conditions in canna indica planted cw mfc producing 25 71 mw m3 power density and 85 71 ma m3 current density with a ce of 11 95 in contact time of 48 h in canna indica planted cw mfc a drop in the water level by 336 mm in the cathode electrode zone was recorded this water loss at the cathode improved cathodic reduction kinetics it improves the voltage generation from 182 5 12 5 mv to 800 13 47 mv at the same time pollutant concentration in terms of cod ammonium and phosphate substantially reduced to 80 7 98 73 17 5 01 and 75 60 1 65 respectively this study suggests an important role of et in the performance of cw mfc which should be considered while designing large scale systems for real life applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests

12512,this study aims to illustrate the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on reactor performance and biofilm characteristics in the gravity driven membrane gdm reactor pretreating seawater three gdm reactors were operated in parallel for 62 days under hrts of 22 h 54 h and 102 h respectively the results indicated that the gdm reactors at hrts of 22 h and 102 h had relatively higher permeate flux and superior permeate quality especially assimilable organic carbon aoc compared to that at hrt of 54 h extending hrt benefited to reduce irreversible fouling but cake layer fouling was maximized at hrt of 54 h as different hrts led to significantly dissimilar microbial community structure and cake layer composition such higher cake layer resistance at hrt of 54 h was attributed to homogenous nature of the biofilm which contained greater amount of organics and less abundance of nematoda dominant predator lastly as increasing 5 time of hrt from 22 h to 102 h improved 1 5 of permeate flux a shorter hrt of 22 h was preferable for the gdm reactor in pretreating seawater with regard to treatment productivity and footprint graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords seawater pretreatment gravity driven membrane hydraulic retention time membrane fouling microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction desalted seawater achieved has been considered as a freshwater resource in many countries and regions among the total seawater desalination capacity reverse osmosis ro seawater desalination contributes majorly up to 60 1 2 however ro desalination is an energy intensive process 3 4 kwh m3 water especially seawater pretreatment aiming to remove potential foulants from seawater and lessen ro membrane fouling is the main ancillary energy use 3 nowadays ultrafiltration uf based membrane filtration has been widely used for ro seawater desalination pretreatment however uf involves frequent physical backwash and chemical cleaning leading to a significant energy consumption 0 1 0 3 kwh m3 and a high capital cost membrane replacement and chemicals 4 in addition uf membranes could not adequately remove low molecular weight organic matters such as assimilable organic carbon which have been identified as potential foulants of downstream ro membranes 5 7 recently gravity driven membrane gdm filtration for seawater pretreatment has been well documented 5 8 13 which employs water head gravity force to drive dead end microfiltration mf or uf membrane filtration of raw seawater the research findings highlighted that 1 gdm filtration of raw seawater could achieve stabilized fluxes at 20 l m2h at a hydraulic pressure of 0 04 bar which maintained over one year without any physical and chemical cleaning 5 12 2 the eukaryotes developed on the membrane surfaces performed active predation and movement controlling the extent of biofilm growth on the membranes 5 8 3 the developed biofilms on the membrane surface in the gdm systems facilitated to achieve superior permeate quality with less organic components such as transparent extracellular particles tep and assimilable organic carbon compared to that of uf pretreatment 5 12 13 4 gdm pretreatment led to lower ro fouling than uf pretreatment which would reduce chemical usage and frequency for ro membrane cleaning 5 5 gdm pretreatment showed highly energy efficient nature 0 002 kwh m3 and led to reduced subsequent ro energy consumption 2 196 kwh m3 10 it is also noticed that gdm pretreatment of seawater systems only removed limited amounts of small sized soluble organics such as humic substances building blocks and lmw neutrals and aoc from raw seawater especially when the hydrolysis of greater sized organic matters to smaller sized soluble organic substances by the biofilm on membranes were promoted under certain operation conditions 12 further improvement of aoc removal was achieved by integrating a biofiltration column with gdm however such combination could cause a decrease of gdm permeate flux 10 previous other studies focusing on gdm filtration of surface water and rainwater illustrate that hydraulic retention time hrt could influence permeate quality in terms of the relationship between the hydrolysis of greater sized organic matters to smaller sized soluble organic substances and the degradation of soluble organic substances occurred in the biofilm layer of the gdm systems 14 16 however there lacks information relating to the effect of hrts on microbial community which play a pivotal role in determining the performances of reactors 17 19 especially for seawater pretreatment recently ranieri et al 20 reported the hrt effect in the gdm reactors for seawater pretreatment however they did not provide any information about eukaryotes that perform significant roles in the filtration performance thus so far there has been a lack of studies providing an in depth perspective on the hrt effect in gdm reactors for seawater pretreatment this study aims to illustrate the effects of hrt on seawater pretreatment in submerged hollow fiber gdm reactors in terms of permeate flux and quality membrane fouling mechanisms and foulant characteristics and microbial community structure of the biofilm this study would offer new insights on improvement of gdm systems for seawater pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 gdm reactor setup shown in fig 1 three lab scale gdm reactors with respective working volume and effective membrane area r1 8 6 l and 68 7 cm2 r2 3 9 l and 68 7 cm2 2 r3 2 6 l and 68 7 cm2 2 were setup and operated in parallel in this study hrt was determined by calculating the ratio of reactor volume to the permeate flow rate note the feed flow rate was adjusted based on the permeate flow rate daily in order to minimize the overflow the averaged hrt of three reactors during the entire operation period was achieved at 102 h 54 h and 22 h respectively in each gdm reactor the hollow fiber membrane pvdf 150 kda module was installed in the gdm reactor which was located 40 cm below the water level i e a hydrostatic pressure of 40 mbar the chlorinated raw seawater was periodically collected from a full scale desalination plant in singapore after collection de chlorination was performed by adding sodium bisulphite acros organics usa if chlorine was detected by a chlorine colorimeter thermo fisher scientific usa the temperature in the lab room was at 21 1 c 2 2 water quality analysis 2 2 1 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd analysis all water quality parameters were measured after the permeate fluxes of gdm reactors were relatively stable during days 25 56 the feed reactor and permeate water samples were collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter before analysis soluble organic carbon was characterized by a lc ocd analyzer lc ocd model 8 doc labor germany a size exclusion chromatography integrated with organic carbon detector and organic nitrogen detector the organic carbons in the sample were classified into five fraction groups according to their molecular weights i e biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1

matrix eem spectrometry analysis the feed reactor permeate water filtrate samples were further characterization by an eem fluorescence spectrophotometer perkinelmer usa the wavelength range for excitation and emission was set at 220 450 nm and at 280 550 nm respectively five components including aromatic proteins i ex 250 nm em 330 nm aromatic proteins ii ex 250 nm em 380 nm fulvic acid like matters ex 250 nm em 380 nm microbial byproduct like matters ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and humic acid like matters ex 250 nm em 380 nm were identified 34 2 2 3 transparent exopolymer particles tep the tep levels in the feed reactor permeate samples were measured after the samples were filtered through a 0 1 μm track etched filter millipore usa then the retained tep on the filter was stained by filtering with 3 ml of 0 02 alcian blue solution and 0 06 acetic acid sigma aldrich usa after washing with distilled water the filter with stained tep was immersed into 4 ml of sulfuric acid solution

aldrich usa was used as a tep standard 22 2 2 4 assimilable organic carbon aoc the aoc measurement was carried out using the method described by hammes and egli 23 the water sample was filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter millipore usa and the filtrate was heated in a water bath at 70 c after 45 mins the sample was taken out and cooled to room temperature then the raw seawater was added into the sample which was inoculated at 30 c and 40 rpm the sample without inoculation was used as a negative control after 3 day of incubation the cell number was counted using a flow cytometry bd usa with syto9 molecular probes usa staining lastly the aoc concentration was evaluated using a calibration curve 103 274 cells l equivalent to 1 μg aoc as acetate l 10 2 3 biofilm analysis 2 3 1 biofilm morphology at the end of filtration experiment several hollow fibers were cut from the module then the biofilm layer on the membrane surface was stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen usa and observed by a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiness germany the 3d clsm images were reconstructed using imaris software bitplane switzerland 2 3 2 fouling resistance the fouling resistance was calculated based on resistance in series model 24 as shown in eq 1 3 r t is the total resistance m 1 and consists of the intrinsic membrane resistance r m irreversible fouling resistance r ir and cake layer resistance r c 1 r t r m r ir r c p μ j s 2 r m r ir p μ j p 3 r m p μ j m where p is the transmembrane pressure 40 mbar μ is the permeate viscosity

cleaning rinsing with 100 ml of distilled water for 10 min the cake layer resistance r c was calculated by subtracting r m r ir from total resistance r t and the irreversible fouling resistance r ir was achieved by subtracting r m from r m r ir 2 3 3 adenosine triphosphate atp the biofilm sample was prepared by physically rinsing the membrane surface as described in section 2 3 2 the total atp of the biofilm solution was evaluated using an atp assay kit checklite hs set kikkoman japan and a potable luminometer lumitester c 110 kikkoman japan according to the manufacturer s protocol the live and dead cells were evaluated by measuring the intracellular and extracellular atp concentrations respectively 2 3 4 soluble foulants the biofilm solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe membrane and the soluble foulant was collected for lc ocd and eem analysis as described in section 2 2 2 3 5 microbial community the powerbiofilm dna isolation kit mo bio usa was used to extract the genomic dna of microorganisms from the biofilm the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities were analyzed using the 16s and 18s rrna sequencing respectively the sequencing was conducted by illumina miseq platform using primers 357wf cctacggggnggcwgcag and 785r gactachvgggtatctaatcc for prokaryotes tareukf ccagcascygcggtaattcc and tareukr actttcgttcttgatyra for eukaryotes the community sequencing data was analyzed by the standard de novo operational taxonomic unit otu based approach using qiime 25 2 4 statistical analysis when the sampling data groups under two different conditions were compared a two sample t test was applied to calculate p value in order to illustrate the statistical significance a significance level of 0 1 was set in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect on membrane performance the three gdm systems at the same hydraulic pressure of 40 mbar were operated at different hrts for 62 days in parallel the permeate flux development profiles were described in fig 2a during the initial 15 day of operation similar permeate flux drop trends were noticed in the three gdm reactors showing almost no influence of hrt on the gdm performance during early stage of biofilm development on the membrane surface after that the three gdm reactors experienced different permeate flux patterns in the gdm reactor with a longer hrt 102 h the permeate flux increased slightly followed by a slow decrease and reached at 11 2 lmh at the end of filtration while in the gdm reactor with a hrt of 54 h the permeate flux decreased with filtration time achieving 2 7 lmh at day 62 at a shorter hrt 22 h the permeate flux was relatively stable maintaining at 7 5 lmh till the end of operation such findings indicated that shortening or extending hrt could achieve a relatively higher permeate flux a similar phenomenon was observed in the gdm systems treating rainwater 16 in that study a permeate flux at hrt of 51 h was 2 9 lmh lower than 4 2 and 5 0 lmh at hrt of 27 h and 156 h respectively which was found to be closely associated with organic concentrations in the gdm reactors furthermore at the end of gdm operation the cake layer i e biofilm layer resistance and irreversible fouling resistance were examined and presented in fig 2b under the hrt of 54 h and 102 h the cake layer resistance accounted for 78 and 62 of total resistance respectively showing its predominant role in flux decline while under the hrt of 22 h the irreversible fouling was dominant almost 66 of the total resistance in addition with increasing hrt irreversible fouling resistance decreased but cake layer resistance increased followed by a decreasing trend it implies that hrt could influence fouling resistance distribution in terms of cake layer development and pore blocking the membrane performance is generally influenced by various factors such as water quality biofilm property and microbial community the effect of hrt on the individual factor and its relationship with membrane performance were discussed in the following sections 3 2 effect on permeate quality 3 2 1 organics in the gdm reactors as shown in table 1 the ph levels in the three gdm reactors were comparable to the feed seawater all of which were maintained at neutral levels the do levels in the gdm reactors were much lower than that of the feed water 0 5 4 7 mg l vs 6 5 mg l attributing to oxygen consumption with biodegradation of organics in the reactors interestingly initial do levels were relatively similar in all gdm reactors however after 25 day operation the averaged do level 4 2 4 7 mg l in the reactor at a shorter hrt 22 h or longer hrt 102 h was 8 times of that at a hrt of 54 h 0 5 mg l fig s1 in addition the doc in the gdm reactors at a shorter hrt 22 h 1 74 0 23 mg l or longer hrt 102 h 1 68 0 33 mg l were almost comparable to that of the feed seawater 1 61 0 39 mg l while the doc in the reactor at a hrt of 54 h 2 73 0 52 mg l was significantly higher than that of the feed seawater the aoc in the gdm reactors displayed a similar pattern as the doc with the highest aoc level in the gdm reactor at a hrt of 54 h 20 times of that in the feed seawater generally in the gdm reactor part of particulate substances from seawater can be hydrolyzed to soluble substances meanwhile the soluble substances are degraded by the microorganisms theoretically increasing hrt of the reactor accelerated both decomposition and degradation rates but they may not be in a similar level 26 in addition the rate of biodegradation is often slower under anoxic and anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions 27 therefore possibly the decomposition of particulate substances prevailed the biodegradation of soluble substances at a hrt of 54 h leading to greater accumulation of doc and aoc in the reactor the tep representing the organics 0 1 μm in the three gdm reactors were comparable and almost 2 time of that in the feed seawater this phenomenon was possibly associated with the cross linking nature of the decomposed organics especially in the presence of divalent cations 28 furthermore the detailed organic components were analyzed by lc ocd and eem which were present in fig 3a and b respectively the lc ocd data fig 3a indicated a significant accumulation of biopolymers building blocks and low molecule weight neutrals occurred in the gdm reactor operated at a hrt of 54 h while only the accumulation of low molecule weight neutrals was obvious in the gdm reactor at hrts of at 22 h and 102 h this trend was similar to doc and aoc accumulation patterns in the gdm reactors table 1 it suggests that the low molecule weight substances had a great contribution to aoc which was correspondent to the finding in the previous study 6 the eem data fig 3b revealed that the intensities of aromatic protein i in the three gdm reactors were greatly higher than that in the feed p value 0 1 at a short hrt of 22 h the aromatic protein ii and microbial byproduct like substances in the gdm reactor were insignificantly different from those in the feed seawater p value 0 1 while with extending hrt from 22 h to 102 h both aromatic protein ii and microbial byproduct like substances in the gdm reactor tended to slightly increase which were higher than those in the feed water p value 0 1 3 2 2 permeate quality shown in table 1 the permeate contained less doc and tep compared to the samples from the gdm reactors showing that the biofilm formed on the membrane benefited to reduce organics especially greater sized tep however the higher amounts of aoc in the permeate of the gdm reactors at a shorter 22 h or longer hrt 102 h were noticed compared to those in the gdm reactor under a hrt of 54 h less amount of aoc in the permeate than that in the gdm reactor it is noted that at hrts of 22 h and 102 h the aoc in the gdm reactors 51 53 μg l was much lower than that at a hrt of 54 h 730 μg l possibly when the available aoc was inadequate for maintaining the growth of biofilm developed on the membrane the biofilm may experience cell hydrolysis to produce aoc such aoc could not be rejected by the membranes and was present in the permeate on the other hand when the available aoc was sufficient for biofilm growth they would be utilized by the biofilm leading to a reduced amount of aoc in the permeate moreover the organic components biopolymers humics building blocks and low molecule weight neutrals in the permeates of the gdm reactors were almost comparable to those in the feed p value 0 1 except that the humics and low molecule weight neutrals in the permeate of the gdm reactor at a hrt of 54 h and the building blocks in the permeate of the gdm reactor at a hrt of 102 h were higher than those in the feed p value 0 1 the eem analysis pointed out that the three gdm reactors produced the permeate containing higher amounts of aromatic protein i and ii and microbial byproduct like substances compared to those in the feed p value 0 1 it appears that the aromatic proteins and microbial byproduct like substances were associated with the aoc level in the permeate this is dissimilar to the observation that low molecular weight substances contributed majorly to the aoc in the gdm reactor section 3 2 1 and raw seawater 6 we hypothesized that the biofilm on the membrane surface could utilize low molecule weight substances dominant organics for their growth and excreted these eem detectable metabolic products that could not be effectively rejected by the membrane and appeared in the permeate this also implies that the contribution of organics to aoc may be related to not only molecule sizes of organics but also chemical properties of size fractioned organics nevertheless the gdm reactors had better permeate quality at hrts of 22 h and 102 h in terms of doc tep and aoc moreover although increasing 5 time of hrt from 22 h to 102 h improved 1 5 of permeate flux a shorter hrt of 22 h was preferable for the gdm reactor in pretreating seawater with regard to treatment productivity and footprint 3 3 effect on biofilm properties 3 3 1 biofilm morphology the morphologies of the biofilms developed on the membranes were observed by clsm fig 4 and the biovolume of the biofilm were presented in table 2 with increasing hrt the biovolume of biofilm increased 0 90 0 53 3 05 1 13 and 8 93 1 47 μm3 μm2 under hrts of 22 54 and 102 h respectively showing the similar trend as the atp values of biofilm however the amount of biofilm atp and biovolume did not display linear relationship with the resistance of biofilm layer on the membrane fig 2b as the clsm images shown the biofilm formed at the longer hrt i e 102 h had more heterogeneous structure than those at the shorter hrts i e 22 h and 54 h possibly the heterogeneous structure of the biofilm hrt of 102 h benefited for reducing the biofilm resistance instead of the amount of the deposited biofilm the similar phenomenon was also noticed in several previous studies 8 13 29 3 3 2 biofilm composition furthermore the cell viability and organic compositions in the biofilm of the gdm reactors were analyzed and presented in table 2 more viable cells 97 were noticed in the biofilm of the gdm reactors under shorter hrts 22 h and 54 h while extending hrt to 102 h the developed biofilm had more dead cells 58 table 2 also indicates that slightly more organics especially building blocks and lmw neutrals by lc ocd analysis aromatic protein ii fulvic substances microbial byproduct like substances and humic acid like substances by eem analysis were deposited on the membrane surface in the gdm reactor under hrt of 54 h which may contribute to the development of the dense and uniform biofilm layer however the amount of individual organic component was not linearly associated with the permeate flux of the gdm reactors under different hrts this finding further highlighted that the biofilm morphology performs a major role in determining the permeate flux development 29 31 3 3 3 microbial community at the end of operation the biofilm samples and the water samples in the gdm reactors were collected for analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities under the hrt of 54 h the prokaryotic community in the biofilm layer and in the gdm reactor were greatly dissimilar both of which were also different from those in the gdm reactors at hrts of 22 h and 102 h fig 5a and fig s2 on the other hand the similarity of prokaryotic community between the biofilm and suspended bacteria in the gdm reactor was relatively higher at a longer hrt of 102 h in detail in the three gdm reactors planctomycetia 8 2 13 3 alphaproteobacteria 14 5 25 2 gammaproteobacteria 6 4 15 4 were commonly observed as dominant prokaryotic class of the suspended bacteria fig 6a however clostridia one of obligate anaerobic bacteria accounted for 15 9 in the gdm reactor under the hrt of 54 h which was closely related to its do level 0 5 0 3 mg l on the contrary almost negligible amounts of clostridia were found under both hrts of 22 h and 102 h 0 2 0 4 due to the relatively higher do levels 4 2 4 7 mg l in both gdm reactors the dissimilar microbial community at the hrt of 54 h suggests more rapid growth and decay of some microorganisms which may contribute to significant consumption of oxygen and increased organic concentration in the reactor while the do supply was limited due to such a longer hrt these suggest that hrt could play a pivotal role in determining the relationship among oxygen consumption biological activity and microbial community subsequently influencing the performances of gdm reactors in addition more alphaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia in the biofilm layer of the gdm reactor at the hrt of 54 h 31 5 and 25 1 respectively compared to those at the longer hrt of 102 h 8 4 and 13 8 respectively and at the shorter hrt of 22 h 10 9 and 0 5 respectively pollet et al 32 reported that marine biofilm formed on the plastic were predominated by alphaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia and flavobacteriia might be the key species associated with the functions of marine biofilm in contrast planctomycetia was highly present in the gdm reactors at both hrts of 102 h 41 1 and 22 h 41 3 significantly greater than those at the hrt of 54 h 5 0 on the other hand much lower diversity indexes of both suspended bacteria and biofilm layer were observed in the gdm at a hrt of 54 h compared to those at hrts of 22 h and 102 h table s1 in addition the eukaryotes in the biofilm layer and the suspended eukaryotes in the gdm reactor were significantly dissimilar regardless of hrt fig 5b and fig s2 while the hrt had greater impacts on richness diversity and structure of the suspended eukaryotes in the gdm reactors than those in the biofilm layer fig 5b and table s1 as indicated in fig 6b gastrotricha 25 4 labyrinthulomycetes 20 5 peronosporomycetes 21 3 nematoda 17 4 were predominant in the suspended eukaryotes when the gdm was operated at the longer hrt of 102 h while under the hrts of 54 h and 22 h dinoflagellata 62 4 gastrotricha 25 2 and dinoflagellata 20 5 peronosporomycetes 17 8 were majorly present in the gdm reactors respectively furthermore the eukaryotes developed in the biofilm under both hrts of 22 h and 102 h were similar which were relatively different from those under the hrt of 54 h fig 5b it is worth noting that gastrotricha was comparably dominant in the biofilms of three reactors 32 7 45 0 however nematoda belong to metazoan phylum was largely dominated in the biofilm under both hrts of 22 h and 102 h 39 7 47 3 but negligible under the hrt of 54 h 0 2 the low do levels at the hrt of 54 h could significantly increase the mortality of nematodes limiting their population 33 it has been well illustrated that the metazoan eukaryotes played an important role in the development of biofilm structure and water permeability attributing to their grazing movements and predator behaviors 8 29 in particular it was reported that nematodes and oligochaetes the subclass of nematoda and annelida respectively could facilitate to form the biofilm layer with more heterogeneous and porous structure due to their grazing movement 30 31 thus the lack of nematoda in the biofilm of the gdm reactor under the hrt of 54 h may be associated with its lowest permeate flux fig 2a 4 conclusions in this study the effect of hrt on the gdm reactor performance in terms of permeate quality and membrane performance and biofilm characteristics with regard to biofilm morphology organic compositions and microbial community was illustrated for seawater pre treatment application the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the permeate fluxes in the gdm reactors operated under different hrts followed a sequence under hrt 102 h under hrt 22 h under hrt 54 h under hrt of 22 h irreversible fouling was predominant in the gdm reactor while under hrt of 54 h and 102 h cake layer fouling contributed majorly to flux decline 2 the gdm reactors at hrts of 22 h and 102 h had superior permeate quality in terms of doc tep and aoc compared to that at hrt of 54 h in terms of treatment productivity and footprint a shorter hrt of 22 h is suggested to be adopted for the gdm reactor in pretreating seawater 3 the biofilm developed in the gdm reactor at hrt of 54 h displayed homogenous morphology with more organic accumulation and had less abundance of nematoda dominant predator leading to the lower permeate flux 4 the dominant prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities developed in the biofilm or present in the gdm reactors were dissimilar at different hrts it indicates that hrt influenced gdm performances by regulating microbial community structure declaration of competing interest

12512,this study aims to illustrate the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on reactor performance and biofilm characteristics in the gravity driven membrane gdm reactor pretreating seawater three gdm reactors were operated in parallel for 62 days under hrts of 22 h 54 h and 102 h respectively the results indicated that the gdm reactors at hrts of 22 h and 102 h had relatively higher permeate flux and superior permeate quality especially assimilable organic carbon aoc compared to that at hrt of 54 h extending hrt benefited to reduce irreversible fouling but cake layer fouling was maximized at hrt of 54 h as different hrts led to significantly dissimilar microbial community structure and cake layer composition such higher cake layer resistance at hrt of 54 h was attributed to homogenous nature of the biofilm which contained greater amount of organics and less abundance of nematoda dominant predator lastly as increasing 5 time of hrt from 22 h to 102 h improved 1 5 of permeate flux a shorter hrt of 22 h was preferable for the gdm reactor in pretreating seawater with regard to treatment productivity and footprint graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords seawater pretreatment gravity driven membrane hydraulic retention time membrane fouling microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction desalted seawater achieved has been considered as a freshwater resource in many countries and regions among the total seawater desalination capacity reverse osmosis ro seawater desalination contributes majorly up to 60 1 2 however ro desalination is an energy intensive process 3 4 kwh m3 water especially seawater pretreatment aiming to remove potential foulants from seawater and lessen ro membrane fouling is the main ancillary energy use 3 nowadays ultrafiltration uf based membrane filtration has been widely used for ro seawater desalination pretreatment however uf involves frequent physical backwash and chemical cleaning leading to a significant energy consumption 0 1 0 3 kwh m3 and a high capital cost membrane replacement and chemicals 4 in addition uf membranes could not adequately remove low molecular weight organic matters such as assimilable organic carbon which have been identified as potential foulants of downstream ro membranes 5 7 recently gravity driven membrane gdm filtration for seawater pretreatment has been well documented 5 8 13 which employs water head gravity force to drive dead end microfiltration mf or uf membrane filtration of raw seawater the research findings highlighted that 1 gdm filtration of raw seawater could achieve stabilized fluxes at 20 l m2h at a hydraulic pressure of 0 04 bar which maintained over one year without any physical and chemical cleaning 5 12 2 the eukaryotes developed on the membrane surfaces performed active predation and movement controlling the extent of biofilm growth on the membranes 5 8 3 the developed biofilms on the membrane surface in the gdm systems facilitated to achieve superior permeate quality with less organic components such as transparent extracellular particles tep and assimilable organic carbon compared to that of uf pretreatment 5 12 13 4 gdm pretreatment led to lower ro fouling than uf pretreatment which would reduce chemical usage and frequency for ro membrane cleaning 5 5 gdm pretreatment showed highly energy efficient nature 0 002 kwh m3 and led to reduced subsequent ro energy consumption 2 196 kwh m3 10 it is also noticed that gdm pretreatment of seawater systems only removed limited amounts of small sized soluble organics such as humic substances building blocks and lmw neutrals and aoc from raw seawater especially when the hydrolysis of greater sized organic matters to smaller sized soluble organic substances by the biofilm on membranes were promoted under certain operation conditions 12 further improvement of aoc removal was achieved by integrating a biofiltration column with gdm however such combination could cause a decrease of gdm permeate flux 10 previous other studies focusing on gdm filtration of surface water and rainwater illustrate that hydraulic retention time hrt could influence permeate quality in terms of the relationship between the hydrolysis of greater sized organic matters to smaller sized soluble organic substances and the degradation of soluble organic substances occurred in the biofilm layer of the gdm systems 14 16 however there lacks information relating to the effect of hrts on microbial community which play a pivotal role in determining the performances of reactors 17 19 especially for seawater pretreatment recently ranieri et al 20 reported the hrt effect in the gdm reactors for seawater pretreatment however they did not provide any information about eukaryotes that perform significant roles in the filtration performance thus so far there has been a lack of studies providing an in depth perspective on the hrt effect in gdm reactors for seawater pretreatment this study aims to illustrate the effects of hrt on seawater pretreatment in submerged hollow fiber gdm reactors in terms of permeate flux and quality membrane fouling mechanisms and foulant characteristics and microbial community structure of the biofilm this study would offer new insights on improvement of gdm systems for seawater pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 gdm reactor setup shown in fig 1 three lab scale gdm reactors with respective working volume and effective membrane area r1 8 6 l and 68 7 cm2 r2 3 9 l and 68 7 cm2 2 r3 2 6 l and 68 7 cm2 2 were setup and operated in parallel in this study hrt was determined by calculating the ratio of reactor volume to the permeate flow rate note the feed flow rate was adjusted based on the permeate flow rate daily in order to minimize the overflow the averaged hrt of three reactors during the entire operation period was achieved at 102 h 54 h and 22 h respectively in each gdm reactor the hollow fiber membrane pvdf 150 kda module was installed in the gdm reactor which was located 40 cm below the water level i e a hydrostatic pressure of 40 mbar the chlorinated raw seawater was periodically collected from a full scale desalination plant in singapore after collection de chlorination was performed by adding sodium bisulphite acros organics usa if chlorine was detected by a

matrix eem spectrometry analysis the feed reactor permeate water filtrate samples were further characterization by an eem fluorescence spectrophotometer perkinelmer usa the wavelength range for excitation and emission was set at 220 450 nm and at 280 550 nm respectively five components including aromatic proteins i ex 250 nm em 330 nm aromatic proteins ii ex 250 nm em 380 nm fulvic acid like matters ex 250 nm em 380 nm microbial byproduct like matters ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and humic acid like matters ex 250 nm em 380 nm were identified 34 2 2 3 transparent exopolymer particles tep the tep levels in the feed reactor permeate samples were measured after the samples were filtered through a 0 1 μm track etched filter millipore usa then the retained tep on the filter was stained by filtering with 3 ml of 0 02 alcian blue solution and 0 06 acetic acid sigma aldrich usa after washing with distilled water the filter with stained tep was immersed into 4 ml of sulfuric acid solution 80 sigma aldrich usa after 2 h the solution was measured by a spectrophotometer hach usa at a wavelength of 787 nm tep concentration was evaluated using a calibration curve the gum xanthan sigma aldrich usa was used as a tep standard 22 2 2 4 assimilable organic carbon aoc the aoc measurement was carried out using the method described by hammes and egli 23 the water sample was filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter millipore usa and the filtrate was heated in a water bath at 70 c after 45 mins the sample was taken out and cooled to room temperature then the raw seawater was added into the sample which was inoculated at 30 c and 40 rpm the sample without inoculation was used as a negative control after 3 day of incubation the cell number was counted using a flow cytometry bd usa with syto9 molecular probes usa staining lastly the aoc concentration was evaluated using a calibration curve 103 274 cells l equivalent to 1 μg aoc as acetate l 10 2 3 biofilm analysis 2 3 1 biofilm morphology at the end of filtration experiment several hollow fibers were cut from the module then the biofilm layer on the membrane surface was stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen usa and observed by a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiness germany the 3d clsm images were reconstructed using imaris software bitplane switzerland 2 3 2 fouling resistance the fouling resistance was calculated based on resistance in series model 24 as shown in eq 1 3 r t is the total resistance m 1 and consists of the intrinsic membrane resistance r m irreversible fouling resistance r ir and cake layer resistance r c 1 r t r m r ir r c p μ j s 2 r m r ir p μ j p 3 r m p μ j m where p is the transmembrane pressure 40 mbar μ is the permeate viscosity pa s j s is the stabilized permeate flux at the end of filtration experiment l m2h j m is the clean water permeate flux l m2h at 40 mbar the permeate flux jp was measured at 40 mbar after physical cleaning rinsing with 100 ml of distilled water for 10 min the cake layer resistance r c was calculated by subtracting r m r ir from total resistance r t and the irreversible fouling resistance r ir was achieved by subtracting r m from r m r ir 2 3 3 adenosine triphosphate atp the biofilm sample was prepared by physically rinsing the membrane surface as described in section 2 3 2 the total atp of the biofilm solution was evaluated using an atp assay kit checklite hs set kikkoman japan and a potable luminometer lumitester c 110 kikkoman japan according to the manufacturer s protocol the live and dead cells were evaluated by measuring the intracellular and extracellular atp concentrations respectively 2 3 4 soluble foulants the biofilm solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe membrane and the soluble foulant was collected for lc ocd and eem analysis as described in section 2 2 2 3 5 microbial community the powerbiofilm dna isolation kit mo bio usa was used to extract the genomic dna of microorganisms from the biofilm the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities were analyzed using the 16s and 18s rrna sequencing respectively the sequencing was conducted by illumina miseq platform using primers 357wf cctacggggnggcwgcag and 785r gactachvgggtatctaatcc for prokaryotes tareukf ccagcascygcggtaattcc and tareukr actttcgttcttgatyra for eukaryotes the community sequencing data was analyzed by the standard de novo operational taxonomic unit otu based approach using qiime 25 2 4 statistical analysis when the sampling data groups under two different conditions were compared a two sample t test was applied to calculate p value in order to illustrate the statistical significance a significance level of 0 1 was set in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect on membrane performance the three gdm systems at the same hydraulic pressure of 40 mbar were operated at different hrts for 62 days in parallel the permeate flux development profiles were described in fig 2a during the initial 15 day of operation similar permeate flux drop trends were noticed in the three gdm reactors showing almost no influence of hrt on the gdm performance during early stage of biofilm development on the membrane surface after that the three gdm reactors experienced different permeate flux patterns in the gdm reactor with a longer hrt 102 h the permeate flux increased slightly followed by a slow decrease and reached at 11 2 lmh at the end of filtration while in the gdm reactor with a hrt of 54 h the permeate flux decreased with filtration time achieving 2 7 lmh at day 62 at a shorter hrt 22 h the permeate flux was relatively stable maintaining at 7 5 lmh till the end of operation such findings indicated that shortening or extending hrt could achieve a relatively higher permeate flux a similar phenomenon was observed in the gdm systems treating rainwater 16 in that study a permeate flux at hrt of 51 h was 2 9 lmh lower than 4 2 and 5 0 lmh at hrt of 27 h and 156 h respectively which was found to be closely associated with organic concentrations in the gdm reactors furthermore at the end of gdm operation the cake layer i e biofilm layer resistance and irreversible fouling resistance were examined and presented in fig 2b under the hrt of 54 h and 102 h the cake layer resistance accounted for 78 and 62 of total resistance respectively showing its predominant role in flux decline while under the hrt of 22 h the irreversible fouling was dominant almost 66 of the total resistance in addition with increasing hrt irreversible fouling resistance decreased but cake layer resistance increased followed by a decreasing trend it implies that hrt could influence fouling resistance distribution in terms of cake layer development and pore blocking the membrane performance is generally influenced by various factors such as water quality biofilm property and microbial community the effect of hrt on the individual factor and its relationship with membrane performance were discussed in the following sections 3 2 effect on permeate quality 3 2 1 organics in the gdm reactors as shown in table 1 the ph levels in the three gdm reactors were comparable to the feed seawater all of which were maintained at neutral levels the do levels in the gdm reactors were much lower than that of the feed water 0 5 4 7 mg l vs 6 5 mg l attributing to oxygen consumption with biodegradation of organics in the reactors interestingly initial do levels were relatively similar in all gdm reactors however after 25 day operation the averaged do level 4 2 4 7 mg l in the reactor at a shorter hrt 22 h or longer hrt 102 h was 8 times of that at a hrt of 54 h 0 5 mg l fig s1 in addition the doc in the gdm reactors at a shorter hrt 22 h 1 74 0 23 mg l or longer hrt 102 h 1 68 0 33 mg l were almost comparable to that of the feed seawater 1 61 0 39 mg l while the doc in the reactor at a hrt of 54 h 2 73 0 52 mg l was significantly higher than that of the feed seawater the aoc in the gdm reactors displayed a similar pattern as the doc with the highest aoc level in the gdm reactor at a hrt of 54 h 20 times of that in the feed seawater generally in the gdm reactor part of particulate substances from seawater can be hydrolyzed to soluble substances meanwhile the soluble substances are degraded by the microorganisms theoretically increasing hrt of the reactor accelerated both decomposition and degradation rates but they may not be in a similar level 26 in addition the rate of biodegradation is often slower under anoxic and anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions 27 therefore possibly the decomposition of particulate substances prevailed the biodegradation of soluble substances at a hrt of 54 h leading to greater accumulation of doc and aoc in the reactor the tep representing the organics 0 1 μm in the three gdm reactors were comparable and almost 2 time of that in the feed seawater this phenomenon was possibly associated with the cross linking nature of the decomposed organics especially in the presence of divalent cations 28 furthermore the detailed organic components were analyzed by lc ocd and eem which were present in fig 3a and b respectively the lc ocd data fig 3a indicated a significant accumulation of biopolymers building blocks and low molecule weight neutrals occurred in the gdm reactor operated at a hrt of 54 h while only the accumulation of low molecule weight neutrals was obvious in the gdm reactor at hrts of at 22 h and 102 h this trend was similar to doc and aoc accumulation patterns in the gdm reactors table 1 it suggests that the low molecule weight substances had a great contribution to aoc which was correspondent to the finding in the previous study 6 the eem data fig 3b revealed that the intensities of aromatic protein i in the three gdm reactors were greatly higher than that in the feed p value 0 1 at a short hrt of 22 h the aromatic protein ii and microbial byproduct like substances in the gdm reactor were insignificantly different from those in the feed seawater p value 0 1 while with extending hrt from 22 h to 102 h both aromatic protein ii and microbial byproduct like substances in the gdm reactor tended to slightly increase which were higher than those in the feed water p value 0 1 3 2 2 permeate quality shown in table 1 the permeate contained less doc and tep compared to the samples from the gdm reactors showing that the biofilm formed on the membrane benefited to reduce organics especially greater sized tep however the higher amounts of aoc in the permeate of the gdm reactors at a shorter 22 h or longer hrt 102 h were noticed compared to those in the gdm reactor under a hrt of 54 h less amount of aoc in the permeate than that in the gdm reactor it is noted that at hrts of 22 h and 102 h the aoc in the gdm reactors 51 53 μg l was much lower than that at a hrt of 54 h 730 μg l possibly when the available aoc was inadequate for maintaining the growth of biofilm developed on the membrane the biofilm may experience cell hydrolysis to produce aoc such aoc could not be rejected by the membranes and was present in the permeate on the other hand when the available aoc was sufficient for biofilm growth they would be utilized by the biofilm leading to a reduced amount of aoc in the permeate moreover the organic components biopolymers humics building blocks and low molecule weight neutrals in the permeates of the gdm reactors were almost comparable to those in the feed p value 0 1 except that the humics and low molecule weight neutrals in the permeate of the gdm reactor at a hrt of 54 h and the building blocks in the permeate of the gdm reactor at a hrt of 102 h were higher than those in the feed p value 0 1 the eem analysis pointed out that the three gdm reactors produced the permeate containing higher amounts of aromatic protein i and ii and microbial byproduct like substances compared to those in the feed p value 0 1 it appears that the aromatic proteins and microbial byproduct like substances were associated with the aoc level in the permeate this is dissimilar to the observation that low molecular weight substances contributed majorly to the aoc in the gdm reactor section 3 2 1 and raw seawater 6 we hypothesized that the biofilm on the membrane surface could utilize low molecule weight substances dominant organics for their growth and excreted these eem detectable metabolic products that could not be effectively rejected by the membrane and appeared in the permeate this also implies that the contribution of organics to aoc may be related to not only molecule sizes of organics but also chemical properties of size fractioned organics nevertheless the gdm reactors had better permeate quality at hrts of 22 h and 102 h in terms of doc tep and aoc moreover although increasing 5 time of hrt from 22 h to 102 h improved 1 5 of permeate flux a shorter hrt of 22 h was preferable for the gdm reactor in pretreating seawater with regard to treatment productivity and footprint 3 3 effect on biofilm properties 3 3 1 biofilm morphology the morphologies of the biofilms developed on the membranes were observed by clsm fig 4 and the biovolume of the biofilm were presented in table 2 with increasing hrt the biovolume of biofilm increased 0 90 0 53 3 05 1 13 and 8 93 1 47 μm3 μm2 under hrts of 22 54 and 102 h respectively showing the similar trend as the atp values of biofilm however the amount of biofilm atp and biovolume did not display linear relationship with the resistance of biofilm layer on the membrane fig 2b as the clsm images shown the biofilm formed at the longer hrt i e 102 h had more heterogeneous structure than those at the shorter hrts i e 22 h and 54 h possibly the heterogeneous structure of the biofilm hrt of 102 h benefited for reducing the biofilm resistance instead of the amount of the deposited biofilm the similar phenomenon was also noticed in several previous studies 8 13 29 3 3 2 biofilm composition furthermore the cell viability and organic compositions in the biofilm of the gdm reactors were analyzed and presented in table 2 more viable cells 97 were noticed in the biofilm of the gdm reactors under shorter hrts 22 h and 54 h while extending hrt to 102 h the developed biofilm had more dead cells 58 table 2 also indicates that slightly more organics especially building blocks and lmw neutrals by lc ocd analysis aromatic protein ii fulvic substances microbial byproduct like substances and humic acid like substances by eem analysis were deposited on the membrane surface in the gdm reactor under hrt of 54 h which may contribute to the development of the dense and uniform biofilm layer however the amount of individual organic component was not linearly associated with the permeate flux of the gdm reactors under different hrts this finding further highlighted that the biofilm morphology performs a major role in determining the permeate flux development 29 31 3 3 3 microbial community at the end of operation the biofilm samples and the water samples in the gdm reactors were collected for analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities under the hrt of 54 h the prokaryotic community in the biofilm layer and in the gdm reactor were greatly dissimilar both of which were also different from those in the gdm reactors at hrts of 22 h and 102 h fig 5a and fig s2 on the other hand the similarity of prokaryotic community between the biofilm and suspended bacteria in the gdm reactor was relatively higher at a longer hrt of 102 h in detail in the three gdm reactors planctomycetia 8 2 13 3 alphaproteobacteria 14 5 25 2 gammaproteobacteria 6 4 15 4 were commonly observed as dominant prokaryotic class of the suspended bacteria fig 6a however clostridia one of obligate anaerobic bacteria accounted for 15 9 in the gdm reactor under the hrt of 54 h which was closely related to its do level 0 5 0 3 mg l on the contrary almost negligible amounts of clostridia were found under both hrts of 22 h and 102 h 0 2 0 4 due to the relatively higher do levels 4 2 4 7 mg l in both gdm reactors the dissimilar microbial community at the hrt of 54 h suggests more rapid growth and decay of some microorganisms which may contribute to significant consumption of oxygen and increased organic concentration in the reactor while the do supply was limited due to such a longer hrt these suggest that hrt could play a pivotal role in determining the relationship among oxygen consumption biological activity and microbial community subsequently influencing the performances of gdm reactors in addition more alphaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia in the biofilm layer of the gdm reactor at the hrt of 54 h 31 5 and 25 1 respectively compared to those at the longer hrt of 102 h 8 4 and 13 8 respectively and at the shorter hrt of 22 h 10 9 and 0 5 respectively pollet et al 32 reported that marine biofilm formed on the plastic were predominated by alphaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia and flavobacteriia might be the key species associated with the functions of marine biofilm in contrast planctomycetia was highly present in the gdm reactors at both hrts of 102 h 41 1 and 22 h 41 3 significantly greater than those at the hrt of 54 h 5 0 on the other hand much lower diversity indexes of both suspended bacteria and biofilm layer were observed in the gdm at a hrt of 54 h compared to those at hrts of 22 h and 102 h table s1 in addition the eukaryotes in the biofilm layer and the suspended eukaryotes in the gdm reactor were significantly dissimilar regardless of hrt fig 5b and fig s2 while the hrt had greater impacts on richness diversity and structure of the suspended eukaryotes in the gdm reactors than those in the biofilm layer fig 5b and table s1 as indicated in fig 6b gastrotricha 25 4 labyrinthulomycetes 20 5 peronosporomycetes 21 3 nematoda 17 4 were predominant in the suspended eukaryotes when the gdm was operated at the longer hrt of 102 h while under the hrts of 54 h and 22 h dinoflagellata 62 4 gastrotricha 25 2 and dinoflagellata 20 5 peronosporomycetes 17 8 were majorly present in the gdm reactors respectively furthermore the eukaryotes developed in the biofilm under both hrts of 22 h and 102 h were similar which were relatively different from those under the hrt of 54 h fig 5b it is worth noting that gastrotricha was comparably dominant in the biofilms of three reactors 32 7 45 0 however nematoda belong to metazoan phylum was largely dominated in the biofilm under both hrts of 22 h and 102 h 39 7 47 3 but negligible under the hrt of 54 h 0 2 the low do levels at the hrt of 54 h could significantly increase the mortality of nematodes limiting their population 33 it has been well illustrated that the metazoan eukaryotes played an important role in the development of biofilm structure and water permeability attributing to their grazing movements and predator behaviors 8 29 in particular it was reported that nematodes and oligochaetes the subclass of nematoda and annelida respectively could facilitate to form the biofilm layer with more heterogeneous and porous structure due to their grazing movement 30 31 thus the lack of nematoda in the biofilm of the gdm reactor under the hrt of 54 h may be associated with its lowest permeate flux fig 2a 4 conclusions in this study the effect of hrt on the gdm reactor performance in terms of permeate quality and membrane performance and biofilm characteristics with regard to biofilm morphology organic compositions and microbial community was illustrated for seawater pre treatment application the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the permeate fluxes in the gdm reactors operated under different hrts followed a sequence under hrt 102 h under hrt 22 h under hrt 54 h under hrt of 22 h irreversible fouling was predominant in the gdm reactor while under hrt of 54 h and 102 h cake layer fouling contributed majorly to flux decline 2 the gdm reactors at hrts of 22 h and 102 h had superior permeate quality in terms of doc tep and aoc compared to that at hrt of 54 h in terms of treatment productivity and footprint a shorter hrt of 22 h is suggested to be adopted for the gdm reactor in pretreating seawater 3 the biofilm developed in the gdm reactor at hrt of 54 h displayed homogenous morphology with more organic accumulation and had less abundance of nematoda dominant predator leading to the lower permeate flux 4 the dominant prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities developed in the biofilm or present in the gdm reactors were dissimilar at different hrts it indicates that hrt influenced gdm performances by regulating microbial community structure declaration of competing interest

12513,the presence of emerging pollutants eps in water is a major environmental concern this study evaluates for the first time the removal of three eps namely triclosan tcs 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp and bisphenol a bpa 90 μmol dm3 from water through both fenton and photo fenton like reactions using montmorillonite mt and aluminum interlayered pillared clays al pilc as catalytic supports the catalysts fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc were evaluated in single component solutions and in an equimolar mixture two al pilc were synthesized from a hazardous waste namely aluminum saline slag using either the acid al pilcae or the alkaline al pilcbe aluminum extract as precursors the third al pilc was obtained by the conventional method using a commercial aluminum salt al pilccm catalytic supports were impregnated at 10 and 20 wt titanium iron loadings from 1 to 20 wt were tested for mt while only 20 wt iron was tested for al pilc all catalysts were characterized using several techniques and the results confirmed the formation of tio2 and fe2o3 almost 100 of tcs and 2 6 dcp were removed by both fenton like 240 and 420 min respectively and photo fenton like reactions 30 and 90 120 min respectively using the al pilc based catalyst the maximum removal for bpa was 80 14 1 93 after 120 min under photo fenton like conditions using al pilcbe the catalysts synthesized using the four catalytic supports showed good results for the removal of tcs by both processes while for 2 6 dcp and bpa the best results were obtained using al pilcae and al pilcbe as catalytic supports finally a degradation pathway was suggested for every pollutant based on the by products identified during the reactions by hplc ms the results revealed that the materials used in this work are suitable catalysts for removing emerging pollutants from water by both fenton and photo fenton like reactions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photo fenton like reaction alumina pillared clay catalyst aluminum saline slag organic pollutant data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is essential for life and therefore the entry of potentially hazardous chemicals into the aquatic environment has always been a major environmental concern 1 the organic pollutants commonly detected in the environment includes both persistent organic pollutants pops 2 and emerging pollutants eps pops are considered persistent and extremely toxic whereas eps were initially dismissed as eventual pollutants and as a result have not been monitored or regulated and thus released into the environment given the lack of information regarding their harmful effects eps are all those compounds whose concentration in the environment has increased to the point of generating hazardous effects 3 among the list of eps are triclosan tcs 5 chloro 2 2 4 dichlorophenoxy phenol bisphenol a bpa 4 4 propane 2 2 diyl diphenol and 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp tcs is a broad spectrum antibacterial and preservative agent which was widely used in many household personal care pcp and consumer products 1 4 7 but has since been shown to have chronic toxicity and several health effects including endocrine disrupting and estrogenic effects 5 8 bpa a plasticizer with endocrine disrupting effects 3 9 and 2 6 dcp which together with tcs belongs to the chlorophenols cp family and is used as an intermediate in several industries and as a raw material for the synthesis of several pharmaceuticals pesticides and herbicides 2 6 dcp has been shown to be highly toxic and harmful to both human health and the environment 10 several methods have been studied to remove organic pollutants from water and some conventional methods have exhibited disadvantages including slow and or incomplete degradation of the pollutants 11 12 advanced oxidation processes aops have been used and have shown to be an effective alternative for the removal of several toxic resistant and stable organic compounds due to their essentially complete lack of selectivity and excellent destructive power 13 14 aops are based on the production and use of hydroxyl radicals oh for oxidation of the target compound 11 however the efficiency of the degradation and mineralization can differ between the different aops used these results in the presence of several secondary products formed during the oxidation process in the final solution 11 13 this means that identification of the by products formed is essential to ensure that under the reaction conditions used this conversion does not generate other hazardous compounds for example the chemical structure of tcs is similar to highly toxic and persistent pollutants such as dioxins 1 thus meaning that the formation of dioxins as intermediates during its degradation is possible in fact although some studies have reported the effective removal of tcs by photodegradation 7 15 others have identified hazardous by products such as 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 8 dichlorodibenzo p dioxin 2 8 dcdd and 4 5 dichloro 2 2 dihydroxybiphenyl oh 2pcb 13 among others 6 8 12 15 16 these substances have been reported in photocatalytic processes using both solar and uv radiation as well as in biodegradation studies 2 8 dcdd for example can be converted into higher chlorinated dioxins which are considered more toxic this conversion can occur under certain conditions such as chlorination 6 this is particularly important given that both uv and chlorine dioxide clo2 are used in water treatment systems worldwide 16 the use of various aops such as fenton and photo fenton oxidation have been reported for the successful degradation of several organic pollutants 7 11 17 18 in the fenton process the ferrous iron is combined with hydrogen peroxide fe2 h2o2 at acidic conditions to generate the hydroxyl radicals oh 19 which degrade the target organic compounds into small organic molecules which are finally mineralized into co2 and h2o 14 20 fenton fe2 h2o2 and fenton like reactions fe3 h2o2 as well as photo fenton that use a combination of h2o2 fe ii iii and light irradiation uv have been successfully used to oxidize a wide list of organic pollutants including chlorinated compounds such as chlorobenzenes chlorophenols and chlorinated pesticides among others 8 11 14 17 21 the use of solid catalysts in fenton like processes to generate the strong oxidants and degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants is also a promising alternative several solids have been studied for this purpose including iron oxide minerals silicas zeolites clays and pillared clays among others 22 the considerable importance of clays as a semiconductor support material lies in their characteristics including their layered morphology chemical stability and cation exchange ability as well as their economic advantages and availability 23 one example of such clays is montmorillonite mt which belongs to the smectite group and is one of the most widely studied and reported in the literature the use of modified smectites in environmental protection has also been widely documented in the literature 2 24 25 one of these modification methods consists in introducing pillars between the layers by replacing the exchangeable cations in the clay with rigid metal oxide clusters thus converting the clays into pillared clays which have a larger basal spacing and pore volume 26 pillared clays have also been successfully studied as catalysts and catalytic supports for several chemical reactions 27 31 one of the modifications made to catalytic supports for use in catalysis involves the incorporation or deposition of metal and non metal ions tio2 and fe3 have been widely used for this purpose due to their characteristics and advantages 13 including the low cost photostability non toxicity high chemical stability and catalytic performance 32 however most of the studies on the use of pilc in catalysis involve ti pilc and fe pilc rather than nanocomposites in which the metal is deposited on the pilc using another pilc such as al pilc several researchers have used tio2 clays and ti pilc as photocatalysts for the photodegradation of organic pollutants under both uv or vis light irradiation in an aqueous suspension the use of sunlight has also been reported since this has aroused great interest for the removal of organic pollutants dyes are most widely studied pollutants for catalytic photodegradation being other organic compounds including herbicides analgesics antibiotics and endocrine disruptors have be also considered various authors have attempted to modify both tio2 clays and ti pilc to improve their photocatalytic efficiency under vis light or sunlight indeed several strategies such as the use of metal complex ions or photosensitizing dyes have been applied to photosensitize tio2 clays and ti pilc moreover modification of the parameters for the deposition methods is also needed in this case to obtain better nanoparticles and improve their photocatalytic performance it must always be remembered that pilcs are microporous materials dp 2 0 nm and that organic molecules that degrade should be able to diffuse into their porous structure therefore there is a steric diffusional limitation in this case in order to broaden the spectrum to other larger pollutant molecules it would be necessary to increase the structure of the adsorbents synthesized such as heterostructures or mof based on clays considering the above it is vital to explore new alternatives and study new possible catalysts for removing eps from water aluminum pillared clays al pilc are commonly obtained from commercial chemicals however previous studies have shown that those solids synthesized using the remaining aluminum extracted from a hazardous industrial waste saline slag are good adsorbents and catalysts for removing eps from water 32 33 repurposing industrial waste to reduce the environmental pollution aligns with the principles of a circular economy in this case by both turning the hazardous waste into a non hazardous material and by using it to remove pollutants from water 34 the use of al pilc as catalysts was studied using tio2 al pilc to photodegrade the eps due to the lack of information about the use of al pilc in general as catalytic supports in fenton and photo fenton processes for the removal of eps this work focuses for the first time on the synthesis of both fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts by deposition of the metals on the catalytic support using pillared clays synthesized previously from the aforementioned aluminum saline slags the catalysts obtained were evaluated for the removal of tcs bpa and 2 6 dcp from water by way of fenton and photo fenton reactions in a single component and an equimolar mixture of the three compounds the by products formed during the reaction were identified by hplc ms thus allowing us to propose a probable pathway for the degradation of each of these three pollutants 2 experimental procedure 2 1 materials and reagents four catalytic supports with different structural properties 33 were studied in this work namely three alumina pillared clays al pilc and a montmorillonite mt supplied by tsukinuno the clay science society of japan which was the mineral clay used as raw material in the synthesis of all three al pilc the difference between the three al pilc was the aluminum source in the intercalation solution used in their synthesis thus one of them al pilccm was prepared using the conventional aluminum source an aluminum salt in the intercalation solution whereas the other two were synthesized using the aluminum extracted from a hazardous waste produced in the secondary aluminum production process known as saline slags in this case the difference was that one of them used the alkaline extract al pilcbe and the other the acid one al pilcae the chemical composition by frx of the saline slags is na2o 8 65 wt mgo 2 76 wt al2o3 41 71 wt sio2 4 23 wt p2o5 0 05 wt cl 11 83 wt k2o 4 40 wt cao 2 08 wt tio2 0 31 wt cr 0 04 wt mno 0 17 wt fe2o3 2 05 wt cu 0 35 wt f 0 41 wt zn 0 18 wt the three organic pollutants studied were 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp c6h4cl2o acros organics triclosan tcs c12h7cl3o2 ambeed and bisphenol a bpa c15h16o2 acros organics methanol chemsolve was used during the preparation of their aqueous solutions to enhance their solubility and hydrochloric acid 37 panreac applichem to adjust the solution ph titanium iv isopropoxide 97 sigma aldrich iron iii nitrate nonahydrate panreac applichem hcl 37 panreac applichem and isopropyl alcohol 99 sigma aldrich were used during impregnation of the catalytic supports hplc grade acetonitrile acn j t baker and formic acid sigma aldrich were used for the high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis to quantify the three pollutants in the experiments and to identify their by products hydrogen peroxide h2o2 chempur was used in both fenton like and photo fenton like experiments 2 2 synthesis of the catalysts the catalytic supports used in this work were montmorillonite mt supplied by tsukinuno the clay science society of japan and three aluminum pillared clays al pilccm al pilcbe and al pilcae synthesized using the mt as the raw clay al pilccm was synthesized using the conventional method using commercial aluminum chloride alcl3 6h2o and naoh in a hydrolysis reaction oh al3 of 2 0 for the preparation of the intercalation solution al pilcbe and al pilcae were synthesized using the aluminum extracted from the saline slag by the alkaline or acid extraction method respectively the synthesis and characterization of the three al pilc is explained in a previous work 33 the mentioned work evaluated the parameters to prepare the intercalating solution that allows the synthesis of al pilc with the highest textural properties using aluminum extracts the parameters used for the preparation of the intercalating solution differ for the aluminum extracts alkaline and acid the oh al3 molar ratio was 2 0 for both however the al clay mmol g ratio was 20 0 alkaline and 7 0 acid and the clay volume solution ratio was 8 0 alkaline and 6 0 acid in the case of the alkaline extract the pillaring solution was prepared at room temperature 24 c and the acidic extract at high temperature 90 c the ph of the pillaring solutions was around 3 9 4 2 both titration and aging time was 1 h and the intercalation time was 22 h at room temperature at the end of the intercalation process the intercalated clays were separated from the solution by centrifugation hettich rotanta 460 s and washed several times with distilled water then they were dried 100 c for 8 h and subsequently calcinated 500 c for 4 h 1 c min in an oven nabertherm l5 s27 to produce the al pilc all four catalytic supports studied al pilccm al pilcbe al pilcae and mt were dried at 150 c for 12 h modification of these supports was carried out by first including the titanium to obtain tio2 mt and tio2 al pilc and then the iron to obtain fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc both these modifications iron and titanium were carried out using a well known method namely impregnation through stirring followed by calcination 35 the appropriate amount of the respective impregnating agent was calculated by taking into account the desired percentage of each in the catalyst in the light of preliminary results all four catalytic supports were modified using two mass percentages of ti 10 and 20 wt mt doped at both titanium mass percentages 10 and 20 wt was impregnated with four loadings of iron 1 5 10 and 20 wt and evaluated as catalytic support in the fenton like reaction in view of the results obtained all three al pilc studied in this work at both titanium mass percentages 10 and 20 wt were impregnated with iron only at the highest iron mass percentage 20 wt both values used in the impregnation steps agree with values previously used by other authors 36 37 in a few cases especially for the lower metal content the desired metal loading was added in a single step however in others especially for the higher metal contents successive impregnations were required because the volume of the solutions needed was higher than the water pore volume of the catalytic supports between these impregnation steps the loaded catalytic supports were dried at 100 c for 3 h to remove the solvent at the end of the impregnation procedure once the desired amount had been impregnated into the catalytic supports they were dried at 100 c for 8 h and 150 c for 12 h finally the dried solids were calcined at 500 c for 4 h 1 c min 2 3 characterization techniques the textural properties of the catalysts studied in this work were analyzed using n2 praxair 99 999 adsorption experiments at 196 c using a gas sorption analyzer micromeritics model asap 2020 plus samples 0 2 g were degassed prior to the analysis 200 c for 12 h at a pressure lower than 0 1 pa the total pore volume vtotal was calculated using the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0 98 and the specific surface area sbet of the catalysts in the relative pressure range from 0 05 to 0 2 was estimated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method the catalysts were characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd using a bruker d 8 advance eco x ray diffractometer ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 0 1548 nm was used operating in the range from 8 to 70 2θ at a scan rate of 0 2 2θ min finally the morphology and the chemical composition of the catalysts were determined by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectrometry inspect f50 at 10 kv and transmission electron microscopy tem using a tecnai t30 transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv 2 4 fenton and photo fenton like reactions aqueous solutions of each pollutant 90 μmol dm3 were prepared and their ph was adjusted to 3 5 using hcl aq this ph value was chosen as is it well known that both fenton and fenton like reactions are more effective under acidic conditions 13 38 39 the solution of the respective pollutant 15 cm3 at that ph value was mixed in a round bottom glass reactor with the respective catalyst 15 mg and magnetically stirred continuously in the dark 700 rpm for 15 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium between the pollutants and the catalyst surface at this point the respective fenton or photo fenton catalytic test was started adding the oxidant h2o2 at a molar ratio of 1 10 with respect to the pollutant the molar ratio of h2o2 was calculated using the theoretical stoichiometric amount required for complete oxidation of the three pollutants this value was chosen based on the results obtained in preliminary experiments in the case of photo fenton experiments the reaction was carried out in a uv reactor equipped with 20 monochrome hg lamps power 160 w with a continuous uv a radiation spectrum with mean peaks at 350 nm in photo fenton experiments once the h2o2 had been added the uv source was turned on to allow the reaction to occur under exposure to uv radiation once the fenton or photo fenton reaction had started aliquots were taken from the suspension at established time intervals these aliquots were centrifuged at 6000 rpm ifuge m08 microcentrifuge from neuation and filtered hydrophilic ptfe diameter 1 3 cm pore diameter 0 22 μm to ensure complete removal of the catalyst the conversion efficiency was determined by hplc ms measuring the amount of pollutant eliminated from the solution after those given periods of time all experiments were repeated once in addition to the single component solutions an equimolar aqueous solution of the three pollutants at 90 μmol pollutant dm3 was prepared to study the fenton and photo fenton catalytic degradation of this mixture the ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 using hcl aq and the fenton and photo fenton procedures were carried out as described for the single component solutions the percentage of pollutant adsorbed the percentage of pollutant converted and the percentage of pollutant removed were determined by calculating the difference between the initial and remaining concentrations using eqs 1 3 1 pollutant adsorbed c 0 c t 1 c 0 100 2 pollutant converted c t 1 c t 2 c t 1 100 3 pollutant removed c 0 c t 2 c 0 100 where c 0 μmol dm3 c t1 μmol dm3 and c t2 μmol dm3 correspond to the initial concentration of the organic compound at the beginning of the experiment 90 μmol dm3 the concentration of organic compound at 15 min when the dark adsorption period finished and the fenton and photo fenton experiments started and finally the concentration of the organic pollutant at the respective sampling time which for calculation of the final value was the concentration of pollutant in the final sampling at the end of the experiment the kinetics for oxidation of the organic pollutants by both fenton and photo fenton processes can be represented as follows 4 d c p dt k p c p c oh where c p and c oh are the concentrations μmol dm3 of pollutant and hydroxyl radical and k p is the rate constant for the reaction under certain reaction conditions the concentration of hydroxyl radical is constant 40 thus leading to the following reduced pseudo first order equation 5 d c p dt k 1 c p where k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant when t 0 c p is equal to c p0 then 6 ln c p c p 0 k 1 t the pseudo first order rate constant is obtained from the slope calculated using the linear least squares fit for the logarithmic plot of the data the pseudo second order model was also studied using the following equations 7 d c p dt k 2 c p 2 8 t c t 1 k 2 c e 2 t c e where k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant and c t and c e the concentration of the pollutant μmol dm3 at time t and equilibrium respectively to choose the model that best fits the experimental data a comparison of both the adjusted r squared r2 and the residual sum of squares rss was taken into account 41 the rss compares the experimental and calculated value according to the kinetic model smaller rss values indicate a similarity between the experimental and calculated data while higher values suggest that the model poorly explains the experimental data to evaluate the experimental results obtained in this work we used a hypothesis test at 5 significance level the f test for comparison of variances and analysis of conglomerates using statgraphics centurion and originpro version 9 2 5 by product identification the by products obtained in the fenton and photo fenton catalytic degradation of all three pollutants were identified by mass spectrometry an uhplc ultimate 3000 dionex coupled to an uv detector and an electrospray ionization esi mass spectrometer amazon sl bruker daltonics operating in negative mode and a c18 column halo 2 1 150 mm 4 6 μm particle size were used for this purpose a mixture of acn water 0 25 formic acid with a volume ratio of 60 40 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0 5 cm3 min each sample 10 μl was analyzed in full scan mode range of 50 to 600 m z at a scan speed of 0 20 scans s the experiments to identify the by products in both fenton and photo fenton reactions were carried out by replicating the experiments with the catalyst that took longer for the conversions to ensure identification of the maximum possible number of by products during the experiment the aliquots analyzed during the reaction were sampled at the same sampling times as in the previous experiments all samples were diluted 1 10 before analysis in the hplc ms system finally the by products formed by all three target organic pollutants were tentatively identified by comparing the molecular ion and respective mass fragmentation pattern with those found in the literature with the aid of the nist mass spectral library 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalysts analysis of all the catalysts synthesized was repeated once using xrd and n2 adsorption techniques in order to gain a better understanding of their homogeneity and to study them by statistical analysis the xrd patterns of the mt and al pilc used as supports are presented in fig s1 the xrd results of the catalysts synthesized confirmed the presence of both tio2 anatase phase and fe2o3 in the solids as a result of the identification of their characteristic peaks as shown in fig 1 the debye scherer equation eq 9 42 was used to calculate the crystallite size of both tio2 and fe2o3 particles in all samples fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc from the xrd patterns this was performed using the most intense diffraction peak 101 of the anatase phase found at 25 31 and the average of the two most intense peaks 104 and 110 for fe2o3 found at 33 33 and 35 79 9 d kλ β cosθ where d is crystal size nm k is the crystallite shape factor 0 89 and λ the x ray wavelength β is the width at half maximum fwhm of the respective peak and θ is the bragg angle the xrd patterns of the catalysts are summarized in figs 1 and 2 fig 1 shows the xrd pattern for mt tio2 mt 10 and 20 wt ti and fe2o3 tio2 mt 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe in both cases fig 2 presents the xrd pattern of the three tio2 al pilc 10 and 20 wt ti and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe in both cases the estimated value of the crystallite size for tio2 anatase in all samples including mt and al pilc ranged from 18 52 1 75 to 25 81 0 22 nm which is in agreement with the values reported previously 35 36 43 all mt samples at both titanium contents 10 and 20 wt impregnated with various iron loadings showed an increase in the fe2o3 crystal size as the amount of iron used in the impregnation step increased ranging from 16 05 0 72 mt 10 wt ti and 1 wt fe to 39 92 7 70 nm mt 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe the anova of the crystal size values showed that there is only a statistically significant difference between the catalysts at 20 ti impregnated with various iron loadings p 0 05 95 confidence the results revealed that the titanium content has a statistically significant effect on the crystal size p 0 05 in the case of al pilc at both 10 and 20 wt titanium impregnated with 20 iron the crystal sizes ranged from 24 24 0 40 al pilcbe 10 wt ti and 20 wt fe to 42 88 1 99 nm al pilccm 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe the statistical analysis of the data revealed that there is no statistically significant difference between the crystal sizes of the three al pilc p 0 05 95 confidence the crystal sizes calculated in this work are in agreement with the values reported by other authors 43 45 the textural characteristics of the supports are shown in fig s1 and the textural characteristics of the catalysts are summarized in table 1 and figs 3 and 4 table 1 lists the calculated specific surface areas sbet average pore diameters dp and total pore volumes vtotal and fig 3 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for tio2 mt at 10 and 20 wt ti and fe2o3 tio2 mt at 10 and 20 wt ti with various iron contents 1 20 wt fig 4 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the different fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc synthesized at both titanium concentrations 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe the adsorption isotherms obtained which are considered to be type ii according to the iupac classification 46 are characteristic of pilc the hysteresis loops of the isotherms exhibit a broad pore size distribution 36 in the case of the catalysts synthesized using mt as the catalytic support statistical analysis of the sbet data showed that there is only a significant difference for those at 20 wt ti with various iron contents 1 20 fe p 0 05 95 confidence the multifactorial analysis of the sbet data for all catalysts in table 1 showed that both factors titanium and iron content have a statistically significant effect p 0 05 95 confidence only for those catalysts synthesized using al pilc as catalytic support for fe2o3 tio2 mt only the titanium content has a significant effect on sbet value 95 confidence these results highlight both the relationship between the crystallite size and the sbet area of the catalysts and the relevance of the iron titanium ratio used in their synthesis the morphology of all the catalysts studied in this work was evaluated by sem and tem the micrographs are presented in fig 5 sem and fig 6 tem these micrographs figs 5 a and 6 a show the surface morphology of all the catalytic supports used clearly highlighting the differences between the mineral clay and the pillared clays used mt has a fluffy and smooth appearance with irregular flakes while al pilc shows a uniform morphology the sem and tem images in figs 5 and 6 show the different catalysts at 20 wt ti with 0 wt fe b and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe c a comparison of those micrographs also reveals the significant change in the structure of the supports upon incorporation of tio2 and fe2o3 into the structure figs 5 c and 6 c 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe show disordered and exfoliated structures the morphological features observed in the sem and tem images suggest formation of the particles on the external surface of the catalytic supports in agreement with other authors 36 the micrographs of the fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts synthesized under the conditions of this study demonstrate the formation of nanostructures with an average particle size of 50 nm which is in agreement with the xrd results and with other authors who have synthesized tio2 fe2o3 nanoparticles 47 fig 7 a shows a tem micrograph for al pilcbe at 10 wt ti and 20 wt fe the lattice fringes of tio2 pink and yellow and fe2o3 green and blue correspond to the 101 103 012 and 104 planes with a fringe distance of 0 35 0 24 0 37 and 0 27 nm respectively fig 7 b presents the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern for the fe2o3 tio2 al pilcbe catalyst which corroborates the xrd findings regarding the presence of tio2 and fe2o3 in the catalysts synthesized the crystallographic planes 101 103 and 107 correspond to tio2 while the crystallographic planes 110 and 116 and 214 correspond to fe2o3 for all catalysts the size of the particles calculated from the tem images is in agreement with the xrd results fig 7 d shows the particle size distribution curve calculated for al pilcbe with 10 wt ti and 20 wt fe and also the uniform distribution of the particles with an average diameter of 21 nm finally as mentioned in the experimental procedure edx was used to monitor the average elemental composition of the nanocomposites synthesized and confirm the purity of the catalysts fig s2 shows the elemental mapping analysis of the catalysts at 20 ti and 20 fe the edx results confirmed the presence of both tio2 and fe2o3 in all catalysts synthesized and as can be seen in table s1 they did not contain impurities these values also show that both contents tio2 and fe2o3 were successfully controlled during the synthesis given the similarity between the experimental content and the theoretical value used during impregnation the relative error of the impregnations ranged from 0 4 to 12 0 and was lower for impregnation with titanium 0 4 7 8 than for impregnation with iron 7 1 12 0 the highest relative error for the titanium and iron impregnations was found for the synthesis of fe2o3 tio2 al pilcbe 3 2 fenton and photo fenton like reactions in the single component experiments the experimental times fenton and photo fenton were selected on the basis of the time required to remove the maximum quantity of the respective pollutant from the solution in all cases in the fenton experiments for tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa these times were 240 420 and 540 min respectively the times required for the photo fenton experiments were 30 min for tcs and 90 120 min for 2 6 dcp and bpa the duration of the equimolar mixture experiments was established on the basis of the time required to remove the slowest degraded pollutant in the single component experiments the percentage of tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa removed by the catalysts in the single component experiments after 240 tcs 420 2 6 dcp and 540 bpa minutes of fenton like reaction and after 30 min of photo fenton like reaction are summarized in figs 8 9 and 10 respectively as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 almost complete removal 100 of tcs and 2 6 dcp was achieved in the case of tcs this was possible in both the fenton and photo fenton processes irrespective of the four catalytic supports evaluated for 2 6 dcp and bpa however better results were obtained when using al pilcae and al pilcbe as the catalytic supports the three were at the highest loading of both titanium and iron the maximum bpa removed in the fenton like reaction was 42 24 as the figures reveal a reaction time of 30 min was insufficient to achieve the complete removal of 2 6 dcp and bpa in the photo fenton like reaction finally for all three pollutants the percentage removed was lower in the equimolar mixture component solutions than in the single component experiments with values up to 1 77 16 82 and 1 33 times smaller for tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa respectively the percentages of the three pollutants removed under both fenton and photo fenton like conditions were higher in both single and mixed component systems for the catalysts containing 20 wt titanium than for those containing 10 wt titanium additionally in both fenton and photo fenton experiments the percentages of the three pollutants removed increased as the iron content wt increased see figs 8 10 table s2 shows the percentages of all three pollutants removed in both single and mixed component solutions under both fenton and photo fenton conditions using the catalysts synthesized with 10 wt ti and 20 wt ti and the highest iron load 20 wt in both cases the reaction times required to achieve these values were 240 tcs 420 2 6 dcp and 540 min bpa for the fenton reaction and 30 min for all three pollutants in the photo fenton reaction table 2 shows the percentages obtained at the highest iron concentration which are those that gave the highest conversion for the complete removal of 2 6 dcp in the photo fenton process a reaction time of at least 90 min was required for the three al pilcs and 120 min for the mt while a time of at least 120 min was needed to reach the highest removal of bpa 70 25 80 14 in the photo fenton process the time required to remove the pollutants in the photo fenton like reaction was less than that required for the fenton like reaction a comparison of the amounts removed at the same sampling times revealed higher values for the photo fenton reaction than for the fenton reaction at every sampling time with the highest values being achieved when the catalysts used contained 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe this higher degradation rate for the photo fenton like process indicates the successful narrowing of the bandgap this is possible due to both the well formed anatase phase as confirmed by xrd and the presence of fe3 in the tio2 conduction layer which allows the excited electrons to react with the fe3 ions thereby preventing or reducing electron hole recombination 13 48 the improvement in the catalytic performance of the catalysts as the iron load increased could also be due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies by the iron which results in the formation of surface hydroxyl groups as explained by other authors 13 these results clearly show the positive synergistic effect of the uv tio2 fe2o3 h2o2 system in the oxidative degradation of the pollutants studied herein this synergistic acceleration in the oxidative degradation process agrees with results reported by other authors 49 statistical analysis of all data for every pollutant was carried out by performing a multi factor analysis of variance involving five factors iron and titanium content in the catalyst used catalytic support system single compound or mixture of the three pollutants and uv presence or absence the results revealed that all five factors have a statistically significant effect on the total removal of 2 6 dcp p 0 05 but only four of them iron and titanium content catalytic support and system on the total removal of tcs and three iron and titanium content and uv on the total removal of bpa p 0 05 with 95 confidence in all three cases the factor which contributed most to the variance of the total removal was uv which contributes 94 35 2 6 dcp 50 45 tcs and 73 02 bpa followed by the iron content in the case of 2 6 dcp 5 29 and bpa 26 63 and system in the case of tcs 43 59 these findings corroborate the improvement in the degradation efficiency due to the use of uv radiation a statistical analysis was also carried out focusing on the catalytic supports for mt the uv factor contributed most to the variance in the total removal of all three pollutants 84 18 for 2 6 dcp 45 34 for tcs and 99 71 for bpa in the case of the three al pilc the data showed that the total removal behavior differs between the three pollutants studied thus for the removal of bpa three factors namely iron and titanium content and uv have a significant effect with iron content accounting for 62 82 al pilcbe 68 57 al pilccm and 62 16 al pilcae contributing most to this variance for the removal of 2 6 dcp two factors namely system and uv have a statistically significant effect and the factor which contributed most to the variance was uv accounting for 99 61 al pilcbe 93 73 al pilccm and 78 82 al pilcae finally for tcs removal three factors namely titanium content system and uv al pilcbe al pilccm and iron content system and uv al pilcae have a significant effect in this case the factor which contributed most to the variance for al pilcbe and al pilcae was uv accounting for 76 82 al pilcbe and 53 91 al pilccm followed by system 22 14 for al pilcbe and 45 94 for al pilcae while for al pilccm the factor which contributed most to the variance in the total removal of tcs was system 56 24 followed by uv 43 53 the conversion data for all three pollutants were analyzed statistically by way of a multi factor analysis for tcs and 2 6 dcp two factors namely titanium content and uv presence or absence have a statistically significant effect on the conversion of tcs p 0 05 with 95 confidence for bpa three factors namely iron and titanium content and uv presence or absence have a statistically significant effect on the conversion for all three pollutants uv was the factor that contributed most to the variance in pollutant conversion accounting for 98 83 tcs 89 45 2 6 dcp and 77 86 bpa a comparison of both pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic plots for tcs in the fenton process can be found in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows the plots for fe2o3 tio2 mt at both 10 and 20 wt ti with the iron loadings tested in this work 1 20 wt and fig 12 the catalysts at 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe the kinetic parameters for all three pollutants can be found in table 3 for both the fenton without uv radiation and photo fenton with uv radiation reactions this table gives the parameters obtained from the curve fitting for both models pseudo first and pseudo second order reactions tables s3 s5 give the kinetic parameters for all catalysts used in this work for the three pollutants studied the higher regression values 0 890 0 997 for tcs 0 935 0 999 for 2 6 dcp and 0 946 0 998 for bpa and the lower residual sum of squares rss values 0 001 1 811 for tcs 1 21 10 4 0 371 for 2 6 dcp and 2 59 10 5 0 007 for bpa obtained using the pseudo first order kinetic equation show that this kinetic best fits the experimental data for conversion of all the pollutants in both the fenton and photo fenton processes the half life τ 1 2 values were calculated using eq 10 in which k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 10 τ 1 2 0 693 k 1 table s6 gives the calculated half life τ 1 2 values for the fenton and photo fenton processes the results confirmed that the photo fenton like process is more efficient for degrading all three pollutants as was mentioned in the experimental section the fenton and photo fenton catalytic degradation experiments started after 15 min of adsorption in the dark in the presence of the corresponding catalyst the adsorption results for the catalysts showed that the amount of the three pollutants adsorbed in both single and mixed component systems was higher for the catalysts impregnated with 20 titanium than for those impregnated with 10 ti additionally in both cases 10 and 20 ti the amount adsorbed increased as the iron content increased for all catalysts used a statistical analysis of the adsorption data was conducted for each pollutant involving four factors namely catalytic support used iron and titanium content in the catalyst and system single compound or mixture of the three pollutants the results revealed that all four factors have a statistically significant effect on adsorption for all three pollutants p 0 05 with 95 confidence however the factor that contributed most to the variance of the adsorption differed for the three pollutants thus for 2 6 dcp it was the system single or mixed component which contributed 55 29 to the variance in adsorption while for bpa this factor was the iron content 71 51 and for tcs the catalytic support used 33 64 a statistical analysis of the adsorption data for the catalytic supports used was conducted for each of the three pollutants including three factors namely iron and titanium content and system single compound or mixture of the three pollutants the results showed that all three factors have a statistically significant effect on the adsorption of all three pollutants for mt p 0 05 while these three factors have a statistically significant effect on the adsorption of 2 6 dcp and tc for all three al pilc in the case of bpa adsorption on al pilc two factors namely iron and titanium content have a significant effect in the case of bpa and tcs iron content was the factor that contributed most to the variance of adsorption on the three pilc and two pilc respectively thus the iron content contributed 85 84 al pilcbe 72 62 al pilccm and 99 01 al pilcae to the variance in bpa adsorption and 32 23 al pilcbe and 40 99 al pilccm to the variance in tcs adsorption in the case of al pilcae the factor that contributed most to the variance in tcs adsorption was system single compound or mixture accounting for 68 05 of the variance finally system also was the factor that contributed most to the variance of 2 6 dcp adsorption accounting for 55 68 al pilcbe 83 48 al pilccm and 69 87 al pilcae these results reveal that adsorption of the pollutants plays an important role in the total removal of tcs which was the most adsorbed pollutant 5 44 54 55 2 6 dcp 0 29 15 4 and bpa 0 01 11 58 the successful use of tio2 clay hybrids as adsorbents for the removal of pollutants has been reported previously 36 finally with the aim of clarifying the similarities and differences between the changes in adsorption conversion and total removal in both reactions fenton and photo fenton like by the catalysts that showed the best results 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe a hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out using the nearest neighbor method the results are presented in fig 13 for bpa a and d 2 6 dcp b and e and tcs c f in both fenton like a c and photo fenton like d f reactions the cluster in fig 13 a for example shows how for bpa adsorption and conversion by the catalyst 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe synthesized using al pilcbe as catalytic support are very similar to those obtained using al pilccm it also reveals that in this case somewhat different values were obtained for the catalyst synthesized using mt as catalytic support the clusters in fig 13 show how the similarities and differences between the catalysts in the fenton like reaction a only differ from those observed in the photo fenton like process d for bpa in the case of tcs fig 13 c and f the catalysts synthesized using al pilc as catalytic support behaved in a very similar manner differing values were obtained for the catalyst synthesized using mt as catalytic support for both tcs fig 13 c and f and bpa fig 13 a and d while for 2 6 dcp this was the case for al pilcbe fig 13 b and e these results illustrate the relationship between pollutant and catalyst and the difference in the removal behavior of the catalysts depending on their catalytic support the differences between those catalysts synthesized using the three al pilc corroborate their morphological and compositional differences thereby highlighting the importance of the aluminum source used in their synthesis and how this affects their possible use in environmental remediation 3 3 by product identification in studies related to the removal of organic compounds from water by degradation is crucial to know both the remaining concentration of the target pollutant and the composition of the sample at the end of the process identification of the molecules in the final sample is important because on occasions the by products obtained upon pollutant degradation can be even more toxic and persistent than their parent compounds 1 4 11 50 this information is also relevant to understand how the target pollutant is degraded and explain the degradation pathway the aim of the current study was not to elucidate the reactions that occur in the degradation pathway of all three organic pollutants studied nor to quantify the by products resulting from the reaction instead the by products formed by all three target organic pollutants were tentatively identified at different stages of the reaction and the degradation pathway was proposed by considering both the by products identified at the different reaction times analyzed and the different pathways proposed by other authors bearing in mind the principles of organic chemistry for the three organic pollutants analyzed herein we found the same by products when using both fenton and photo fenton reactions in the case of tcs nine products were found during the reaction 4 chlorocatehol 4 cc 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 chloro 5 4 chloro 2 hydroxyphenoxy benzene 1 4 diol hpbd 2 chloro 5 2 4 dichloro 5 hydroxyphenoxy cyclohexa 2 5 diene 1 4 dione hpcd 4 6 dichloro 1 2 benzenediol 4 6 dc 1 2 bd and 4 6 dichlororesorcinol 4 6 dcr monochlorophenol mcp chlorohydroquinone chq and p hydroquinone of triclosan p ht fig s3 shows the extracted ion chromatograms xic for the main by products identified and table s7 the proposed structures of these by products the results obtained are in accordance with those published by other authors who identified the following compounds as by products of the oxidation of tcs p ht 8 51 2 4 dcp 8 14 16 51 56 4 cc 8 14 52 57 4 6 dc 1 2 bd 8 4 6 dcr 8 hpcd 7 of these by products 2 4 dcp and 4 cc have also been reported as photo products of tcs 1 6 12 15 16 52 58 61 as mentioned previously the aim of this work was not to quantify the by products during the reaction but to elucidate the changes in their concentration during it as such 2 4 dcp was identified among the peaks in the hplc chromatogram using a commercial reagent sigma aldrich fig s4 shows the region for 2 4 dcp in the hplc chromatogram at different sampling times ranging from 15 to 240 min this figure reveals that the signal corresponding to 2 4 dcp changes during the experiment increasing in intensity as the reaction proceeds the probable pathway for the degradation of tcs in this work was proposed based on the different molecules tentatively identified and the oxidation pathways proposed by other authors such as wang et al 7 apell et al 15 peng et al 14 hossein et al 12 and munoz et al 8 see fig 14 the structure of tcs has two positions for hydroxyl radical attack as a result of the oh group which has a directing nature thus if the radical attacks in the para position a hydroxylation occurs and p ht is formed whereas if the radical attacks in the ortho position an ether bond cleavage occurs thereby opening one of the aromatic rings and forming 2 4 dcp and or 4 cc the latter can also be formed from 2 4 dcp upon hydroxylation and dechlorination given the compounds identified it is likely that 2 4 dcp undergoes three different degradation reactions dechlorination hydroxylation or hydroxylation plus dechlorination monochlorophenol mcp is formed by dechlorination 4 6 dcr and 4 6 dc 1 2 bd by hydroxylation after attack of the hydroxyl radical at the meta or ortho position respectively and 4 cc and chq by hydroxylation and dechlorination due to substitution of the chlorine atom at the ortho or para position hpcd which was also identified among the products can be formed from tcs or p ht by hydroxylation followed by dehydrogenation in both cases finally p ht can be converted into hpbd by hydroxylation followed by dechlorination the presence of triclosan dimers has also been reported as a result of a polymerization reaction that can be favored by the high concentration of chlorophenols in the presence of uv light 58 in this work however no tcs dimers or any other polymerization products were found given the by products formed we propose that triclosan degradation under both our experimental conditions occurs as a result of ether bond cleavage hydroxylation dechlorination hydrodechlorination and dehydrogenation in the case of the degradation of 2 6 dcp eight by products were identified the main by products were 2 6 dichlorohydroquinone 2 6 dchq 2 6 dichloro p benzoquinone 2 6 dcbq 2 6 dihydroxycyclohexa 2 5 diene 1 4 dione 2 6 dhch 2 5 d 1 4 d 2 hydroxy p benzoquinone 2 hbq and p benzoquinone bq the extracted ion chromatograms xic of these by products are presented in fig s5 and their proposed structures in table s7 other compounds tentatively identified during the reaction were 1 2 3 5 tetrahydroxybenzene 1 2 3 5 thb 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene 1 2 4 thb chlorohydroquinone chq and a few short chain acids the results obtained agree with those reported by other authors such as dai et al 62 and norabadi et al 62 who also studied the oxidative degradation of 2 6 dcp given both the oxidation pathways published by these authors and the products identified in this work at the sampling times used a possible pathway for the degradation of 2 6 dcp was proposed this tentative pathway is shown in fig 15 if the oh radical attacks the benzene ring of 2 6 dcp in the para position a hydroxylation occurs and dchq is formed chq 2 6 dcbq and bq can then be formed by dechlorination dehydrogenation or dechlorination plus dehydrogenation of 2 6 dchq respectively chq and 2 6 dcbq can also be formed from 2 6 dcp by hydroxylation plus dechlorination or hydroxylation and dehydrogenation both hydroxylations occur in the para position the hydroxylation plus dechlorination of chq for substitution of the chlorine atom at the ortho position gives 1 2 4 thb which in turn has two possible degradation reactions pathways namely dehydrogenation or hydroxylation that form 2 hbq or 1 2 3 5 thb respectively 1 2 3 5 thb can also be obtained from 2 6 dcp by hydroxylation plus dechlorination of both chlorine atoms similarly 1 2 3 5 thb can be converted into 2 6 dhch 2 5 d 1 4 d by way of a dehydrogenation reaction finally analysis of the solutions obtained from the oxidation of bpa showed five by products during the reaction bpa o catechol bpa o c bisphenol o quinone bpa q 3 hydroxy 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl cyclohexa 3 5 diene 1 2 dione 3 h 4 2 hp 2 c 3 5 d 1 2 d 4 hydroxyacetophenone 4 hap 4 isopropenylphenol 4 ipp and hydroquinone hq these products have been reported by other authors bpa o c 63 69 bpa q 63 65 4 ipp 20 64 66 68 70 71 4 hap 20 63 64 66 68 70 3 h 4 2 hp 2 c 3 5 d 1 2 d 68 hq 20 66 68 70 fig s6 shows the extracted ion chromatograms xic of bpa and its by products and table s7 their proposed structures based on the products identified and the pathway put forward in the studies referenced above an alternative pathway for the degradation of bpa was proposed as shown in fig 16 in light of the products formed the oh radical attacks bpa mainly at two positions in the first one the hydroxyl radical attacks the benzene ring of bpa to give bpa o c by way of a radical addition bpa o c in turn forms bpa q by dehydrogenation in the second one the oh radical attacks the other vulnerable position of bpa namely the cc bond between the aromatic ring and the isopropyl group in the molecule thus resulting in cleavage of the phenyl groups of bpa and forming 4 ipp hq and 4 hap these three compounds can also be formed from bpa o c by cleavage of the phenyl groups the oxidation of tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa mainly occurs due to the attack of oh radicals hydroxyl radicals oh are vital in the fenton process as they are responsible for initiating sequential degradation of the organic pollutants upon reaction with them 71 in this process iron catalyzes the decomposition of h2o2 to form these hydroxyl radicals 20 the prevalent intermediates found in this work were hydroquinones and quinones which is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors who have reported those compounds as the predominant intermediates in the degradation of chlorophenols in general 72 73 formation of the different quinones identified as by products in this work was proposed as a result of the oxidation of hydroquinones and related compounds via a two step successive single electron transfer in agreement with the principles of organic chemistry 62 in all three cases the aromatic compounds formed are further oxidized in subsequent steps undergoing ring opening reactions that result in the formation of different aliphatic compounds such as alcohols and short chain acids a few such acids including maleic and oxalic acid were identified in the oxidation experiments for all three pollutants finally all the intermediate molecules were mineralized to co2 and h2o by way of decarboxylation and oxidation processes the compounds identified in the solutions remaining at the end of the experiments showed that the toxicity of tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa solutions was gradually reduced as a result of oxidation via both fenton and photo fenton processes 4 conclusions in this study montmorillonite mt and three alumina pillared montmorillonites al pilcae al pilcbe and al pilccm have been used as catalytic supports to synthesize fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts the success of the synthesis was evaluated using several techniques such as sem edx tem xrd and n2 adsorption experiments at 196 c the statistical analysis revealed the importance of the titanium iron ratio used in the synthesis tcs and 2 6 dcp were almost completely removed 100 by both fenton like 240 and 420 min and photo fenton like 30 and 90 min reactions using fe2o3 tio2 al pilc as catalysts the highest removal value for bpa was 80 14 1 93 by the photo fenton like reaction 120 min tcs showed good degradation results irrespective of the catalytic support evaluated whereas 2 6 dcp and bpa exhibited better results when using fe2o3 tio2 al pilcae and fe2o3 tio2 al pilcbe the highest removal values were achieved using the catalyst with the highest content of both titanium and iron 20 wt in all cases for all three pollutants the amount removed in the equimolar mixed component solutions was lower than in the single component experiments with values up to 1 77 tcs 16 82 2 6 dcp and 1 33 times smaller bpa results highlighted the importance of the catalytic support and corroborated the differences between the three al pilc thereby agreeing with their characterization this highlights the impact of the aluminum source used in their synthesis and how it may affect their possible use in environmental remediation analysis of the by products showed nine eight and five main by products for tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa respectively and the results obtained allowed us to put forward a possible degradation pathway for each pollutant in general our results indicate that the fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts used in this work are suitable for removing emerging contaminants such as tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa from water by way of both fenton like and photo fenton like reactions this work has allowed the evaluation of a material synthesized from a hazardous industrial waste as a catalyst the results have been better than those obtained when the catalyst obtained through commercial precursors is applied this behavior can be explained from a synergistic effect produced by the metals that are extracted in the recovery process therefore a possible path for the future is opened for the recovery of this type of waste

12513,the presence of emerging pollutants eps in water is a major environmental concern this study evaluates for the first time the removal of three eps namely triclosan tcs 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp and bisphenol a bpa 90 μmol dm3 from water through both fenton and photo fenton like reactions using montmorillonite mt and aluminum interlayered pillared clays al pilc as catalytic supports the catalysts fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc were evaluated in single component solutions and in an equimolar mixture two al pilc were synthesized from a hazardous waste namely aluminum saline slag using either the acid al pilcae or the alkaline al pilcbe aluminum extract as precursors the third al pilc was obtained by the conventional method using a commercial aluminum salt al pilccm catalytic supports were impregnated at 10 and 20 wt titanium iron loadings from 1 to 20 wt were tested for mt while only 20 wt iron was tested for al pilc all catalysts were characterized using several techniques and the results confirmed the formation of tio2 and fe2o3 almost 100 of tcs and 2 6 dcp were removed by both fenton like 240 and 420 min respectively and photo fenton like reactions 30 and 90 120 min respectively using the al pilc based catalyst the maximum removal for bpa was 80 14 1 93 after 120 min under photo fenton like conditions using al pilcbe the catalysts synthesized using the four catalytic supports showed good results for the removal of tcs by both processes while for 2 6 dcp and bpa the best results were obtained using al pilcae and al pilcbe as catalytic supports finally a degradation pathway was suggested for every pollutant based on the by products identified during the reactions by hplc ms the results revealed that the materials used in this work are suitable catalysts for removing emerging pollutants from water by both fenton and photo fenton like reactions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photo fenton like reaction alumina pillared clay catalyst aluminum saline slag organic pollutant data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is essential for life and therefore the entry of potentially hazardous chemicals into the aquatic environment has always been a major environmental concern 1 the organic pollutants commonly detected in the environment includes both persistent organic pollutants pops 2 and emerging pollutants eps pops are considered persistent and extremely toxic whereas eps were initially dismissed as eventual pollutants and as a result have not been monitored or regulated and thus released into the environment given the lack of information regarding their harmful effects eps are all those compounds whose concentration in the environment has increased to the point of generating hazardous effects 3 among the list of eps are triclosan tcs 5 chloro 2 2 4 dichlorophenoxy phenol bisphenol a bpa 4 4 propane 2 2 diyl diphenol and 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp tcs is a broad spectrum antibacterial and preservative agent which was widely used in many household personal care pcp and consumer products 1 4 7 but has since been shown to have chronic toxicity and several health effects including endocrine disrupting and estrogenic effects 5 8 bpa a plasticizer with endocrine disrupting effects 3 9 and 2 6 dcp which together with tcs belongs to the chlorophenols cp family and is used as an intermediate in several industries and as a raw material for the synthesis of several pharmaceuticals pesticides and herbicides 2 6 dcp has been shown to be highly toxic and harmful to both human health and the environment 10 several methods have been studied to remove organic pollutants from water and some conventional methods have exhibited disadvantages including slow and or incomplete degradation of the pollutants 11 12 advanced oxidation processes aops have been used and have shown to be an effective alternative for the removal of several toxic resistant and stable organic compounds due to their essentially complete lack of selectivity and excellent destructive power 13 14 aops are based on the production and use of hydroxyl radicals oh for oxidation of the target compound 11 however the efficiency of the degradation and mineralization can differ between the different aops used these results in the presence of several secondary products formed during the oxidation process in the final solution 11 13 this means that identification of the by products formed is essential to ensure that under the reaction conditions used this conversion does not generate other hazardous compounds for example the chemical structure of tcs is similar to highly toxic and persistent pollutants such as dioxins 1 thus meaning that the formation of dioxins as intermediates during its degradation is possible in fact although some studies have reported the effective removal of tcs by photodegradation 7 15 others have identified hazardous by products such as 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 8 dichlorodibenzo p dioxin 2 8 dcdd and 4 5 dichloro 2 2 dihydroxybiphenyl oh 2pcb 13 among others 6 8 12 15 16 these substances have been reported in photocatalytic processes using both solar and uv radiation as well as in biodegradation studies 2 8 dcdd for example can be converted into higher chlorinated dioxins which are considered more toxic this conversion can occur under certain conditions such as chlorination 6 this is particularly important given that both uv and chlorine dioxide clo2 are used in water treatment systems worldwide 16 the use of various aops such as fenton and photo fenton oxidation have been reported for the successful degradation of several organic pollutants 7 11 17 18 in the fenton process the ferrous iron is combined with hydrogen peroxide fe2 h2o2 at acidic conditions to generate the hydroxyl radicals oh 19 which degrade the target organic compounds into small organic molecules which are finally mineralized into co2 and h2o 14 20 fenton fe2 h2o2 and fenton like reactions fe3 h2o2 as well as photo fenton that use a combination of h2o2 fe ii iii and light irradiation uv have been successfully used to oxidize a wide list of organic pollutants including chlorinated compounds such as chlorobenzenes chlorophenols and chlorinated pesticides among others 8 11 14 17 21 the use of solid catalysts in fenton like processes to generate the strong oxidants and degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants is also a promising alternative several solids have been studied for this purpose including iron oxide minerals silicas zeolites clays and pillared clays among others 22 the considerable importance of clays as a semiconductor support material lies in their characteristics including their layered morphology chemical stability and cation exchange ability as well as their economic advantages and availability 23 one example of such clays is montmorillonite mt which belongs to the smectite group and is one of the most widely studied and reported in the literature the use of modified smectites in environmental protection has also been widely documented in the literature 2 24 25 one of these modification methods consists in introducing pillars between the layers by replacing the exchangeable cations in the clay with rigid metal oxide clusters thus converting the clays into pillared clays which have a larger basal spacing and pore volume 26 pillared clays have also been successfully studied as catalysts and catalytic supports for several chemical reactions 27 31 one of the modifications made to catalytic supports for use in catalysis involves the incorporation or deposition of metal and non metal ions tio2 and fe3 have been widely used for this purpose due to their characteristics and advantages 13 including the low cost photostability non toxicity high chemical stability and catalytic performance 32 however most of the studies on the use of pilc in catalysis involve ti pilc and fe pilc rather than nanocomposites in which the metal is deposited on the pilc using another pilc such as al pilc several researchers have used tio2 clays and ti pilc as photocatalysts for the photodegradation of organic pollutants under both uv or vis light irradiation in an aqueous suspension the use of sunlight has also been reported since this has aroused great interest for the removal of organic pollutants dyes are most widely studied pollutants for catalytic photodegradation being other organic compounds including herbicides analgesics antibiotics and endocrine disruptors have be also considered various authors have attempted to modify both tio2 clays and ti pilc to improve their photocatalytic efficiency under vis light or sunlight indeed several strategies such as the use of metal complex ions or photosensitizing dyes have been applied to photosensitize tio2 clays and ti pilc moreover modification of the parameters for the deposition methods is also needed in this case to obtain better nanoparticles and improve their photocatalytic performance it must always be remembered that pilcs are microporous materials dp 2 0 nm and that organic molecules that degrade should be able to diffuse into their porous structure therefore there is a steric diffusional limitation in this case in order to broaden the spectrum to other larger pollutant molecules it would be necessary to increase the structure of the adsorbents synthesized such as heterostructures or mof based on clays considering the above it is vital to explore new alternatives and study new possible catalysts for removing eps from water aluminum pillared clays al pilc are commonly obtained from commercial chemicals however previous studies have shown that those solids synthesized using the remaining aluminum extracted from a hazardous industrial waste saline slag are good adsorbents and catalysts for removing eps from water 32 33 repurposing industrial waste to reduce the environmental pollution aligns with the principles of a circular economy in this case by both turning the hazardous waste into a non hazardous material and by using it to remove pollutants from water 34 the use of al pilc as catalysts was studied using tio2 al pilc to photodegrade the eps due to the lack of information about the use of al pilc in general as catalytic supports in fenton and photo fenton processes for the removal of eps this work focuses for the first time on the synthesis of both fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts by deposition of the metals on the catalytic support using pillared clays synthesized previously from the aforementioned aluminum saline slags the catalysts obtained were evaluated for the removal of tcs bpa and 2 6 dcp from water by way of fenton and photo fenton reactions in a single component and an equimolar mixture of the three compounds the by products formed during the reaction were identified by hplc ms thus allowing us to propose a probable pathway for the degradation of each of these three pollutants 2 experimental procedure 2 1 materials and reagents four catalytic supports with different structural properties 33 were studied in this work namely three alumina pillared clays al pilc and a montmorillonite mt supplied by tsukinuno the clay science society of japan which was the mineral clay used as raw material in the synthesis of all three al pilc the difference between the three al pilc was the aluminum source in the intercalation solution used in their synthesis thus one of them al pilccm was prepared using the conventional aluminum source an aluminum salt in the intercalation solution whereas the other two were synthesized using the aluminum extracted from a hazardous waste produced in the secondary aluminum production process known as saline slags in this case the difference was that one of them used the alkaline extract al pilcbe and the other the acid one al pilcae the chemical composition by frx of the saline slags is na2o 8 65 wt mgo 2 76 wt al2o3 41 71 wt sio2 4 23 wt p2o5 0 05 wt cl 11 83 wt k2o 4 40 wt cao 2 08 wt tio2 0 31 wt cr 0 04 wt mno 0 17 wt fe2o3 2 05 wt cu 0 35 wt f 0 41 wt zn 0 18 wt the three organic pollutants studied were 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp c6h4cl2o acros organics triclosan tcs c12h7cl3o2 ambeed and bisphenol a bpa c15h16o2 acros organics methanol chemsolve was used during the preparation of their aqueous solutions to enhance their solubility and hydrochloric acid 37 panreac applichem to adjust the solution ph titanium iv isopropoxide 97 sigma aldrich iron iii nitrate nonahydrate panreac applichem hcl 37 panreac applichem and isopropyl alcohol 99 sigma aldrich were used during impregnation of the catalytic supports hplc grade acetonitrile acn j t baker and formic acid sigma aldrich were used for the high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis to quantify the three pollutants in the experiments and to identify their by products hydrogen peroxide h2o2 chempur was used in both fenton like and photo fenton like experiments 2 2 synthesis of the catalysts the catalytic supports used in this work were montmorillonite mt supplied by tsukinuno the clay science society of japan and three aluminum pillared clays al pilccm al pilcbe and al pilcae synthesized using the mt as the raw clay al pilccm was synthesized using the conventional method using commercial aluminum chloride alcl3 6h2o and naoh in a hydrolysis reaction oh al3 of 2 0 for the preparation of the intercalation solution al pilcbe and al pilcae were synthesized using the aluminum extracted from the saline slag by the alkaline or acid extraction method respectively the synthesis and characterization of the three al pilc is explained in a previous work 33 the mentioned work evaluated the parameters to prepare the intercalating solution that allows the synthesis of al pilc with the highest textural properties using aluminum extracts the parameters used for the preparation of the intercalating solution differ for the aluminum extracts alkaline and acid the oh al3 molar ratio was 2 0 for both however the al clay mmol g ratio was 20 0 alkaline and 7 0 acid and the clay volume solution ratio was 8 0 alkaline and 6 0 acid in the case of the alkaline extract the pillaring solution was prepared at room temperature 24 c and the acidic extract at high temperature 90 c the ph of the pillaring solutions was around 3 9 4 2 both titration and aging time was 1 h and the intercalation time was 22 h at room temperature at the end of the intercalation process the intercalated clays were separated from the solution by centrifugation hettich rotanta 460 s and washed several times with distilled water then they were dried 100 c for 8 h and subsequently calcinated 500 c for 4 h 1 c min in an oven nabertherm l5 s27 to produce the al pilc all four catalytic supports studied al pilccm al pilcbe al pilcae and mt were dried at 150 c for 12 h modification of these supports was carried out by first including the titanium to obtain tio2 mt and tio2 al pilc and then the iron to obtain fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc both these modifications iron and titanium were carried out using a well known method namely impregnation through stirring followed by calcination 35 the appropriate amount of the respective impregnating agent was calculated by taking into account the desired percentage of each in the catalyst in the light of preliminary results all four catalytic supports were modified using two mass percentages of ti 10 and 20 wt mt doped at both titanium mass percentages 10 and 20 wt was impregnated with four loadings of iron 1 5 10 and 20 wt and evaluated as catalytic support in the fenton like reaction in view of the results obtained all three al pilc studied in this work at both titanium mass percentages 10 and 20 wt were impregnated with iron only at the highest iron mass percentage 20 wt both values used in the impregnation steps agree with values previously used by other authors 36 37 in a few cases especially for the lower metal content the desired metal loading was added in a single step however in others especially for the higher metal contents successive impregnations were required because the volume of the solutions needed was higher than the water pore volume of the catalytic supports between these impregnation steps the loaded catalytic supports were dried at 100 c for 3 h to remove the solvent at the end of the impregnation procedure once the desired amount had been impregnated into the catalytic supports they were dried at 100 c for 8 h and 150 c for 12 h finally the dried solids were calcined at 500 c for 4 h 1 c min 2 3 characterization techniques the textural properties of the catalysts studied in this work were analyzed using n2 praxair 99 999 adsorption experiments at 196 c using a gas sorption analyzer micromeritics model asap 2020 plus samples 0 2 g were degassed prior to the analysis 200 c for 12 h at a pressure lower than 0 1 pa the total pore volume vtotal was calculated using the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0 98 and the specific surface area sbet of the catalysts in the relative pressure range from 0 05 to 0 2 was estimated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method the catalysts were characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd using a bruker d 8 advance eco x ray diffractometer ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 0 1548 nm was used operating in the range from 8 to 70 2θ at a scan rate of 0 2 2θ min finally the morphology and the chemical composition of the catalysts were determined by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectrometry inspect f50 at 10 kv and transmission electron microscopy tem using a tecnai t30 transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv 2 4 fenton and photo fenton like reactions aqueous solutions of each pollutant 90 μmol dm3 were prepared and their ph was adjusted to 3 5 using hcl aq this ph value was chosen as is it well known that both fenton and fenton like reactions are more effective under acidic conditions 13 38 39 the solution of the respective pollutant 15 cm3 at that ph value was mixed in a round bottom glass reactor with the respective catalyst 15 mg and magnetically stirred continuously in the dark 700 rpm for 15 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium between the pollutants and the catalyst surface at this point the respective fenton or photo fenton catalytic test was started adding the oxidant h2o2 at a molar ratio of 1 10 with respect to the pollutant the molar ratio of h2o2 was calculated using the theoretical stoichiometric amount required for complete oxidation of the three pollutants this value was chosen based on the results obtained in preliminary experiments in the case of photo fenton experiments the reaction was carried out in a uv reactor equipped with 20 monochrome hg lamps power 160 w with a continuous uv a radiation spectrum with mean peaks at 350 nm in photo fenton experiments once the h2o2 had been added the uv source was turned on to allow the reaction to occur under exposure to uv radiation once the fenton or photo fenton reaction had started aliquots were taken from the suspension at established time intervals these aliquots were centrifuged at 6000 rpm ifuge m08 microcentrifuge from neuation and filtered hydrophilic ptfe diameter 1 3 cm pore diameter 0 22 μm to ensure complete removal of the catalyst the conversion efficiency was determined by hplc ms measuring the amount of pollutant eliminated from the solution after those given periods of time all experiments were repeated once in addition to the single component solutions an equimolar aqueous solution of the three pollutants at 90 μmol pollutant dm3 was prepared to study the fenton and photo fenton catalytic degradation of this mixture the ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 using hcl aq and the fenton and photo fenton procedures were carried out as described for the single component solutions the percentage of pollutant adsorbed the percentage of pollutant converted and the percentage of pollutant removed were determined by calculating the difference between the initial and remaining concentrations using eqs 1 3 1 pollutant adsorbed c 0 c t 1 c 0 100 2 pollutant converted c t 1 c t 2 c t 1 100 3 pollutant removed c 0 c t 2 c 0 100 where c 0 μmol dm3 c t1 μmol dm3 and c t2 μmol dm3 correspond to the initial concentration of the organic compound at the beginning of the experiment 90 μmol dm3 the concentration of organic compound at 15 min when the dark adsorption period finished and the fenton and photo fenton experiments started and finally the concentration of the organic pollutant at the respective sampling time which for calculation of the final value was the concentration of pollutant in the final sampling at the end of the experiment the kinetics for oxidation of the organic pollutants by both fenton and photo fenton processes can be represented as follows 4 d c p dt k p c p c oh where c p and c oh are the concentrations μmol dm3 of pollutant and hydroxyl radical and k p is the rate constant for the reaction under certain reaction conditions the concentration of hydroxyl radical is constant 40 thus leading to the following reduced pseudo first order equation 5 d c p dt k 1 c p where k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant when t 0 c p is equal to c p0 then 6 ln c p c p 0 k 1 t the pseudo first order rate constant is obtained from the slope calculated using the linear least squares fit for the logarithmic plot of the data the pseudo second order model was also studied using the following equations 7 d c p dt k 2 c p 2 8 t c t 1 k 2 c e 2 t c e where k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant and c t and c e the concentration of the pollutant μmol dm3 at time t and equilibrium respectively to choose the model that best fits the experimental data a comparison of both the adjusted r squared r2 and the residual sum of squares rss was taken into account 41 the rss compares the experimental and calculated value according to the kinetic model smaller rss values indicate a similarity between the experimental and calculated data while higher values suggest that the model poorly explains the experimental data to evaluate the experimental results obtained in this work we used a hypothesis test at 5 significance level the f test for comparison of variances and analysis of conglomerates using statgraphics centurion and originpro version 9 2 5 by product identification the by products obtained in the fenton and photo fenton catalytic degradation of all three pollutants were identified by mass spectrometry an uhplc ultimate 3000 dionex coupled to an uv detector and an electrospray ionization esi mass spectrometer amazon sl bruker daltonics operating in negative mode and a c18 column halo 2 1 150 mm 4 6 μm particle size were used for this purpose a mixture of acn water 0 25 formic acid with a volume ratio of 60 40 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0 5 cm3 min each sample 10 μl was analyzed in full scan mode range of 50 to 600 m z at a scan speed of 0 20 scans s the experiments to identify the by products in both fenton and photo fenton reactions were carried out by replicating the experiments with the catalyst that took longer for the conversions to ensure identification of the maximum possible number of by products during the experiment the aliquots analyzed during the reaction were sampled at the same sampling times as in the previous experiments all samples were diluted 1 10 before analysis in the hplc ms system finally the by products formed by all three target organic pollutants were tentatively identified by comparing the molecular ion and respective mass fragmentation pattern with those found in the literature with the aid of the nist mass spectral library 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalysts analysis of all the catalysts synthesized was repeated once using xrd and n2 adsorption techniques in order to gain a better understanding of their homogeneity and to study them by statistical analysis the xrd patterns of the mt and al pilc used as supports are presented in fig s1 the xrd results of the catalysts synthesized confirmed the presence of both tio2 anatase phase and fe2o3 in the solids as a result of the identification of their characteristic peaks as shown in fig 1 the debye scherer equation eq 9 42 was used to calculate the crystallite size of both tio2 and fe2o3 particles in all samples fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc from the xrd patterns this was performed using the most intense diffraction peak 101 of the anatase phase found at 25 31 and the average of the two most intense peaks 104 and 110 for fe2o3 found at 33 33 and 35 79 9 d kλ β cosθ where d is crystal size nm k is the crystallite shape factor 0 89 and λ the x ray wavelength β is the width at half maximum fwhm of the respective peak and θ is the bragg angle the xrd patterns of the catalysts are summarized in figs 1 and 2 fig 1 shows the xrd pattern for mt tio2 mt 10 and 20 wt ti and fe2o3 tio2 mt 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe in both cases fig 2 presents the xrd pattern of the three tio2 al pilc 10 and 20 wt ti and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe in both cases the estimated value of the crystallite size for tio2 anatase in all samples including mt and al pilc ranged from 18 52 1 75 to 25 81 0 22 nm which is in agreement with the values reported previously 35 36 43 all mt samples at both titanium contents 10 and 20 wt impregnated with various iron loadings showed an increase in the fe2o3 crystal size as the amount of iron used in the impregnation step increased ranging from 16 05 0 72 mt 10 wt ti and 1 wt fe to 39 92 7 70 nm mt 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe the anova of the crystal size values showed that there is only a statistically significant difference between the catalysts at 20 ti impregnated with various iron loadings p 0 05 95 confidence the results revealed that the titanium content has a statistically significant effect on the crystal size p 0 05 in the case of al pilc at both 10 and 20 wt titanium impregnated with 20 iron the crystal sizes ranged from 24 24 0 40 al pilcbe 10 wt ti and 20 wt fe to 42 88 1 99 nm al pilccm 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe the statistical analysis of the data revealed that there is no statistically significant difference between the crystal sizes of the three al pilc p 0 05 95 confidence the crystal sizes calculated in this work are in agreement with the values reported by other authors 43 45 the textural characteristics of the supports are shown in fig s1 and the textural characteristics of the catalysts are summarized in table 1 and figs 3 and 4 table 1 lists the calculated specific surface areas sbet average pore diameters dp and total pore volumes vtotal and fig 3 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for tio2 mt at 10 and 20 wt ti and fe2o3 tio2 mt at 10 and 20 wt ti with various iron contents 1 20 wt fig 4 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the different fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc synthesized at both titanium concentrations 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe the adsorption isotherms obtained which are considered to be type ii according to the iupac classification 46 are characteristic of pilc the hysteresis loops of the isotherms exhibit a broad pore size distribution 36 in the case of the catalysts synthesized using mt as the catalytic support statistical analysis of the sbet data showed that there is only a significant difference for those at 20 wt ti with various iron contents 1 20 fe p 0 05 95 confidence the multifactorial analysis of the sbet data for all catalysts in table 1 showed that both factors titanium and iron content have a statistically significant effect p 0 05 95 confidence only for those catalysts synthesized using al pilc as catalytic support for fe2o3 tio2 mt only the titanium content has a significant effect on sbet value 95 confidence these results highlight both the relationship between the crystallite size and the sbet area of the catalysts and the relevance of the iron titanium ratio used in their synthesis the morphology of all the catalysts studied in this work was evaluated by sem and tem the micrographs are presented in fig 5 sem and fig 6 tem these micrographs figs 5 a and 6 a show the surface morphology of all the catalytic supports used clearly highlighting the differences between the mineral clay and the pillared clays used mt has a fluffy and smooth appearance with irregular flakes while al pilc shows a uniform morphology the sem and tem images in figs 5 and 6 show the different catalysts at 20 wt ti with 0 wt fe b and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe c a comparison of those micrographs also reveals the significant change in the structure of the supports upon incorporation of tio2 and fe2o3 into the structure figs 5 c and 6 c 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe show disordered and exfoliated structures the morphological features observed in the sem and tem images suggest formation of the particles on the external surface of the catalytic supports in agreement with other authors 36 the micrographs of the fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts synthesized under the conditions of this study demonstrate the formation of nanostructures with an average particle size of 50 nm which is in agreement with the xrd results and with other authors who have synthesized tio2 fe2o3 nanoparticles 47 fig 7 a shows a tem micrograph for al pilcbe at 10 wt ti and 20 wt fe the lattice fringes of tio2 pink and yellow and fe2o3 green and blue correspond to the 101 103 012 and 104 planes with a fringe distance of 0 35 0 24 0 37 and 0 27 nm respectively fig 7 b presents the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern for the fe2o3 tio2 al pilcbe catalyst which corroborates the xrd findings regarding the presence of tio2 and fe2o3 in the catalysts synthesized the crystallographic planes 101 103 and 107 correspond to tio2 while the crystallographic planes 110 and 116 and 214 correspond to fe2o3 for all catalysts the size of the particles calculated from the tem images is in agreement with the xrd results fig 7 d shows the particle size distribution curve calculated for al pilcbe with 10 wt ti and 20 wt fe and also the uniform distribution of the particles with an average diameter of 21 nm finally as mentioned in the experimental procedure edx was used to monitor the average elemental composition of the nanocomposites synthesized and confirm the purity of the catalysts fig s2 shows the elemental mapping analysis of the catalysts at 20 ti and 20 fe the edx results confirmed the presence of both tio2 and fe2o3 in all catalysts synthesized and as can be seen in table s1 they did not contain impurities these values also show that both contents tio2 and fe2o3 were successfully controlled during the synthesis given the similarity between the experimental content and the theoretical value used during impregnation the relative error of the impregnations ranged from 0 4 to 12 0 and was lower for impregnation with titanium 0 4 7 8 than for impregnation with iron 7 1 12 0 the highest relative error for the titanium and iron impregnations was found for the synthesis of fe2o3 tio2 al pilcbe 3 2 fenton and photo fenton like reactions in the single component experiments the experimental times fenton and photo fenton were selected on the basis of the time required to remove the maximum quantity of the respective pollutant from the solution in all cases in the fenton experiments for tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa these times were 240 420 and 540 min respectively the times required for the photo fenton experiments were 30 min for tcs and 90 120 min for 2 6 dcp and bpa the duration of the equimolar mixture experiments was established on the basis of the time required to remove the slowest degraded pollutant in the single component experiments the percentage of tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa removed by the catalysts in the single component experiments after 240 tcs 420 2 6 dcp and 540 bpa minutes of fenton like reaction and after 30 min of photo fenton like reaction are summarized in figs 8 9 and 10 respectively as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 almost complete removal 100 of tcs and 2 6 dcp was achieved in the case of tcs this was possible in both the fenton and photo fenton processes irrespective of the four catalytic supports evaluated for 2 6 dcp and bpa however better results were obtained when using al pilcae and al pilcbe as the catalytic supports the three were at the highest loading of both titanium and iron the maximum bpa removed in the fenton like reaction was 42 24 as the figures reveal a reaction time of 30 min was insufficient to achieve the complete removal of 2 6 dcp and bpa in the photo fenton like reaction finally for all three pollutants the percentage removed was lower in the equimolar mixture component solutions than in the single component experiments with values up to 1 77 16 82 and 1 33 times smaller for tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa respectively the percentages of the three pollutants removed under both fenton and photo fenton like conditions were higher in both single and mixed component systems for the catalysts containing 20 wt titanium than for those containing 10 wt titanium additionally in both fenton and photo fenton experiments the percentages of the three pollutants removed increased as the iron content wt increased see figs 8 10 table s2 shows the percentages of all three pollutants removed in both single and mixed component solutions under both fenton and photo fenton conditions using the catalysts synthesized with 10 wt ti and 20 wt ti and the highest iron load 20 wt in both cases the reaction times required to achieve these values were 240 tcs 420 2 6 dcp and 540 min bpa for the fenton reaction and 30 min for all three pollutants in the photo fenton reaction table 2 shows the percentages obtained at the highest iron concentration which are those that gave the highest conversion for the complete removal of 2 6 dcp in the photo fenton process a reaction time of at least 90 min was required for the three al pilcs and 120 min for the mt while a time of at least 120 min was needed to reach the highest removal of bpa 70 25 80 14 in the photo fenton process the time required to remove the pollutants in the photo fenton like reaction was less than that required for the fenton like reaction a comparison of the amounts removed at the same sampling times revealed higher values for the photo fenton reaction than for the fenton reaction at every sampling time with the highest values being achieved when the catalysts used contained 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe this higher degradation rate for the photo fenton like process indicates the successful narrowing of the bandgap this is possible due to both the well formed anatase phase as confirmed by xrd and the presence of fe3 in the tio2 conduction layer which allows the excited electrons to react with the fe3 ions thereby preventing or reducing electron hole recombination 13 48 the improvement in the catalytic performance of the catalysts as the iron load increased could also be due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies by the iron which results in the formation of surface hydroxyl groups as explained by other authors 13 these results clearly show the positive synergistic effect of the uv tio2 fe2o3 h2o2 system in the oxidative degradation of the pollutants studied herein this synergistic acceleration in the oxidative degradation process agrees with results reported by other authors 49 statistical analysis of all data for every pollutant was carried out by performing a multi factor analysis of variance involving five factors iron and titanium content in the catalyst used catalytic support system single compound or mixture of the three pollutants and uv presence or absence the results revealed that all five factors have a statistically significant effect on the total removal of 2 6 dcp p 0 05 but only four of them iron and titanium content catalytic support and system on the total removal of tcs and three iron and titanium content and uv on the total removal of bpa p 0 05 with 95 confidence in all three cases the factor which contributed most to the variance of the total removal was uv which contributes 94 35 2 6 dcp 50 45 tcs and 73 02 bpa followed by the iron content in the case of 2 6 dcp 5 29 and bpa 26 63 and system in the case of tcs 43 59 these findings corroborate the improvement in the degradation efficiency due to the use of uv radiation a statistical analysis was also carried out focusing on the catalytic supports for mt the uv factor contributed most to the variance in the total removal of all three pollutants 84 18 for 2 6 dcp 45 34 for tcs and 99 71 for bpa in the case of the three al pilc the data showed that the total removal behavior differs between the three pollutants studied thus for the removal of bpa three factors namely iron and titanium content and uv have a significant effect with iron content accounting for 62 82 al pilcbe 68 57 al pilccm and 62 16 al pilcae contributing most to this variance for the removal of 2 6 dcp two factors namely system and uv have a statistically significant effect and the factor which contributed most to the variance was uv accounting for 99 61 al pilcbe 93 73 al pilccm and 78 82 al pilcae finally for tcs removal three factors namely titanium content system and uv al pilcbe al pilccm and iron content system and uv al pilcae have a significant effect in this case the factor which contributed most to the variance for al pilcbe and al pilcae was uv accounting for 76 82 al pilcbe and 53 91 al pilccm followed by system 22 14 for al pilcbe and 45 94 for al pilcae while for al pilccm the factor which contributed most to the variance in the total removal of tcs was system 56 24 followed by uv 43 53 the conversion data for all three pollutants were analyzed statistically by way of a multi factor analysis for tcs and 2 6 dcp two factors namely titanium content and uv presence or absence have a statistically significant effect on the conversion of tcs p 0 05 with 95 confidence for bpa three factors namely iron and titanium content and uv presence or absence have a statistically significant effect on the conversion for all three pollutants uv was the factor that contributed most to the variance in pollutant conversion accounting for 98 83 tcs 89 45 2 6 dcp and 77 86 bpa a comparison of both pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic plots for tcs in the fenton process can be found in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows the plots for fe2o3 tio2 mt at both 10 and 20 wt ti with the iron loadings tested in this work 1 20 wt and fig 12 the catalysts at 10 and 20 wt ti with 20 wt fe the kinetic parameters for all three pollutants can be found in table 3 for both the fenton without uv radiation and photo fenton with uv radiation reactions this table gives the parameters obtained from the curve fitting for both models pseudo first and pseudo second order reactions tables s3 s5 give the kinetic parameters for all catalysts used in this work for the three pollutants studied the higher regression values 0 890 0 997 for tcs 0 935 0 999 for 2 6 dcp and 0 946 0 998 for bpa and the lower residual sum of squares rss values 0 001 1 811 for tcs 1 21 10 4 0 371 for 2 6 dcp and 2 59 10 5 0 007 for bpa obtained using the pseudo first order kinetic equation show that this kinetic best fits the experimental data for conversion of all the pollutants in both the fenton and photo fenton processes the half life τ 1 2 values were calculated using eq 10 in which k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 10 τ 1 2 0 693 k 1 table s6 gives the calculated half life τ 1 2 values for the fenton and photo fenton processes the results confirmed that the photo fenton like process is more efficient for degrading all three pollutants as was mentioned in the experimental section the fenton and photo fenton catalytic degradation experiments started after 15 min of adsorption in the dark in the presence of the corresponding catalyst the adsorption results for the catalysts showed that the amount of the three pollutants adsorbed in both single and mixed component systems was higher for the catalysts impregnated with 20 titanium than for those impregnated with 10 ti additionally in both cases 10 and 20 ti the amount adsorbed increased as the iron content increased for all catalysts used a statistical analysis of the adsorption data was conducted for each pollutant involving four factors namely catalytic support used iron and titanium content in the catalyst and system single compound or mixture of the three pollutants the results revealed that all four factors have a statistically significant effect on adsorption for all three pollutants p 0 05 with 95 confidence however the factor that contributed most to the variance of the adsorption differed for the three pollutants thus for 2 6 dcp it was the system single or mixed component which contributed 55 29 to the variance in adsorption while for bpa this factor was the iron content 71 51 and for tcs the catalytic support used 33 64 a statistical analysis of the adsorption data for the catalytic supports used was conducted for each of the three pollutants including three factors namely iron and titanium content and system single compound or mixture of the three pollutants the results showed that all three factors have a statistically significant effect on the adsorption of all three pollutants for mt p 0 05 while these three factors have a statistically significant effect on the adsorption of 2 6 dcp and tc for all three al pilc in the case of bpa adsorption on al pilc two factors namely iron and titanium content have a significant effect in the case of bpa and tcs iron content was the factor that contributed most to the variance of adsorption on the three pilc and two pilc respectively thus the iron content contributed 85 84 al pilcbe 72 62 al pilccm and 99 01 al pilcae to the variance in bpa adsorption and 32 23 al pilcbe and 40 99 al pilccm to the variance in tcs adsorption in the case of al pilcae the factor that contributed most to the variance in tcs adsorption was system single compound or mixture accounting for 68 05 of the variance finally system also was the factor that contributed most to the variance of 2 6 dcp adsorption accounting for 55 68 al pilcbe 83 48 al pilccm and 69 87 al pilcae these results reveal that adsorption of the pollutants plays an important role in the total removal of tcs which was the most adsorbed pollutant 5 44 54 55 2 6 dcp 0 29 15 4 and bpa 0 01 11 58 the successful use of tio2 clay hybrids as adsorbents for the removal of pollutants has been reported previously 36 finally with the aim of clarifying the similarities and differences between the changes in adsorption conversion and total removal in both reactions fenton and photo fenton like by the catalysts that showed the best results 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe a hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out using the nearest neighbor method the results are presented in fig 13 for bpa a and d 2 6 dcp b and e and tcs c f in both fenton like a c and photo fenton like d f reactions the cluster in fig 13 a for example shows how for bpa adsorption and conversion by the catalyst 20 wt ti and 20 wt fe synthesized using al pilcbe as catalytic support are very similar to those obtained using al pilccm it also reveals that in this case somewhat different values were obtained for the catalyst synthesized using mt as catalytic support the clusters in fig 13 show how the similarities and differences between the catalysts in the fenton like reaction a only differ from those observed in the photo fenton like process d for bpa in the case of tcs fig 13 c and f the catalysts synthesized using al pilc as catalytic support behaved in a very similar manner differing values were obtained for the catalyst synthesized using mt as catalytic support for both tcs fig 13 c and f and bpa fig 13 a and d while for 2 6 dcp this was the case for al pilcbe fig 13 b and e these results illustrate the relationship between pollutant and catalyst and the difference in the removal behavior of the catalysts depending on their catalytic support the differences between those catalysts synthesized using the three al pilc corroborate their morphological and compositional differences thereby highlighting the importance of the aluminum source used in their synthesis and how this affects their possible use in environmental remediation 3 3 by product identification in studies related to the removal of organic compounds from water by degradation is crucial to know both the remaining concentration of the target pollutant and the composition of the sample at the end of the process identification of the molecules in the final sample is important because on occasions the by products obtained upon pollutant degradation can be even more toxic and persistent than their parent compounds 1 4 11 50 this information is also relevant to understand how the target pollutant is degraded and explain the degradation pathway the aim of the current study was not to elucidate the reactions that occur in the degradation pathway of all three organic pollutants studied nor to quantify the by products resulting from the reaction instead the by products formed by all three target organic pollutants were tentatively identified at different stages of the reaction and the degradation pathway was proposed by considering both the by products identified at the different reaction times analyzed and the different pathways proposed by other authors bearing in mind the principles of organic chemistry for the three organic pollutants analyzed herein we found the same by products when using both fenton and photo fenton reactions in the case of tcs nine products were found during the reaction 4 chlorocatehol 4 cc 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 chloro 5 4 chloro 2 hydroxyphenoxy benzene 1 4 diol hpbd 2 chloro 5 2 4 dichloro 5 hydroxyphenoxy cyclohexa 2 5 diene 1 4 dione hpcd 4 6 dichloro 1 2 benzenediol 4 6 dc 1 2 bd and 4 6 dichlororesorcinol 4 6 dcr monochlorophenol mcp chlorohydroquinone chq and p hydroquinone of triclosan p ht fig s3 shows the extracted ion chromatograms xic for the main by products identified and table s7 the proposed structures of these by products the results obtained are in accordance with those published by other authors who identified the following compounds as by products of the oxidation of tcs p ht 8 51 2 4 dcp 8 14 16 51 56 4 cc 8 14 52 57 4 6 dc 1 2 bd 8 4 6 dcr 8 hpcd 7 of these by products 2 4 dcp and 4 cc have also been reported as photo products of tcs 1 6 12 15 16 52 58 61 as mentioned previously the aim of this work was not to quantify the by products during the reaction but to elucidate the changes in their concentration during it as such 2 4 dcp was identified among the peaks in the hplc chromatogram using a commercial reagent sigma aldrich fig s4 shows the region for 2 4 dcp in the hplc chromatogram at different sampling times ranging from 15 to 240 min this figure reveals that the signal corresponding to 2 4 dcp changes during the experiment increasing in intensity as the reaction proceeds the probable pathway for the degradation of tcs in this work was proposed based on the different molecules tentatively identified and the oxidation pathways proposed by other authors such as wang et al 7 apell et al 15 peng et al 14 hossein et al 12 and munoz et al 8 see fig 14 the structure of tcs has two positions for hydroxyl radical attack as a result of the oh group which has a directing nature thus if the radical attacks in the para position a hydroxylation occurs and p ht is formed whereas if the radical attacks in the ortho position an ether bond cleavage occurs thereby opening one of the aromatic rings and forming 2 4 dcp and or 4 cc the latter can also be formed from 2 4 dcp upon hydroxylation and dechlorination given the compounds identified it is likely that 2 4 dcp undergoes three different degradation reactions dechlorination hydroxylation or hydroxylation plus dechlorination monochlorophenol mcp is formed by dechlorination 4 6 dcr and 4 6 dc 1 2 bd by hydroxylation after attack of the hydroxyl radical at the meta or ortho position respectively and 4 cc and chq by hydroxylation and dechlorination due to substitution of the chlorine atom at the ortho or para position hpcd which was also identified among the products can be formed from tcs or p ht by hydroxylation followed by dehydrogenation in both cases finally p ht can be converted into hpbd by hydroxylation followed by dechlorination the presence of triclosan dimers has also been reported as a result of a polymerization reaction that can be favored by the high concentration of chlorophenols in the presence of uv light 58 in this work however no tcs dimers or any other polymerization products were found given the by products formed we propose that triclosan degradation under both our experimental conditions occurs as a result of ether bond cleavage hydroxylation dechlorination hydrodechlorination and dehydrogenation in the case of the degradation of 2 6 dcp eight by products were identified the main by products were 2 6 dichlorohydroquinone 2 6 dchq 2 6 dichloro p benzoquinone 2 6 dcbq 2 6 dihydroxycyclohexa 2 5 diene 1 4 dione 2 6 dhch 2 5 d 1 4 d 2 hydroxy p benzoquinone 2 hbq and p benzoquinone bq the extracted ion chromatograms xic of these by products are presented in fig s5 and their proposed structures in table s7 other compounds tentatively identified during the reaction were 1 2 3 5 tetrahydroxybenzene 1 2 3 5 thb 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene 1 2 4 thb chlorohydroquinone chq and a few short chain acids the results obtained agree with those reported by other authors such as dai et al 62 and norabadi et al 62 who also studied the oxidative degradation of 2 6 dcp given both the oxidation pathways published by these authors and the products identified in this work at the sampling times used a possible pathway for the degradation of 2 6 dcp was proposed this tentative pathway is shown in fig 15 if the oh radical attacks the benzene ring of 2 6 dcp in the para position a hydroxylation occurs and dchq is formed chq 2 6 dcbq and bq can then be formed by dechlorination dehydrogenation or dechlorination plus dehydrogenation of 2 6 dchq respectively chq and 2 6 dcbq can also be formed from 2 6 dcp by hydroxylation plus dechlorination or hydroxylation and dehydrogenation both hydroxylations occur in the para position the hydroxylation plus dechlorination of chq for substitution of the chlorine atom at the ortho position gives 1 2 4 thb which in turn has two possible degradation reactions pathways namely dehydrogenation or hydroxylation that form 2 hbq or 1 2 3 5 thb respectively 1 2 3 5 thb can also be obtained from 2 6 dcp by hydroxylation plus dechlorination of both chlorine atoms similarly 1 2 3 5 thb can be converted into 2 6 dhch 2 5 d 1 4 d by way of a dehydrogenation reaction finally analysis of the solutions obtained from the oxidation of bpa showed five by products during the reaction bpa o catechol bpa o c bisphenol o quinone bpa q 3 hydroxy 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl cyclohexa 3 5 diene 1 2 dione 3 h 4 2 hp 2 c 3 5 d 1 2 d 4 hydroxyacetophenone 4 hap 4 isopropenylphenol 4 ipp and hydroquinone hq these products have been reported by other authors bpa o c 63 69 bpa q 63 65 4 ipp 20 64 66 68 70 71 4 hap 20 63 64 66 68 70 3 h 4 2 hp 2 c 3 5 d 1 2 d 68 hq 20 66 68 70 fig s6 shows the extracted ion chromatograms xic of bpa and its by products and table s7 their proposed structures based on the products identified and the pathway put forward in the studies referenced above an alternative pathway for the degradation of bpa was proposed as shown in fig 16 in light of the products formed the oh radical attacks bpa mainly at two positions in the first one the hydroxyl radical attacks the benzene ring of bpa to give bpa o c by way of a radical addition bpa o c in turn forms bpa q by dehydrogenation in the second one the oh radical attacks the other vulnerable position of bpa namely the cc bond between the aromatic ring and the isopropyl group in the molecule thus resulting in cleavage of the phenyl groups of bpa and forming 4 ipp hq and 4 hap these three compounds can also be formed from bpa o c by cleavage of the phenyl groups the oxidation of tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa mainly occurs due to the attack of oh radicals hydroxyl radicals oh are vital in the fenton process as they are responsible for initiating sequential degradation of the organic pollutants upon reaction with them 71 in this process iron catalyzes the decomposition of h2o2 to form these hydroxyl radicals 20 the prevalent intermediates found in this work were hydroquinones and quinones which is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors who have reported those compounds as the predominant intermediates in the degradation of chlorophenols in general 72 73 formation of the different quinones identified as by products in this work was proposed as a result of the oxidation of hydroquinones and related compounds via a two step successive single electron transfer in agreement with the principles of organic chemistry 62 in all three cases the aromatic compounds formed are further oxidized in subsequent steps undergoing ring opening reactions that result in the formation of different aliphatic compounds such as alcohols and short chain acids a few such acids including maleic and oxalic acid were identified in the oxidation experiments for all three pollutants finally all the intermediate molecules were mineralized to co2 and h2o by way of decarboxylation and oxidation processes the compounds identified in the solutions remaining at the end of the experiments showed that the toxicity of tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa solutions was gradually reduced as a result of oxidation via both fenton and photo fenton processes 4 conclusions in this study montmorillonite mt and three alumina pillared montmorillonites al pilcae al pilcbe and al pilccm have been used as catalytic supports to synthesize fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts the success of the synthesis was evaluated using several techniques such as sem edx tem xrd and n2 adsorption experiments at 196 c the statistical analysis revealed the importance of the titanium iron ratio used in the synthesis tcs and 2 6 dcp were almost completely removed 100 by both fenton like 240 and 420 min and photo fenton like 30 and 90 min reactions using fe2o3 tio2 al pilc as catalysts the highest removal value for bpa was 80 14 1 93 by the photo fenton like reaction 120 min tcs showed good degradation results irrespective of the catalytic support evaluated whereas 2 6 dcp and bpa exhibited better results when using fe2o3 tio2 al pilcae and fe2o3 tio2 al pilcbe the highest removal values were achieved using the catalyst with the highest content of both titanium and iron 20 wt in all cases for all three pollutants the amount removed in the equimolar mixed component solutions was lower than in the single component experiments with values up to 1 77 tcs 16 82 2 6 dcp and 1 33 times smaller bpa results highlighted the importance of the catalytic support and corroborated the differences between the three al pilc thereby agreeing with their characterization this highlights the impact of the aluminum source used in their synthesis and how it may affect their possible use in environmental remediation analysis of the by products showed nine eight and five main by products for tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa respectively and the results obtained allowed us to put forward a possible degradation pathway for each pollutant in general our results indicate that the fe2o3 tio2 mt and fe2o3 tio2 al pilc catalysts used in this work are suitable for removing emerging contaminants such as tcs 2 6 dcp and bpa from water by way of both fenton like and photo fenton like reactions this work has allowed the evaluation of a material synthesized from a hazardous industrial waste as a catalyst the results have been better than those obtained when the catalyst obtained through commercial precursors is applied this behavior can be explained from a synergistic effect produced by the metals that are extracted in the recovery process therefore a possible path for the future is opened for the recovery of this type of waste

12514,despite the dominance of centralized water treatment systems in the past decades there is increased demand for instant water treatment in isolated areas i e decentralized water treatment moreover as wastewater contains multiple pollutants such as heavy metals anionic substances and organic matter research on their simultaneous removal is one of the most significant issues for practical application in this study we reported a novel all in one multi pollutants removal filter based on inverse opal io structures for decentralized water treatment this io based all in one filter consists of three adsorbents fe2o3 niox and s doped graphene for the simultaneous removal of heavy metals anionic substances and organic matter the filter was particularly designed to enhance the water flux of nano absorbents with high absorption capacity under a water flow system as a result the all in one multi pollutants removal filter exhibited excellent adsorption performance phenol 108 16 mg g zn 209 26 mg g and phosphate 202 54 mg g at ultrafast water flux 1167 l m2 h we successfully designed an efficient multi pollutants removal system considering the removal mechanisms suitable for different pollutants the correlation of pollutants and the water flow by io structure moreover our results demonstrated the simultaneous removal of multi pollutants from wastewater using a single unit purification system which would provide great significance to decentralized water purification systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords all in one filter inverse opal structure multi pollutants water purification fixed bed column data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the most significant global crises as it directly impacts humans and ecosystems 1 the wastewater from various sources has led to drastic deterioration of water quality leading to hazardous health consequences such as kidney failure cancer heart attack and brain disorders 2 5 over the last century centralized water treatment systems which involve the transportation of wastewater and treated water through a broad network of pumps and pipes have been the norm 6 however centralized water treatment systems demand high costs for constructing and maintaining the relevant infrastructure and transporting polluted and treated water over long distances moreover the unsecured quality of treated water due to a deteriorated water supply network and huge water treatment and transportation budget makes centralized water treatment systems inappropriate for isolated areas as a solution to these drawbacks decentralized water treatment systems with different types of technology have been studied worldwide 7 11 these decentralized treatment systems enable on site water treatment without any transport infrastructure lowering the cost of installation of sustaining infrastructure furthermore decentralization enhances infrastructure resiliency by quickly recovering the damaged or disrupted treatment system providing easy control of accidentally released contaminants and ensuring high quality water meets its intended use 7 8 in particular an on site water treatment system could contribute to ensuring a resilient and safe water supply in peri urban areas or isolated locations several efforts have been made to remove pollutants in three representation treatments such as biological chemical and physical treatment the biological treatments are suitable for biodegradable organic substances and usually economical 12 however this method has several disadvantages including the need for a large land area some chemical toxicity and a limit of organic substances that can be removed 13 on the other hand the chemical and physical treatment has been widely used due to its removal efficiency and various types of contaminants that can be removed and include various purification methods such as adsorption chemical precipitation disinfection photocatalytic process reverse osmosis ion exchange and membrane 12 14 22 of these methods adsorption is preferred as a potential method for water purification due to its low cost simplicity and potential for recycling real wastewaters are aqueous mixtures of diverse neutral and ionic pollutants such as heavy metals and organic compounds containing nitrogen and sulfur 2 23 25 however to date several pollutant removal studies have focused on removing a single component considering the realistic chemical compositions found in the wastewater matrices the technical efforts made so far to design the treatment system for a specific single target substrate are impractical hence studies focusing on the simultaneous removal of contaminants and multiple pollutants have recently gained much more attention 26 31 the functionalized cellulose was introduced for lead pb cadmium cd and nickel ni removal in multi pollutant systems demonstrating remarkable high adsorption capacities of 295 20 mg g pb 151 51 mg g cd and 72 80 mg g ni 26 cao et al observed the heavy metal adsorbing properties in co exists of different heavy metals e g pb cd copper cu ni and zinc zn using multi pore activated carbons and reported that their competitive adsorption was as follows cd pb ni cu zn 32 the la mgal nanocomposites for the simultaneous treatment of co existing phosphate and fluoride from water have also been investigated and high adsorption capacities of 101 59 mg g for phosphate and 51 03 mg g for fluoride were observed 33 however the strategies suggested previously aimed to eliminate similar categories of pollutant species including heavy metals inorganic anions and organic compounds so the technical challenges in treating natural wastewater containing pollutants that belong to diverse categories have yet to be addressed for more practical utilization afridi et al studied the phosphate removing properties of anodized iron oxide in a variety of simulated wastewaters having anions heavy metals and organic matter and confirmed the inhibitory effect of co existing contaminants on the removal efficiency 34 although the study reported the effect of co existing pollutants of different species further research on multi pollutants removal at once should be conducted removal mechanisms depend on the pollutant species so proper adsorbents should be designed and adapted to remove each pollutant for instance the adsorption process by electrostatic interaction of different charged pollutants e g heavy metals are positively charged and anionic substances are negatively charged needs oppositely charged adsorbents meanwhile most previously reported water treatment studies conducted batch experiments to test adsorption performance the quantitative information from batch experiments may not be readily adapted for designing practical water purification systems due to the discriminating differences between the water flow conditions minimal studies have evaluated adsorption performance under flow through conditions in multi pollutants systems 35 36 vu et al performed column flow through experiments in multi pollutants systems e g phosphate zinc and caffeine using multifunctional al mg go as an adsorbent which exhibited an adsorption capacity of phosphate 1 64 mg g zinc 0 56 mg g and caffeine 0 53 mg g 35 however to utilize in actual water treatment low adsorption capacity still remains a hurdle to overcome owing to the trade off between adsorption ability and water flux inverse opal io structures have been employed as water purification membranes due to their high porosity large surface area and good interconnectivity 37 40 zhang et al prepared tio2 io photonic crystal pc combined with nayf4 yb3 er3 nyf up conversion nanoparticles for use in catalytic membrane the nyf tio2 io showed enhanced photocatalytic activity high inactivation rate of 100 for bacteria under 11 h caused by highly ordered io structure 40 na et al employed the 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl tempo immobilized io for use in catalytic membrane 39 the tempo immobilized io exhibited outstanding performance of high conversion efficiency 97 maintaining a permeation flux higher than 300 l m2 h 1 bar in spite of the structural benefits of io structure their use in practical water purification system is still remained as challenges due to the difficulty in scalable process and controlling surface properties to adsorb specific pollutants also researches on the io water purification system for multi contaminants has not been conducted yet in this study we have designed an all in one water filtration unit using an inverse opal io structure for a fit for purpose water treatment system io based filters can encompass porous materials with a broad range of pore sizes morphological features and chemical compositions it is technically possible to fabricate multifunctional io integrating diverse inorganic nano adsorbents that result in the miniaturization of natural wastewater treatment plants the io based filter consists of three substances fe2o3 io niox io and sulfur doped graphene s g to remove heavy metals anionic substances and organic matters respectively the flow rate of water according to the pore size of io structure was analyzed and the water purification performance of the io based filter for multi pollutants was evaluated also an optimized io based all in one filter system was designed by comparing two different fixed bed continuous water flow systems to suggest a practical water purification system 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of materials 2 1 1 materials iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 99 urea ch4n2o 99 5 gelatin from bovine skin type b

by measuring the zeta potential otsuka elsz2000 zs 2 3 pollutant removal experiment to evaluate the performance of sequential water purification systems fixed bed column experiments were conducted as shown in fig 4 a first quartz columns 5 mm inner diameter were packed with an appropriate amount of the adsorbent materials and connected with membrane filters at both ends then the solution containing a known concentration of each pollutant was fed into the column using a peristaltic pump effluent from the column was sampled at regular time intervals and examined until saturation of adsorbent was observed the breakthrough curve was expressed as influent concentration ratios ct c0 as a function of time in which the shape of the breakthrough curve and the time for the appearance of the breakthrough were crucial for ascertaining the operation and dynamic response of the sorption column 47 48 the thomas and adams bohart models were used to fit the experimental data under various

components s g fe2o3 and niox ios which were designed to remove organic pollutants heavy metals and anionic substances from multi pollutants in wastewater respectively first porous s g was prepared fig s1 a and b to remove organic pollutants through π π electron donor acceptor eda interaction as the s g has π electrons perpendicular to the surface the primary adsorption mechanism was governed by π π eda interaction 53 55 following the s g layer the fe2o3 and niox io filters were sequentially fabricated as absorbents for cation and anion pollutants respectively notably the fe2o3 nanoparticles nps exhibited the amorphous phase with approximately 10 nm in size and a low isoelectric point iep of 4 1 as shown in figs s1 and s2 this low iep and strong negative zeta potential 33 mv at ph 6 5 strengthened the electrostatic attraction between the fe2o3 nps and positively charged cations in neutral ph leading to effective adsorption of cationic pollutants i e cationic organic materials and heavy metal ions conversely niox nps with a 10 nm size showed a high iep of 10 66 figs s1 and s2 suggesting effective removal ability for anionic pollutants the io based filters with high porosity and desired charged surface allowed a high water flux and efficient removal of pollutants at low energy consumption as a result this io based all in one filter can efficiently remove multiple pollutants with high throughput originating from unique io structures mesoporous and different removal mechanisms of the multi component mixtures in wastewater matrices 3 2 fabrication and characterizations of io based all in one filter to prepare the io structure as the component of an all in one filter polystyrene ps which could easily adjust the particle size and surface charge was firstly prepared as a template as schematically illustrated in fig 2 a fe2o3 and niox nanoparticles nps were first coated on the surface of ps colloidal particles by electrostatic interaction followed by self assembly of np coated ps colloidal particles ps nps next the assembled ps nps were dried entirely and the core ps particles were removed using heat treatment at 500 c higher than the pyrolysis temperature of ps 56 for the fabrication of fe2o3 io filter positively charged pss with 1 μm size were used as a template fig 2 b and c the positively charged ps was synthesized using 2 2 azobis 2 methylpropionamidine dihydrochloride to form copolymeric chains with positively charged ends 57 which can adsorb the negatively charged fe2o3 nps fig 2 d and e showed the fe sem images of the fe2o3 coated ps and fe2o3 io filter respectively the fe2o3 nps were uniformly coated on the ps surface and io structure with approximately 1 μm pore size was formed successfully after the removal of the core ps via heat treatment conversely the niox io structure was formed using negatively charged ps colloidal particles as shown in fig 2 f i the prepared ps for the niox io filter had a negative zeta potential of 50 4 mv owing to the dissociation of the carboxylic acid groups originating from the anionic initiator 4 4 azobis 4 cyanovaleric acid 58 59 the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged ps colloidal particles and positively charged niox nps resulted in raspberry like niox coated ps particles as shown in fig 2 h and then io structure was formed with the successive heat treatment fig 2 i 3 3 water flux control via pore size engineering in the io structured filters the use of io structured filters allowed a higher water flux than that of powder based filters during the water purification process as illustrated in fig 3 a and the water flux was easily controlled by adjusting the pore size of io structured filters 39 60 61 in previous works the membrane filters showed an intrinsic limit related to pore size which was highly associated with pollutant removal performance 61 63 however our io structured filters were composed of functional nps which remove pollutants by adsorption relying on the electrostatic interaction of the charged nps rather than by size dependent rejection thus the purification performance of the io structured filter was less dependent on the pore size as shown in fig 3 b the pore size of the io structured filter could be varied from 400 nm to 2 μm through the size of pss fig s3 notably the water flux increased as the pore size increases for example the permeated water flux for an io structured filter with a pore size of 400 nm exhibited a higher flux of 1167 l m2 h while the powder based filter exhibited only half i e 572 l m2 h the water flux refers not only to the kinetics of purification but also to the residence time of the wastewater within the io structured filter implying the trade off relationship between the water flux and purification performance thus it is necessary to consider optimizing adsorption capacity and pore size in an io structured water purification system as a criterion for efficient filter design 3 4 multi pollutants removal performance of the io structured all in one filter to evaluate the feasibility of the practical application of our io structured all in one filter fix bed column flow through experiments were carried out using a quartz column of 5 mm internal diameter connected with membrane filters at both ends fig 4 a the multi pollutants solution was prepared by including zinc phosphate and phenol as model substrates of heavy metals anionic substances and organic matter the fixed bed column system was set in two different ways packing the columns with i the separate layers of multiple adsorbents separated filter fig 4 b and ii a single phase of an all in one filter integrated filter fig 4 c and the pollutant solution was fed in up flow mode through the column using a peristaltic pump the performance of purification for fixed bed columns can be estimated by a mathematical modeling approach of breakthrough curves among the most commonly used models the thomas and adams bohart models were introduced to fit the experimental data at different column systems and summarized results are presented in table 1 as seen in fig 4 e f the thomas model provides a better fitting for all of the pollutant adsorption experimental data in the fixed bed column compared to the adams bohart model indicating that this io structured filter system follows the langmuir isotherms and second order reversible kinetics 51 64 the adams bohart model is commonly utilized to describe the initial part of the breakthrough curve and the nonlinear fitting curves by the adams bohart model perform worse at higher c t c 0 than 0 5 which is consistent with previous reports 51 74 the thomas model is also used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity on adsorbents and the kinetic constant k th ml min mg according to results in table 1 the values of absorption capacities q e of the integrated all in one filter for various pollutants is higher than those of the separated multi column system which could be attributed to the lower flow rate of all in one column q 17 20 ml h as illustrated in fig 4 d despite an equal amount of total adsorbent in both systems the flow rate of the integrated filter system was lower than the separated filter system due to the difference in continuous bed length the lower flow rate implies a longer residence time in the adsorbent bed causing sufficient contact time for adsorbate onto the adsorbents within the column in table 1 the removal performance for each pollutant e g phenol zn and phosphate is much different from one another despite being in the same column system a certain adsorbent bed could eliminate each pollutant within the column and the removal performance for each adsorbent differs as shown in fig s4 and table s1 the s g exhibited higher adsorption capacity of 53 16 mg g than that of other absorbents in the single column system at the high water flow 2 3 ml min suggesting that the adsorption kinetics of s g is faster than other absorbents fe2o3 and niox thus the increase in adsorption performance for zinc and phosphate in the integrate system could be attributed by the lower flow rate which could compensate for the slow adsorption kinetics of fe2o3 and niox fig 4 h and table s2 compare adsorption capacity and flow rate for various pollutants in fixed bed column flow through systems including phenol phosphate and zinc as reported in the literature 35 36 65 73 the io structured all in one filter in this work demonstrates superior adsorption performance with a higher adsorption capacity of 108 16 mg g phenol 209 26 mg g zn and 202 54 mg g phosphate under a flow rate of 0 29 ml min indicating the excellent potential for decentralized water treatment and portable water purification devices in addition the saturated adsorbents in an all in one filter can be separated after use to regenerate according to the characteristics of each adsorbent the s g can be regenerated by heat treatment 75 and we confirmed that the s g maintained its structure even after the phenol adsorption desorption process heat treatment 500 c n2 atmosphere 2 h as shown in fig s5 to confirm the reusability of the fe2o3 and niox the removal efficiencies were tested by three consecutive cycles of the adsorption desorption process fig s6 the removal efficiencies for fe2o3 and niox decreased after reuse due to the residual pollutants on the surface suggesting the need for an optimized desorption process especially the efficiency decrease in fe2o3 was caused by the strong interaction between the zn ions and amine group on the fe2o3 surface 41 however the removal efficiency exhibited above 70 even after three recycling process and the fe2o3 and niox did not change the crystallographic structure after the adsorption desorption cycle indicating high reusability fig s7 in addition the composition of adsorbents within a column could be adjusted in compliance with wastewater characteristics suggesting practical utilization in water purification applications 4 conclusions in summary an io structured all in one filter composed of three different layers of absorbents i e s g fe2o3 io niox io was designed as a novel water purification system the io structured filter showed an enhanced water flux of 1167 l m2 h compared to the powder of nps 572 l m2 h the adsorption property was also investigated in a continuous fixed bed column to remove pollutants simultaneously from multi pollutants systems including phenol zn and phosphate the sequential multi column separated filter system was compared with the all in one column integrated filter system and the thomas and adams bohart models were used to fit and predict the experimental data indicating that adsorption occurs followed by langmuir isotherm and second order reversible kinetics notably the io structured all in one filter showed a remarkable adsorption capacity of 108 16 mg g 209 26 mg g and 202 54 mg g for phenol zn and phosphate respectively under a flow rate of 0 29 ml min in addition the fe2o3 and niox reusability were tested by three consecutive cycles of the adsorption desorption process the removal efficiency exhibited above 70 even after three recycling processes implying the reusability of io based an all in one filter our results demonstrated the great potential of an io structure all in one filter as

12514,despite the dominance of centralized water treatment systems in the past decades there is increased demand for instant water treatment in isolated areas i e decentralized water treatment moreover as wastewater contains multiple pollutants such as heavy metals anionic substances and organic matter research on their simultaneous removal is one of the most significant issues for practical application in this study we reported a novel all in one multi pollutants removal filter based on inverse opal io structures for decentralized water treatment this io based all in one filter consists of three adsorbents fe2o3 niox and s doped graphene for the simultaneous removal of heavy metals anionic substances and organic matter the filter was particularly designed to enhance the water flux of nano absorbents with high absorption capacity under a water flow system as a result the all in one multi pollutants removal filter exhibited excellent adsorption performance phenol 108 16 mg g zn 209 26 mg g and phosphate 202 54 mg g at ultrafast water flux 1167 l m2 h we successfully designed an efficient multi pollutants removal system considering the removal mechanisms suitable for different pollutants the correlation of pollutants and the water flow by io structure moreover our results demonstrated the simultaneous removal of multi pollutants from wastewater using a single unit purification system which would provide great significance to decentralized water purification systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords all in one filter inverse opal structure multi pollutants water purification fixed bed column data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the most significant global crises as it directly impacts humans and ecosystems 1 the wastewater from various sources has led to drastic deterioration of water quality leading to hazardous health consequences such as kidney failure cancer heart attack and brain disorders 2 5 over the last century centralized water treatment systems which involve the transportation of wastewater and treated water through a broad network of pumps and pipes have been the norm 6 however centralized water treatment systems demand high costs for constructing and maintaining the relevant infrastructure and transporting polluted and treated water over long distances moreover the unsecured quality of treated water due to a deteriorated water supply network and huge water treatment and transportation budget makes centralized water treatment systems inappropriate for isolated areas as a solution to these drawbacks decentralized water treatment systems with different types of technology have been studied worldwide 7 11 these decentralized treatment systems enable on site water treatment without any transport infrastructure lowering the cost of installation of sustaining infrastructure furthermore decentralization enhances infrastructure resiliency by quickly recovering the damaged or disrupted treatment system providing easy control of accidentally released contaminants and ensuring high quality water meets its intended use 7 8 in particular an on site water treatment system could contribute to ensuring a resilient and safe water supply in peri urban areas or isolated locations several efforts have been made to remove pollutants in three representation treatments such as biological chemical and physical treatment the biological treatments are suitable for biodegradable organic substances and usually economical 12 however this method has several disadvantages including the need for a large land area some chemical toxicity and a limit of organic substances that can be removed 13 on the other hand the chemical and physical treatment has been widely used due to its removal efficiency and various types of contaminants that can be removed and include various purification methods such as adsorption chemical precipitation disinfection photocatalytic process reverse osmosis ion exchange and membrane 12 14 22 of these methods adsorption is preferred as a potential method for water purification due to its low cost simplicity and potential for recycling real wastewaters are aqueous mixtures of diverse neutral and ionic pollutants such as heavy metals and organic compounds containing nitrogen and sulfur 2 23 25 however to date several pollutant removal studies have focused on removing a single component considering the realistic chemical compositions found in the wastewater matrices the technical efforts made so far to design the treatment system for a specific single target substrate are impractical hence studies focusing on the simultaneous removal of contaminants and multiple pollutants have recently gained much more attention 26 31 the functionalized cellulose was introduced for lead pb cadmium cd and nickel ni removal in multi pollutant systems demonstrating remarkable high adsorption capacities of 295 20 mg g pb 151 51 mg g cd and 72 80 mg g ni 26 cao et al observed the heavy metal adsorbing properties in co exists of different heavy metals e g pb cd copper cu ni and zinc zn using multi pore activated carbons and reported that their competitive adsorption was as follows cd pb ni cu zn 32 the la mgal nanocomposites for the simultaneous treatment of co existing phosphate and fluoride from water have also been investigated and high adsorption capacities of 101 59 mg g for phosphate and 51 03 mg g for fluoride were observed 33 however the strategies suggested previously aimed to eliminate similar categories of pollutant species including heavy metals inorganic anions and organic compounds so the technical challenges in treating natural wastewater containing pollutants that belong to diverse categories have yet to be addressed for more practical utilization afridi et al studied the phosphate removing properties of anodized iron oxide in a variety of simulated wastewaters having anions heavy metals and organic matter and confirmed the inhibitory effect of co existing contaminants on the removal efficiency 34 although the study reported the effect of co existing pollutants of different species further research on multi pollutants removal at once should be conducted removal mechanisms depend on the pollutant species so proper adsorbents should be designed and adapted to remove each pollutant for instance the adsorption process by electrostatic interaction of different charged pollutants e g heavy metals are positively charged and anionic substances are negatively charged needs oppositely charged adsorbents meanwhile most previously reported water treatment studies conducted batch experiments to test adsorption performance the quantitative information from batch experiments may not be readily adapted for designing practical water purification systems due to the discriminating differences between the water flow conditions minimal studies have evaluated adsorption performance under flow through conditions in multi pollutants systems 35 36 vu et al performed column flow through experiments in multi pollutants systems e g phosphate zinc and caffeine using multifunctional al mg go as an adsorbent which exhibited an adsorption capacity of phosphate 1 64 mg g zinc 0 56 mg g and caffeine 0 53 mg g 35 however to utilize in actual water treatment low adsorption capacity still remains a hurdle to overcome owing to the trade off between adsorption ability and water flux inverse opal io structures have been employed as water purification membranes due to their high porosity large surface area and good interconnectivity 37 40 zhang et al prepared tio2 io photonic crystal pc combined with nayf4 yb3 er3 nyf up conversion nanoparticles for use in catalytic membrane the nyf tio2 io showed enhanced photocatalytic activity high inactivation rate of 100 for bacteria under 11 h caused by highly ordered io structure 40 na et al employed the 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl tempo immobilized io for use in catalytic membrane 39 the tempo immobilized io exhibited outstanding performance of high conversion efficiency 97 maintaining a permeation flux higher than 300 l m2 h 1 bar in spite of the structural benefits of io structure their use in practical water purification system is still remained as challenges due to the difficulty in scalable process and controlling surface properties to adsorb specific pollutants also researches on the io water purification system for multi contaminants has not been conducted yet in this study we have designed an all in one water filtration unit using an inverse opal io structure for a fit for purpose water treatment system io based filters can encompass porous materials with a broad range of pore sizes morphological features and chemical compositions it is technically possible to fabricate multifunctional io integrating diverse inorganic nano adsorbents that result in the miniaturization of natural wastewater treatment plants the io based filter consists of three substances fe2o3 io niox io and sulfur doped graphene s g to remove heavy metals anionic substances and organic matters respectively the flow rate of water according to the pore size of io structure was analyzed and the water purification performance of the io based filter for multi pollutants was evaluated also an optimized io based all in one filter system was designed by comparing two different fixed bed continuous water flow systems to suggest a practical water purification system 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of materials 2 1 1 materials iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 99 urea ch4n2o 99 5 gelatin from bovine skin type b

adsorbent was observed the breakthrough curve was expressed as influent concentration ratios ct c0 as a function of time in which the shape of the breakthrough curve and the time for the appearance of

be attributed to the lower flow rate of all in one column q 17 20 ml h as illustrated in fig 4 d despite an equal amount of total adsorbent in both systems the flow rate of the integrated filter system was lower than the separated filter system due to the difference in continuous bed length the lower flow rate implies a longer residence time in the adsorbent bed causing sufficient contact time for adsorbate onto the adsorbents within the column in table 1 the removal performance for each pollutant e g phenol zn and phosphate is much different from one another despite being in the same column system a certain adsorbent bed could eliminate each pollutant within the column and the removal performance for each adsorbent differs as shown in fig s4 and table s1 the s g exhibited higher adsorption capacity of 53 16 mg g than that of other absorbents in the single column system at the high water flow 2 3 ml min suggesting that the adsorption kinetics of s g is faster than other absorbents fe2o3 and niox thus the increase in adsorption performance for zinc and phosphate in the integrate system could be attributed by the lower flow rate which could compensate for the slow adsorption kinetics of fe2o3 and niox fig 4 h and table s2 compare adsorption capacity and flow rate for various pollutants in fixed bed column flow through systems including phenol phosphate and zinc as reported in the literature 35 36 65 73 the io structured all in one filter in this work demonstrates superior adsorption performance with a higher adsorption capacity of 108 16 mg g phenol 209 26 mg g zn and 202 54 mg g phosphate under a flow rate of 0 29 ml min indicating the excellent potential for decentralized water treatment and portable water purification devices in addition the saturated adsorbents in an all in one filter can be separated after use to regenerate according to the characteristics of each adsorbent the s g can be regenerated by heat treatment 75 and we confirmed that the s g maintained its structure even after the phenol adsorption desorption process heat treatment 500 c n2 atmosphere 2 h as shown in fig s5 to confirm the reusability of the fe2o3 and niox the removal efficiencies were tested by three consecutive cycles of the adsorption desorption process fig s6 the removal efficiencies for fe2o3 and niox decreased after reuse due to the residual pollutants on the surface suggesting the need for an optimized desorption process especially the efficiency decrease in fe2o3 was caused by the strong interaction between the zn ions and amine group on the fe2o3 surface 41 however the removal efficiency exhibited above 70 even after three recycling process and the fe2o3 and niox did not change the crystallographic structure after the adsorption desorption cycle indicating high reusability fig s7 in addition the composition of adsorbents within a column could be adjusted in compliance with wastewater characteristics suggesting practical utilization in water purification applications 4 conclusions in summary an io structured all in one filter composed of three different layers of absorbents i e s g fe2o3 io niox io was designed as a novel water purification system the io structured filter showed an enhanced water flux of 1167 l m2 h compared to the powder of nps 572 l m2 h the adsorption property was also investigated in a continuous fixed bed column to remove pollutants simultaneously from multi pollutants systems including phenol zn and phosphate the sequential multi column separated filter system was compared with the all in one column integrated filter system and the thomas and adams bohart models were used to fit and predict the experimental data indicating that adsorption occurs followed by langmuir isotherm and second order reversible kinetics notably the io structured all in one filter showed a remarkable adsorption capacity of 108 16 mg g 209 26 mg g and 202 54 mg g for phenol zn and phosphate respectively under a flow rate of 0 29 ml min in addition the fe2o3 and niox reusability were tested by three consecutive cycles of the adsorption desorption process the removal efficiency exhibited above 70 even after three recycling processes implying the reusability of io based an all in one filter our results demonstrated the great potential of an io structure all in one filter as excellent multi pollutants removal performance especially at high water flux for practical application as a water purification filter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
