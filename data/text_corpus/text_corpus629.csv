3145,fiber optic distributed temperature sensing when combined with the single probe heat pulse technique can measure soil moisture θ across spatial scales the key limitation of this system is in obtaining the relationship between soil thermal conductivity λ and θ for a specific field using the department of energy atmospheric radiation measurement arm site this study tested a new methodology to account for the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship using a gaussian processes model the resulting accurate θ measurements rmse 0 03 m3m 3 were used to characterize the spatial variability of θ across scales and to develop an empirical equation that can correct for the changes in the θ spatial variability observed at different spatial resolutions in addition the number of required samples to accurately characterize θ and its variability over scales ranging from 5 m and 350 m were estimated these findings provide key information to scale soil moisture from centimeters to hundreds of meters for process understanding keywords distributed temperature sensing soil thermal properties soil moisture single probe heat pulse statistical learning remote sensing 1 introduction soil moisture content θ m 3 m 3 is a key parameter for many scientific and practical applications including investigation of the different components of the water budget over different spatial and temporal scales krakauer et al 2014 wilson et al 2001 precision agriculture irrigation applications hassan esfahani et al 2014 li 2012 and flood prediction systems alvarez garreton et al 2015 brocca et al 2010a brocca et al 2010b wanders et al 2014 to cite a few factors like soil physical properties vegetation cover micro topography and the meteorological forcing drive the spatial variability in θ western et al 2002 however these factors influence θ over different spatial scales with the soil properties becoming dominant at micro scales and the influences of the other factors start to increase as the scale increases crow et al 2012 peng et al 2017 as a result the variability of θ is scale dependent blöschl sivapalan 1995 suggested that a scale triplet consisting of spacing support and extent should be used to characterize the scale effects over spatial variability spacing refers to the average distance between the measurements support refers to the actual distance captured in the individual measurements and extent represents the overall area covered by the observed measurements the same scale definition is used in this study for consistency investigating the scale effects on the variability of θ requires high resolution θ measurements that cover the whole scale spectrum many measurement techniques have been developed to measure θ at the point scale su et al 2014 in parallel satellite remote sensing techniques were developed to measure θ over large and global scales but with low resolution in the range of several kilometers e g fathololoumi et al 2021 mohanty et al 2017 aerial l band radiometers can measure θ with higher resolution in the order of tens of square meters e g bogena et al 2015 both the remote sensing and aerial radiometers need to be calibrated and validated using in situ measurements different methods have been proposed to determine the number of required samples nrs to capture the variability over the scale represented by each pixel from these products these methods typically utilize a statistical approach a geostatistical approach or a variation of the bootstrap sampling approach wang et al 2008 the bootstrap sampling method eliminates the need for any assumptions regarding the distribution of the observed variability but it is computationally expensive as it requires a large number of replicates to provide accurate estimates kamgar et al 1993 previous studies attempted to utilize these methods to estimate nrs over different scales but few of them address small scales 800 m due to the scarcity of extensive datasets over those scales for instance famiglietti et al 2008 investigated the variability of θ over scale extents of 800 m and 50 km using the datasets from the sgp97 sgp99 smex02 and smex03 field campaigns and concluded using a statistical approach that 18 and 30 samples are required to estimate the mean soil moisture within 3 and with 95 confidence at these two scales respectively brocca et al 2010a brocca et al 2010b adopted a similar statistical approach and concluded that a maximum of 15 measurements is needed to estimate the mean soil moisture within 2 with 95 confidence within a field scale extent 60 m in central italy however additional investigations are required to investigate the variability in θ over a wider range of scales and under different field conditions wet dry to supplement and understand the generality of these findings besides the need to calibrate and validate remote sensing products these products also frequently need to be downscaled to match the scale required for the different applications peng et al 2017 each pixel in remote sensing θ measurements represent the average conditions over the whole pixel area therefore the variability in the observed θ in remote sensing applications should be thought of as a filtered version of the actual variability many downscaling techniques have been proposed to attempt reconstructing these filtered out variability components a good review of the different downscaling approaches of soil moisture data can be found in peng et al 2017 the majority of the downscaling approaches can be classified into satellite based and model based approaches in the satellite based approaches the features of a high resolution satellite product are used to increase the resolution of soil moisture maps acquired using another lower resolution satellite product the downscaling capabilities of the satellite based approaches is limited by the resolutions of the available satellite products which is by far coarser than the requirements of many field scale applications in the model based downscaling approaches a statistical model e g kaheil et al 2008 or a data assimilation technique is used to characterize the spatial variability of θ at the downscaled scale which is then implemented in the downscaling algorithm from the earlier discussion it is apparent that investigation of the spatial variability in θ over intermediate spatial scales that range from several meters to several kilometers is limited by our previous inability to measure θ in situ across scales from sub meter to hundreds of meters recent advances in fiber optic fo distributed temperature sensing dts technology make fill the gap in our capacity to measure soil moisture across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales dts systems are capable of monitoring temperature along several kilometers of fo cable with spatial resolutions down to a few centimeters and temporal resolution down to one second sayde et al 2010 shehata et al 2020 monitoring the variation in soil temperature after a heating or cooling event can be used to estimate the soil thermal properties as water has the strongest thermal inertia in comparison with soil particles and air this can in turn be used to estimate θ one of the techniques that relies on this principle is the single probe heat pulse sphp technique in which a heating element is used to induce a heat pulse in the soil while a temperature sensor or a fo cable when using dts technology enclosed inside the heating element is used to monitor the corresponding temperature variation the sphp technique can be used to measure soil thermal conductivity λ but has limited accuracy in measuring other thermal properties bristow et al 1994 de vries 1952 he et al 2018 if the λ θ relationship is known soil moisture can be derived from the estimated λ however other factors besides θ are contributing to the λ θ relationship among the key factors are the thermal properties of the soil s solids which depend on the soil s mineralogical composition other soil physical factors such as particle size gradation packing bulk density and porosity also control the thermal resistance between the different particles and consequently govern heat conduction through soil dong et al 2015 soil temperature can also influence λ significantly at very high temperatures or near and below freezing conditions e g campbell et al 1994 haynes et al 1980 moreover the λ θ relationship can be affected by hysteresis farouki 1966 the dependency of the λ θ relationship on the other aforementioned factors makes it difficult to obtain that relationship except by direct measurements which is a key limitation of the sphp technique in measuring θ typically a λ θ relationship representative of the whole experiment domain is obtained by pairing λ measurements from the sphp technique with θ measurements obtained from independent point sensors scattered along the length of the fo cable to construct the λ θ relationship ciocca et al 2012 sayde et al 2010 striegl and ii 2012 this methodology could be sufficient for relatively homogeneous fields where the λ θ relationship persists over the whole field as the heterogeneity in soil properties increases over the measurement domain utilizing a single calibration curve could significantly increase the errors in the θ estimates previous fo dts studies did not address the issue of soil heterogeneity while utilizing the sphp dts techniques one possibility to account for the soil heterogeneity while calibrating sphp dts transects is by using a statistical learning approach recent advancements in statistical learning algorithms such as the gaussian processes regression gp provide unprecedented opportunities to explore trends and fit highly complex non linear datasets which could be used to address existing limitations in the fo dts approach gp models are highly flexible in fitting complex datasets and can also provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the predictions due to their probabilistic nature ažman and kocijan 2007 rasmussen 2004 recently gp models have been used in many remote sensing and airborne imagery applications e g camps valls et al 2016 verrelst et al 2016 xie et al 2021 gp models have also been used to spatially interpolate soil moisture from a point soil moisture sensing network to support precision agriculture applications andugula et al 2017 and to calibrate frequency domain reflection sensors to account for temperature variations chen et al 2019 the gp was then used to more accurately estimate θ along the fiber with its uncertainty this study has three objectives the first one is to test a new methodology to obtain improved estimates of θ along an sphp transect by accounting for the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship the second objective is to use the obtained high resolution θ measurements to characterize the observed changes in the spatial variability in θ among measurements with different spatial resolutions ranging from 0 25 m to 40 m the third objective was to estimate the nrs to accurately estimate the spatial variability in θ inside scale extents e g remote sensing pixel sizes ranging from 5 m to 350 m the findings of this study provide the required key pieces of information to establish high quality validation and downscaling processes of remote sensing products 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental setup the experimental design used in this study is a part of a larger dts installation located in an agricultural field adjacent to the southern great plains sgp atmospheric observatory in oklahoma the installation consisted of multiple underground and aerial fiber optic fo cables extending over a 600 m transect in an alfalfa covered agricultural field the soil in the site is mapped as the kirkland series with the surface soil texture classified as silt loam according to the united states department of agriculture web soil survey the configuration of the installed dts system is shown in fig 1 in august 2017 the underground installation was performed using a custom built plow which was used to install three underground fo cables over a 45 plane at depths of 5 10 and 15 cm in the soil the soil was then left to settle and recover to its undisturbed state over a period longer than two years before the three months investigated in this study march to may 2020 three well mixed calibration baths equipped with air bubblers were installed where each bath contained 25 50 m from each of the three fo cables one calibration bath was kept at temperatures lower than the ambient temperature by installing it inside the air conditioned container that contained the dts unit the temperature inside the second calibration bath located outside the container was raised above the ambient temperatures using a heating element the third calibration bath located at the end of the transect was held at ambient temperatures one rbr solo3 t sensor rbr ltd was used to monitor the temperature of each calibration bath every 60 s the fo cable ends were fusion spliced together into a single path connected to a silixa ultima sr silixa ltd dts unit operating from inside an air conditioned container the dts data were collected continuously with spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 m and 2 s the 10 cm depth cable was heated actively while the other two cables reported temperature passively this study focuses on the fo sphp data collected from the middle underground fo cable marked in blue in fig 1 over 76 days within the period from march to may 2020 the active 4 5 mm diameter fo cable consisted of 50 µm optical fibers enclosed inside a 2 0 mm stainless steel tube filled with sepigel seppic inc and covered by a polyethylene jacket reinforced with six copper and six stainless steel wires 0 6 mm in diameter each custom made afl telecommunications the conductive elements of the fo cable had a total resistance of 0 01 o m twenty different ec 5 soil moisture stations onset computer corporation were installed along the first 450 m of the fo sphp cable with spacing ranging from 18 to 26 m as shown in fig 1b three stations of those were wired stations that consisted of four ec 5 sensors installed at depths of 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 25 m and connected to an h21 usb hobo micro station data logger the remaining 17 stations were hobonet wireless ec 5 sensors installed at the same depth as the fo sphp cable a microrx2100 cellular station collected the data from the wireless stations and uploaded them to the hobolink cloud services all soil moisture sensors collected measurements every minute throughout the study period the locations of the soil moisture stations along the fo cable were identified by applying an ice bag to the fo cable at those locations and locating the corresponding drop in temperature in the dts measurements in addition undisturbed soil samples were collected from the ec 5 sensor locations to investigate the possible variability in the soil bulk density and texture between those locations 2 2 heating protocol for the active measurements the fo sphp cable transect was divided into four sections of 150 m each and a few spare meters were left outside the soil between the sections to connect the power lines one heat pulse per hour that lasted for 480 s was applied to each of the three sections closest to the dts unit starting from midnight to 7 00 am each day heat pulses were applied at night for safety reasons as this field is used primarily to raise livestock the total applied voltage for each heated section was also limited to 50 v to comply with the safety considerations at the site which resulted in variability in the applied current and power per each heated section as shown in fig 1b the heat pulses were applied using a microfusion power controller control concepts inc controlled by a time activated relay controller ncd inc 2 3 estimation of soil thermal conductivity λ the dts data were firstly calibrated using the controlled temperature of the calibration baths then the influence of ambient temperature was subtracted from the applied heat pulses to extract the variation in temperatures caused solely by the applied heating event the ambient temperature for each heat pulse was estimated by fitting a linear relationship using data from two 600 s intervals one precedes the start of the heat application and the other start after 1800 s from it this approach is suitable to the nature of the heat pulses which were applied overnight when no steep changes in the temporal temperature gradients are expected over the heat pulse duration in fact this ambient temperature determination approach resulted in minimal errors rmse 0 04 ok when tested using data from a night in which no heat pulses were applied the daily average soil thermal conductivity λ corresponding to each 0 25 m section along the transect was then estimated from the slope of the linear relationship between the average change of temperature δ t observed at this location from the seven applied heat pulses v s the logarithm of time t de vries 1952 bristow et al 1994 1 δ t q 4 π λ l n t b where q is the applied heating power and b is the intercept of the fitted line the first few seconds of the heat pulse are highly influenced by the finite radius of the heat source and the contact resistance between the fo cable and the surrounding soil bristow et al 1994 therefore following the approach of bristow et al 1994 the first 10 s from the applied heat pulse were excluded from the fitting while estimating λ 2 4 calibration curves of λ v s θ to establish the calibration curves at the locations of the ec 5 sensors their θ measurements were combined with the λ measurements observed at the closest section of the fo cable to their locations fig 2 a b the majority of the calibration curves followed a similar relationship except for the calibration curves corresponding to stations 10 11 and 18 the different and noisy relationship observed at station 10 was expected as many gopher underground holes were observed next to its location fig 2 c d these holes caused extensive errors in both the fo sphp and the ec 5 measurements therefore it was decided to exclude station 10 on the other hand the relatively different relationships observed at stations 11 and 18 could be attributed to the higher bulk densities observed at these stations in comparison with the other stations fig 3 despite having a similar silt loam texture 2 5 estimation of the θ profiles the traditional approach in which a single calibration curve that represents the whole site was conducted as a baseline several thermal conductivity models were fitted to all the λ θ pairs observed at all the ec 5 sensor locations the côté konrad 2005 model equations 2 and 3 provided the best fit among the tested models and therefore was used to generate the final single calibration curve 2 θ k r n m k r m 1 3 k r λ λ dry λ n λ dry where k r is the kersten number n is the soil porosity m is a tuning parameter λ n and λ dry are the thermal conductivity at saturation and dry moisture conditions respectively the four parameters n m λ n and λ dry were used as fitting parameters while generating the final calibration curve in this study we propose a new methodology to account for the heterogeneity in the soil properties along the fo cable transect using a gp model gp models are stochastic processes that can be used to estimate the posterior error as a function of time or space thus giving temporally or spatially varying information on the variable estimate uncertainties due to observational errors of model error gp models which represent here the gaussian stochastic processes along the dts length can be characterized by only their mean and the covariance function 4 θ g p m x k x i x j where m x is the mean of the predictors x equal to zero after normalizing the predictors and k x i x j is the covariance function between the predictors x i and x j which can take different forms rasmussen and williams 2006 in this study the rational quadratic kernel with no basis function was used 5 k x i x j σ f 2 1 d x i x j 2 2 α l 2 α where d x i x j is the euclidean distance between x i and x j and the three kernel parameters σ f α l which are fitted using the available data the predictors used in the gp model included the distance of the station along the transect the observed λ on that day the average and maximum thermal conductivity observed at that location over the study period also the observed spatially averaged soil moisture on that day the average of soil moisture observed at all the ec 5 stations over the heat pulses period was added as a predictor in addition the observed average ambient temperature was also included as a predictor to account for any variability in λ caused by the temperature differences finally two additional predictors that represent the reduction in λ observed over the first and second days of drainage from the nearly saturated soil conditions reached after a severe storm that occurred on april 18th precipitation 50 mm within 24 h these two predictors were included as they provide information about the possible variations in soil characteristics over the length of the fo transect the ability of the constructed gp models to predict θ at other locations was assessed using cross validation using this approach observations from one station were iteratively left out from the training dataset which was used to optimize the gp covariance parameters and θ from the left out station was used as the validation dataset after the performance of the gp models were validated a new gp model trained using all the data from the non excluded soil moisture stations was used to predict the final θ profiles θ final with the highest possible accuracy the performance of the gp model in estimating θ was compared against the single calibration curve approach i e the côté konrad 2005 model four statistic parameters were used in this comparison namely the root mean square error rmse m 3 m 3 mean bias mbe m 3 m 3 maximum absolute error mae m 3 m 3 and the normalized nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nnse unitless introduced by nossent bauwens 2012 that give a value ranging from zero to one with larger values representing a more efficient model 6 rmse i 1 n θ i θ i 2 n 7 mbe i 1 n θ i θ i n 8 mae m a x θ i θ i 9 nnse 1 1 i 1 n θ i θ i 2 i 1 n θ i θ i 2 where n is the number of days where the ec 5 measurements were available at the station under consideration and θ i and θ i are the predicted soil moisture and the observed measurements using the ec 5 sensors respectively and θ i is the average soil moisture observed at the station under consideration over the whole investigated period 2 6 effect of spatial resolution over the spatial variability of θ the final estimated θ final profiles with the original spatial resolution δ x 0 25 m were used to assess how the spatial variability of θ changed with the mean soil moisture μ θ the spatial variability was characterized using the standard deviation σ θ and coefficient of variation cv for each day as defined in equations 10 12 10 μ θ j i 1 n θ i j n 11 σ θ j 1 n 1 i 1 n θ i j μ θ j 2 12 cv j σ θ j μ θ j where n is the number of measurements included in estimating the statistics θ i j is the soil moisture estimated at location i and over day j the changes in the observed spatial variability in θ at different δ x were also investigated the δ x effect in this study is equivalent to the joint effect of varying the spacing and support scales defined by blöschl and sivapalan 1995 profiles of θ with δ x ranging from 0 5 m to 40 m with interval of 0 25 m were constructed by upscaling the actual observed θ final profiles the upscaling was performed to reach a dataset with a spatial resolution i θ sp i by averaging the θ final measurements over a non overlapping moving window with a width equal i this upscaling technique means that μ θ remains constant regardless of the used δ x for each θ sp i dataset the variability observed at different mean soil moisture states was calculated the empirical equation proposed by famiglietti et al 2008 was used to fit the relationships between cv and σ θ against μ θ using two fitting parameters k 1 and k 2 equation 13 to see if they follow the same patterns observed in previous studies over larger spatial scales 13 cv k 1 e x p k 2 μ θ additionally an empirical equation was proposed and fitted to the data to provide a framework to estimate the ratio of the observed variability parameters at a certain length scale δ x to those observed at δ x 0 25 m σ θ r a t i o and cv ratio a function of μ θ and δ x 2 7 the nrs for different scale extents a bootstrapping technique was used to estimate nrs for accurate estimation of μ θ and σ θ over the spatial extents from 5 m to 350 m each investigated scale extent was represented by 50 replicates obtained by randomly selecting sampling areas with that extent from the θ final profiles for each replicate the error in the estimated μ θ and σ θ corresponding to each number of samples n s was calculated using 104 iterations of subsampling n s samples from the sampling area associated with that replicate from the results the nrs required to estimate μ θ and σ θ within a margin of error of 1 2 and 3 with 95 confidence were computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 gp models validation in comparison with the single calibration curve approach the comparison between the performance of the gp model cross validation and the traditional single calibration curve approaches in predicting the ec 5 measurements at the different stations is presented in fig 4 and the mean statistics are presented in table 1 the gp model managed to reduce the overall error and bias in the predicted θ as it resulted in a mean and standard deviation rmse and mbe of 0 03 0 01 m3m 3 and 0 00 0 03 m3m 3 respectively which is comparable to the accuracy of the ec 5 sensors themselves the single calibration curve approach resulted in higher rmse and mbe of 0 05 0 02 m3m 3 and 0 00 0 05 m3m 3 respectively the gp model also managed to reduce the mae from 0 11 0 04 m3m 3 to 0 07 0 02 m3m 3 and resulted in more accurate overall predictions as can be inferred from the increase of the observed nnse from 0 65 0 24 to 0 72 0 27 in comparison with the traditional single calibration curve approach it should be noted that the gp model predictions presented in fig 4 and its statistics presented in table 1 are based on the validation gp models that excluded the data from the station under consideration from the training dataset on the other hand all the data from the ec 5 stations were included while generating the côté and konrad 2005 single calibration curve this may explain why the single calibration curve approach slightly outperformed the gp model while predicting the stations which were relatively different such as station 3 and to a lower extent at station 15 see fig 4 nevertheless the gp models had better predictive power at all the other stations including stations 11 and 18 which followed a relatively different relationship the final gp model that utilizes the full dataset for training is expected to even have higher predictive power as it will account for all stations another point to consider here is that the predictions from both approaches were compared to the raw θ measured by ec 5 sensors which include their intrinsic errors assumed to be within the range of 0 03 m3m 3 based on manufacturer although some previous studies reported larger errors for the ec 5 sensors in different soil formations fares et al 2016 kanso et al 2020 the gpr model approach is superior to the single calibration curve approach in this regard as it accounts for measurement uncertainty in its training dataset due to its probabilistic nature which leads to less biased θ estimates the final spatiotemporal distribution of θ final estimated from the final gp model which was trained using data from all the non excluded stations are shown in fig 5 the results illustrate the key advantage of the obtained high resolution dts measurements in revealing the details of the spatial variability over a wide range of spatial scales the heterogeneity in the observed reduction on soil moisture following the april 18th severe storm day 53 illustrates the wide variation in the drainage properties across the fo transect 3 2 effect of spatial resolution on the observed spatial variability of θ the relations between c v and σ θ versus μ θ at different scales are presented in fig 6 increasing μ θ led to a reduction on both c v and σ θ the reduction on c v is near exponential and can be adequately represented by equation 13 r2 0 9 which is consistent with previous studies e g brocca et al 2012 brocca et al 2010a famiglietti et al 2008 zarlenga et al 2018 in contrast increases in μ θ from the lowest observed values led to a slight increase in the observed σ θ that peaked at μ θ 0 23 m3m 3 which then decreased slightly at higher μ θ values however the convex upward shape reported by previous studies e g famiglietti et al 2008 could not be confirmed here due to the lack of measurements at lower μ θ values although reductions in the dataset spatial resolution i e increases in δ x did not affect the estimates of μ θ as all the measurements were included in the averaging process it led to reductions in the estimated σ θ and c v the reductions were more pronounced within the range from 0 25 m and 10 m and the reduction rate decreased at higher δ x see fig 6 this rapid reduction in σ θ and c v at δ x 10 m can be attributed to the filtering of the spatial variability structures that occur at micro scales less than 10 m in particular due to local variation in soil properties the vegetation cover and root distribution and micro topography furthermore the shape of the observed relationship between δ x and σ θ r a t i o over different days with similar μ θ were more variable for low observed μ θ values in comparison with near saturated conditions for instance recorded σ θ r a t i o at δ x 40 m for μ θ in the range 0 21 0 22 m3m 3 and 0 37 0 38 m3m 3 were in the range of 0 45 to 0 64 and 0 30 to 0 35 respectively this excessive variability near dry conditions can be attributed to the complex interaction between the different factors inducing the spatial variability and the temporal fluctuation of their dominance over a certain scale on the other hand when the soil is nearly saturated it dampens those spatial differences western et al 2002 this is the first study to our knowledge to report a measurement based continuous characterization of changes of the observed spatial variability over spatial resolutions ranging from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters for different relative saturation states being able to estimate these changes between different spatial resolutions can help in developing more efficient downscaling algorithms for remote sensing and aerial radiometer data currently the model based downscaling algorithms like that used in kaheil et al 2008 use the observed variability at the coarse resolution to initialize the downscaled version of it that has higher resolution although kaheil et al 2008 followed that initialization step with other rearrangement steps and the result was then assimilated with in situ measurements these additional steps will lead to changes in the resulting variability at the higher resolution but there is no guarantee that these changes are indeed accurate and resemble what is observed directly by a remote sensing product with a similar resolution the ability to quantify the changes in the observed variability can provide an additional constraint to the kaheil et al 2008 and other similar algorithms which can lead to higher efficiency in conserving the variability structure across scales in this study an empirical equation was developed to link the observed standard deviation at a certain δ x σ θ δ x to that observed at spatial resolution of 0 25 m σ θ 0 25 as a function of μ θ 14 σ θ r a t i o σ θ δ x σ θ 0 25 β 1 l n δ x 0 23 β 2 15 β 1 3 05 μ θ 2 1 79 μ θ 0 16 16 β 2 9 71 μ θ 2 7 09 μ θ 1 89 the comparison between the observed σ θ r a t i o using the actual θ final profiles and those estimated using equations 14 16 are presented in fig 6 c d the model managed to fit the observed relationship with high r2 0 91 at near saturation conditions and a lower r2 0 81 for the driest μ θ conditions the relatively low r2 values at low μ θ conditions could be attributed to the wide temporal variability in the δ x σ θ r a t i o relationships at low μ θ 3 3 the number of required samples nrs for different scale extents the nrs to measure μ θ and σ θ with different accuracy at different scale extents were estimated from the bootstrapping technique see fig 7 for estimating μ θ the total nrs increases with increasing length scale the corresponding density of measurement per unit meter however was decreasing the nrs to estimate μ θ within 2 and 3 errors respectively were only increasing slightly for scales larger than 50 m suggesting that only minor changes in the spatial variability of θ were observed over spatial scales in the range from 50 to 350 m for estimation of σ θ the nrs increases with scale for scales 100 m and starts to decrease at higher scales the nrs required to estimate σ θ was consistently less than those required for μ θ in all cases the maximum nrs was observed at an intermediate μ θ which indicate that these results are not affected by the lack of measurements at μ θ 0 2 m3m 3 nrs 29 and 14 seems to be sufficient to estimate both μ θ and σ θ at this site over the whole investigated scale extent range with a margin of error of 0 02 m3m 3 and 0 03 m3m 3 respectively these estimates are close to the 18 samples estimated by famiglietti et al 2008 for estimating μ θ over an even larger scale 800 m within the same region in oklahoma our estimates should help in improving the validation protocol of remote sensing and aerial products by providing information about the number of in situ samples required to accurately estimate the mean and standard deviation of θ within an individual pixel which can then be compared against the pixel estimates from the remote sensing products 4 conclusion this study introduced a novel statistical learning approach to account for the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship along the fiber optic transect while calibrating it the new approach relies on constructing a gaussian processes gp model that incorporates different sources of information at the calibration stations namely the point observed λ θ relationships the observed λ statistics the distance along the fo transect and the ambient temperature the gp model validation process revealed that this approach has a higher predictive power in comparison with the traditional single calibration curve approach in addition analysis of the resulting high resolution θ profiles showed that the observed spatial variability of θ decreases when a dataset with a lower δ x is used the reduction in the observed spatial variability of θ was sensitive to the reductions in δ x within the range from 0 25 m to 10 m and the sensitivity decreases at δ x 10 m an empirical equation was fitted to facilitate correcting for changes in the observed spatial variability at the study site as a function of the changes in δ x from 0 25 m to 40 m and μ θ furthermore the high resolution θ profiles were used to estimate the number of required samples nrs to accurately estimate μ θ and σ θ over scales ranging from 5 m to 350 m at the study site the total nrs increased with increasing scale extent the density of measurement per unit meter however was decreasing with increasing scale extent in general 29 and 14 samples were sufficient to estimate both μ θ and σ θ at this site over the scale up to 350 m with a margin of error of 0 02 m3m 3 and 0 03 m3m 3 respectively these accurate nrs estimates can guide the future validation studies of remote sensing products on the minimum number of in situ measurements to achieve a certain accuracy at that site a single one dimensional dts transect was used in this study to characterize all the aforementioned aspects of the θ spatial variability however the one dimensional nature of this transect limits its ability to reflect any directional anisotropy in θ variability that might exist at that site in future investigations this limitation can be addressed by installing multiple multi directional dts transects which can be used to capture and characterize anisotropy and two dimensional variability in addition further studies need to be performed in different regions and over a wider range of spatial scales generalize the estimates developed in this study under different meteorological and topographical conditions the sphp dts systems have the potential to provide unprecedented high resolution soil moisture data that can support a wide variety of applications in order to improve the practical application of these systems further research is needed to find a methodology to optimize the number and locations of the calibration stations in order to reduce the total cost while capturing the variability in soil moisture along the fo transect furthermore additional research is required to investigate the appropriate way to upscale the sphp dts system to cover longer spatial scales and to address any associated implementations and technical challenges associated with that credit authorship contribution statement mahmoud shehata methodology software formal

3145,fiber optic distributed temperature sensing when combined with the single probe heat pulse technique can measure soil moisture θ across spatial scales the key limitation of this system is in obtaining the relationship between soil thermal conductivity λ and θ for a specific field using the department of energy atmospheric radiation measurement arm site this study tested a new methodology to account for the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship using a gaussian processes model the resulting accurate θ measurements rmse 0 03 m3m 3 were used to characterize the spatial variability of θ across scales and to develop an empirical equation that can correct for the changes in the θ spatial variability observed at different spatial resolutions in addition the number of required samples to accurately characterize θ and its variability over scales ranging from 5 m and 350 m were estimated these findings provide key information to scale soil moisture from centimeters to hundreds of meters for process understanding keywords distributed temperature sensing soil thermal properties soil moisture single probe heat pulse statistical learning remote sensing 1 introduction soil moisture content θ m 3 m 3 is a key parameter for many scientific and practical applications including investigation of the different components of the water budget over different spatial and temporal scales krakauer et al 2014 wilson et al 2001 precision agriculture irrigation applications hassan esfahani et al 2014 li 2012 and flood prediction systems alvarez garreton et al 2015 brocca et al 2010a brocca et al 2010b wanders et al 2014 to cite a few factors like soil physical properties vegetation cover micro topography and the meteorological forcing drive the spatial variability in θ western et al 2002 however these factors influence θ over different spatial scales with the soil properties becoming dominant at micro scales and the influences of the other factors start to increase as the scale increases crow et al 2012 peng et al 2017 as a result the variability of θ is scale dependent blöschl sivapalan 1995 suggested that a scale triplet consisting of spacing support and extent should be used to characterize the scale effects over spatial variability spacing refers to the average distance between the measurements support refers to the actual distance captured in the individual measurements and extent represents the overall area covered by the observed measurements the same scale definition is used in this study for consistency investigating the scale effects on the variability of θ requires high resolution θ measurements that cover the whole scale spectrum many measurement techniques have been developed to measure θ at the point scale su et al 2014 in parallel satellite remote sensing techniques were developed to measure θ over large and global scales but with low resolution in the range of several kilometers e g fathololoumi et al 2021 mohanty et al 2017 aerial l band radiometers can measure θ with higher resolution in the order of tens of square meters e g bogena et al 2015 both the remote sensing and aerial radiometers need to be calibrated and validated using in situ measurements different methods have been proposed to determine the number of required samples nrs to capture the variability over the scale represented by each pixel from these products these methods typically utilize a statistical approach a geostatistical approach or a variation of the bootstrap sampling approach wang et al 2008 the bootstrap sampling method eliminates the need for any assumptions regarding the distribution of the observed variability but it is computationally expensive as it requires a large number of replicates to provide accurate estimates kamgar et al 1993 previous studies attempted to utilize these methods to estimate nrs over different scales but few of them address small scales 800 m due to the scarcity of extensive datasets over those scales for instance famiglietti et al 2008 investigated the variability of θ over scale extents of 800 m and 50 km using the datasets from the sgp97 sgp99 smex02 and smex03 field campaigns and concluded using a statistical approach that 18 and 30 samples are required to estimate the mean soil moisture within 3 and with 95 confidence at these two scales respectively brocca et al 2010a brocca et al 2010b adopted a similar statistical approach and concluded that a maximum of 15 measurements is needed to estimate the mean soil moisture within 2 with 95 confidence within a field scale extent 60 m in central italy however additional investigations are required to investigate the variability in θ over a wider range of scales and under different field conditions wet dry to supplement and understand the generality of these findings besides the need to calibrate and validate remote sensing products these products also frequently need to be downscaled to match the scale required for the different applications peng et al 2017 each pixel in remote sensing θ measurements represent the average conditions over the whole pixel area therefore the variability in the observed θ in remote sensing applications should be thought of as a filtered version of the actual variability many downscaling techniques have been proposed to attempt reconstructing these filtered out variability components a good review of the different downscaling approaches of soil moisture data can be found in peng et al 2017 the majority of the downscaling approaches can be classified into satellite based and model based approaches in the satellite based approaches the features of a high resolution satellite product are used to increase the resolution of soil moisture maps acquired using another lower resolution satellite product the downscaling capabilities of the satellite based approaches is limited by the resolutions of the available satellite products which is by far coarser than the requirements of many field scale applications in the model based downscaling approaches a statistical model e g kaheil et al 2008 or a data assimilation technique is used to characterize the spatial variability of θ at the downscaled scale which is then implemented in the downscaling algorithm from the earlier discussion it is apparent that investigation of the spatial variability in θ over intermediate spatial scales that range from several meters to several kilometers is limited by our previous inability to measure θ in situ across scales from sub meter to hundreds of meters recent advances in fiber optic fo distributed temperature sensing dts technology make fill the gap in our capacity to measure soil moisture across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales dts systems are capable of monitoring temperature along several kilometers of fo cable with spatial resolutions down to a few centimeters and temporal resolution down to one second sayde et al 2010 shehata et al 2020 monitoring the variation in soil temperature after a heating or cooling event can be used to estimate the soil thermal properties as water has the strongest thermal inertia in comparison with soil particles and air this can in turn be used to estimate θ one of the techniques that relies on this principle is the single probe heat pulse sphp technique in which a heating element is used to induce a heat pulse in the soil while a temperature sensor or a fo cable when using dts technology enclosed inside the heating element is used to monitor the corresponding temperature variation the sphp technique can be used to measure soil thermal conductivity λ but has limited accuracy in measuring other thermal properties bristow et al 1994 de vries 1952 he et al 2018 if the λ θ relationship is known soil moisture can be derived from the estimated λ however other factors besides θ are contributing to the λ θ relationship among the key factors are the thermal properties of the soil s solids which depend on the soil s mineralogical composition other soil physical factors such as particle size gradation packing bulk density and porosity also control the thermal resistance between the different particles and consequently govern heat conduction through soil dong et al 2015 soil temperature can also influence λ significantly at very high temperatures or near and below freezing conditions e g campbell et al 1994 haynes et al 1980 moreover the λ θ relationship can be affected by hysteresis farouki 1966 the dependency of the λ θ relationship on the other aforementioned factors makes it difficult to obtain that relationship except by direct measurements which is a key limitation of the sphp technique in measuring θ typically a λ θ relationship representative of the whole experiment domain is obtained by pairing λ measurements from the sphp technique with θ measurements obtained from independent point sensors scattered along the length of the fo cable to construct the λ θ relationship ciocca et al 2012 sayde et al 2010 striegl and ii 2012 this methodology could be sufficient for relatively homogeneous fields where the λ θ relationship persists over the whole field as the heterogeneity in soil properties increases over the measurement domain utilizing a single calibration curve could significantly increase the errors in the θ estimates previous fo dts studies did not address the issue of soil heterogeneity while utilizing the sphp dts techniques one possibility to account for the soil heterogeneity while calibrating sphp dts transects is by using a statistical learning approach recent advancements in statistical learning algorithms such as the gaussian processes regression gp provide unprecedented opportunities to explore trends and fit highly complex non linear datasets which could be used to address existing limitations in the fo dts approach gp models are highly flexible in fitting complex datasets and can also provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the predictions due to their probabilistic nature ažman and kocijan 2007 rasmussen 2004 recently gp models have been used in many remote sensing and airborne imagery applications e g camps valls et al 2016 verrelst et al 2016 xie et al 2021 gp models have also been used to spatially interpolate soil moisture from a point soil moisture sensing network to support precision agriculture applications andugula et al 2017 and to calibrate frequency domain reflection sensors to account for temperature variations chen et al 2019 the gp was then used to more accurately estimate θ along the fiber with its uncertainty this study has three objectives the first one is to test a new methodology to obtain improved estimates of θ along an sphp transect by accounting for the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship the second objective is to use the obtained high resolution θ measurements to characterize the observed changes in the spatial variability in θ among measurements with different spatial resolutions ranging from 0 25 m to 40 m the third objective was to estimate the nrs to accurately estimate the spatial variability in θ inside scale extents e g remote sensing pixel sizes ranging from 5 m to 350 m the findings of this study provide the required key pieces of information to establish high quality validation and downscaling processes of remote sensing products 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental setup the experimental design used in this study is a part of a larger dts installation located in an agricultural field adjacent to the southern great plains sgp atmospheric observatory in oklahoma the installation consisted of multiple underground and aerial fiber optic fo cables extending over a 600 m transect in an alfalfa covered agricultural field the soil in the site is mapped as the kirkland series with the surface soil texture classified as silt loam according to the united states department of agriculture web soil survey the configuration of the installed dts system is shown in fig 1 in august 2017 the underground installation was performed using a custom built plow which was used to install three underground fo cables over a 45 plane at depths of 5 10 and 15 cm in the soil the soil was then left to settle and recover to its undisturbed state over a period longer than two years before the three months investigated in this study march to may 2020 three well mixed calibration baths equipped with air bubblers were installed where each bath contained 25 50 m from each of the three fo cables one calibration bath was kept at temperatures lower than the ambient temperature by installing it inside the air conditioned container that contained the dts unit the temperature inside the second calibration bath located outside the container was raised above the ambient temperatures using a heating element the third calibration bath located at the end of the transect was held at ambient temperatures one rbr solo3 t sensor rbr ltd was used to monitor the temperature of each calibration bath every 60 s the fo cable ends were fusion spliced together into a single path connected to a silixa ultima sr silixa ltd dts unit operating from inside an air conditioned container the dts data were collected continuously with spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 m and 2 s the 10 cm depth cable was heated actively while the other two cables reported temperature passively this study focuses on the fo sphp data collected from the middle underground fo cable marked in blue in fig 1 over 76 days within the period from march to may 2020 the active 4 5 mm diameter fo cable consisted of 50 µm optical fibers enclosed inside a 2 0 mm stainless steel tube filled with sepigel seppic inc and covered by a polyethylene jacket reinforced with six copper and six stainless steel wires 0 6 mm in diameter each custom made afl telecommunications the conductive elements of the fo cable had a total resistance of 0 01 o m twenty different ec 5 soil moisture stations onset computer corporation were installed along the first 450 m of the fo sphp cable with spacing ranging from 18 to 26 m as shown in fig 1b three stations of those were wired stations that consisted of four ec 5 sensors installed at depths of 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 25 m and connected to an h21 usb hobo micro station data logger the remaining 17 stations were hobonet wireless ec 5 sensors installed at the same depth as the fo sphp cable a microrx2100 cellular station collected the data from the wireless stations and uploaded them to the hobolink cloud services all soil moisture sensors collected measurements every minute throughout the study period the locations of the soil moisture stations along the fo cable were identified by applying an ice bag to the fo cable at those locations and locating the corresponding drop in temperature in the dts measurements in addition undisturbed soil samples were collected from the ec 5 sensor locations to investigate the possible variability in the soil bulk density and texture between those locations 2 2 heating protocol for the active measurements the fo sphp cable transect was divided into four sections of 150 m each and a few spare meters were left outside the soil between the sections to connect the power lines one heat pulse per hour that lasted for 480 s was applied to each of the three sections closest to the dts unit starting from midnight to 7 00 am each day heat pulses were applied at night for safety reasons as this field is used primarily to raise livestock the total applied voltage for each heated section was also limited to 50 v to comply with the safety considerations at the site which resulted in variability in the applied current and power per each heated section as shown in fig 1b the heat pulses were applied using a microfusion power controller control concepts inc controlled by a time activated relay controller ncd inc 2 3 estimation of soil thermal conductivity λ the dts data were firstly calibrated using the controlled temperature of the calibration baths then the influence of ambient temperature was subtracted from the applied heat pulses to extract the variation in temperatures caused solely by the applied heating event the ambient temperature for each heat pulse was estimated by fitting a linear relationship using data from two 600 s intervals one precedes the start of the heat application and the other start after 1800 s from it this approach is suitable to the nature of the heat pulses which were applied overnight when no steep changes in the temporal temperature gradients are expected over the heat pulse duration in fact this ambient temperature determination approach resulted in minimal errors rmse 0 04 ok when tested using data from a night in which no heat pulses were applied the daily average soil thermal conductivity λ corresponding to each 0 25 m section along the transect was then estimated from the slope of the linear relationship between the average change of temperature δ t observed at this location from the seven applied heat pulses v s the logarithm of time t de vries 1952 bristow et al 1994 1 δ t q 4 π λ l n t b where q is the applied heating power and b is the intercept of the fitted line the first few seconds of the heat pulse are highly influenced by the finite radius of the heat source and the contact resistance between the fo cable and the surrounding soil bristow et al 1994 therefore following the approach of bristow et al 1994 the first 10 s from the applied heat pulse were excluded from the fitting while estimating λ 2 4 calibration curves of λ v s θ to establish the calibration curves at the locations of the ec 5 sensors their θ measurements were combined with the λ measurements observed at the closest section of the fo cable to their locations fig 2 a b the majority of the calibration curves followed a similar relationship except for the calibration curves corresponding to stations 10 11 and 18 the different and noisy relationship observed at station 10 was expected as many gopher underground holes were observed next to its location fig 2 c d these holes caused extensive errors in both the fo sphp and the ec 5 measurements therefore it was decided to exclude station 10 on the other hand the relatively different relationships observed at stations 11 and 18 could be attributed to the higher bulk densities observed at these stations in comparison with the other stations fig 3 despite having a similar silt loam texture 2 5 estimation of the θ profiles the traditional approach in which a single calibration curve that represents the whole site was conducted as a baseline several thermal conductivity models were fitted to all the λ θ pairs observed at all the ec 5 sensor locations the côté konrad 2005 model equations 2 and 3 provided the best fit among the tested models and therefore was used to generate the final single calibration curve 2 θ k r n m k r m 1 3 k r λ λ dry λ n λ dry where k r is the kersten number n is the soil porosity m is a tuning parameter λ n and λ dry are the thermal conductivity at saturation and dry moisture conditions respectively the four parameters n m λ n and λ dry were used as fitting parameters while generating the final calibration curve in this study we propose a new methodology to account for the heterogeneity in the soil properties along the fo cable transect using a gp model gp models are stochastic processes that can be used to estimate the posterior error as a function of time or space thus giving temporally or spatially varying information on the variable estimate uncertainties due to observational errors of model error gp models which represent here the gaussian stochastic processes along the dts length can be characterized by only their mean and the covariance function 4 θ g p m x k x i x j where m x is the mean of the predictors x equal to zero after normalizing the predictors and k x i x j is the covariance function between the predictors x i and x j which can take different forms rasmussen and williams 2006 in this study the rational quadratic kernel with no basis function was used 5 k x i x j σ f 2 1 d x i x j 2 2 α l 2 α where d x i x j is the euclidean distance between x i and x j and the three kernel parameters σ f α l which are fitted using the available data the predictors used in the gp model included the distance of the station along the transect the observed λ on that day the average and maximum thermal conductivity observed at that location over the study period also the observed spatially averaged soil moisture on that day the average of soil moisture observed at all the ec 5 stations over the heat pulses period was added as a predictor in addition the observed average ambient temperature was also included as a predictor to account for any variability in λ caused by the temperature differences finally two additional predictors that represent the reduction in λ observed over the first and second days of drainage from the nearly saturated soil conditions reached after a severe storm that occurred on april 18th precipitation 50 mm within 24 h these two predictors were included as they provide information about the possible variations in soil characteristics over the length of the fo transect the ability of the constructed gp models to predict θ at other locations was assessed using cross validation using this approach observations from one station were iteratively left out from the training dataset which was used to optimize the gp covariance parameters and θ from the left out station was used as the validation dataset after the performance of the gp models were validated a new gp model trained using all the data from the non excluded soil moisture stations was used to predict the final θ profiles θ final with the highest possible accuracy the performance of the gp model in estimating θ was compared against the single calibration curve approach i e the côté konrad 2005 model four statistic parameters were used in this comparison namely the root mean square error rmse m 3 m 3 mean bias mbe m 3 m 3 maximum absolute error mae m 3 m 3 and the normalized nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nnse unitless introduced by nossent bauwens 2012 that give a value ranging from zero to one with larger values representing a more efficient model 6 rmse i 1 n θ i θ i 2 n 7 mbe i 1 n θ i θ i n 8 mae m a x θ i θ i 9 nnse 1 1 i 1 n θ i θ i 2 i 1 n θ i θ i 2 where n is the number of days where the ec 5 measurements were available at the station under consideration and θ i and θ i are the predicted soil moisture and the observed measurements using the ec 5 sensors respectively and θ i is the average soil moisture observed at the station under consideration over the whole investigated period 2 6 effect of spatial resolution over the spatial variability of θ the final estimated θ final profiles with the original spatial resolution δ x 0 25 m were used to assess how the spatial variability of θ changed with the mean soil moisture μ θ the spatial variability was characterized using the standard deviation σ θ and coefficient of variation cv for each day as defined in equations 10 12 10 μ θ j i 1 n θ i j n 11 σ θ j 1 n 1 i 1 n θ i j μ θ j 2 12 cv j σ θ j μ θ j where n is the number of measurements included in estimating the statistics θ i j is the soil moisture estimated at location i and over day j the changes in the observed spatial variability in θ at different δ x were also investigated the δ x effect in this study is equivalent to the joint effect of varying the spacing and support scales defined by blöschl and sivapalan 1995 profiles of θ with δ x ranging from 0 5 m to 40 m with interval of 0 25 m were constructed by upscaling the actual observed θ final profiles the upscaling was performed to reach a dataset with a spatial resolution i θ sp i by averaging the θ final measurements over a non overlapping moving window with a width equal i this upscaling technique means that μ θ remains constant regardless of the used δ x for each θ sp i dataset the variability observed at different mean soil moisture states was calculated the empirical equation proposed by famiglietti et al 2008 was used to fit the relationships between cv and σ θ against μ θ using two fitting parameters k 1 and k 2 equation 13 to see if they follow the same patterns observed in previous studies over larger spatial scales 13 cv k 1 e x p k 2 μ θ additionally an empirical equation was proposed and fitted to the data to provide a framework to estimate the ratio of the observed variability parameters at a certain length scale δ x to those observed at δ x 0 25 m σ θ r a t i o and cv ratio a function of μ θ and δ x 2 7 the nrs for different scale extents a bootstrapping technique was used to estimate nrs for accurate estimation of μ θ and σ θ over the spatial extents from 5 m to 350 m each investigated scale extent was represented by 50 replicates obtained by randomly selecting sampling areas with that extent from the θ final profiles for each replicate the error in the estimated μ θ and σ θ corresponding to each number of samples n s was calculated using 104 iterations of subsampling n s samples from the sampling area associated with that replicate from the results the nrs required to estimate μ θ and σ θ within a margin of error of 1 2 and 3 with 95 confidence were computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 gp models validation in comparison with the single calibration curve approach the comparison between the performance of the gp model cross validation and the traditional single calibration curve approaches in predicting the ec 5 measurements at the different stations is presented in fig 4 and the mean statistics are presented in table 1 the gp model managed to reduce the overall error and bias in the predicted θ as it resulted in a mean and standard deviation rmse and mbe of 0 03 0 01 m3m 3 and 0 00 0 03 m3m 3 respectively which is comparable to the accuracy of the ec 5 sensors themselves the single calibration curve approach resulted in higher rmse and mbe of 0 05 0 02 m3m 3 and 0 00 0 05 m3m 3 respectively the gp model also managed to reduce the mae from 0 11 0 04 m3m 3 to 0 07 0 02 m3m 3 and resulted in more accurate overall predictions as can be inferred from the increase of the observed nnse from 0 65 0 24 to 0 72 0 27 in comparison with the traditional single calibration curve approach it should be noted that the gp model predictions presented in fig 4 and its statistics presented in table 1 are based on the validation gp models that excluded the data from the station under consideration from the training dataset on the other hand all the data from the ec 5 stations were included while generating the côté and konrad 2005 single calibration curve this may explain why the single calibration curve approach slightly outperformed the gp model while predicting the stations which were relatively different such as station 3 and to a lower extent at station 15 see fig 4 nevertheless the gp models had better predictive power at all the other stations including stations 11 and 18 which followed a relatively different relationship the final gp model that utilizes the full dataset for training is expected to even have higher predictive power as it will account for all stations another point to consider here is that the predictions from both approaches were compared to the raw θ measured by ec 5 sensors which include their intrinsic errors assumed to be within the range of 0 03 m3m 3 based on manufacturer although some previous studies reported larger errors for the ec 5 sensors in different soil formations fares et al 2016 kanso et al 2020 the gpr model approach is superior to the single calibration curve approach in this regard as it accounts for measurement uncertainty in its training dataset due to its probabilistic nature which leads to less biased θ estimates the final spatiotemporal distribution of θ final estimated from the final gp model which was trained using data from all the non excluded stations are shown in fig 5 the results illustrate the key advantage of the obtained high resolution dts measurements in revealing the details of the spatial variability over a wide range of spatial scales the heterogeneity in the observed reduction on soil moisture following the april 18th severe storm day 53 illustrates the wide variation in the drainage properties across the fo transect 3 2 effect of spatial resolution on the observed spatial variability of θ the relations between c v and σ θ versus μ θ at different scales are presented in fig 6 increasing μ θ led to a reduction on both c v and σ θ the reduction on c v is near exponential and can be adequately represented by equation 13 r2 0 9 which is consistent with previous studies e g brocca et al 2012 brocca et al 2010a famiglietti et al 2008 zarlenga et al 2018 in contrast increases in μ θ from the lowest observed values led to a slight increase in the observed σ θ that peaked at μ θ 0 23 m3m 3 which then decreased slightly at higher μ θ values however the convex upward shape reported by previous studies e g famiglietti et al 2008 could not be confirmed here due to the lack of measurements at lower μ θ values although reductions in the dataset spatial resolution i e increases in δ x did not affect the estimates of μ θ as all the measurements were included in the averaging process it led to reductions in the estimated σ θ and c v the reductions were more pronounced within the range from 0 25 m and 10 m and the reduction rate decreased at higher δ x see fig 6 this rapid reduction in σ θ and c v at δ x 10 m can be attributed to the filtering of the spatial variability structures that occur at micro scales less than 10 m in particular due to local variation in soil properties the vegetation cover and root distribution and micro topography furthermore the shape of the observed relationship between δ x and σ θ r a t i o over different days with similar μ θ were more variable for low observed μ θ values in comparison with near saturated conditions for instance recorded σ θ r a t i o at δ x 40 m for μ θ in the range 0 21 0 22 m3m 3 and 0 37 0 38 m3m 3 were in the range of 0 45 to 0 64 and 0 30 to 0 35 respectively this excessive variability near dry conditions can be attributed to the complex interaction between the different factors inducing the spatial variability and the temporal fluctuation of their dominance over a certain scale on the other hand when the soil is nearly saturated it dampens those spatial differences western et al 2002 this is the first study to our knowledge to report a measurement based continuous characterization of changes of the observed spatial variability over spatial resolutions ranging from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters for different relative saturation states being able to estimate these changes between different spatial resolutions can help in developing more efficient downscaling algorithms for remote sensing and aerial radiometer data currently the model based downscaling algorithms like that used in kaheil et al 2008 use the observed variability at the coarse resolution to initialize the downscaled version of it that has higher resolution although kaheil et al 2008 followed that initialization step with other rearrangement steps and the result was then assimilated with in situ measurements these additional steps will lead to changes in the resulting variability at the higher resolution but there is no guarantee that these changes are indeed accurate and resemble what is observed directly by a remote sensing product with a similar resolution the ability to quantify the changes in the observed variability can provide an additional constraint to the kaheil et al 2008 and other similar algorithms which can lead to higher efficiency in conserving the variability structure across scales in this study an empirical equation was developed to link the observed standard deviation at a certain δ x σ θ δ x to that observed at spatial resolution of 0 25 m σ θ 0 25 as a function of μ θ 14 σ θ r a t i o σ θ δ x σ θ 0 25 β 1 l n δ x 0 23 β 2 15 β 1 3 05 μ θ 2 1 79 μ θ 0 16 16 β 2 9 71 μ θ 2 7 09 μ θ 1 89 the comparison between the observed σ θ r a t i o using the actual θ final profiles and those estimated using equations 14 16 are presented in fig 6 c d the model managed to fit the observed relationship with high r2 0 91 at near saturation conditions and a lower r2 0 81 for the driest μ θ conditions the relatively low r2 values at low μ θ conditions could be attributed to the wide temporal variability in the δ x σ θ r a t i o relationships at low μ θ 3 3 the number of required samples nrs for different scale extents the nrs to measure μ θ and σ θ with different accuracy at different scale extents were estimated from the bootstrapping technique see fig 7 for estimating μ θ the total nrs increases with increasing length scale the corresponding density of measurement per unit meter however was decreasing the nrs to estimate μ θ within 2 and 3 errors respectively were only increasing slightly for scales larger than 50 m suggesting that only minor changes in the spatial variability of θ were observed over spatial scales in the range from 50 to 350 m for estimation of σ θ the nrs increases with scale for scales 100 m and starts to decrease at higher scales the nrs required to estimate σ θ was consistently less than those required for μ θ in all cases the maximum nrs was observed at an intermediate μ θ which indicate that these results are not affected by the lack of measurements at μ θ 0 2 m3m 3 nrs 29 and 14 seems to be sufficient to estimate both μ θ and σ θ at this site over the whole investigated scale extent range with a margin of error of 0 02 m3m 3 and 0 03 m3m 3 respectively these estimates are close to the 18 samples estimated by famiglietti et al 2008 for estimating μ θ over an even larger scale 800 m within the same region in oklahoma our estimates should help in improving the validation protocol of remote sensing and aerial products by providing information about the number of in situ samples required to accurately estimate the mean and standard deviation of θ within an individual pixel which can then be compared against the pixel estimates from the remote sensing products 4 conclusion this study introduced a novel statistical learning approach to account for the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship along the fiber optic transect while calibrating it the new approach relies on constructing a gaussian processes gp model that incorporates different sources of information at the calibration stations namely the point observed λ θ relationships the observed λ statistics the distance along the fo transect and the ambient temperature the gp model validation process revealed that this approach has a higher predictive power in comparison with the traditional single calibration curve approach in addition analysis of the resulting high resolution θ profiles showed that the observed spatial variability of θ decreases when a dataset with a lower δ x is used the reduction in the observed spatial variability of θ was sensitive to the reductions in δ x within the range from 0 25 m to 10 m and the sensitivity decreases at δ x 10 m an empirical equation was fitted to facilitate correcting for changes in the observed spatial variability at the study site as a function of the changes in δ x from 0 25 m to 40 m and μ θ furthermore the high resolution θ profiles were used to estimate the number of required samples nrs to accurately estimate μ θ and σ θ over scales ranging from 5 m to 350 m at the study site the total nrs increased with increasing scale extent the density of measurement per unit meter however was decreasing with increasing scale extent in general 29 and 14 samples were sufficient to estimate both μ θ and σ θ at this site over the scale up to 350 m with a margin of error of 0 02 m3m 3 and 0 03 m3m 3 respectively these accurate nrs estimates can guide the future validation studies of remote sensing products on the minimum number of in situ measurements to achieve a certain accuracy at that site a single one dimensional dts transect was used in this study to characterize all the aforementioned aspects of the θ spatial variability however the one dimensional nature of this transect limits its ability to reflect any directional anisotropy in θ variability that might exist at that site in future investigations this limitation can be addressed by installing multiple multi directional dts transects which can be used to capture and characterize anisotropy and two dimensional variability in addition further studies need to be performed in different regions and over a wider range of spatial scales generalize the estimates developed in this study under different meteorological and topographical conditions the sphp dts systems have the potential to provide unprecedented high resolution soil moisture data that can support a wide variety of applications in order to improve the practical application of these systems further research is needed to find a methodology to optimize the number and locations of the calibration stations in order to reduce the total

3146,hydrologic and isotope mass balance models mbms are useful tools for the simulation and quantitative interpretation of lake water δ18o δl such studies of small open lakes are important because δl may show large responses to weather driven hydrological variability a δl sequence was simulated for three year and five day interval data from taozi lake a small open lake in changsha in the east asian monsoon region of china the mbms performed well with the optimal model explaining 90 of the observed δl variability however it was necessary to parameterize the precipitation input by increasing the lake water depth during heavy precipitation events to capture the observed sharp decreases in δl we found that the mbms using air temperature and the equilibrated atmospheric vapor δ18o δa produced a more negative δl compared to the model using the surface water temperature and the observed δa and that the equilibrated δa was somewhat arbitrary which introduced a large error in the model output a sensitivity test highlighted the importance of the seasonal variability of hydrometeorological and isotopic variables to reproduce the observed δl variability additionally the simulated average δl showed a similar pattern of variation to the meteorological variables shifted by different ratios but for the relative humidity there was only a narrow window within which a realistic δl series could be reproduced our results show that a realistic mbm can be established based on long term observations with implications for studies of hydrologic processes and paleoclimate reconstruction keywords mass balance model stable isotopes lake water evaporation precipitation atmospheric water vapor data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction the stable isotopic ratios of lake water vary with evaporation precipitation and groundwater inputs and with the lake water balance consequently stable isotopes have become widely used proxies in studies of modern lake hydrologic processes and for paleoclimate reconstruction tyler et al 2007 jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 xie et al 2021 several studies have utilized simple regression analysis to develop empirical relationships between hydrometeorological factors and lake water isotopes and the stable isotope information recorded in lake sediments has been used for paleoclimate reconstruction and interpretation based on these empirical relationships wooller et al 2004 hua et al 2019 li et al 2020 based on such studies numerous empirical formulas have been defined which demonstrate the important influences of meteorological factors such as temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed on the seasonal variability of lake water isotopes wooller et al 2004 hua et al 2019 li et al 2020 however an increasing number of studies have revealed the limitations of previous research and recent studies have sought to achieve a more comprehensive interpretation of the factors affecting the stable isotopes of lake water steinman et al 2010 gibson et al 2016 wu et al 2021 in recent years hydrologic and isotope mass balance models mbms based on the comprehensive and systematic monitoring of lake water isotopes have been developed for specific lake systems and have proven to be useful tools for the simulation and quantitative interpretation of lake water isotopes which overcome the limitations of simple regression analysis jones and imbers 2010 steinman and abbott 2013 jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 mass balance modeling quantitatively interprets the factors influencing lake water isotopes based on different input variables such as variations in weather conditions inflowing and outflowing water and catchment size jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 masse dufresne et al 2021 however few mbm studies have been tested using a long temporal lake water sequence and previous studies tended to rely on intermittent lake water sampling over short intervals moreover monthly lake water δ18o sampling with irregular intervals was usually used in previous studies steinman and abbott 2013 jones et al 2016 short interval monitoring and irregular sampling intervals may fail to capture the detailed variations of lake water δ18o and thus they cannot be used to test the concepts behind the interpretation of variations in lake water δ18o jones et al 2016 for example lake water δ18o may change abruptly within a few days during heavy precipitation events and a monthly sampling interval will likely lead to a damped isotopic signal hua et al 2019 although challenging more frequent and regular sampling of lake water as well as of inputs such as precipitation and groundwater is necessary to provide improved simulations of lake water δ18o the stable isotopic ratios of atmospheric vapor δa and temperature are critical input variables needed to calculate the stable isotopic ratios of vapor evaporated from surface water δe additionally lakes may show a predominant water loss by evaporation however δa is not measured in most mbm studies and is obtained by assuming that the atmospheric vapor is in equilibrium with precipitation gibson et al 2008 benettin et al 2018 if there is no precipitation within a modeled time interval δa is determined by linear interpolation between adjacent δa values however a study showed that the isotopic ratios in atmospheric vapor and precipitation are sometimes in a non equilibrium state which can be attributed to strong below cloud secondary evaporation of falling raindrops and the weak evaporation from the underlying surface yao et al 2018 this leads to the δa parameterization method being somewhat arbitrary which may introduce errors in simulations of lake water δ18o gibson et al 2008 benettin et al 2018 xie et al 2021 additionally because evaporation occurs at the water surface the surface water temperature t w provides a better representation of the phase change temperature at the evaporating surface than the air temperature t a andreas 1995 hajidavalloo et al 2010 stull 2011 gibson et al 2016 however as automatic meteorological stations ams are widely used to observe the air temperature i e t a and because it is easier to observe t a than to provide a direct observation of t w the ams observed t a is widely used in the calculation of δe horita et al 2008 however the influences of these factors on the simulation of lake water δ18o are rarely considered which is a potential source of uncertainty in paleohydrologic reconstructions and the interpretation of lake hydrologic processes observational and simulation studies of water isotopes are usually carried out on relatively large lakes and relatively few studies have focused on small lakes and ponds see steinman and abbott 2013 xie et al 2021 small open lakes usually have a small water volume and short residence time and thus there is a large seasonal variability of the lake water δ18o due to the more pronounced influences of precipitation and evaporation steinman and abbott 2013 finger higgens et al 2019 maberly et al 2020 therefore small open lakes may respond very sensitively to changes in the environment and the mass balance modeling of such lakes with their large seasonal variability of lake water δ18o is challenging this study is of taozi lake a small open lake in changsha in south central china we conducted daily sampling of precipitation hourly sampling of atmospheric vapor and five day interval sampling of groundwater and lake water combined with measurements of meteorological factors our records provide a three year time series of lake water and related hydrometeorological components with an unusually high temporal resolution as δ18o was widely used as the proxy indicator in the simulation and quantitative interpretation of modern lake water isotopes e g jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 hua et al 2019 and for paleoclimate reconstruction based on the stable isotope information recorded in lake sediments e g wooller et al 2004 steinman and abbott 2013 we simulated lake water δ18o using an mbm during the period from january 2015 to december 2017 this was consistent with other studies and provided results that were relevant for related studies our specific aims were as follows 1 to establish an mbm to simulate the lake water δ18o of a three year time series from taozi lake 2 to identify the influences of precipitation temperature and atmospheric vapor isotopes parameterization on the simulation of lake water δ18o 3 to test the sensitivity of the mbms and quantify the variations of lake water δ18o with different variables 2 site description lake water sampling was conducted in taozi lake 28 10 59 28 11 05 n and 112 56 47 112 56 49 e which is located in between the yuelu mountains and the xiangjiang river in changsha china fig 1 the area of taozi lake is 0 08 km2 and the average elevation of the lake floor is 27 5 m a s l the mean water depth is 1 5 m the study area is in a typical subtropical monsoon region and the southwest and southeast monsoons prevail in summer and northerly winds prevail in winter thus summers are warm and rainy and winters are cold and dry the average annual air temperature precipitation relative humidity and total evaporation are 17 4 c 1147 mm 72 4 and 902 mm respectively wu et al 2014 taozi lake has a regular roughly rectangular shape and is an artificial lake hua et al 2019 a water quality improvement project in 2010 ended all domestic sewage discharges into the lake the main initial water source of the lake is atmospheric precipitation which is supplemented to some degree by groundwater to prevent the lake from overflowing after heavy rainfall a drainage pipe was excavated on the eastern shore when the water level of the lake reaches 30 2 m the water flows naturally into the xiangjiang river via this channel thus after heavy rainfall a relatively rapid decrease in the lake water depth may occur 3 materials and methods 3 1 meteorological measurements measurements of air temperature precipitation and relative humidity were conducted at the ams of the college of geographic science hunan normal university changsha fig 1 112 56 28 e 28 11 30 n at an altitude of 55 m and 1 km from taozi lake the observatory is adjacent to the yuelu mountains where an ams has existed for ten years 2005 2014 and over the sampling period 2015 2017 of this study both rainfall and snowfall amounts were measured with a tipping bucket the data collection interval for air temperature and relative humidity was 30 min the daily evaporation data are based on the large evaporator model e 601b of yuelu meteorological station in changsha which is provided by the local meteorological department the evaporation recorded by evaporator e 601b is very close to the actual evaporation of small water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs and it reliably represents the amount and temporal variation of evaporation in the study area hua et al 2019 3 2 collection and measurement of water samples precipitation atmospheric vapor groundwater and lake water samples were collected fig 1 from january 2015 to december 2017 groundwater and lake water samples were sampled 216 times at a sampling interval of five days that is sampling was conducted on days 1 6 11 16 21 and 26 of the month and samples had to be obtained on the first day of each month daily precipitation and hourly atmospheric vapor samples were also collected during the sampling period from january 1 2015 to december 31 2017 precipitation was collected at the ams of hunan normal university located at the foot of the yuelu mountains fig 1 according to the precipitation observation specifications formulated by the meteorological department precipitation events with precipitation amount 0 1 mm were sampled at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing time on the precipitation day the precipitation collected at 20 00 of the day and 08 00 of the next day respectively represents the accumulated precipitation of the day 12 h and night 12 h and the sum of the two samplings is recorded as the total precipitation of the day 24 h precipitation samples were collected twice on rainy days to prevent the fractionation of stable isotopes in the precipitation samples caused by evaporation samples from each snowfall event were packed in plastic bags sealed and melted at room temperature the precipitation isotopes of the two samples on one precipitation day were weighted to the mean precipitation based on the precipitation amounts and a total of 410 precipitation isotope values were obtained representing 410 precipitation days both rainwater and snowmelt samples were transferred to clean sealed polyethylene bottles 30 ml for storage in a refrigerator at 0 c the atmospheric vapor samples were measured using an lgr gaseous analyzer model 35ep los gatos research inc usa and the time interval of the atmospheric vapor sampling was 1 h based on off axis integration chamber output spectrum technology oa icos the gaseous analyzer can realize the synchronous measurement of the isotopic ratios and concentration of water vapor at a specific height by placing the air collection pipe at the height of 8 m the gaseous analyzer measured the isotopic ratios and concentration of the collected atmospheric vapor at this height to eliminate the concentration effect of the isotopic ratios in atmospheric vapor during measurements it is necessary to conduct concentration dependent correction of the isotopic ratios in atmospheric vapor that is the atmospheric vapor correction system is used to measure the same standard water sample with a known isotope ratio under different atmospheric vapor concentrations then according to the relationship between the stable isotopic ratios of the standard water sample and the atmospheric vapor concentration the stable isotopic ratios of the measured atmospheric vapor are corrected to the same reference atmospheric vapor concentration according to the built in drift correction system for the atmospheric water vapor isotopes the gaseous analyzer has high measurement accuracy because the drift of the measured value is very small a lake water sampling program with a five day sampling interval was conducted on a suspended platform in the east part of taozi lake 2 5 m from the shore but in relatively deep water fig 1 the water depth of taozi lake was recorded synchronously during the lake water sampling based on the measurement of the distance between the lake surface water and the suspended platform given that the distance from the platform to the lake bottom is known which is 3 15 m the water depths measured during the lake water sampling were mainly used in the analysis the sampling depth of the lake water samples was 0 2 m below the surface which reduced the possible influence of human activity moreover as indicated by the limited spatial variation of the stable isotopic ratios taozi lake is a well mixed water body likely because of the small lake area and water volume hua et al 2019 therefore long term and single point sampling can reliably represent the stable water isotopes of taozi lake and the results support the assumption in the mass balance modeling that the lake water isotopes are relatively uniform the groundwater was represented by creek water which was collected from the slope of the yuelu mountains at a five day interval fig 1 the creek is 1100 m from taozi lake and is fed by soil water and fractured rock aquifer water flow may cease after a prolonged dry interval more detailed descriptions of the sample collection procedures are given in hua et al 2019 the 18o ratio of all samples was analyzed using an lgr 35ep model 35ep los gatos research inc usa the units of the isotopic ratios of the water samples are per mil and the measurement precision for the δ18o of the water samples is 0 2 to correct for potential instrumental drift each autorun consisted of an injection of the standard sample at the beginning and after every four water samples the three standard samples were used according to the stable isotopic ranges of the collected water samples six sequential injections of each sample were applied with the results of the first two injections discarded to avoid sample memory effects and the mean of the last four injections accepted as the final result for measuring natural waters more detailed descriptions of the sample analysis are given in hua et al 2019 3 3 the hydrologic and isotope mass balance models the hydrologic and isotope mass balance of a well mixed lake assuming a constant density of water can be written respectively as 1 dv dt i p q e 2 d δ l v dt δ i i δ q p δ q q δ e e where v is the volume of the lake t is time dv is the change in lake water volume with the time interval dt i is the inflow volume p is the precipitation falling on the lake surface q is the outflow volume e is the vapor evaporated from the surface water of the lake δl δi δp δq and δe are respectively the stable isotopic ratios of lake water inflow water precipitation outflow water and vapor evaporated from surface water for a well mixed lake the outflow water should be consistent with δl i e δl δq taozi lake is an open lake where the inflow is balanced by the evaporation and outflow i e q because taozi lake is an artificial lake and the lake area is relatively stable over time we assumed that the lake area s is constant in which case eq 1 can be substituted into 3 h t h t 1 s i δ t s p δ t s q δ t s e δ t s where ht 1 and ht are the measured lake water depth during the last two samplings and the time step δt is five days eq 3 can be simplified as 4 i δ t q δ t h t h t 1 p δ t e δ t similarly the isotope mass balance equation of lake water is 5 δ l t h t δ l t 1 h t 1 δ i i δ t δ p p δ t δ e e δ t δ q q δ t where δl t 1 and δl t are the lake water isotopic ratios at t 1 and t respectively because there is no perennial surface runoff to taozi lake the inflow includes groundwater and the outflow includes evaporation leakage and pipe drainage because the volumes of i and q are difficult to measure directly i and q were expressed as a combined term i q to simulate δl δl was simulated assuming two scenarios i q 0 and i q 0 6 δ l t δ l t 1 h t 1 δ g i q δ t δ p p δ t δ e e δ t h t i q 0 δ l t δ l t 1 h t 1 δ l t 1 i q δ t δ p p δ t δ e e δ t h t i q 0 where i q 0 and i q 0 represent scenarios in which the inflow volume is larger than and smaller than the outflow volume respectively and the stable isotopic ratios of i q in these two scenarios are δg and δl t 1 respectively 3 4 evaluation indexes of the mass balance models three evaluation indexes the nash efficiency coefficient ens relative bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 were used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the mbms in simulating δl the indexes are respectively calculated as 7 e ns 1 i 1 n δ l i observed δ avg modelled i 1 n δ l i observed δ avg observed 8 pbias i 1 n δ l t observed δ l i modelled i 1 n δ l t observed 9 r 2 i 1 n δ l i observed δ avg observed δ l i modelled δ avg modelled 2 i 1 n δ l i observed δ avg observed i 1 n δ l i modelled δ avg modelled 2 where superscript measured and simulated are the measured and simulated values of δl respectively subscript avg is the average value of δl ens represents the goodness of fit between the measured and the simulated δl and the range of ens is 0 1 the larger the ens the higher the simulated reliability pbias is used to evaluate the differences between the measured and simulated δl with the optimal value pbias is 0 a positive and negative pbias value indicates that the simulated values are respectively higher and lower than the measured values r2 is used to evaluate the consistency of the changing trend of the measured and the simulated δl value sequence when r2 1 the changes in the measured and simulated values are the same moriasi et al 2007 3 5 determination of the stable isotopic ratios of vapor evaporated from lake surface water δe is difficult to measure directly and therefore it is usually calculated using classical evaporation models such as the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 which estimates the combined effects of equilibrium and kinetic isotopic fractionation during the phase transition from liquid water to vapor it is expressed as 10 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where δa represents the stable isotopic ratios of the atmospheric vapor h is the relative humidity around the saturated vapor pressure at the water surface α and ε are the equilibrium fractionation factors and εk is a kinetic fractionation factor the values of α for oxygen can be calculated as a function of air temperature t c majoube 1971 11 ln α 18 o 1 137 10 3 t 2 0 4156 t 2 0667 10 3 the equilibrium isotopic separation between liquid and vapor is then calculated as 12 ε α 1 10 3 the kinetic fractionation factor εk quantifies the isotopic effects during net evaporation associated with the higher diffusivities of isotopic lighter molecules it can be expressed as 13 ε k c k 1 h here the experimentally determined kinetic fractionation parameter ck value of 9 7 for oxygen is used to represent the evaporation conditions of small lakes and ponds based on nine sets of outdoor experimental results xie et al 2021 additionally δa can be obtained by assuming that it is in equilibrium with precipitation and is calculated as 14 δ a δ p ε α where δp represents the weighted average ratio within the time step five days of the mass balance modeling in the absence of a precipitation event between the two lake water sampling periods δa was determined by linear interpolation between the adjacent δa values 3 6 calculation of water temperature at the evaporating surface we used the measured h and t a to calculate t w as in rong 2008 and t w was regarded as the water temperature at the evaporating surface the saturation atmospheric vapor pressure p v moisture content d and enthalpy of air h a can be calculated using the following equations 15 p v 611 2 e 18 678 t a 234 5 t a t a 257 14 16 d 622 h p v 101325 h p v 17 h a 1 01 t a 2500 1 84 t a d eq 15 to 17 can also be used to calculate p v d and h at the water surface based on eq 15 to 17 when the enthalpy of the surface water h w equals the enthalpy of air h a i e h w h a we obtain the following 18 h a h w 1 01 t w 2500 1 84 t w 622 h 611 2 e 18 678 t w 234 5 t w t w 257 14 101325 h 611 2 e 18 678 t w 234 5 t w t w 257 14 to solve eq 18 t w can be calculated using t a and h measured by the ams in this study t w was used in mass balance modeling the calculations in this study including the mass balance modeling the calculation of δa t w and evaluation indexes are relatively simple and were conducted using excel software 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotopic ratios of precipitation atmospheric vapor groundwater and lake water given the five day sampling interval for the lake water and groundwater it is necessary to unify the time step of each input variable in the mass balance modeling this involved converting the 30 min interval for h and t w to five day average data converting the daily p and e into five day accumulated data and converting the hourly δa and daily δp into weighted five day average data based on h and p respectively the time interval of the calculated δe was five days because it was calculated based on δl fig 2 shows the temporal variations of δp δa δg and δl accompanied by meteorological variables and the water depth of taozi lake during the sampling period under the influence of numerous factors such as the source and transport path of atmospheric vapor δp changed substantially over time with δ18o ranging from 17 5 to 6 7 with a precipitation weighted mean of 5 4 and standard deviation sd of 3 4 fig 2c the δp series has a sinusoidal shape with more enriched or depleted stable isotopes in winter and summer respectively δa shows a similar pattern of temporal variation as the precipitation with enriched stable isotopes in summer when t w h and p were higher and depleted stable isotopes in winter when the meteorological conditions were the opposite δa ranged from 28 2 to 1 2 with a mean value of 14 2 the similar temporal variation of δp and δl may be due to the consistency of the water sources and the factors influencing precipitation and atmospheric vapor reflecting the seasonal variability of the large scale regional climate system and atmospheric vapor transport yao et al 2017 tian et al 2020 moreover the δa values were usually lower than the δp values which may be due to the contributions of recent precipitation to the atmospheric water vapor the differences between the δa and δp series were larger in the warm season and smaller in the cold season possibly because of the weak secondary evaporation of raindrops experienced in the cold season yao et al 2017 the input of groundwater and precipitation usually led to a decrease in δl first the groundwater was generally more depleted than the lake water that is δl ranged from 8 0 to 2 0 with a mean value of 4 2 and δg ranged from 8 5 to 4 5 with a mean value of 6 2 second the precipitation showed greater isotopic depletion compared to the lake water with the two series overlapped in some periods fig 2c and 2d for example the lake water depth increased with precipitation inputs especially at the end of june 2016 and 2017 the lake water depth increased from 2 35 m to 2 94 m at the end of june 2016 and from 2 39 m to 5 15 m at the end of june 2017 and the precipitation amounts during the same periods were 246 and 487 mm respectively with respective weighted average δp of 10 2 and 10 6 therefore δl decreased from 3 7 on july 1 2016 to 5 3 on july 6 2016 and from 4 8 on june 26 2017 to 7 9 on july 1 2017 with the occurrence of heavy and isotopically depleted precipitation precipitation and evaporation often demonstrated opposing influences on δl with δl increasing gradually during the period of decreasing lake water depth due to evaporation fig 2 for example during the period of decreasing lake water depth at the end of june 2016 and 2017 fig 2d evaporation was high fig 2b and at the same time the lake water depth decreased rapidly due to water loss via the pipe outlet from taozi lake to the xiangjiang river and δl increased gradually under the influence of evaporation fig 2d in addition the influences of evaporation on the lake water isotopes should be relatively weak in winter as the evaporation was low during this period as the daily evaporation amount kept 5 mm from november to february of the following year which was less than the values in the summer months fig 2b moreover compared to the δp and δa series the isotopic values of δl show a similar but more damped temporal pattern fig 2c and 2d for example the δl series was more positive in winter and spring compared to summer which is consistent with the temporal variation of δp although there were still differences in the seasonal changes between δl and δp therefore the temporal variations of δl were the result of comprehensive hydrometeorological forcing and δl may show transient isotopic responses to the stochastic variability of these forcing factors leng and marshall 2004 hua et al 2019 closed lakes with substantial volumes depths and areas may have a relatively small seasonal variability annual variances of 2 e g tyler et al 2007 mayr et al 2007 pham et al 2009 while small lakes and ponds may show large seasonal variability 7 e g steinman and abbott 2013 shi et al 2014 in this study taozi lake has a shorter residence time than closed or large lakes and thus it has a relatively large seasonal variability i e 6 this can be attributed to the small volume with an area of 0 08 km2 and a mean water depth of 1 5 m of taozi lake and the lake water can drain naturally into the xiangjiang river via the pipe drainage especially after major precipitation events fig 2d according to our previous study which calculated the residence time of various water types in the xiangjiang river basin the yuelu creek water representing the groundwater in this study had a young water fraction fyw of 8 0 younger than 2 6 months xiao et al 2022 the fyw is an estimate of the fraction of runoff components that is younger than a few months and is a more useful metric of basin transit time than the mean transit time because fyw can be reliably determined in heterogeneous and nonstationary basins via analyses of seasonal tracer cycles kirchner 2016 xiao et al 2022 the lake water may have a similar or even higher fyw with the yuelu creek water due to the similar pattern of variation between these two water types and the higher ranges of the lake water δ18o series fig 2d 4 2 mass balance modeling of lake water isotopes the simulation of the five day interval δl series with the mbm based on the hydrometeorological and isotopic observations and the simulated δl provided a good reproduction of the seasonal and inter annual variability against the three year time series of measured δl which duplicated the overall trend of δl fig 3 the simulated δl ranged from 6 2 to 1 9 with a mean value of 3 9 and the values of ens pbias and r2 between the measured and simulated δl sequences were 0 83 7 0 and 0 90 respectively this shows that there was no significant difference between the measured and simulated δl series and that the reliability of the simulated results was high with consistent changes in the trend between the measured and simulated values therefore the mbm was successfully applied to simulate the δl of a small open lake with a large range and seasonal variability of δ18o although the mbm performed well in the simulation of δl several major changes of δl were not captured especially during the abrupt increases in lake water depth after heavy rainfall figs 2 and 3 for example during the intervals of november 26 to december 6 2015 july 1 to 6 2016 and june 26 to july 1 2017 δl decreased from 3 9 to 4 5 from 3 7 to 5 3 and from 4 8 to 7 9 respectively fig 3b these abrupt decreases in δl were associated with heavy precipitation with negative isotopic ratios during these intervals which had weighted five day average δ18o of 14 4 12 0 and 11 3 respectively with the five day accumulated precipitation depths of 52 2 mm 207 7 mm and 301 6 mm respectively however the model underestimated the abrupt fall in δl and overestimated δl during these periods fig 3b which had simulated δ18o values of 3 8 4 3 and 6 2 on december 6 2015 july 6 2016 and july 1 2017 respectively the overestimation of δl may be due to the underestimation of the area contributing to the input of depleted precipitation to taozi lake as shown by the non linear relationship between the increases in precipitation and lake water depth fig 4 first during heavy precipitation events the lake usually receives more water input from beyond the lake surface especially in the three intervals mentioned above when the lake water depth increased by 200 mm 490 mm and 2410 mm respectively and was 3 8 2 4 and 8 0 times higher than the precipitation depth in mm during the same intervals fig 4a second there is a power law relationship between precipitation and lake water depth fig 4b indicating a disproportionately large increase in lake water depth after heavy precipitation the larger area contributing precipitation to taozi lake is mainly associated with the high runoff ratio of the urban ground surface around the lake margin fig 1 the runoff ratio and contribution area may be related to several factors such as the antecedent wetness conditions precipitation intensity and precipitation duration liu et al 2011 schoener and stone 2019 todhunter 2021 thus it is difficult to assess the size of the area that precipitation contributing to taozi lake moreover the area immediately surrounding the lake has an impervious surface cement and asphalt which minimizes any interaction between the precipitation and soil water and the precipitation falling on this surface rapidly drains into the lake due to the flat terrain these factors lead to the amplified influence of precipitation on the lake water volume and δl thus leading to the overestimation of the simulated δl during heavy rainfall events as the relative humidity and air temperature usually increased and decreased during heavy precipitation events respectively fig 2a and the lake water level was usually lower than the height of the drainage pipe fig 2d thus the evaporative was relatively weak fig 2b during heavy precipitation events and the outflow volume through the drainage pipe may be not very high moreover it is hard to assess the catchment area of taozi lake as the catchment area is not a fixed value in the rapid urbanization construction therefore the contribution of precipitation to the lake during heavy precipitation events may be approximately represented by the increases in lake water depth i e δh ht ht 1 which was calculated by the measured lake water depth during the last two samplings to achieve a more accurate simulation when the increase in δh exceeded p p in eq 6 was replaced by δh and the δl sequence obtained by the revised model is shown in fig 5 the p that is replaced by the δh ranged from 0 7 to 301 6 mm and the small p amount replaced by the δh may be due to the high antecedent wetness conditions the simulated δl with the new model ranged from 7 6 to 1 8 with a mean value of 4 1 these values are closer to the measured δl sequence compared with the model that only used p to represent the precipitation input fig 5b the new model improved the ability to capture the abrupt falls in δl during heavy precipitation events fig 5b and 5c which resulted in improved model performance with high ens and r2 and low pbias values 0 92 0 95 and 2 4 respectively this shows that δh in heavy precipitation events when δh exceeds p can be a simple and effective proxy for representing the influence of the precipitation input such a parameterization scheme can avoid incorporating the complex catchment hydrological processes into the simulation of the lake water isotopes therefore the model that combined p and δh is regarded as the optimal model and is used in the following discussion jones et al 2016 simulated the δl of a large lake in the east midlands region of the uk the model explained up to 74 of the measured lake water isotope variability r2 of 0 86 however the monthly monitoring data from this lake was used in the simulation which may have ignored the detailed variations in δl jones et al 2016 in our study the mbms with a shorter time step five days produced a higher r2 compared to that of jones et al 2016 thus indicating a superior model performance based on the observed hydrometeorological and isotopic variables 4 3 effects of air temperature and δa parameterization on the simulated δl t a was generally higher than t w with mean values of 18 3 c and 15 2 c respectively and the differences between t a and t w were greater for smaller values of h fig 6 a these results are consistent with those of stull 2011 in which t w was calculated using an empirical inverse solution and was proportional to h and t a although the ens pbias and r2 values of the model using t a were close to those obtained with the optimal model the simulated δl series using t a was usually more negative than the simulated sequence using t w this is likely related to the fact that higher temperatures may lead to lower α and a more positive δe and thus a more negative δl moreover the evaporation amount in this study was measured using a large evaporator however in previous mbm studies evaporation was often calculated using the penman equation valiantzas 2006 jones et al 2016 pillco zolá et al 2019 in which δe may increase as temperature increases leading to a more negative δl if t a is used in the mbms therefore it is more appropriate to use t w in the mbms to obtain a more realistic simulated δl fig 7 a shows the temporal variation of the weighted five day average δa based on observations and calculations according to eq 14 the average measured and calculated δa were 14 2 and 15 7 with a standard deviation of 3 5 and 3 1 respectively the calculated δa generally showed the same trend and similar values to the measured δa but the opposite pattern of variation and more negative values sometimes occurred during the cold seasons for example the calculated δa values were lower than the measured δa during the interval from january to april 2015 and from august to december 2017 the negative δa obtained from eq 14 during these intervals may be due to the relatively low temperature which leads to higher α and ε additionally yao et al 2018 attributed the cause to the strong evaporative enrichment in falling raindrops and the weak evaporation from the underlying water surface moreover precipitation events during these intervals were relatively rare compared to spring and summer fig 2b and 69 4 of annual precipitation was concentrated in the period from april to september yao et al 2016 therefore the low temperature and rare precipitation events led to the anomalous calculated δa values during these intervals which may introduce a relatively large degree of uncertainty to the mbms also the observed hourly δa was converted to a five day interval which was consistent with that used in the mass balance modeling however the calculated δa based on daily precipitation may produce larger deviations from the observed daily δa than the calculated δa based on the five day interval data leading to a greater degree of uncertainty in the mass balance modeling if a shorter time step e g daily is used during the evaporation processes the light isotopes are preferentially lost from the water body when h and δa are small craig and gordon 1965 saxena 1989 gibson et al 2016 thus more negative δa could lead to more positive δe and thus to a more negative δl fig 7b the models using measured and calculated δa produced closer δl values in the period from april to september fig 7b when the temperature and precipitation were relatively high and intense respectively fig 2a and 2b however the model using calculated δa showed an overall worse performance in the simulation of δl as shown by the lower ens and r2 and the low pbias 0 70 0 77 and 10 3 respectively fig 7b therefore caution is needed when the atmospheric water vapor in equilibrium with local precipitation is applied to obtain δa 4 4 sensitivity tests of the mass balance models to assess the model sensitivity to the hydrometeorological and stable isotopic variables the δl series was simulated by the mbms using different input variables such as the constants e t w p h δp δa δe and δg with three year average values fig 8 and the t w e p and h series with varying time shifts ratios of 0 8 0 85 0 9 1 0 1 05 1 1 1 15 1 2 respectively fig 9 for the models with different variables held constant at three year average values and with the constants t w and h only influencing the calculation of δe thus when t w and h were held constant most of the δl variability was maintained fig 8a and 8b the sensitivity test suggested that in such lakes influenced by evaporation although the constant e had little impact on the simulated δl it resulted in more positive δl in winter and spring fig 8c this may be because the values of e in winter and spring were lower than the three year average of e fig 2b as indicated by the higher pbias the model with constant p as an input variable exported a more positive δl compared with the optimal model especially for heavy precipitation events in which δl fell sharply fig 8d this was related to the fact that the three year average p was far below the five day precipitation amount during heavy precipitation events as indicated by the sharp increases in lake water depth during such events fig 4 for the models with constant stable isotopic variables it is interesting to note that substantial changes in the model output occurred when δp δa and δe were held constant fig 8e 8f and 8 g but the model with constant δg exported almost the same δl series as the optimal model fig 8h there may be three reasons for this first the relatively short term variability in δg around the three year average has little influence on the simulated δl fig 8h this may be related to the fact that the water volumes of i q were less when i q 0 indicating that precipitation was the major water source of taozi lake and that the input from the underground flow pathway to the lake was relatively low second the models with constant δp and δa exported a more negative δl in winter and more positive δl in summer compared with the optimal model fig 8e and 8f this may be due to the seasonal variability of δp and δa which showed more positive and negative isotopic ratios in winter and summer respectively than the three year average values fig 2c and thus the models with constant δp and δa could not reproduce the seasonal variability of δl more importantly δp often decreased during heavy precipitation events due to factors such as the rainout and precipitation amount effects wei et al 2018 le duy et al 2018 thus the model with constant δp and variable p also failed to capture the sharp falls in δl fig 8e which was similar to the constant p model fig 8d third the model with constant δe exported a large deviation from the observed δl series as indicated by the low ens and high pbias values fig 8g which may be due to the large seasonal variability of the calculated δe data not shown these sensitivity tests highlight the importance of seasonal variability and the need for accurate measurement of p e δp δa and δe as the series of meteorological factors such as t w e p and h were shifted by different ratios the simulated δl sequence showed overall increases or decreases along with the changes in the variables fig 9 first δl increased with increases in t w which may be due to the lower α and higher δe as a result of the increasing t w as discussed in section 4 2 above and second e and p influenced the simulated δl by directly affecting the water mass balance i e the precipitation or evaporation water volumes in eq 6 moreover as discussed in section 4 1 above the evaporation and precipitation input generally led to more positive and negative δl respectively and thus the increased and reduced e and p had opposing influences on the simulated δl fig 9b and 9c these sensitivity tests verify the physical plausibility of the mbms in addition the increases in h could lead to the breakdown of the mbms especially for the mbms with h shifted by 1 15 and 1 2 fig 9d which may show relatively high h values close to 100 these mbms showed an unrealistic pattern of the simulated δl series i e the simulated δl would decrease or increase to unrealistic more negative or positive values compared to the optimal model fig 9d this was related to the fact that e would be 0 when h was 100 i e there are no phase change evaporation processes when air reaches saturation and it is unnecessary to calculate δe according to eq 10 this indicated that the values of h have only a narrow window within which to produce a successful model for simulating δl and that the accurate measurement of h in field experiments is important however large uncertainties are involved in the observations of h and thus for paleoclimate reconstruction or future climate projection studies caution is needed under high humidity conditions as the meteorological variables were shifted by different ratios the simulated average δl showed a similar pattern of variation along with the changes in the variables fig 10 for example a 10 shift in t w e p and h caused a shift of average δl of between 0 06 and 0 30 and as would be expected an increase in t w p and h led to more negative δl and an increase in e led to more positive δl this may be due to the linear relationship between the input variables and the simulated δl as indicated by the linear first order equation of the mbm i e eq 6 therefore the impacts of the changes of e on the simulated δl were approximately offset by the opposing but similar changes in t w p and h moreover the average value of the simulated lake water δ18o with h shifted by 1 2 was relatively low with an average value of 5 3 fig 10 this may be due to the anomalously low simulated δl when h was shifted by 1 2 fig 9d in addition the changes in simulated δl between two samplings δl t δl t 1 i e δδl showed similar temporal variations among the models with the metrological variables shifted by the different ratios data not shown and the different models showed very similar average values of δδl which were close to 0 this indicated that the overall shifts of different metrological variables had similar influences on the temporal variations of the lake water isotopes δδl and the stable isotopic characteristics of taozi lake are in a steady state it is noteworthy that t w and p have a relationship with δp and δa i e the temperature effect and precipitation amount effect wei et al 2018 le duy et al 2018 wu and bedaso 2022 and t w and h not only determine δe eq 10 but they also influence e as would be expected a higher e occurs as a result of an increase in t w or a decrease in h valiantzas 2006 jones et al 2016 pillco zolá et al 2019 however the e δp and δa series were determined by field experiments and therefore the interactions among the input variables and the impact of multiple changes in variables on the simulated δl are difficult to disentangle thus the actual variations of δl in the sensitivity tests may be greater and more complex therefore although the measured input variables may lead to improved performance in the simulation of δl the determination of δl responses to seasonal variability requires isotope assisted models which take into account more factors and processes and need to be incorporated in future research our results show that small and open lakes can be reliably simulated based on the mbms with comprehensive and systematic monitoring and the suitable parameterization of isotopic and hydrometeorological variables our findings also emphasize the importance of the accurate measurement of hydrometeorological and isotopic variables for the simulation of lakes that have high seasonal variability especially for lakes in rainy regions with more precipitation signals in lake water isotopes a suitable parameterization to capture the influences of precipitation input on the lake is necessary overall our approach can provide valuable information for the quantitative interpretation of specific lake systems and for interpreting the influence of the factors affecting lake water isotopes with different input variables thus the approach can be used to analyze the effects of weather seasonality on hydrological processes with applications in paleoclimate reconstruction 5 conclusions the stable isotopes of taozi lake a small and open lake in the east asian monsoon region were successfully simulated using the mbms for three years and with a five day time step based on the high frequency sampling of local precipitation atmospheric vapor groundwater and hydrometeorological observations the principal results are as follows 1 the mbms based on these observed variables performed well in simulating δl with the optimal model explaining 90 of the observed δl variability the high values of ens and r2 and low pbias 0 92 0 95 and 2 4 respectively showed that the mbm was capable of simulating δl based on long term observation 2 an optimal model was produced in which δh was substituted for p when δh was higher than p this increased the ability of the mbms to capture the observed sharp falls in δl during heavy precipitation events thus improving the model performance in simulating δl this may be due to the high runoff ratio of the urban ground surface and the precipitation falling on the lakeside which rapidly entered the lake leading to disproportionate δh compared with p during the same interval 3 the use of t a and equilibrated δa may produce a more negative δl compared to the models using t w and the observed δa t w can better represent the phase change temperature and δa in equilibrium with precipitation may be more positive than the observed δa during the cold season when precipitation events are rare and evaporation from the underlying surface is weak thus it is necessary to use t w and observed δa in the mbms to improve the model performance 4 a sensitivity test with constant input variables with three year average values highlighted the importance of seasonal variability and the accurate measurement of p e δp δa and δe also the constants t w h and δg had little impact on the simulated δl because t w and h only influenced the calculation of δe and the water input from the underground flow pathway to taozi lake was relatively less the simulated average δl showed a similar variation to the metrological variables i e t w e p and h shifted by different ratios but there was only a narrow window for h within which a realistic δl series could be produced the impacts of the changes of e on δl are roughly offset by the opposing but similar changes in t w p and h credit authorship contribution statement xiong xiao data curation methodology software writing

3146,hydrologic and isotope mass balance models mbms are useful tools for the simulation and quantitative interpretation of lake water δ18o δl such studies of small open lakes are important because δl may show large responses to weather driven hydrological variability a δl sequence was simulated for three year and five day interval data from taozi lake a small open lake in changsha in the east asian monsoon region of china the mbms performed well with the optimal model explaining 90 of the observed δl variability however it was necessary to parameterize the precipitation input by increasing the lake water depth during heavy precipitation events to capture the observed sharp decreases in δl we found that the mbms using air temperature and the equilibrated atmospheric vapor δ18o δa produced a more negative δl compared to the model using the surface water temperature and the observed δa and that the equilibrated δa was somewhat arbitrary which introduced a large error in the model output a sensitivity test highlighted the importance of the seasonal variability of hydrometeorological and isotopic variables to reproduce the observed δl variability additionally the simulated average δl showed a similar pattern of variation to the meteorological variables shifted by different ratios but for the relative humidity there was only a narrow window within which a realistic δl series could be reproduced our results show that a realistic mbm can be established based on long term observations with implications for studies of hydrologic processes and paleoclimate reconstruction keywords mass balance model stable isotopes lake water evaporation precipitation atmospheric water vapor data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction the stable isotopic ratios of lake water vary with evaporation precipitation and groundwater inputs and with the lake water balance consequently stable isotopes have become widely used proxies in studies of modern lake hydrologic processes and for paleoclimate reconstruction tyler et al 2007 jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 xie et al 2021 several studies have utilized simple regression analysis to develop empirical relationships between hydrometeorological factors and lake water isotopes and the stable isotope information recorded in lake sediments has been used for paleoclimate reconstruction and interpretation based on these empirical relationships wooller et al 2004 hua et al 2019 li et al 2020 based on such studies numerous empirical formulas have been defined which demonstrate the important influences of meteorological factors such as temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed on the seasonal variability of lake water isotopes wooller et al 2004 hua et al 2019 li et al 2020 however an increasing number of studies have revealed the limitations of previous research and recent studies have sought to achieve a more comprehensive interpretation of the factors affecting the stable isotopes of lake water steinman et al 2010 gibson et al 2016 wu et al 2021 in recent years hydrologic and isotope mass balance models mbms based on the comprehensive and systematic monitoring of lake water isotopes have been developed for specific lake systems and have proven to be useful tools for the simulation and quantitative interpretation of lake water isotopes which overcome the limitations of simple regression analysis jones and imbers 2010 steinman and abbott 2013 jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 mass balance modeling quantitatively interprets the factors influencing lake water isotopes based on different input variables such as variations in weather conditions inflowing and outflowing water and catchment size jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 masse dufresne et al 2021 however few mbm studies have been tested using a long temporal lake water sequence and previous studies tended to rely on intermittent lake water sampling over short intervals moreover monthly lake water δ18o sampling with irregular intervals was usually used in previous studies steinman and abbott 2013 jones et al 2016 short interval monitoring and irregular sampling intervals may fail to capture the detailed variations of lake water δ18o and thus they cannot be used to test the concepts behind the interpretation of variations in lake water δ18o jones et al 2016 for example lake water δ18o may change abruptly within a few days during heavy precipitation events and a monthly sampling interval will likely lead to a damped isotopic signal hua et al 2019 although challenging more frequent and regular sampling of lake water as well as of inputs such as precipitation and groundwater is necessary to provide improved simulations of lake water δ18o the stable isotopic ratios of atmospheric vapor δa and temperature are critical input variables needed to calculate the stable isotopic ratios of vapor evaporated from surface water δe additionally lakes may show a predominant water loss by evaporation however δa is not measured in most mbm studies and is obtained by assuming that the atmospheric vapor is in equilibrium with precipitation gibson et al 2008 benettin et al 2018 if there is no precipitation within a modeled time interval δa is determined by linear interpolation between adjacent δa values however a study showed that the isotopic ratios in atmospheric vapor and precipitation are sometimes in a non equilibrium state which can be attributed to strong below cloud secondary evaporation of falling raindrops and the weak evaporation from the underlying surface yao et al 2018 this leads to the δa parameterization method being somewhat arbitrary which may introduce errors in simulations of lake water δ18o gibson et al 2008 benettin et al 2018 xie et al 2021 additionally because evaporation occurs at the water surface the surface water temperature t w provides a better representation of the phase change temperature at the evaporating surface than the air temperature t a andreas 1995 hajidavalloo et al 2010 stull 2011 gibson et al 2016 however as automatic meteorological stations ams are widely used to observe the air temperature i e t a and because it is easier to observe t a than to provide a direct observation of t w the ams observed t a is widely used in the calculation of δe horita et al 2008 however the influences of these factors on the simulation of lake water δ18o are rarely considered which is a potential source of uncertainty in paleohydrologic reconstructions and the interpretation of lake hydrologic processes observational and simulation studies of water isotopes are usually carried out on relatively large lakes and relatively few studies have focused on small lakes and ponds see steinman and abbott 2013 xie et al 2021 small open lakes usually have a small water volume and short residence time and thus there is a large seasonal variability of the lake water δ18o due to the more pronounced influences of precipitation and evaporation steinman and abbott 2013 finger higgens et al 2019 maberly et al 2020 therefore small open lakes may respond very sensitively to changes in the environment and the mass balance modeling of such lakes with their large seasonal variability of lake water δ18o is challenging this study is of taozi lake a small open lake in changsha in south central china we conducted daily sampling of precipitation hourly sampling of atmospheric vapor and five day interval sampling of groundwater and lake water combined with measurements of meteorological factors our records provide a three year time series of lake water and related hydrometeorological components with an unusually high temporal resolution as δ18o was widely used as the proxy indicator in the simulation and quantitative interpretation of modern lake water isotopes e g jones et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 hua et al 2019 and for paleoclimate reconstruction based on the stable isotope information recorded in lake sediments e g wooller et al 2004 steinman and abbott 2013 we simulated lake water δ18o using an mbm during the period from january 2015 to december 2017 this was consistent with other studies and provided results that were relevant for related studies our specific aims were as follows 1 to establish an mbm to simulate the lake water δ18o of a three year time series from taozi lake 2 to identify the influences of precipitation temperature and atmospheric vapor isotopes parameterization on the simulation of lake water δ18o 3 to test the sensitivity of the mbms and quantify the variations of lake water δ18o with different variables 2 site description lake water sampling was conducted in taozi lake 28 10 59 28 11 05 n and 112 56 47 112 56 49 e which is located in between the yuelu mountains and the xiangjiang river in changsha china fig 1 the area of taozi lake is 0 08 km2 and the average elevation of the lake floor is 27 5 m a s l the mean water depth is 1 5 m the study area is in a typical subtropical monsoon region and the southwest and southeast monsoons prevail in summer and northerly winds prevail in winter thus summers are warm and rainy and winters are cold and dry the average annual air temperature precipitation relative humidity and total evaporation are 17 4 c 1147 mm 72 4 and 902 mm respectively wu et al 2014 taozi lake has a regular roughly rectangular shape and is an artificial lake hua et al 2019 a water quality improvement project in 2010 ended all domestic sewage discharges into the lake the main initial water source of the lake is atmospheric precipitation which is supplemented to some degree by groundwater to prevent the lake from overflowing after heavy rainfall a drainage pipe was excavated on the eastern shore when the water level of the lake reaches 30 2 m the water flows naturally into the xiangjiang river via this channel thus after heavy rainfall a relatively rapid decrease in the lake water depth may occur 3 materials and methods 3 1 meteorological measurements measurements of air temperature precipitation and relative humidity were conducted at the ams of the college of geographic science hunan normal university changsha fig 1 112 56 28 e 28 11 30 n at an altitude of 55 m and 1 km from taozi lake the observatory is adjacent to the yuelu mountains where an ams has existed for ten years 2005 2014 and over the sampling period 2015 2017 of this study both rainfall and snowfall amounts were measured with a tipping bucket the data collection interval for air temperature and relative humidity was 30 min the daily evaporation data are based on the large evaporator model e 601b of yuelu meteorological station in changsha which is provided by the local meteorological department the evaporation recorded by evaporator e 601b is very close to the actual evaporation of small water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs and it reliably represents the amount and temporal variation of evaporation in the study area hua et al 2019 3 2 collection and measurement of water samples precipitation atmospheric vapor groundwater and lake water samples were collected fig 1 from january 2015 to december 2017 groundwater and lake water samples were sampled 216 times at a sampling interval of five days that is sampling was conducted on days 1 6 11 16 21 and 26 of the month and samples had to be obtained on the first day of each month daily precipitation and hourly atmospheric vapor samples were also collected during the sampling period from january 1 2015 to december 31 2017 precipitation was collected at the ams of hunan normal university located at the foot of the yuelu mountains fig 1 according to the precipitation observation specifications formulated by the meteorological department precipitation events with precipitation amount 0 1 mm were sampled at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing time on the precipitation day the precipitation collected at 20 00 of the day and 08 00 of the next day respectively represents the accumulated precipitation of the day 12 h and night 12 h and the sum of the two samplings is recorded as the total precipitation of the day 24 h precipitation samples were collected twice on rainy days to prevent the fractionation of stable isotopes in the precipitation samples caused by evaporation samples from each snowfall event were packed in plastic bags sealed and melted at room temperature the precipitation isotopes of the two samples on one precipitation day were weighted to the mean precipitation based on the precipitation amounts and a total of 410 precipitation isotope values were obtained representing 410 precipitation days both rainwater and snowmelt samples were transferred to clean sealed polyethylene bottles 30 ml for storage in a refrigerator at 0 c the atmospheric vapor samples were measured using an lgr gaseous analyzer model 35ep los gatos research inc usa and the time interval of the atmospheric vapor sampling was 1 h based on off axis integration chamber output spectrum technology oa icos the gaseous analyzer can realize the synchronous measurement of the isotopic ratios and concentration of water vapor at a specific height by placing the air collection pipe at the height of 8 m the gaseous analyzer measured the isotopic ratios and concentration of the collected atmospheric vapor at this height to eliminate the concentration effect of the isotopic ratios in atmospheric vapor during measurements it is necessary to conduct concentration dependent correction of the isotopic ratios in atmospheric vapor that is the atmospheric vapor correction system is used to measure the same standard water sample with a known isotope ratio under different atmospheric vapor concentrations then according to the relationship between the stable isotopic ratios of the standard water sample and the atmospheric vapor concentration the stable isotopic ratios of the measured atmospheric vapor are corrected to the same reference atmospheric vapor concentration according to the built in drift correction system for the atmospheric water vapor isotopes the gaseous analyzer has high measurement accuracy because the drift of the measured value is very small a lake water sampling program with a five day sampling interval was conducted on a suspended platform in the east part of taozi lake 2 5 m from the shore but in relatively deep water fig 1 the water depth of taozi lake was recorded synchronously during the lake water sampling based on the measurement of the distance between the lake surface water and the suspended platform given that the distance from the platform to the lake bottom is known which is 3 15 m the water depths measured during the lake water sampling were mainly used in the analysis the sampling depth of the lake water samples was 0 2 m below the surface which reduced the possible influence of human activity moreover as indicated by the limited spatial variation of the stable isotopic ratios taozi lake is a well mixed water body likely because of the small lake area and water volume hua et al 2019 therefore long term and single point sampling can reliably represent the stable water isotopes of taozi lake and the results support the assumption in the mass balance modeling that the lake water isotopes are relatively uniform the groundwater was represented by creek water which was collected from the slope of the yuelu mountains at a five day interval fig 1 the creek is 1100 m from taozi lake and is fed by soil water and fractured rock aquifer water flow may cease after a prolonged dry interval more detailed descriptions of the sample collection procedures are given in hua et al 2019 the 18o ratio of all samples was analyzed using an lgr 35ep model 35ep los gatos research inc usa the units of the isotopic ratios of the water samples are per mil and the measurement precision for the δ18o of the water samples is 0 2 to correct for potential instrumental drift each autorun consisted of an injection of the standard sample at the beginning and after every four water samples the three standard samples were used according to the stable isotopic ranges of the collected water samples six sequential injections of each sample were applied with the results of the first two injections discarded to avoid sample memory effects and the mean of the last four injections accepted as the final result for measuring natural waters more detailed descriptions of the sample analysis are given in hua et al 2019 3 3 the hydrologic and isotope mass balance models the hydrologic and isotope mass balance of a well mixed lake assuming a constant density of water can be written respectively as 1 dv dt i p q e 2 d δ l v dt δ i i δ q p δ q q δ e e where v is the volume of the lake t is time dv is the change in lake water volume with the time interval dt i is the inflow volume p is the precipitation falling on the lake surface q is the outflow volume e is the vapor evaporated from the surface water of the lake δl δi δp δq and δe are respectively the stable isotopic ratios of lake water inflow water precipitation outflow water and vapor evaporated from surface water for a well mixed lake the outflow water should be consistent with δl i e δl δq taozi lake is an open lake where the inflow is balanced by the evaporation and outflow i e q because taozi lake is an artificial lake and the lake area is relatively stable over time we assumed that the lake area s is constant in which case eq 1 can be substituted into 3 h t h t 1 s i δ t s p δ t s q δ t s e δ t s where ht 1 and ht are the measured lake water depth during the last two samplings and the time step δt is five days eq 3 can be simplified as 4 i δ t q δ t h t h t 1 p δ t e δ t similarly the isotope mass balance equation of lake water is 5 δ l t h t δ l t 1 h t 1 δ i i δ t δ p p δ t δ e e δ t δ q q δ t where δl t 1 and δl t are the lake water isotopic ratios at t 1 and t respectively because there is no perennial surface runoff to taozi lake the inflow includes groundwater and the outflow includes evaporation leakage and pipe drainage because the volumes of i and q are difficult to measure directly i and q were expressed as a combined term i q to simulate δl δl was simulated assuming two scenarios i q 0 and i q 0 6 δ

larger than and smaller than the outflow volume respectively and the stable isotopic ratios of i q in these two scenarios are δg and δl t 1 respectively 3 4 evaluation indexes of the mass balance models three evaluation indexes the nash efficiency coefficient ens relative bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 were used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the mbms in simulating δl the indexes are respectively calculated as 7 e ns 1 i 1 n δ l i observed δ avg modelled i 1 n δ l i observed δ avg observed 8 pbias i 1 n δ l t observed δ l i modelled i 1 n δ l

are the measured and simulated values of δl respectively subscript avg is the average value of δl ens represents the goodness of fit between the measured and the simulated δl and the range of ens is 0 1 the larger the ens the higher the simulated reliability pbias is used to evaluate the differences between the measured and simulated δl with the optimal value pbias is 0 a positive and negative pbias value indicates that the simulated values are respectively higher and lower than the measured values r2 is used to evaluate the consistency of the changing trend of the measured and the simulated δl value sequence when r2 1 the changes in the measured and simulated values are the same moriasi et al 2007 3 5 determination of the stable isotopic ratios of vapor evaporated from lake surface water δe is difficult to measure directly and therefore it is usually calculated using classical evaporation models such as the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 which estimates the combined effects of equilibrium and kinetic isotopic fractionation during the phase transition from liquid water to vapor it is expressed as 10 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where δa represents the stable isotopic ratios of the atmospheric vapor h is the relative humidity around the saturated vapor pressure at the water surface α and ε are the equilibrium fractionation factors and εk is a kinetic fractionation factor the values of α for oxygen can be calculated as a function of air temperature t c majoube 1971 11 ln α 18 o 1 137 10 3 t 2 0 4156 t 2 0667 10 3 the equilibrium isotopic separation between liquid and vapor is then calculated as 12 ε α 1 10 3 the kinetic fractionation factor εk quantifies the isotopic effects during net evaporation associated with the higher diffusivities of isotopic lighter molecules it can be expressed as 13 ε k c k 1 h here the experimentally determined kinetic fractionation parameter ck value of 9 7 for oxygen is used to represent the evaporation conditions of small lakes and ponds based on nine sets of outdoor experimental results xie et al 2021 additionally δa can be obtained by assuming that it is in equilibrium with precipitation and is calculated as 14 δ a δ p ε α where δp represents the weighted average ratio within the time step five days of the mass balance modeling in the absence of a precipitation event between the two lake water sampling periods δa was determined by linear interpolation between the adjacent δa values 3 6 calculation of water temperature at the evaporating surface we used the measured h and t a to calculate t w as in rong 2008 and t w was regarded as the water temperature at the evaporating surface the saturation atmospheric vapor pressure p v moisture content d and enthalpy of air h a can be calculated using the following equations 15 p v 611 2 e 18 678 t a 234 5 t a t a 257 14 16 d 622 h p v 101325 h p v 17 h a 1 01 t a 2500 1 84 t a d eq 15 to 17 can also be used to calculate p v d and h at the water surface based on eq 15 to 17 when the enthalpy of the surface water h w equals the enthalpy of air h a i e h w h a we obtain the following 18 h a h w 1 01 t

w was used in mass balance modeling the calculations in this study including the mass balance modeling the calculation of δa t w and evaluation indexes are relatively simple and were conducted using excel software 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotopic ratios of precipitation atmospheric vapor groundwater and lake water given the five day sampling interval for the lake water and groundwater it is necessary to unify the time step of each input variable in the mass balance modeling this involved converting the 30 min interval for h and t w to five day average data converting the daily p and e into five day accumulated data and converting the hourly δa and daily δp into weighted five day average data based on h and p respectively the time interval of the calculated δe was five days because it was calculated based on δl fig 2 shows the temporal variations of δp δa δg and δl accompanied by meteorological variables and the water depth of taozi lake during the sampling period under the influence of numerous factors such as the source and transport path of atmospheric vapor δp changed substantially over time with δ18o ranging from 17 5 to 6 7 with a precipitation weighted mean of 5 4 and standard deviation sd of 3 4 fig 2c the δp series has a sinusoidal shape with more enriched or depleted stable isotopes in winter and summer respectively δa shows a similar pattern of temporal variation as the precipitation with enriched stable isotopes in summer when t w h and p were higher and depleted stable isotopes in winter when the meteorological conditions were the opposite δa ranged from 28 2 to 1 2 with a mean value of 14 2 the similar temporal variation of δp and δl may be due to the consistency of the water sources and the factors influencing precipitation and atmospheric vapor reflecting the seasonal variability of the large scale regional climate system and atmospheric vapor transport yao et al 2017 tian et al 2020 moreover the δa values were usually lower than the δp values which may be due to the contributions of recent precipitation to the atmospheric water vapor the differences between the δa and δp series were larger in the warm season and smaller in the cold season possibly because of the weak secondary evaporation of raindrops experienced in the cold season yao et al 2017 the input of groundwater and precipitation usually led to a decrease in δl first the groundwater was generally more depleted than the lake water that is δl ranged from 8 0 to 2 0 with a mean value of 4 2 and δg ranged from 8 5 to 4 5 with a mean value of 6 2 second the precipitation showed greater isotopic depletion compared to the lake water with the two series overlapped in some periods fig 2c and 2d for example the lake water depth increased with precipitation inputs especially at the end of june 2016 and 2017 the lake water depth increased from 2 35 m to 2 94 m at the end of june 2016 and from 2 39 m to 5 15 m at the end of june 2017 and the precipitation amounts during the same periods were 246 and 487 mm respectively with respective weighted average δp of 10 2 and 10 6 therefore δl decreased from 3 7 on july 1 2016 to 5 3 on july 6 2016 and from 4 8 on june 26 2017 to 7 9 on july 1 2017 with the occurrence of heavy and isotopically depleted precipitation precipitation and evaporation often demonstrated opposing influences on δl with δl increasing gradually during the period of decreasing lake water depth due to evaporation fig 2 for example during the period of decreasing lake water depth at the end of june 2016 and 2017 fig 2d evaporation was high fig 2b and at the same time the lake water depth decreased rapidly due to water loss via the pipe outlet from taozi lake to the xiangjiang river and δl increased gradually under the influence of evaporation fig 2d in addition the influences of evaporation on the lake water isotopes should be relatively weak in winter as the evaporation was low during this period as the daily evaporation amount kept 5 mm from november to february of the following year which was less than the values in the summer months fig 2b moreover compared to the δp and δa series the isotopic values of δl show a similar but more damped temporal pattern fig 2c and 2d for example the δl series was more positive in winter and spring compared to summer which is consistent with the temporal variation of δp although there were still differences in the seasonal changes between δl and δp therefore the temporal variations of δl were the result of comprehensive hydrometeorological forcing and δl may show transient isotopic responses to the stochastic variability of these forcing factors leng and marshall 2004 hua et al 2019 closed lakes with substantial volumes depths and areas may have a relatively small seasonal variability annual variances of 2 e g tyler et al 2007 mayr et al 2007 pham et al 2009 while small lakes and ponds may show large seasonal variability 7 e g steinman and abbott 2013 shi et al 2014 in this study taozi lake has a shorter residence time than closed or large lakes and thus it has a relatively large seasonal variability i e 6 this can be attributed to the small volume with an area of 0 08 km2 and a mean water depth of 1 5 m of taozi lake and the lake water can drain naturally into the xiangjiang river via the pipe drainage especially after major precipitation events fig 2d according to our previous study which calculated the residence time of various water types in the xiangjiang river basin the yuelu creek water representing the groundwater in this study had a young water fraction fyw of 8 0 younger than 2 6 months xiao et al 2022 the fyw is an estimate of the fraction of runoff components that is younger than a few months and is a more useful metric of basin transit time than the mean transit time because fyw can be reliably determined in heterogeneous and nonstationary basins via analyses of seasonal tracer cycles kirchner 2016 xiao et al 2022 the lake water may have a similar or even higher fyw with the yuelu creek water due to the similar pattern of variation between these two water types and the higher ranges of the lake water δ18o series fig 2d 4 2 mass balance modeling of lake water isotopes the simulation of the five day interval δl series with the mbm based on the hydrometeorological and isotopic observations and the simulated δl provided a good reproduction of the seasonal and inter annual variability against the three year time series of measured δl which duplicated the overall trend of δl fig 3 the simulated δl ranged from 6 2 to 1 9 with a mean value of 3 9 and the values of ens pbias and r2 between the measured and simulated δl sequences were 0 83 7 0 and 0 90 respectively this shows that there was no significant difference between the measured and simulated δl series and that the reliability of the simulated results was high with consistent changes in the trend between the measured and simulated values therefore the mbm was successfully applied to simulate the δl of a small open lake with a large range and seasonal variability of δ18o although the mbm performed well in the simulation of δl several major changes of δl were not captured especially during the abrupt increases in lake water depth after heavy rainfall figs 2 and 3 for example during the intervals of november 26 to december 6 2015 july 1 to 6 2016 and june 26 to july 1 2017 δl decreased from 3 9 to 4 5 from 3 7 to 5 3 and from 4 8 to 7 9 respectively fig 3b these abrupt decreases in δl were associated with heavy precipitation with negative isotopic ratios during these intervals which had weighted five day average δ18o of 14 4 12 0 and 11 3 respectively with the five day accumulated precipitation depths of 52 2 mm 207 7 mm and 301 6 mm respectively however the model underestimated the abrupt fall in δl and overestimated δl during these periods fig 3b which had simulated δ18o values of 3 8 4 3 and 6 2 on december 6 2015 july 6 2016 and july 1 2017 respectively the overestimation of δl may be due to the underestimation of the area contributing to the input of depleted precipitation to taozi lake as shown by the non linear relationship between the increases in precipitation and lake water depth fig 4 first during heavy precipitation events the lake usually receives more water input from beyond the lake surface especially in the three intervals mentioned above when the lake water depth increased by 200 mm 490 mm and 2410 mm respectively and was 3 8 2 4 and 8 0 times higher than the precipitation depth in mm during the same intervals fig 4a second there is a power law relationship between precipitation and lake water depth fig 4b indicating a disproportionately large increase in lake water depth after heavy precipitation the larger area contributing precipitation to taozi lake is mainly associated with the high runoff ratio of the urban ground surface around the lake margin fig 1 the runoff ratio and contribution area may be related to several factors such as the antecedent wetness conditions precipitation intensity and precipitation duration liu et al 2011 schoener and stone 2019 todhunter 2021 thus it is difficult to assess the size of the area that precipitation contributing to taozi lake moreover the area immediately surrounding the lake has an impervious surface cement and asphalt which minimizes any interaction between the precipitation and soil water and the precipitation falling on this surface rapidly drains into the lake due to the flat terrain these factors lead to the amplified influence of precipitation on the lake water volume and δl thus leading to the overestimation of the simulated δl during heavy rainfall events as the relative humidity and air temperature usually increased and decreased during heavy precipitation events respectively fig 2a and the lake water level was usually lower than the height of the drainage pipe fig 2d thus the evaporative was relatively weak fig 2b during heavy precipitation events and the outflow volume through the drainage pipe may be not very high moreover it is hard to assess the catchment area of taozi lake as the catchment area is not a fixed value in the rapid urbanization construction therefore the contribution of precipitation to the lake during heavy precipitation events may be approximately represented by the increases in lake water depth i e δh ht ht 1 which was calculated by the measured lake water depth during the last two samplings to achieve a more accurate simulation when the increase in δh exceeded p p in eq 6 was replaced by δh and the δl sequence obtained by the revised model is shown in fig 5 the p that is replaced by the δh ranged from 0 7 to 301 6 mm and the small p amount replaced by the δh may be due to the high antecedent wetness conditions the simulated δl with the new model ranged from 7 6 to 1 8 with a mean value of 4 1 these values are closer to the measured δl sequence compared with the model that only used p to represent the precipitation input fig 5b the new model improved the ability to capture the abrupt falls in δl during heavy precipitation events fig 5b and 5c which resulted in improved model performance with high ens and r2 and low pbias values 0 92 0 95 and 2 4 respectively this shows that δh in heavy precipitation events when δh exceeds p can be a simple and effective proxy for representing the influence of the precipitation input such a parameterization scheme can avoid incorporating the complex catchment hydrological processes into the simulation of the lake water isotopes therefore the model that combined p and δh is regarded as the optimal model and is used in the following discussion jones et al 2016 simulated the δl of a large lake in the east midlands region of the uk the model explained up to 74 of the measured lake water isotope variability r2 of 0 86 however the monthly monitoring data from this lake was used in the simulation which may have ignored the detailed variations in δl jones et al 2016 in our study the mbms with a shorter time step five days produced a higher r2 compared to that of jones et al 2016 thus indicating a superior model performance based on the observed hydrometeorological and isotopic variables 4 3 effects of air temperature and δa parameterization on the simulated δl t a was generally higher than t w with mean values of 18 3 c and 15 2 c respectively and the differences between t a and t w were greater for smaller values of h fig 6 a these results are consistent with those of stull 2011 in which t w was calculated using an empirical inverse solution and was proportional to h and t a although the ens pbias and r2 values of the model using t a were close to those obtained with the optimal model the simulated δl series using t a was usually more negative than the simulated sequence using t w this is likely related to the fact that higher temperatures may lead to lower α and a more positive δe and thus a more negative δl moreover the evaporation amount in this study was measured using a large evaporator however in previous mbm studies evaporation was often calculated using the penman equation valiantzas 2006 jones et al 2016 pillco zolá et al 2019 in which δe may increase as temperature increases leading to a more negative δl if t a is used in the mbms therefore it is more appropriate to use t w in the mbms to obtain a more realistic simulated δl fig 7 a shows the temporal variation of the weighted five day average δa based on observations and calculations according to eq 14 the average measured and calculated δa were 14 2 and 15 7 with a standard deviation of 3 5 and 3 1 respectively the calculated δa generally showed the same trend and similar values to the measured δa but the opposite pattern of variation and more negative values sometimes occurred during the cold seasons for example the calculated δa values were lower than the measured δa during the interval from january to april 2015 and from august to december 2017 the negative δa obtained from eq 14 during these intervals may be due to the relatively low temperature which leads to higher α and ε additionally yao et al 2018 attributed the cause to the strong evaporative enrichment in falling raindrops and the weak evaporation from the underlying water surface moreover precipitation events during these intervals were relatively rare compared to spring and summer fig 2b and 69 4 of annual precipitation was concentrated in the period from april to september yao et al 2016 therefore the low temperature and rare precipitation events led to the anomalous calculated δa values during these intervals which may introduce a relatively large degree of uncertainty to the mbms also the observed hourly δa was converted to a five day interval which was consistent with that used in the mass balance modeling however the calculated δa based on daily precipitation may produce larger deviations from the observed daily δa than the calculated δa based on the five day interval data leading to a greater degree of uncertainty in the mass balance modeling if a shorter time step e g daily is used during the evaporation processes the light isotopes are preferentially lost from the water body when h and δa are small craig and gordon 1965 saxena 1989 gibson et al 2016 thus more negative δa could lead to more positive δe and thus to a more negative δl fig 7b the models using measured and calculated δa produced closer δl values in the period from april to september fig 7b when the temperature and precipitation were relatively high and intense respectively fig 2a and 2b however the model using calculated δa showed an overall worse performance in the simulation of δl as shown by the lower ens and r2 and the low pbias 0 70 0 77 and 10 3 respectively fig 7b therefore caution is needed when the atmospheric water vapor in equilibrium with local precipitation is applied to obtain δa 4 4 sensitivity tests of the mass balance models to assess the model sensitivity to the hydrometeorological and stable isotopic variables the δl series was simulated by the mbms using different input variables such as the constants e t w p h δp δa δe and δg with three year average values fig 8 and the t w e p and h series with varying time shifts ratios of 0 8 0 85 0 9 1 0 1 05 1 1 1 15 1 2 respectively fig 9 for the models with different variables held constant at three year average values and with the constants t w and h only influencing the calculation of δe thus when t w and h were held constant most of the δl variability was maintained fig 8a and 8b the sensitivity test suggested that in such lakes influenced by evaporation although the constant e had little impact on the simulated δl it resulted in more positive δl in winter and spring fig 8c this may be because the values of e in winter and spring were lower than the three year average of e fig 2b as indicated by the higher pbias the model with constant p as an input variable exported a more positive δl compared with the optimal model especially for heavy precipitation events in which δl fell sharply fig 8d this was related to the fact that the three year average p was far below the five day precipitation amount during heavy precipitation events as indicated by the sharp increases in lake water depth during such events fig 4 for the models with constant stable isotopic variables it is interesting to note that substantial changes in the model output occurred when δp δa and δe were held constant fig 8e 8f and 8 g but the model with constant δg exported almost the same δl series as the optimal model fig 8h there may be three reasons for this first the relatively short term variability in δg around the three year average has little influence on the simulated δl fig 8h this may be related to the fact that the water volumes of i q were less when i q 0 indicating that precipitation was the major water source of taozi lake and that the input from the underground flow pathway to the lake was relatively low second the models with constant δp and δa exported a more negative δl in winter and more positive δl in summer compared with the optimal model fig 8e and 8f this may be due to the seasonal variability of δp and δa which showed more positive and negative isotopic ratios in winter and summer respectively than the three year average values fig 2c and thus the models with constant δp and δa could not reproduce the seasonal variability of δl more importantly δp often decreased during heavy precipitation events due to factors such as the rainout and precipitation amount effects wei et al 2018 le duy et al 2018 thus the model with constant δp and variable p also failed to capture the sharp falls in δl fig 8e which was similar to the constant p model fig 8d third the model with constant δe exported a large deviation from the observed δl series as indicated by the low ens and high pbias values fig 8g which may be due to the large seasonal variability of the calculated δe data not shown these sensitivity tests highlight the importance of seasonal variability and the need for accurate measurement of p e δp δa and δe as the series of meteorological factors such as t w e p and h were shifted by different ratios the simulated δl sequence showed overall increases or decreases along with the changes in the variables fig 9 first δl increased with increases in t w which may be due to the lower α and higher δe as a result of the increasing t w as discussed in section 4 2 above and second e and p influenced the simulated δl by directly affecting the water mass balance i e the precipitation or evaporation water volumes in eq 6 moreover as discussed in section 4 1 above the evaporation and precipitation input generally led to more positive and negative δl respectively and thus the increased and reduced e and p had opposing influences on the simulated δl fig 9b and 9c these sensitivity tests verify the physical plausibility of the mbms in addition the increases in h could lead to the breakdown of the mbms especially for the mbms with h shifted by 1 15 and 1 2 fig 9d which may show relatively high h values close to 100 these mbms showed an unrealistic pattern of the simulated δl series i e the simulated δl would decrease or increase to unrealistic more negative or positive values compared to the optimal model fig 9d this was related to the fact that e would be 0 when h was 100 i e there are no phase change evaporation processes when air reaches saturation and it is unnecessary to calculate δe according to eq 10 this indicated that the values of h have only a narrow window within which to produce a successful model for simulating δl and that the accurate measurement of h in field experiments is important however large uncertainties are involved in the observations of h and thus for paleoclimate reconstruction or future climate projection studies caution is needed under high humidity conditions as the meteorological variables were shifted by different ratios the simulated average δl showed a similar pattern of variation along with the changes in the variables fig 10 for example a 10 shift in t w e p and h caused a shift of average δl of between 0 06 and 0 30 and as would be expected an increase in t w p and h led to more negative δl and an increase in e led to more positive δl this may be due to the linear relationship between the input variables and the simulated δl as indicated by the linear first order equation of the mbm i e eq 6 therefore the impacts of the changes of e on the simulated δl were approximately offset by the opposing but similar changes in t w p and h moreover the average value of the simulated lake water δ18o with h shifted by 1 2 was relatively low with an average value of 5 3 fig 10 this may be due to the anomalously low simulated δl when h was shifted by 1 2 fig 9d in addition the changes in simulated δl between two samplings δl t δl t 1 i e δδl showed similar temporal variations among the models with the metrological variables shifted by the different ratios data not shown and the different models showed very similar average values of δδl which were close to 0 this indicated that the overall shifts of different metrological variables had similar influences on the temporal variations of the lake water isotopes δδl and the stable isotopic characteristics of taozi lake are in a steady state it is noteworthy that t w and p have a relationship with δp and δa i e the temperature effect and precipitation amount effect wei et al 2018 le duy et al 2018 wu and bedaso 2022 and t w and h not only determine δe eq 10 but they also influence e as would be expected a higher e occurs as a result of an increase in t w or a decrease in h valiantzas 2006 jones et al 2016 pillco zolá et al 2019 however the e δp and δa series were determined by field experiments and therefore the interactions among the input variables and the impact of multiple changes in variables on the simulated δl are difficult to disentangle thus the actual variations of δl in the sensitivity tests may be greater and more complex therefore although the measured input variables may lead to improved performance in the simulation of δl the determination of δl responses to seasonal variability requires isotope assisted models which take into account more factors and processes and need to be incorporated in future research our results show that small and open lakes can be reliably simulated based on the mbms with comprehensive and systematic monitoring and the suitable parameterization of isotopic and hydrometeorological variables our findings also emphasize the importance of the accurate measurement of hydrometeorological and isotopic variables for the simulation of lakes that have high seasonal variability especially for lakes in rainy regions with more precipitation signals in lake water isotopes a suitable parameterization to capture the influences of precipitation input on the lake is necessary overall our approach can provide valuable information for the quantitative interpretation of specific lake systems and for interpreting the influence of the factors affecting lake water isotopes with different input variables thus the approach can be used to analyze the effects of weather seasonality on hydrological processes with applications in paleoclimate reconstruction 5 conclusions the stable isotopes of taozi lake a small and open lake in the east asian monsoon region were successfully simulated using the mbms for three years and with a five day time step based on the high frequency sampling of local precipitation atmospheric vapor groundwater and hydrometeorological observations the principal results are as follows 1 the mbms based on these observed variables performed well in simulating δl with the optimal model explaining 90 of the observed δl variability the high values of ens and r2 and low pbias 0 92 0 95 and 2 4 respectively showed that the mbm was capable of simulating δl based on long term observation 2 an optimal model was produced in which δh was substituted for p when δh was higher than p this increased the ability of the mbms to capture the observed sharp falls in δl during heavy precipitation events thus improving the model performance in simulating δl this may be due to the high runoff ratio of the urban ground surface and the precipitation falling on the lakeside which rapidly entered the lake leading to disproportionate δh compared with p during the same interval 3 the use of t a and equilibrated δa may produce a more negative δl compared to the models using t w and the observed δa t w can better represent the phase change temperature and δa in equilibrium with precipitation may be more positive than the observed δa during the cold season when precipitation events are rare and evaporation from the underlying surface is weak thus it is necessary to use t w and observed δa in the mbms to improve the model performance 4 a sensitivity test with constant input variables with three year average values highlighted the importance of seasonal variability and the accurate measurement of p e δp δa and δe also the constants t w h and δg had little impact on the simulated δl because t w and h only influenced the calculation of δe and the water input from the underground flow pathway to taozi lake was relatively less the simulated average δl showed a similar variation to the metrological variables i e t w e p and h shifted by different ratios but there was only a narrow window for h within which a realistic δl series could be produced the impacts of the changes of e on δl are roughly offset by the opposing but similar changes in t w p and h credit authorship contribution statement xiong xiao data curation methodology software writing

3147,large scale raft culture a common aquaculture in coastal areas has an important impact on the hydrodynamic and ecological environments of coastal waters due to its water blocking effect the flow resistance of raft culture was formulated by a parameterized model pm to describe the loss of flow momentum based on the classical theory of flow around cylinders using computational fluid dynamics cfd the proposed dimensionless pm took into account the effects of both spacing and submerged length of culture units and the culture density was decomposed into two orthogonal directions along culture unit arrangement the drag coefficient calculated by the pm agreed well with the cfd results to verify the pm s effectiveness the delft3d model with the pm was applied to shenzhen bay of china waters with large scale oyster raft culture compared with the observation the numerical results with the pm agreed better than those without the pm and the results showed that in shenzhen bay the annual average velocity decreased by 23 22 in the culture area while in the nearby channel outside the culture area the annual average velocity increased by 15 65 the model provides a useful tool for scientific management and evaluation for coastal aquaculture and coastal waters keywords parameterized model raft culture drag coefficient shenzhen bay 1 introduction the huge demand for aquatic products is accompanied by the prosperity of the aquaculture industry china is the largest aquaculture country accounting for 58 of the world s aquaculture production while shellfish production accounted for 75 of aquaculture production in china fao 2020 raft culture has been commonly used in shellfish aquaculture in 2019 there were about 465 thousand hectares of raft culture along china s coast including hanging culture and hanging cage culture cfsy 2019 large scale raft culture has brought huge economic benefits at the same time it also caused a lot of obvious environmental and ecological problems such as hydrodynamic weakening newell and richardson 2014 nutrients transportation variation li et al 2018 aggravation of bio deposition in the aquaculture area olivier et al 2020 trigger of green tides hao et al 2020 and other changes in aquatic ecology jiang et al 2019 furthermore in the cultivation area flow attenuation slowed down the transportation of the nutrients and food particles affecting aquatic animals and plants therefore it is of great importance to evaluate the water blocking effect of raft culture for coastal environmental management and ecological disaster prevention and reduction the main effect of raft culture resistance is the attenuation of water flow and a large number of observations and simulation results showed that the velocity of flow through the aquaculture area decreased significantly boyd and heasman 1998 newell and richardson 2014 plew et al 2005 the simulation of flow field in raft culture area could directly display the spatial and temporal changes of attenuation processes grant and bacher 2001 james and o donncha 2019 plew 2011 recent raft culture simulations further focused on the effects of vertical flow structure and aquaculture density the vertical flow structure included additional turbulence and dissipation terms o donncha et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 which is particularly important in the study of estuarine stratification dynamics aquaculture density directly affected the ecological capacity of aquaculture areas and it had a significant impact on hydrodynamic characteristics zhao et al 2017 early observation study found that different aquaculture spacing exerted different flow attenuation effects in the cultivation area boyd and heasman 1998 in recent years aquaculture density was generalized in different forms in the numerical model such as porosity simplification xu and dong 2018 and quantity simplification per unit projected area james and o donncha 2019 however the two independent factors horizontal spacing and vertical submerged length of culture unit are more important than the single factor density in artificial aquaculture because they can generally balance high aquaculture production and the environment effects such as dynamic water blocking effect horizontally and vertically therefore these two factors rather than the single factor density should be considered in the model to simulate the water blocking effect of raft culture in the coastal waters actually the spacing of raft culture and the length of culture unit could be characterized as the aquaculture density in horizontal and vertical dimensions respectively raft culture units representing culture strings could generally be simplified to cylinders with equivalent diameters huai and li 2016 james and o donncha 2019 james et al 2016 o donncha et al 2015 according to the theory of flow around a cylinder the spacing and submerged length had a remarkable effect on the drag coefficient luo et al 1996 sumner 2010 therefore a new parameterized model pm requires comprehensive consideration of the spacing of culture units and submerged lengths which is very important for the macro scale study of the water blocking effect of raft culture the study of water blocking effect of raft culture based on the theory of flow around cylinders can provide a new idea for the accurate simulation of the resistance resulted from raft culture in this study in order to calculate the drag coefficient of raft culture a pm was proposed based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and experimental results of the flow around cylinders the pm could be combined into the shallow water model as a momentum loss term finally the new model with pm was applied to shenzhen bay china where a large number of oysters are cultured and the impact of oyster culture on hydrodynamics in shenzhen bay was evaluated 2 methods the flow resistance of raft culture was formulated by a pm to describe the loss of flow momentum the pm taking into account the effects of spacing and length of culture units at sub grid scale was coupled to the long wave shallow water model to simulate the water blocking process of raft culture in the coastal waters according to the principle of equivalent diameter and length based on the effective blocking section of the culture string the raft culture unit was simplified as a cylinder with diameter d and length l in order to study the effects of spacing and length the flow drag coefficients around single double and multiple cylinders with different arrangements were simulated by cfd model the arrangement of culture units was simplified as two orthogonal directions as shown in fig 1 it is assumed that for the typical artificial aquaculture coastal waters the still water depth under the average low tide level was about 2 0 m the velocity range was 0 2 1 0 m s and the equivalent diameter of aquaculture unit was around 0 10 m then the corresponding reynolds number was about 104 105 according to the theory of flow around a cylinder the influence of cylinder length on the drag coefficient is due to the effect of the free end of the cylinder and this effect is confined to the span of 20 diameter luo et al 1996 so in this example the critical water depth was required to be 2 0 m the scale α is noted as the ratio of the length of the submerged cylinder to the water depth for the tandem and side by side arrangements of double cylinders the ratio of spacing to cylinder diameter is defined as tsr and ssr respectively according to the actual situation a cuboid computational domain with length of 5 0 m width of 1 5 m and height of 2 5 m was designed for the cfd model the domain included a channel with a water depth of 2 0 m and an air room with a height of 0 5 m above the water surface 2 1 cfd modeling cfd model was carried out by ansys fluent 18 2 software ansys inc usa the two dimensional 2d method was applied to simulate the flow around double or multiple cylinders and the effect of spacing on the drag coefficient was investigated the three dimensional 3d method was used to simulate the flow around a submerged cylinder and the effect of raft culture unit length on the drag coefficient was studied the 2d and 3d simulations of flow around a single cylinder were verified by using classical experimental data for a single cylinder the 3d flow around a submerged cylinder with a diameter of 0 10 m was simulated to study the relationship between the ratio α ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 and the drag coefficient the distances from the center of the cylinder to the inlet and outlet of channel were 1 05 m and 3 95 m respectively which were greater than 10 times the diameter of the cylinder the distance to the lateral wall of the channel was 0 75 m which was greater than 10 times the radius of the cylinder to avoid the wall effect the distance from the two ends of the cylinder to the water surface and bottom was 0 02 m to make it suspended in the water the settings of 2d model of flow around cylinders were similar to that of the above 3d model in the horizontal direction the 2d model aimed to study the effects of the spacing of different arrangements of cylinders on the drag coefficient different scenarios of group arrangement of multiple cylinders were investigated such as 4 2 4 8 5 5 tsr ranged from 1 5 to 26 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 16 0 and 26 0 respectively compared with tsr it has little effect on the drag coefficient when ssr is greater than 1 5 alam et al 2003 so the effect of ssr was ignored after the grid independent test the structure grids of 3d model of single cylinder 2d models of double and multiple cylinders were about 390 000 420 000 23 000 33 000 230 000 260 000 depending on the length and spacing of cylinders respectively for 2d and 3d models velocity and pressure were used as boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet respectively the cylinder wall was supposed as a no slip boundary while free slip walls were applied for other walls to reduce the wall effects except that the volume of fluid model was used to simulate free water surface in the 3d model other setups including rng k ε turbulence model and simple algorithm were the same for the 2d and 3d models the time step was 0 01 s the corresponding momentum continuity turbulence equations and numerical schemes can be found in the ansys manual ansys inc usa 2 2 pm for drag coefficient of raft culture based on the results of cfd model a new pm for drag coefficient of raft culture was proposed in the subcritical flow named as comprehensive drag coefficient cdc as shown in fig 1 the culture unit was considered as a cylinder and the arrangement of the units was simplified into two orthogonal directions namely m direction and n direction the angle from the n direction to the x axis is defined as θ cdc was calculated according to eq 1 which was derived from the bridge drag coefficient formula farraday and charlton 1983 considering the effective blocking section spacing and submerged length of raft culture units the effective blocking section was characterized by the effective

cylinders the spacing effect in eq 3 was verified by the simulation of flow around multiple cylinders to test the effectiveness of the modeling process the classical experimental results of sighard f hoerner sighard 1965 sumner sumner 2010 alam et al alam et al 2003 were selected to verify the related cfd simulation results after verification of the cfd modeling process the hydrodynamic simulation of raft culture impact was carried out using cdc eq 1 the resistance of raft culture at the sub grid scale was described as a momentum loss term in the x and y directional momentum equations and the momentum loss term in the cell grid was generally expressed as 5 m ξ c dc u δ x u u 2 v 2 in x d i r e c t i o n m η c dc v δ y v u 2 v 2 in y d i r e c t i o n where u and v are the components of

respectively 2 3 shallow water modeling delft3d https oss deltares nl web delft3d is a world leading 3d modeling suite which can be used to investigate the hydrodynamics of coast delft3d was selected as shallow water hydrodynamic model in which the governing equations include continuity equation and momentum equations delft3d hydrodynamic model combined with the pm of eq 1 5 can be used to simulate the water blocking effect caused by raft culture in the coastal waters the proposed pm was expressed as a momentum loss term in the momentum equation in delft3d hydrodynamic model raft culture in china is almost all over the coastal areas from 2013 to 2019 the production increased by 26 cfsy 2013 2019 as shown in fig 2 b shenzhen bay one of the typical raft culture areas in china was selected to verify the proposed parameterized model as shown in fig 2d half of the main channel was occupied by oyster raft culture the culture unit submerged in water and hung in floating raft could be simplified as a cylinder referring to the actual situation of shenzhen bay the mean diameter of the culture units was about 0 10 m and the mean spacing was about 0 40 m i e ssr tsr 4 4 the simplified arrangement of the culture units is shown in fig 1 shenzhen bay is located in the east of the pearl river estuary in china fig 2 the bay is characterized as a shallow and irregular semidiurnal tidal system with an average water depth of 2 90 m and a mean tidal range of 1 37 m pearl river estuary and shenzhen bay were included in the hydrodynamic model to reduce the boundary influence fig 2c curvilinear orthogonal coordinates were used and a total of about 7350 structure girds were constructed with a resolution of about 100 m to 300 m in shenzhen bay the boundary conditions on the open boundaries op1 op2 and op3 were given by the observed hourly tide level from hong kong observatory hko the monthly observed river fluxes at the boundary op4 were given from the observation of the meteorological bureau of shenzhen municipality of china mbsm the monthly salinity and temperature on the open boundaries were given based on the environmental protection department of hong kong hkepd the other 14 rivers and 13 discharge outlets red dots in fig 2d were set as discharge boundaries and the flux data were obtained from the sewage treatment plants in shenzhen hkepd and references tang et al 2016 tang et al 2014 hydraulic retention time hrt is an important indicator for water quality management to calculate the average hrt in shenzhen bay 60 000 particles were released from the mouth of shenzhen river and the trajectory of each particle with tide in shenzhen bay was simulated the influence of oyster raft culture on the hydrodynamics of shenzhen bay was discussed and evaluated according to the hrt based on the numerical results of the model the annual velocity distribution in shenzhen bay was analyzed using the empirical orthogonal function eof method the first eof mode e1 was selected to compare the distribution of flow variation with and without pm which could explain the long term impact of the culture area on the hydrodynamics 3 results 3 1 cfd verification the simulated c d of flow around a single cylinder fig 3 a was verified using the classic experimental data sighard 1965 the 2d and 3d simulation results c d agreed well with the experimental values and the errors were 4 39 and 6 95 respectively for the flow around a single cylinder the critical point of α was 0 60 fig 3b below the point cdα was relatively small and increased linearly with the increase of α above the point cdα showed a quadratic increase with the α and it was mainly caused by the bottom boundary the fitting equation of cdα and α was given as follows c d α 0 789 α 0 002 r 2 0 998 α 0 6 c d α 1 940 α 2 1 393 α 0 616 r 2 0 990 α 0 6 for the flow around double cylinders as shown in fig 3c the relationship between cdtan and tsr of double cylinders was summarized as follows the critical point of tsr was 3 which was close to the experimental study alam et al 2003 when tsr was lower than 3 the upstream drag coefficient decreased with the increase of tsr and the downstream drag coefficient remained negative when tsr was greater than 3 the drag coefficient increased rapidly with the increase of tsr for the flow around multiple cylinders eq 2 for estimating the mean drag coefficient was established based on the spacing effect eq 3 and length effect eq 4 the effects of spacing and submerged length were expressed as spacing influence factor b and length influence factor lα respectively both of which are dimensionless variables spacing impact is very important for the drag coefficient calculation of multiple cylinders to verify the effectiveness of spacing impact estimation three scenarios were arranged to calculate the drag coefficient based on the cfd models the three scenarios included one equal spacing scenario ssr tsr 4 4 fig 3e and two unequal spacing scenarios ssr tsr 4 2 fig 3d and 4 8 fig 3f the drag coefficient of the first row was the largest close to 1 2 the drag coefficients of the rear four rows fluctuated around the average value of 0 34 fig 3d 0 36 fig 3e and 0 51 fig 3f respectively which were much lower than that of the first row since the last four rows of cylinders were completely affected by the tandem spacing the average drag coefficients of the last four rows were selected to estimate the mean drag coefficient of the flow around multiple cylinders for the equal spacing ssr tsr 4 4 the simulated mean cd 0 36 based on the cfd model was very close to the one of pm 0 37 using eqs 2 3 in the case of unequal spacing ssr tsr 4 2 or 4 8 the simulated mean cd of 0 34 or 0 51 from the cfd model was within the estimated lower 0 02 or 0 37 and upper limits 0 37 or 0 64 from the pm using eqs 2 3 overall the above results indicated that the pm eqs 2 3 could provide the mean drag coefficient of the flow around multiple cylinders accurately 3 2 shallow water model verification hydrological verification of the model included tidal level current temperature and salinity the hourly tide data observed at two tide gauge stations tsim bei tsui tbt and chek lap kok clk were obtained from the hko the monthly temperature and salinity observation data at dm1 5 were from the hkepd the flow velocity measured at three points 1 3 near the raft culture zone in september 2016 was used to verify the current all observation stations are shown in fig 2d the magnitude and phase of water level fluctuation calculated by the delft3d model were consistent with the observation as shown in fig 4 the average errors of tide level at tbt and clk stations were 0 11 m and 0 07 m respectively the average errors of temperature and salinity were less than 8 0 table 1 respectively the computed velocity agreed well with the observation fig 4 the mean errors of speed and direction were 0 089 m s and 22 28 table 2 respectively the verification results showed that the model was reliable indicating that the established numerical hydrodynamic model could well simulate the hydrodynamic process in shenzhen bay compared with the simulation without considering the pm the numerical results showed that using the proposed pm the calculated tide levels were almost the same the difference was less than 0 01 m as shown in fig 4a but velocity at all three observation points were improved compared with observation table 2 fig 4b g the mean mae rmse errors of speed and direction decreased from 0 077 0 103 m s to 0 069 0 089 m s and 17 72 22 87 to 17 09 22 28 respectively the comparison of the model results showed that the current calculated using the proposed pm could better reflect the real situation of the coastal waters with oyster raft culture in shenzhen bay in addition to the verification period the model simulated the tidal process of shenzhen bay in the entire year of 2016 with and without the pm the numerical results showed that the velocity difference between using pm and not using pm of each tide process whether it was flood or ebb were consistent with those during the verification period 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and reliability of the pm based on the results of the cfd models the pm eqs 1 4 was proposed to calculate the drag coefficient of raft culture in coastal waters in the cfd models the simulated drag coefficients of flow around a single cylinder and double tandem cylinders were verified through previous experimental study alam et al 2003 sighard 1965 the drag coefficient had a critical value at the spacing ratio tsr of 3 fig 3c alam et al 2003 which might be the key point to differential reattachment regime and co shedding regime sumner 2010 at the reattachment regime the drag coefficient decreased with the increase of tsr and the downstream drag coefficient remained negative at the co shedding regime the coefficient increased rapidly with the increase of tsr until a stable value also the pm was verified through the drag coefficient of the flow around multiple cylinders in different arrangements such as equal spacing fig 3e and unequal spacing fig 3d f since the pm decomposed the drag effect in two orthogonal directions paralleled and perpendicular to the main flow direction it could estimate the upper and lower limits of cd therefore a range of cd was obtained using the pm instead of a single value using conventional cfd simulation which has more advantages and flexibility in practical engineering applications because there are some uncertainties in the flow resistance of the actual culture units such as the changing direction of current the surface roughness of raft culture units and the difference from the cylinder with the same equivalent diameter the pm took into account the effects of the spacing eq 3 and submerged length eq 4 of raft culture units at the sub grid scale to simulate the water blocking effect of raft culture in the coastal waters in fact these two factors could evaluate the horizontal and vertical culture density in coastal waters with artificial aquaculture they were expressed as spacing influence factor b and length influence factor lα both of which were dimensionless variables therefore the pm was a dimensionless model which eliminated the dimensional influence of independent variables and could have wider applicability 4 2 effect of raft culture on hydrodynamics the direct influence of raft culture on hydrodynamics is current velocity change through the analysis of the 2d flow field in the entire year of 2016 the results showed that the first eof mode explained 90 91 of the variance of velocity in shenzhen bay without oyster raft culture it showed that the spatial distribution of flow velocity was relatively uniform in shenzhen bay without raft culture fig 5 b compared with the situations with and without pm the first eof mode explained 58 04 of the variance of velocity difference indicating shenzhen bay had obvious flow increase area non culture zone and flow decrease area culture zone after oyster raft culture fig 5a at the three comparison points black dots in fig 5b in the raft culture zone the numerical flow of the model with pm was less than that of the model without pm also the results showed that the flow attenuation was intensified along the raft culture from upstream to downstream with the annual mean velocity decrease of 17 94 24 99 and 26 73 at the three points and 23 22 on average while the annual average velocity increased by 15 65 at three observation points outside the culture area the range of flow attenuation was similar to that of previous coastal farming observation plew et al 2005 the above comparison results indicated that in the waters with aquaculture areas the hydrodynamics in the aquaculture area slowed down significantly while the flow of the channel nearby the aquaculture area increased the flow distribution from the model with the pm was more reasonable than that of previous study zhang and mao 2015 in which the model did not consider the effect of oyster raft culture if we take a look at flow velocity of a typical complete 13 hour cycle in dry season and rainy seasons for example january 24 dry season and june 5 rainy season the flow velocity changed significantly once the pm was considered the velocity decrease in the rainy season 22 3 in fig 5d was greater than that in the dry season 15 8 in fig 5c in the raft culture zone this is because the upstream runoff was larger in rainy season and the hydrodynamics in the bay was stronger so the water blocking effect of the aquaculture area was more obvious comparison of flow velocity at the three observation points fig 4b g showed that the hydrodynamic accuracy of the model with pm was improved table 2 since these three observation points are located outside the culture area the numerical results showed that the flow velocity of the model with pm was greater than that without pm therefore if the water blocking effect of aquaculture was not considered in the shallow water hydrodynamic model the velocity in the culture area would be greatly overestimated while the velocity in the nearby channel outside the culture area would be greatly underestimated 4 3 implication of raft culture on environment hydrodynamic changes will affect the transport capacity of substances thus acting on the water quality hrt can be used as an index of material transport capacity the hrt calculated by the model with pm was 25 34 d which was 0 30 d longer than that without pm the main migration trajectory of particles was similar to that of previous study wan et al 2014 after oyster culture in shenzhen bay the hrt changed little because the increase of flow velocity in the main channel in the non culture area caused the particles moving fast and the hrt became shorter while the flow attenuation in the raft culture area caused the particles moving slowly and the hrt became longer this might be the cause of sediment deposition in the raft culture area zhang and mao 2015 aquaculture production depends on aquaculture density which will affect coastal hydrodynamics and water environment how to balance the contradiction is of great importance to aquaculture industry and coastal management take two arrangements of aquaculture density ssr tsr 4 4 and 4 8 in shenzhen bay as an example the hrt in 4 8 case increased by 0 97 d a little longer than that in 4 4 case present situation under the aquaculture area of the same size and location it was different from the general understanding that the drag of raft culture decreased with the increase of spacing in fact when the tsr was between 3 and 7 the drag coefficient increased rapidly with the increase of spacing fig 3c which was also validated by the cfd models of the flow around multiple cylinders the average drag coefficients were 0 36 and 0 51 for the case ssr tsr 4 4 fig 3e and 4 8 fig 3f respectively therefore from the perspective of water blocking in addition to the area and location the artificial aquaculture with appropriate spacing in coastal areas is very important in recent years in addition to production artificial aquaculture has attracted more and more attentions due to its huge environmental and ecological benefits such as carbon fixation graniero et al 2021 eutrophication control liu et al 2021 and biodiversity restoration theuerkauf et al 2022 the hydrodynamic model with the pm could be used as scientific tool to guide the reasonable layout of aquaculture density including the spacing and length of culture units and evaluate its impact on water quality in coastal waters also the model is expected to be applied to the study for canopy resistance of flow in coastal waters because the canopy was assumed as suspended aquatic plants which was commonly approximated as cylinders o donncha et al 2015 therefore the model has great application potential in coastal ecological management 5 conclusions a novel dimensionless parameterized model was proposed to calculate the drag coefficient of raft culture which considered the spacing and length of internal culture units the new pm took into account the spacing effect in two orthogonal directions so it could provide a reference range of drag coefficient according to the flow direction which was validated and agreed well with the results of cfd models delft3d hydrodynamic model combined with the pm was employed to successfully simulate the flow of shenzhen bay with large scale oyster raft culture the numerical results showed that in shenzhen bay the annual average velocity decreased by 23 22 in the culture area while in the nearby channel outside the culture area the annual average velocity increased by 15 65 the new pm model could well evaluate the hydrodynamic effect on hrt of different layout of raft culture the hrt of shenzhen bay calculated by the model with pm was 25 34 d which was a little longer than that without pm credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyu lei conceptualization

3147,large scale raft culture a common aquaculture in coastal areas has an important impact on the hydrodynamic and ecological environments of coastal waters due to its water blocking effect the flow resistance of raft culture was formulated by a parameterized model pm to describe the loss of flow momentum based on the classical theory of flow around cylinders using computational fluid dynamics cfd the proposed dimensionless pm took into account the effects of both spacing and submerged length of culture units and the culture density was decomposed into two orthogonal directions along culture unit arrangement the drag coefficient calculated by the pm agreed well with the cfd results to verify the pm s effectiveness the delft3d model with the pm was applied to shenzhen bay of china waters with large scale oyster raft culture compared with the observation the numerical results with the pm agreed better than those without the pm and the results showed that in shenzhen bay the annual average velocity decreased by 23 22 in the culture area while in the nearby channel outside the culture area the annual average velocity increased by 15 65 the model provides a useful tool for scientific management and evaluation for coastal aquaculture and coastal waters keywords parameterized model raft culture drag coefficient shenzhen bay 1 introduction the huge demand for aquatic products is accompanied by the prosperity of the aquaculture industry china is the largest aquaculture country accounting for 58 of the world s aquaculture production while shellfish production accounted for 75 of aquaculture production in china fao 2020 raft culture has been commonly used in shellfish aquaculture in 2019 there were about 465 thousand hectares of raft culture along china s coast including hanging culture and hanging cage culture cfsy 2019 large scale raft culture has brought huge economic benefits at the same time it also caused a lot of obvious environmental and ecological problems such as hydrodynamic weakening newell and richardson 2014 nutrients transportation variation li et al 2018 aggravation of bio deposition in the aquaculture area olivier et al 2020 trigger of green tides hao et al 2020 and other changes in aquatic ecology jiang et al 2019 furthermore in the cultivation area flow attenuation slowed down the transportation of the nutrients and food particles affecting aquatic animals and plants therefore it is of great importance to evaluate the water blocking effect of raft culture for coastal environmental management and ecological disaster prevention and reduction the main effect of raft culture resistance is the attenuation of water flow and a large number of observations and simulation results showed that the velocity of flow through the aquaculture area decreased significantly boyd and heasman 1998 newell and richardson 2014 plew et al 2005 the simulation of flow field in raft culture area could directly display the spatial and temporal changes of attenuation processes grant and bacher 2001 james and o donncha 2019 plew 2011 recent raft culture simulations further focused on the effects of vertical flow structure and aquaculture density the vertical flow structure included additional turbulence and dissipation terms o donncha et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 which is particularly important in the study of estuarine stratification dynamics aquaculture density directly affected the ecological capacity of aquaculture areas and it had a significant impact on hydrodynamic characteristics zhao et al 2017 early observation study found that different aquaculture spacing exerted different flow attenuation effects in the cultivation area boyd and heasman 1998 in recent years aquaculture density was generalized in different forms in the numerical model such as porosity simplification xu and dong 2018 and quantity simplification per unit projected area james and o donncha 2019 however the two independent factors horizontal spacing and vertical submerged length of culture unit are more important than the single factor density in artificial aquaculture because they can generally balance high aquaculture production and the environment effects such as dynamic water blocking effect horizontally and vertically therefore these two factors rather than the single factor density should be considered in the model to simulate the water blocking effect of raft culture in the coastal waters actually the spacing of raft culture and the length of culture unit could be characterized as the aquaculture density in horizontal and vertical dimensions respectively raft culture units representing culture strings could generally be simplified to cylinders with equivalent diameters huai and li 2016 james and o donncha 2019 james et al 2016 o donncha et al 2015 according to the theory of flow around a cylinder the spacing and submerged length had a remarkable effect on the drag coefficient luo et al 1996 sumner 2010 therefore a new parameterized model pm requires comprehensive consideration of the spacing of culture units and submerged lengths which is very important for the macro scale study of the water blocking effect of raft culture the study of water blocking effect of raft culture based on the theory of flow around cylinders can provide a new idea for the accurate simulation of the resistance resulted from raft culture in this study in order to calculate the drag coefficient of raft culture a pm was proposed based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and experimental results of the flow around cylinders the pm could be combined into the shallow water model as a momentum loss term finally the new model with pm was applied to shenzhen bay china where a large number of oysters are cultured and the impact of oyster culture on hydrodynamics in shenzhen bay was evaluated 2 methods the flow resistance of raft culture was formulated by a pm to describe the loss of flow momentum the pm taking into account the effects of spacing and length of culture units at sub grid scale was coupled to the long wave shallow water model to simulate the water blocking process of raft culture in the coastal waters according to the principle of equivalent diameter and length based on the effective blocking section of the culture string the raft culture unit was simplified as a cylinder with diameter d and length l in order to study the effects of spacing and length the flow drag coefficients around single double and multiple cylinders with different arrangements were simulated by cfd model the arrangement of culture units was simplified as two orthogonal directions as shown in fig 1 it is assumed that for the typical artificial aquaculture coastal waters the still water depth under the average low tide level was about 2 0 m the velocity range was 0 2 1 0 m s and the equivalent diameter of aquaculture unit was around 0 10 m then the corresponding reynolds number was about 104 105 according to the theory of flow around a cylinder the influence of cylinder length on the drag coefficient is due to the effect of the free end of the cylinder and this effect is confined to the span of 20 diameter luo et al 1996 so in this example the critical water depth was required to be 2 0 m the scale α is noted as the ratio of the length of the submerged cylinder to the water depth for the tandem and side by side arrangements of double cylinders the ratio of spacing to cylinder diameter is defined as tsr and ssr respectively according to the actual situation a cuboid computational domain with length of 5 0 m width of 1 5 m and height of 2 5 m was designed for the cfd model the domain included a channel with a water depth of 2 0 m and an air room with a height of 0 5 m above the water surface 2 1 cfd modeling cfd model was carried out by ansys fluent 18 2 software ansys inc usa the two dimensional 2d method was applied to simulate the flow around double or multiple cylinders and the effect of spacing on the drag coefficient was investigated the three dimensional 3d method was used to simulate the flow around a submerged cylinder and the effect of raft culture unit length on the drag coefficient was studied the 2d and 3d simulations of flow around a single cylinder were verified by using classical experimental data for a single cylinder the 3d flow around a submerged cylinder with a diameter of 0 10 m was simulated to study the relationship between the ratio α ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 and the drag coefficient the distances from the center of the cylinder to the inlet and outlet of channel were 1 05 m and 3 95 m respectively which were greater than 10 times the diameter of the cylinder the distance to the lateral wall of the channel was 0 75 m which was greater than 10 times the radius of the cylinder to avoid the wall effect the distance from the two ends of the cylinder to the water surface and bottom was 0 02 m to make it suspended in the water the settings of 2d model of flow around cylinders were similar to that of the above 3d model in the horizontal direction the 2d model aimed to study the effects of the spacing of different arrangements of cylinders on the drag coefficient different scenarios of group arrangement of multiple cylinders were investigated such as 4 2 4 8 5 5 tsr ranged from 1 5 to 26 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 16 0 and 26 0 respectively compared with tsr it has little effect on the drag coefficient when ssr is greater than 1 5 alam et al 2003 so the effect of ssr was ignored after the grid independent test the structure grids of 3d model of single cylinder 2d models of double and multiple cylinders were about 390 000 420 000 23 000 33 000 230 000 260 000 depending on the length and spacing of cylinders respectively for 2d and 3d models velocity and pressure were used as boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet respectively the cylinder wall was supposed as a no slip boundary while free slip walls were applied for other walls to reduce the wall effects except that the volume of fluid model was used to simulate free water surface in the 3d model other setups including rng k ε turbulence model and simple algorithm were the same for the 2d and 3d models the time step was 0 01 s the corresponding momentum continuity turbulence equations and numerical schemes can be found in the ansys manual ansys inc usa 2 2 pm for drag coefficient of raft culture based on the results of cfd model a new pm for drag coefficient of raft culture was proposed in the subcritical flow named as comprehensive drag coefficient cdc as shown in fig 1 the culture unit was considered as a cylinder and the arrangement of the units was simplified into two orthogonal

respectively 2 3 shallow water modeling delft3d https oss deltares nl web delft3d is a world leading 3d modeling suite which can be used to investigate the hydrodynamics of coast delft3d was selected as shallow water hydrodynamic model in which the governing equations include continuity equation and momentum equations delft3d hydrodynamic model combined with the pm of eq 1 5 can be used to simulate the water blocking effect caused by raft culture in the coastal waters the proposed pm was expressed as a momentum loss term in the momentum equation in delft3d hydrodynamic model raft culture in china is almost all over the coastal areas from 2013 to 2019 the production increased by 26 cfsy 2013 2019 as shown in fig 2 b shenzhen bay one of the typical raft culture areas in china was selected to verify the proposed parameterized model as shown in fig 2d half of the main channel was occupied by oyster raft culture the culture unit submerged in water and hung in floating raft could be simplified as a cylinder referring to the actual situation of shenzhen bay the mean diameter of the culture units was about 0 10 m and the mean spacing was about 0 40 m i e ssr tsr 4 4 the simplified arrangement of the culture units is shown in fig 1 shenzhen bay is located in the east of the pearl river estuary in china fig 2 the bay is characterized as a shallow and irregular semidiurnal tidal system with an average water depth of 2 90 m and a mean tidal range of 1 37 m pearl river estuary and shenzhen bay were included in the hydrodynamic model to reduce the boundary influence fig 2c curvilinear orthogonal coordinates were used and a total of about 7350 structure girds were constructed with a resolution of about 100 m to 300 m in shenzhen bay the boundary conditions on the open boundaries op1 op2 and op3 were given by the observed hourly tide level from hong kong observatory hko the monthly observed river fluxes at the boundary op4 were given from the observation of the meteorological bureau of shenzhen municipality of china mbsm the monthly salinity and temperature on the open boundaries were given based on the environmental protection department of hong kong hkepd the other 14 rivers and 13 discharge outlets red dots in fig 2d were set as discharge boundaries and the flux data were obtained from the sewage treatment plants in shenzhen hkepd and references tang et al 2016 tang et al 2014 hydraulic retention time hrt is an important indicator for water quality management to calculate the average hrt in shenzhen bay 60 000 particles were released from the mouth of shenzhen river and the trajectory of each particle with tide in shenzhen bay was simulated the influence of oyster raft culture on the hydrodynamics of shenzhen bay was discussed and evaluated according to the hrt based on the numerical results of the model the annual velocity distribution in shenzhen bay was analyzed using the empirical orthogonal function eof method the first eof mode e1 was selected to compare the distribution of flow variation with and without pm which could explain the long term impact of the culture area on the hydrodynamics 3 results 3 1 cfd verification the simulated c d of flow around a single cylinder fig 3 a was verified using the classic experimental data sighard 1965 the 2d and 3d simulation results c d agreed well with the experimental values and the errors were 4 39 and 6 95 respectively for the flow around a single cylinder the critical point of α was 0 60 fig 3b below the point cdα was relatively small and increased linearly with the increase of α above the point cdα showed a quadratic increase with the α and it was mainly caused by the bottom boundary the fitting equation of cdα and α was given as follows c d α 0 789 α 0 002 r 2 0 998 α 0 6 c d α 1 940 α 2 1 393 α 0 616 r 2 0 990 α 0 6 for the flow around double cylinders as shown in fig 3c the relationship between cdtan and tsr of double cylinders was summarized as follows the critical point of tsr was 3 which was close to the experimental study alam et al 2003 when tsr was lower than 3 the upstream drag coefficient decreased with the increase of tsr and the downstream drag coefficient remained negative when tsr was greater than 3 the drag coefficient increased rapidly with the increase of tsr for the flow around multiple cylinders eq 2 for estimating the mean drag coefficient was established based on the spacing effect eq 3 and length effect eq 4 the effects of spacing and submerged length were expressed as spacing influence factor b and length influence factor lα respectively both of which are dimensionless variables spacing impact is very important for the drag coefficient calculation of multiple cylinders to verify the effectiveness of spacing impact estimation three scenarios were arranged to calculate the drag coefficient based on the cfd models the three scenarios included one equal spacing scenario ssr tsr 4 4 fig 3e and two unequal spacing scenarios ssr tsr 4 2 fig 3d and 4 8 fig 3f the drag coefficient of the first row was the largest close to 1 2 the drag coefficients of the rear four rows fluctuated around the average value of 0 34 fig 3d 0 36 fig 3e and 0 51 fig 3f respectively which were much lower than that of the first row since the last four rows of cylinders were completely affected by the tandem spacing the average drag coefficients of the last four rows were selected to estimate the mean drag coefficient of the flow around multiple cylinders for the equal spacing ssr tsr 4 4 the simulated mean cd 0 36 based on the cfd model was very close to the one of pm 0 37 using eqs 2 3 in the case of unequal spacing ssr tsr 4 2 or 4 8 the simulated mean cd of 0 34 or 0 51 from the cfd model was within the estimated lower 0 02 or 0 37 and upper limits 0 37 or 0 64 from the pm using eqs 2 3 overall the above results indicated that the pm eqs 2 3 could provide the mean drag coefficient of the flow around multiple cylinders accurately 3 2 shallow water model verification hydrological verification of the model included tidal level current temperature and salinity the hourly tide data observed at two tide gauge stations tsim bei tsui tbt and chek lap kok clk were obtained from the hko the monthly temperature and salinity observation data at dm1 5 were from the hkepd the flow velocity measured at three points 1 3 near the raft culture zone in september 2016 was used to verify the current all observation stations are shown in fig 2d the magnitude and phase of water level fluctuation calculated by the delft3d model were consistent with the observation as shown in fig 4 the average errors of tide level at tbt and clk stations were 0 11 m and 0 07 m respectively the average errors of temperature and salinity were less than 8 0 table 1 respectively the computed velocity agreed well with the observation fig 4 the mean errors of speed and direction were 0 089 m s and 22 28 table 2 respectively the verification results showed that the model was reliable indicating that the established numerical hydrodynamic model could well simulate the hydrodynamic process in shenzhen bay compared with the simulation without considering the pm the numerical results showed that using the proposed pm the calculated tide levels were almost the same the difference was less than 0 01 m as shown in fig 4a but velocity at all three observation points were improved compared with observation table 2 fig 4b g the mean mae rmse errors of speed and direction decreased from 0 077 0 103 m s to 0 069 0 089 m s and 17 72 22 87 to 17 09 22 28 respectively the comparison of the model results showed that the current calculated using the proposed pm could better reflect the real situation of the coastal waters with oyster raft culture in shenzhen bay in addition to the verification period the model simulated the tidal process of shenzhen bay in the entire year of 2016 with and without the pm the numerical results showed that the velocity difference between using pm and not using pm of each tide process whether it was flood or ebb were consistent with those during the verification period 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and reliability of the pm based on the results of the cfd models the pm eqs 1 4 was proposed to calculate the drag coefficient of raft culture in coastal waters in the cfd models the simulated drag coefficients of flow around a single cylinder and double tandem cylinders were verified through previous experimental study alam et al 2003 sighard 1965 the drag coefficient had a critical value at the spacing ratio tsr of 3 fig 3c alam et al 2003 which might be the key point to differential reattachment regime and co shedding regime sumner 2010 at the reattachment regime the drag coefficient decreased with the increase of tsr and the downstream drag coefficient remained negative at the co shedding regime the coefficient increased rapidly with the increase of tsr until a stable value also the pm was verified through the drag coefficient of the flow around multiple cylinders in different arrangements such as equal spacing fig 3e and unequal spacing fig 3d f since the pm decomposed the drag effect in two orthogonal directions paralleled and perpendicular to the main flow direction it could estimate the upper and lower limits of cd therefore a range of cd was obtained using the pm instead of a single value using conventional cfd simulation which has more advantages and flexibility in practical engineering applications because there are some uncertainties in the flow resistance of the actual culture units such as the changing direction of current the surface roughness of raft culture units and the difference from the cylinder with the same equivalent diameter the pm took into account the effects of the spacing eq 3 and submerged length eq 4 of raft culture units at the sub grid scale to simulate the water blocking effect of raft culture in the coastal waters in fact these two factors could evaluate the horizontal and vertical culture density in coastal waters with artificial aquaculture they were expressed as spacing influence factor b and length influence factor lα both of which were dimensionless variables therefore the pm was a dimensionless model which eliminated the dimensional influence of independent variables and could have wider applicability 4 2 effect of raft culture on hydrodynamics the direct influence of raft culture on hydrodynamics is current velocity change through the analysis of the 2d flow field in the entire year of 2016 the results showed that the first eof mode explained 90 91 of the variance of velocity in shenzhen bay without oyster raft culture it showed that the spatial distribution of flow velocity was relatively uniform in shenzhen bay without raft culture fig 5 b compared with the situations with and without pm the first eof mode explained 58 04 of the variance of velocity difference indicating shenzhen bay had obvious flow increase area non culture zone and flow decrease area culture zone after oyster raft culture fig 5a at the three comparison points black dots in fig 5b in the raft culture zone the numerical flow of the model with pm was less than that of the model without pm also the results showed that the flow attenuation was intensified along the raft culture from upstream to downstream with the annual mean velocity decrease of 17 94 24 99 and 26 73 at the three points and 23 22 on average while the annual average velocity increased by 15 65 at three observation points outside the culture area the range of flow attenuation was similar to that of previous coastal farming observation plew et al 2005 the above comparison results indicated that in the waters with aquaculture areas the hydrodynamics in the aquaculture area slowed down significantly while the flow of the channel nearby the aquaculture area increased the flow distribution from the model with the pm was more reasonable than that of previous study zhang and mao 2015 in which the model did not consider the effect of oyster raft culture if we take a look at flow velocity of a typical complete 13 hour cycle in dry season and rainy seasons for example january 24 dry season and june 5 rainy season the flow velocity changed significantly once the pm was considered the velocity decrease in the rainy season 22 3 in fig 5d was greater than that in the dry season 15 8 in fig 5c in the raft culture zone this is because the upstream runoff was larger in rainy season and the hydrodynamics in the bay was stronger so the water blocking effect of the aquaculture area was more obvious comparison of flow velocity at the three observation points fig 4b g showed that the hydrodynamic accuracy of the model with pm was improved table 2 since these three observation points are located outside the culture area the numerical results showed that the flow velocity of the model with pm was greater than that without pm therefore if the water blocking effect of aquaculture was not considered in the shallow water hydrodynamic model the velocity in the culture area would be greatly overestimated while the velocity in the nearby channel outside the culture area would be greatly underestimated 4 3 implication of raft culture on environment hydrodynamic changes will affect the transport capacity of substances thus acting on the water quality hrt can be used as an index of material transport capacity the hrt calculated by the model with pm was 25 34 d which was 0 30 d longer than that without pm the main migration trajectory of particles was similar to that of previous study wan et al 2014 after oyster culture in shenzhen bay the hrt changed little because the increase of flow velocity in the main channel in the non culture area caused the particles moving fast and the hrt became shorter while the flow attenuation in the raft culture area caused the particles moving slowly and the hrt became longer this might be the cause of sediment deposition in the raft culture area zhang and mao 2015 aquaculture production depends on aquaculture density which will affect coastal hydrodynamics and water environment how to balance the contradiction is of great importance to aquaculture industry and coastal management take two arrangements of aquaculture density ssr tsr 4 4 and 4 8 in shenzhen bay as an example the hrt in 4 8 case increased by 0 97 d a little longer than that in 4 4 case present situation under the aquaculture area of the same size and location it was different from the general understanding that the drag of raft culture decreased with the increase of spacing in fact when the tsr was between 3 and 7 the drag coefficient increased rapidly with the increase of spacing fig 3c which was also validated by the cfd models of the flow around multiple cylinders the average drag coefficients were 0 36 and 0 51 for the case ssr tsr 4 4 fig 3e and 4 8 fig 3f respectively therefore from the perspective of water blocking in addition to the area and location the artificial aquaculture with appropriate spacing in coastal areas is very important in recent years in addition to production artificial aquaculture has attracted more and more attentions due to its huge environmental and ecological benefits such as carbon fixation graniero et al 2021 eutrophication control liu et al 2021 and biodiversity restoration theuerkauf et al 2022 the hydrodynamic model with the pm could be used as scientific tool to guide the reasonable layout of aquaculture density including the spacing and length of culture units and evaluate its impact on water quality in coastal waters also the model is expected to be applied to the study for canopy resistance of flow in coastal waters because the canopy was assumed as suspended aquatic plants which was commonly approximated as cylinders o donncha et al 2015 therefore the model has great application potential in coastal ecological management 5 conclusions a novel dimensionless parameterized model was proposed to calculate the drag coefficient of raft culture which considered the spacing and length of internal culture units the new pm took into account the spacing effect in two orthogonal directions so it could provide a reference range of drag coefficient according to the flow direction which was validated and agreed well with the results of cfd models delft3d hydrodynamic model combined with the pm was employed to successfully simulate the flow of shenzhen bay with large scale oyster raft culture the numerical results showed that in shenzhen bay the annual average velocity decreased by 23 22 in the culture area while in the nearby channel outside the culture area the annual average velocity increased by 15 65 the new pm model could well evaluate the hydrodynamic effect on hrt of different layout of raft culture the hrt of shenzhen bay calculated by the model with pm was 25 34 d which was a little longer than that without pm credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyu lei conceptualization

3148,the colorado river basin crb supports the water supply for seven states and forty million people in the western united states us and has been suffering an extensive drought for more than two decades as climate change continues to reshape water resources distribution in the crb its impact can differ in intensity and location resulting in variations in human adaptation behaviors the feedback from human systems in response to the environmental changes and the associated uncertainty is critical to water resources management especially for water stressed basins this paper investigates how human adaptation affects water scarcity uncertainty in the crb and highlights the uncertainties in human behavior modeling our focus is on agricultural water consumption as approximately 80 of the water consumption in the crb is used in agriculture we adopted a coupled agent based and water resources modeling approach for exploring human water system dynamics in which an agent is a human behavior model that simulates a farmer s water consumption decisions we examined uncertainties at the system agent and parameter levels through uncertainty clustering and sensitivity analyses the uncertainty analysis results suggest that the crb water system may experience 13 to 30 years of water shortage during the 2019 2060 simulation period depending on the paths of farmers adaptation the clustering analysis identified three decision making classes bold prudent and forward looking and quantified the probabilities of an agent belonging to each class the sensitivity analysis results indicated agents whose decision making models require further investigation and the parameters with the higher uncertainty reduction potentials by conducting numerical experiments with the coupled model this paper presents quantitative and qualitative information about farmers adaptation water scarcity uncertainties and future research directions for improving human behavior modeling keywords reinforcement learning clustering analysis global sensitivity analysis coupled human natural system agent based modeling 1 introduction the colorado river basin crb provides freshwater for 40 million people and 5 5 million acres of farmland in seven states of the western united states us however the extensive drought since 2000 and growing water demand have resulted in increasing water scarcity in the basin in august 2021 the federal government declared the first tier water shortage for the first time in history due to the extremely low water levels in lake mead and lake powell consequently water supply to arizona and nevada will be curtailed by 18 and 7 of their total water allocations respectively usbr 2021a as climate change continues to affect water resource distribution in the basin human water demands as well as the ways water is used also shift in response to the changes frederick and major 1997 kallis 2010 the human water system co evolution can be affected by policies and infrastructure that influence people s perceptions of the system for example dams and reservoirs are designed to provide a stable water supply during droughts however the water infrastructure also provides a false sense of water security that encourages water consumption instead of conservation di baldassarre et al 2018 this phenomenon similar to the levee effects for flooding di baldassarre et al 2017 can contribute to severer water shortage during droughts and consequently causes significant economic losses previous studies have highlighted the importance of the co evolution of human water systems and urged more research to improve our understanding e g sivapalan et al 2012 vogel et al 2015 wagener et al 2010 studies of the crb have attempted to quantify water scarcity uncertainty and explore human water system dynamics despite the hydrological and institutional complexity of the water system several studies examined the hydrological responses in the crb to various future climate change scenarios christensen et al 2004 vano et al 2014 vano and lettenmaier 2014 yang et al 2020 explored scenario design for climate adaptation decision making gerlak et al 2021 quinn et al 2020 smith et al 2022 developed modeling tools for understanding the human and water system interactions hadjimichael et al 2020a hung and yang 2021 and investigated institutional and societal influence to the crb water resources distribution e g savelli et al 2022 taylor et al 2019 womble and hanemann 2020 nevertheless quantification of the human adaptation uncertainty in the crb and how such uncertainty affects the co evolution of human natural interactions remains unexplored quantifying and understanding the uncertainty resulting from the co evaluation is a critical step toward managing the uncertainty which is the goal of this paper literature has indicated farmers behavioral change due to climate and environmental changes for example both ding et al 2009 and zilberman et al 2011 concluded that historical droughts had caused farmers behavioral changes toward water conservation to investigate human adaptation and behavioral changes many researchers adopted the agent based modeling abm technique for its ability to simulate diverse human behaviors in a distributed system berglund 2015 giuliani and castelletti 2013 yang et al 2009 abm is a computation method for simulating actions and interactions of autonomous agents to improve understanding of emerging system behaviors and investigate perturbation impacts either climatic or human induced on water systems across multiple temporal and spatial scales berglund 2015 traditional abm studies use deterministic decision rules to describe observed human behaviors in response to environmental signals and algorithms to simulate rational agents who pursue strategies that optimize their objectives e g ligmann zielinska et al 2014 noël cai 2017 yang et al 2009 recently the focus has shifted to simulating human adaptive behaviors due to the increasing concern of water scarcity under future climate change e g al amin et al 2018 hyun et al 2019 and rieker and labadie 2012 however abms as models for human behaviors are prone to uncertainty reflecting our insufficient knowledge of human decision making processes ligmann zielinska et al 2014 also the co evolution of the coupled human natural systems can amplify the uncertainty due to climate and environmental changes solomatine and shrestha 2009 tyre and michaels 2011 vogel et al 2015 therefore it is critical to quantify and manage the model output uncertainty to properly interpret modeling results quantifying and managing the uncertainty of water scarcity has been a topic of interest within the scientific community since the 1990s rajaram et al 2015 uncertainty studies primarily focused on parametric uncertainty of hydrologic models and its effects on the model prediction uncertainty e g jung et al 2011 samuel et al 2012 solomatine shrestha 2009 and future water resources uncertainty caused by climate change e g knighton et al 2017 yang et al 2020 recently the uncertain societal and institutional influence on available water resources also became a concern and the need to properly handle these human system uncertainties has been recognized in the scientific community buchmann et al 2016 ligmann zielinska et al 2014 schindler 2013 however abm studies that explicitly quantify uncertainty are rare partly for lacking evaluation methods that fit the varieties of abms and coupled models ligmann zielinska et al 2020 and partly for the deep uncertainty involved in coupled human natural systems moallemi et al 2020b understanding the uncertainty of human impacts on water systems can facilitate the development of a robust climate adaptation policy to tackle stringent water scarcity issues in major river basins such as crb the advancing computer technology enables uncertainty quantification recent papers in the water resources and sustainability fields have advocated for using models to explore different scenarios to enhance the robustness of model inference and uncover the possibility of many future pathways for problems under deep uncertainty de haan et al 2016 moallemi et al 2020a quinn et al 2017 these studies acknowledge uncertainties in assumptions data and model structure and view modeling experiments and results as educated guesses of future realizations this idea is crucial for modeling human behaviors and coupled human natural systems due to the intrinsic uncertainty and our insufficient knowledge about the control mechanisms of the system behaviors we join forces with the researchers on uncertainty investigation to deconstruct the intricacies in the crb s water resources management focusing on human adaptation water demand changes we examine uncertainties at system agent and parameter levels through three numerical experiments the first experiment is the uncertainty analysis which quantifies the water scarcity uncertainty at multiple spatial scales due to stochasticity in the human system and uncertainty of human behaviors under various human adaptation assumptions the second experiment the clustering analysis classifies agents by their characteristics and quantifies the probability of agents being assigned to the behavioral classes finally the third experiment investigates abm structure and parameter uncertainties through two sensitivity analyses the results can be applied to diagnose agents that may be under or over parametrized and identify opportunities to reduce the uncertainties the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 explains the study area the coupled abm water resources management model and methodology section 3 shows the results of numerical experiments and section 4 discusses the lessons learned from the analyses and limitations finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology and study area 2 1 the colorado river basin crb the colorado river is a major water source for the southwestern us and mexico the map of the basin is shown in fig 1 left from the 1906 2018 flow record an average of 18 billion m3 14 8 million acre feet maf of freshwater is generated annually in the crb salehabadi et al 2020 the water allocation and dam operations are based on compacts federal laws court decisions and decrees contracts and regulatory guidelines collectively known as the law of the river stern sheikh 2019 however the future of the crb water resources is looming due to the extended drought since 2000 and the increasing human demands the mean flow in the current drought period is about 15 billion m3 12 4 maf average from 2000 to 2018 which is 3 5 billion m3 below the consumptive allocation of 18 5 billion m3 including 1 9 billion m3 of mexico uses salehabadi et al 2020 the increasing water scarcity in the crb has been a pressing issue for scientific and policy discussions castle et al 2014 christensen et al 2004 garrick et al 2008 mccabe wolock 2007 the us bureau of reclamation usbr regulates water distribution in the crb through operations of major reservoirs among which lake powell glen canyon dam and lake mead hoover dam are served as the indicators of water availability for the upper and lower basins abbreviated ub and lb hereafter the left figure in fig 1 respectively the 1922 compact states that the ub states comprising colorado new mexico utah wyoming and the upper part of arizona will not cause the flow to be depleted below an aggregate of 9 2 billion m3 7 5 maf in any period of 10 consecutive years for the consumptive uses of the lb states arizona california and nevada in year 2021 water levels in both lake powell and lake mead have dropped to historic lows usbr 2021b c which suggests an urgent need for changing current practices to maintain a sustainable water supply 2 2 model description in a river basin climate change can affect the quantity timing and distribution of precipitation and temperature of which the effects are variable uncertain and heterogeneous consequently water users may view climate change risks differently their perceptions and decision making at local scale can alter water resource distribution in the river basin at local sub basin and basin scales affecting future system responses they or others observed and experienced the dynamic system also involves delayed response and complex interactions among the water users and the water system following the conceptualization of a river basin we adopt an abm approach for the crb from a previous study hung and yang 2021 in which human water users agents are capable of learning to improve their decision making i e adaptation the abm i e the human system is coupled with a water resources management model the colorado river simulation system crss as the virtual environment for agents to interact with for illustration the right figure in fig 1 presents the schematic of the coupled abm model where agents adaptation is modeled by a reinforcement learning algorithm which we will explain shortly in section 2 2 2 the crss a long term planning model for crb water resources administration provides distributed hydrological information regarding the projected future state of the river basin and rulesets for dam operations and water allocation usbr 2007 the rulesets for water allocation were developed based on the current water right system and are assumed unchanged in the future simulation below we describe the coupled abm crss model hung and yang 2021 and the three approaches for assessing water scarcity uncertainty in the crb investigating alternative assumptions and key uncertainties in the abm 2 2 1 the coupled abm crss model the majority about 80 of the water in the crb is consumed by agriculture irrigation for simplicity only agriculture water users and their irrigation decisions are simulated as agents in the abm other water demands such as industrial and municipal demands are fixed inputs using the default values in the crss decisions such as crop selections fertilization and irrigation practices are not explicitly included in current models moreover the agriculture agents are aggregations of individual farmers irrigation districts tribal water users or a mix of farming entities within a geographical region since the agent design is for capturing the emergent phenomena in the water system an agent only represents the collective behavior of farmers at that location but not individual farmers decision making agents decisions are assumed pertaining to their prior knowledge about the river basin the new information learned i e hydrological response and their perception of the future climate change an agent s decision making is modeled as a partially observable markov decision process monahan 1982 that is agents take actions based on their beliefs about the system state i e overall water availability which is not known to agents and the observation available to them i e climate forecasts and dam water levels at the time and location of the decisions following the crss model design the abm simulates 31 22 in the lb and 9 in the ub agents water demands i e the agriculture water users in crss aggregated by locations and indicated by the purple dots in fig 1 and sends the water requests to the crss the agent group ids are enlarged in fig s1 and the corresponding agent names can be found in tables s2 and s3 supplementary information the crss then determines the actual water quantities delivered to the agents according to a predefined rule set that mimics the legal institutions and real world water allocation practices in the basin and provides water quantity and dam water level information to the abm upon receiving the feedback from the crss agents will update their prior knowledge of water availability and optimal strategies for water uses the updating of agents prior knowledge and strategies follows a reinforcement learning rl algorithm developed by hung and yang 2021 of which the key components are presented in the following subsection and the mathematical equations are presented in text s1 supplementary information with new strategies and knowledge of water availability agents will determine their water requests for the following year 2 2 2 the reinforcement learning rl algorithm the rl algorithm simulates an agent s decision making process including choosing an action a water request and updating the optimal water use strategy agents are assumed to utilize environmental information to facilitate their decision making we assume that the lb agents consider the reservoir s water level information in their decision making while the ub agents actions take into account the local precipitation the algorithm utilizes a function max q where q represents the expected utility to maximize an agent s utility by increasing or decreasing its diversion and a stochastic process to determine the quantity of change the stochastic process is assumed to follow a half normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ i e normal μ σ after receiving the water allocation from the crss the utility function q is updated by increasing or decreasing the expected value of the action taken moreover this algorithm adopts a penalty mechanism to punish actions that result in water deficits a multiplier regret is used to represent an agent s risk attitude toward water deficit and the penalty is equal to the deficit multiplied by the regret this design forms a reinforcement loop that encourages actions with high expected utilities and discourages the others another feature of the rl algorithm is the inclusion of the exploitation exploration tradeoff an agent may take exploration actions to search for better strategies this feature is critical since a water system can evolve and agents need to re assess strategies to learn whether the system has changed and the original strategy remains optimal the algorithm adopts an greedy design that an agent will take an exploration action with a probability there are two other parameters that control how an agent learns the learning rate α and discount rate γ the learning rate α represents how much an agent believes in the new information relative to its prior knowledge and the discount rate γ means an agent s view of future utility at the present time both α and γ are in the range of 0 1 α 1 means agents only believe the new information learned whereas α 0 means agents do not learn γ 1 means the future water is equally valuable as the present water and γ 0 represents an agent who does not consider future water no value in summary an agent i e a virtual farmer has six parameters controlling its adaptation actions i e diversion request two related to water use adjustment μ and σ and four for learning α γ and regret

characterization and human behavior modeling diagnosis the coupled abm crss model is a sandbox to test various human adaptation assumptions with different numerical experiments to improve our understanding of the human water system dynamics human behavioral uncertainty and its impacts on water scarcity we conducted three analyses 1 uncertainty quantification 2 agent classification and 3 sensitivity analysis the uncertainty analysis aims to quantify the water scarcity uncertainty due to the uncertainty in farmers irrigation behavior at basin and sub basin levels the results can be viewed as a reference of the water scarcity uncertainty contributed by the human system in the crb and subsequently the following two analyses aim to inform future research directions for reducing the uncertainty the clustering analysis characterizes agents decision making into three classes and quantifies the probabilities of each agent being assigned to each class the results can inform future policy design to steer irrigation behavior changes for the sensitivity analysis the goal is to improve our understanding of the uncertainty in individual agents modeling and consequently reduce water scarcity uncertainty in the crb at various spatial scales below are detailed descriptions of the methods 2 3 1 uncertainty analysis uncertainty can be classified as either aleatory the inherent variation in a quantity that can be characterized by a probability distribution or epistemic uncertainty from analysts lack of knowledge roy and oberkampf 2011 both uncertainties can be characterized as probability distributions based on observations however the distinction of the uncertainty categories is not clear cut since we often learn what we thought aleatory is actually epistemic for example the aleatory uncertainty in decision making can be the result of a farmer s prediction errors and the epistemic uncertainty is related to our insufficient understanding of the farmer s decision making process in the abm an agent s action involves two decisions the direction and quantity of the change in water diversion moreover an agent is assumed to take the optimal action with probability 1 and the exploration actions selecting a sub optimal solution with probability the exploration rate represents the epistemic uncertainty in the decision since we do not know the exact reasons for that action the quantity of change is assumed following a half normal distribution for simulating the aleatory uncertainty in farmers decision making to gain insights into agents response to the non stationary climate and the subsequent impacts on water scarcity we focus on abm parameter uncertainty and its effects on key system outputs at sub basin and basin levels table 1 explains the uncertainty analysis workflow which includes a identify parameter ranges b generate parameter sets c evaluate the parameter set performance d identify behavioral sets and i assess model output uncertainty 2 3 2 clustering analysis the behavioral sets in the uncertainty analysis section 2 3 1 are the candidate representation of an agent s cognitive decision making process and essentially assumptions about the agent s behaviors since a parameter set describes an agent s decision making and learning behavior we will expect similarity in the behavioral sets especially when the observed data show a clear pattern to explore the similarity and dissimilarity among agents behavioral sets we applied the k means clustering for agent classification and investigated the characteristics of the agent classes k means clustering is a classification algorithm that partitions data into k clusters agent classes and recursively assigns data to the cluster whose centroid is closest to the data point until the assignment is stabilized macqueen 1967 by analyzing the characteristics of the agent classes we can develop agent behavior typology and refine the assumptions about agents behaviors to a few common types to help visualization and interpretation we applied the principal component analysis to project data from a high dimensional parameter space into a lower dimensional subspace this is a common practice for clustering analysis to reduce dimensionality and extract information from high dimensional data sets aubert et al 2013 hannah et al 2000 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis sa methods applied in this paper are global sensitivity analysis methods which investigate the relationships between the parameters including equation coefficients thresholds and input forcing and outputs of a simulation model norton 2015 in our abm model an agent s parameters are related to its cognitive decision making process i e learning rate α discount rate γ exploration rate and regret and stochastic actions of water use adjustment i e mean μ and standard deviation σ the model output of interest is the abm s performance in simulating the observed water consumption measured by kge there are a variety of sa methods which can be categorized into five broad groups based on the underlying mathematical concepts perturbation and derivatives elementary effect ee correlation and regression analysis methods and variance based methods pianosi et al 2016 since the sas methods have different mathematical properties and purposes applying multiple sa methods is recommended ligmann zielinska et al 2020 wagener and pianosi 2019 therefore we implemented two widely applied sa methods the morris sa morris 1991 and the sobol sa sobol 2001 in this study as diagnostic tools to improve our understanding of the abm and guide future abm research the morris sa is an ee method that calculates the changes in model outputs for a unit change in a parameter i e the ee in contrast the sobol sa a variance based method uses two variance ratios for the importance of parameters saltelli et al 2010 the first sobol ratio called the first order index measures the direct contribution to the output variance from individual parameters or equivalently the expected variance reduction if a parameter s value could be fixed the second ratio called the total order index measures the overall contribution from a parameter including the direct effects and interactions with other parameters pianosi et al 2016 we applied the morris sa for model structure diagnosis based on the rationale that the parameters of a proper model should have moderate ee values a parameter with a low ee value means that the model may be over parameterized and can be simplified by removing the parameter as a screening method in contrast a parameter with a high ee value may signify a poor representation of the observed behaviors and a need to review the model structure meanwhile the two sobol indices are calculated for ranking the potentials for uncertainty reduction in the agents behavior modeling therefore the sobol indices can inform future research directions on the mechanisms associated with a sensitive parameter or the estimation of that parameter value additionally the two sas also have different experiment designs the morris method requires generating traces of samples a trace consists of n 1 samples n is the number of parameters in the parameter space and calculates the mean absolute elementary effects the sobol method adopts monte carlo sampling methods to generate parameter sets and compute two sensitivity indices the parameter sets for the two sas are generated independently following the methods experiment designs the mathematical definitions of the sas sensitivity indices are presented in text s2 supplementary information 3 results 3 1 monte carlo simulation for water scarcity uncertainty assessment following the procedure described in table 1 we assessed the kge values of the 2 000 parameter sets for each agent the results are presented in figs s2 and s3 supplementary information an agent s parameter sets with kge values higher than a threshold value are selected as the behavioral sets top 10 ranked parameter sets 200 sets per agent although the same 2000 parameter sets are evaluated for each agent the resulting kge value for each set varies from agent to agent due to agents diverse historical behaviors consequently each agent has its own behavior parameter sets due to the heavy computation burden for simulating the coupled model we composed only five scenarios for this analysis a scenario consists of 31 agents i e 31 parameter sets the agents parameter sets are selected from their own behavioral sets based on the kge rankings in doing so we can maintain heterogeneity in agents decision making and fair representations of their observed behaviors the kge rankings for the five scenarios are 1 25 50 75 and 99 rankings of the behavior sets respectively and for clarity the scenarios are named after the percentile values i e q1 q25 q50 q75 and q99 since kge measures how close the simulated results are to the observed data the scenarios represent hypotheses of how agents future behavior would deviate from their historical patterns that is the q99 scenario assumes that the agent s future behavior will be similar to the past while the q75 q50 and q25 scenarios represent futures where agents can behave somehow differently from the past the five scenarios are simulated from 2019 to 2060 under the same future flow condition sum of all inflows in the basin the solid line in fig 2 a a recovering trend from a drought condition to a normal condition the dashed line in fig 2a the future flow series is generated from historical observation resampling and has two significant drought years in 2033 and 2047 to assess water scarcity uncertainty we chose the basin storage monthly average storage of all dams in the crb and mexico delivery shortage year counts as system level performance metrics a shortage year is a year with the annual flow to mexico less than 1 9 billion m3 stated in the 1944 mexico treaty fig 2b shows the mexico delivery shortage years of the five scenarios each has 30 simulations which range from 13 the lower limit of the q99 scenario to 30 years the upper limit of the q50 scenario we can see a trend that the higher percentile scenario is more likely to have a lower number of shortage years except for the q1 scenario interestingly the q1 scenario the dark blue circles in fig 2c is more likely to have a higher mean basin storage larger x axis values than the other scenarios even though the predicted shortage years median is higher than scenarios q75 and q99 fig 2b this result can be partially attributed to the q1 scenario s higher inter annual variability in the basin storage larger y axis values resulting from the farmer characteristics i e agent parameter values to further investigate human impacts on basin storage variability we compare the water consumption of scenarios q1 and q99 aggregated to sub basin and basin levels as fig 3 shows moreover we highlighted three time periods in fig 3 by the orange boxes separated by the 2033 and 2047 droughts to facilitate the discussion in period a from 2019 to 2032 the water stored in the reservoirs is sufficient to satisfy water demands so agents continue to exploit water resources fig s4 supplementary information until 2033 the excessive water uses in period a and the significantly lower natural flow depletes water storage in the basin resulting in a deep plunge in the basin and sub basin water consumption because the reservoirs are depleted agents have to adapt to the reduced water supply in period b to restore basin storage we named this period b the adaptation period for the substantial changes in the water system although agents in the three periods are active learning either for exploiting or conserving water resources in both scenarios the water consumption in the sub basins shows different patterns the ub consumption gradually recovers to the pre adaptation level while the lb consumption recovers to a lower than pre adaptation level the lb agents mainly rely on water flow release from lake mead which will be low in water storage after the 2033 drought so they need to restrain their water uses whereas many ub agents have access to the natural flow and can return to their normal water uses as long as the precipitation is within the normal conditions furthermore although the ub consumption patterns are much alike in the two scenarios we can see that the ub consumption in the q1 scenario has a higher recovering rate i e the slope of the water consumption than in the q99 scenario besides the wider band when another severe drought occurs in 2047 it triggers another round of adaptation in the crb and announces the arrival of the post adaptation period c given the experience of the adaptation period b agents are in a better position to cope with the shortage consequently the crb and the sub basin water consumption can quickly recover to the adaptation period level or higher the results of the two scenarios are very similar in this period except that the uncertainty measured by the range i e maximum minimum is higher in the q99 scenario this implies that agents in both scenarios may have similar water use strategies when the natural flow returns to the normal condition but some agents of the q99 scenario may learn more diverse strategies in the simulations for the wider bandwidth the difference between q1 and q99 is due to our assumptions about farmers characteristics i e agent parameter values fig 4 shows 31 agents parameter distributions parameter ranges are normalized to 0 1 range for the ease of reading in the two scenarios where the main difference lies in the probability of taking an exploration action and regrets a penalty for undersupply the q1 scenario s high exploration rate results in the higher consumption variability in periods a and b whereas the low exploration rate and high regret of the q99 scenario can explain the diverging trajectories in period c fig 4 also demonstrates that the scenario generation process can effectively generate distinct agent compositions while maintaining agent heterogeneity our analysis illustrates that the assumptions about farmers adaptation behaviors can substantially influence system level water scarcity outcomes however farmers adaptation depends on their perceptions of future water availability after shortages and their willingness to adapt both are controlled by the abm parameters it is important to note that learning and adaptation occur at the farmer agent level and can differ from farmer to farmer depending on their local environment and characteristics 3 2 clustering and principal component analyses for human behavior uncertainty assessment following the uncertainty analysis in section 3 1 we used the behavioral sets identified by the performance thresholds as the input data for clustering each agent has 200 behavioral sets the analysis includes two steps first we mapped the behavioral sets to a 2 dimensional principal component space using principal component analysis jolliffe 1986 for visual presentation and interpretation the principal components pcs are linear transformations of the original parameter space normalized to the range of 0 to 1 so that the pcs are linear uncorrelated the pcs are orthogonal directions with the high variance numbered conventionally by order of variance explained table 2 shows the coefficients of the linear transformation function of the two pcs pc1 mainly emphasizes the action parameters μ and σ and pc2 is related to the adaptation parameters α γ and regret a variable s coefficient close to zero means that the variable has little contribution to the pc based on the features of the pcs we named pc1 the boldness in action and pc2 the willingness to adapt then we tested the k means clustering by setting the number of clusters from 2 to 5 and found that three clusters yielded the most meaningful results the clustering performance results are shown in figs s5 and s6 supplementary information fig 5 shows the behavioral sets assigned to one of the three clusters prudent forward looking and bold the clusters naming is based on their mean parameter values which are shown at the bottom of fig 5 the prudent agents orange circles are cautious in adjusting amounts of water use low μ and σ inclined to conserve water after water shortages high regret and more willing to explore new strategies high the forward looking agents blue circles consider the value of future water high γ and deliberate in adaptation to environmental changes low α and whereas the bold agents green circles prefer making substantial adjustments in their water use high μ σ and α and do not regret nor value future water as much low γ and regret assuming each parameter set is equally likely to be a good representation of an agent s decision making we can then calculate the probabilities of an agent being assigned to each cluster tables s2 and s3 supplementary information for example fig 6 right shows the clustering results of two agents wy in the ub and welltonmohawkidd in the lb and the probabilities are calculated based on the point counts of the clusters the wy sets are mostly assigned to the bold or forward looking while the majority of the welltonmohawkidd sets are classified as the prudent fig 6 left shows the pie charts of the results aggregated to the state level and weighted by agents water consumption in 2018 the agents simulated may consist of many farmers in reality and therefore the classification results are weighted by the water consumption when aggregated to the state level the pie charts show that ub agents are likely to be categorized as either the bold or forward looking agents while the lb agents are likely to be assigned to the prudent cluster the classification and probability analysis of agent type can provide qualitative information about farmers adaptation behavior for example an agent may show prudent behaviors due to either the agent s own thinking or the institutional constraints explicitly modeling the institutional constraints can eliminate the latter and help us focus on agents thinking this will be a future research direction additionally other clustering algorithms may generate different results the comparison of multiple algorithms for better characterization can be another future research topic 3 3 morris and sobol sas for human behavior model diagnoses this section presents the results of two sas due to the high computation cost of the abm evaluation we limited the sample size for the sas to between 1 000 and 2 000 samples the model output selected for the sas is the kge and the parameters are sampled from the ranges listed in table s1 in supplementary information in morris sa an insensitive parameter i e a low mean value of ee means that the abm s output does not depend on the parameter value any value in the parameter range of that parameter would generate a similar result contrarily a sensitive parameter i e a high mean value of ee indicates that the abm performance is sensitive to the parameter value fig 7 shows the morris sa results on a scatter plot and each circle represents a parameter s ee of an agent total 186 circles 31 agents 6 parameters the numerical results are presented in tables s4 and s5 in supplementary information the circles are colored orange and blue to indicate the ub and lb agents parameters respectively we can see that the ees of the parameters vary in a wide range which suggests heterogeneity in farmers characteristics to improve our understanding of agents behaviors we examined the historical diversion data starting from the extremes we use hopitribe and powers as two examples to explain why abm performance is sensitive or insensitive to the changes in the parameter values the abm is designed to simulate changes in behavior through adaptive learning since the hopitribe shows no obvious changes in its water uses its performance would worsen when the parameters suggest more adaptation or a significant change hopitribe s high std is the result of applying a non linear abm to predict a rather linear behavior in contrast the powers has steady water use and a decreasing trend after a significant drop the abm training process is to equip an agent with initial strategies in the case of a simple trend like the powers agents can easily learn good strategies from training and perform well regardless of what the parameter values are when the abm performs well in capturing a farmer s adaptation behavior the parameters generally have moderate ees 0 2 0 4 as shown by mohavevalleyidd in fig 7 moreover we can see that the circles exhibit a linear relationship between the means and standard deviations stds of the ee values which implies a scale effect in the parameters ee distributions large stds also suggest the presence significant non linear effects iooss and lemaître 2015 interestingly the orange circles i e ub agents also show a linear relationship but some of the circles significantly deviate from the linear trend line fig 7 since performance metric kge is a composite metric of correlation mean and variance ratios between simulated and observed data parameters deviated from the trend line are indicators of the agents complex behaviors that require further investigation to investigate what abm parameters may require further attention we showed the same results color coded for parameters instead of sub basins in fig 8 we can see that regret blue asterisk orange square and α light blue diamond are more likely to deviate from the trend line this finding suggests non linear and non stationary mechanisms in the penalty exploration and learning behaviors in addition the magnitude of the mean ee values y axis indicates the potential abrupt twists in the agents historical water consumption patterns when the observation data has an evident change it is crucial for the model to capture the timing of the change failure to capture timing can result in a plunge in model performance measured by kge because the trajectory would be very different fig 9 shows the sobol sa results of the ub agents and the largest five agents in terms of water consumption in the lb the numerical results are presented in tables s6 and s7 in supplementary information since sobol sa is a variance based method σ the standard deviation of the water use change and the random exploration rate are expected to have higher first order sobol index values the statement is generally true for the lb agents but the results show that regret and α are also important parameters for many ub agents this finding implies that being able to adapt may be crucial for simulating ub agents historical water use patterns moreover suppose the parameters do not have significant interactions i e the higher order terms are close to 0 in that case the sum of an agent s first order indices and the sum of the total order indices should be close to 1 therefore the sum of the first order indices substantially deviates from 1 is an indicator of strong non linearity e g ut3 and az in the ub and crir az and yumamesa idd in the lb the total order sobol indices represent the variances contributed by a parameter and its interactions with other parameters this information can guide research to reduce the uncertainty of an agent s simulation performance for example regret is the most sensitive parameter in terms of the total order sobol index for many ub agents and if we can improve the regret estimations by collecting data and evidence of human cognitive thinking we can significantly reduce the uncertainty in modeling ub agents adaptation behaviors for the five lb agents future research should focus on σ and to improve understanding of agents water consumption variability and reasons to deviate from the agents normal water consumption patterns in addition from fig 9 we can see that co3 and crir az exhibit very different patterns in both sobol indices compared to other agents in the sub basin further investigation of these agents behaviors can be one of the future directions when comparing the morris and sobol methods results we observed that the two methods identify different sensitive parameters the first order sobol indices indicate σ and as the most influential parameters the total order sobol indices highlight regret and α for the ub agents and σ for the five lb agents and the morris method predicts the agent s parameter ees in a cluster these different results of sensitive parameters confirm that multiple sa methods should be used to investigate abm efficacy in representing farmers adaptation behaviors from multiple aspects future research can consider exploring the broad spectrum of the sa methods for abm model diagnosis 4 discussion the results of the three analyses can inform policy development and shed light on future water management and climate adaptation research in the crb below we discussed the lessons learned from the numerical experiments and the limitations 4 1 uncertainty analysis for exploration and improving understanding previously in section 3 1 we have shown that water storage shortages and consumption uncertainties at basin level can vary with the scenarios and abm parameterization figs 2 and 3 to further investigate the adaptation uncertainty effects at the sub basin level we summarized the water consumption results of the five scenarios in figs 10 and 11 and compared the results with the 2018 water consumption the boxplots in fig 10 indicate the higher water consumption uncertainty in the ub than the lb within and across scenarios fig 11 shows the time series plots of the ub and lb water consumptions in the q99 scenario stacked on top of the uncertainty band of all five scenarios as an example of the uncertainty propagation through time in the scenarios fig 10 we can see that the ub water consumption has substantial increases although in varying degrees while the lb consumption is always well below the 2018 consumption level the reasons are twofold first the ub water consumption has not yet reached the annual allowance of 9 25 billion m3 so the ub agents can continue to expand consumption except for the severe drought years in 2033 2043 and 2047 fig 11 in contrast the lb consumption in 2018 had already reached the 9 25 billion m3 allowance which left limited room for agents to expand their consumption second the severe water shortage in 2033 would deplete the basin storage which would result in a serious water security crisis for the lb agents for losing the stable water supply from lake mead moreover since water in the crb is originated from the mountain area in the ub the ub agents will have priority access to the water until its consumption reaches the sub basin allowance consequently the ub agents can continue to increase water consumption while the lb agents need to curtail consumption due to the limited available water after 2034 fig 11 however whether this is an economic and equitable distribution of the water resources under these shortage conditions may require further discussions and renegotiation among the stakeholders in the basin to tackle the water security issues 4 2 policy implications for human adaptation and water scarcity the crb s first tier water shortage declaration in august 2021 has stirred discussions on water conservation in the seven states consequently the water supplies to arizona and nevada are reduced by 18 and 7 of their total allocations respectively starting in 2022 according to the drought contingency plan without substantial actions for water conservation further curtailment would soon be needed as suggested by the simulation results fig 11 education programs can be effective tools to promote water conservation by triggering substantial learning that leads to water consumption behavior changes the coupled model can be applied to assess when we need behavior changes to happen and to what degree the learning parameters α γ and regret in our abm control how quickly agents respond to environmental changes therefore we can simulate the desired parameter values and design education programs to facilitate the transition moreover the classification results provide a basis for making assumptions about the evolution of agents decision making in response to the policies the abm can be applied to assess various policy combinations and assumptions to facilitate the discussion about the evolution in farmers irrigation behaviors and design policy accordingly to guide and quicken the evolution one example could be some education programs that convert bold agents to forward looking or prudent agents however research may be needed to further investigate farmers attitudes toward climate change to reduce the uncertainties in human behavior modeling including the model structure and parameter uncertainties and design education programs to change farmers perceptions the coupled abm crss is suitable for assisting such soft policy designs as demonstrated in a previous study hung and yang 2021 although the soft policy alone may not solve the water scarcity problem it can delay the decline in water storage for policymakers to generate solutions such as water right allocation renegotiation and water markets if the basin continues to stay in drought conditions due to climate change renegotiation of the water allocation will be needed for adaptation gerlak et al 2021 udall and overpeck 2017 one can only be proactive in tackling the water scarcity problem if one recognizes that the decline in water supply is ongoing and not temporary furthermore the timing of the actions is critical early actions to conserve water will help maintain reservoir storage at a more resilient level for climate adaptation and renegotiation failing to act promptly will cause an increased risk of depleting reservoirs as fig s4 shows and drive the basin to intense competition among water users our results suggest that it may be time to shift the water management paradigm from supply focus to risk focus to strengthen crb s adaptation capacity 4 3 limitations and future research directions the abm applied in this study simulates human decision making as stochastic processes to account for the inherent randomness and our insufficient knowledge about human behavior since the historical data is merely a single realization of many possibilities the abm parameterization should be viewed as an assumption of how agriculture irrigation consumption patterns may change in the future in the uncertainty analysis fig 3 we showed the extent of future water consumption in the crb could differ from the historical pattern the results can serve as a basis for future discussions on climate change adaptation and water resources management additionally the modeling results indicate that farmers would actively conserve water after substantial water shortages box b in fig 3 however in reality whether the water supply cuts starting in 2022 can trigger farmers adaptation for water conservation and synchronize the co evolution of the human and natural systems in the crb still need to be verified in fact studies of human behavioral modeling should be continuous and adaptive with new data and research findings becoming accessible we will be able to reduce the water scarcity uncertainty validate the results and improve the model s prediction regional survey and interview studies can be a complement to the clustering and sensitivity analyses and improve our understanding to reduce epistemic uncertainties from the technical perspective we summarize four future directions for quantifying and managing uncertainties in abms first sensitivity analyses for coupled abm crss are computationally expansive for the exponential growth in simulations with the increase of parameters future works can consider developing fully integrated models and utilizing high performance computing to improve the accuracy of the sensitivity indices second many sampled parameter sets performed poorly in the case study due to the model structure uncertainty and including these parameter sets can obscure the implications of the analysis studies suggest applying screening methods to refine behavioral parameter space pianosi et al 2016 wagener and pianosi 2019 yet methods that systematically generate the behavioral parameter space are still not seen in the literature except for the simple threshold method pappenberger et al 2008 developing screening methods for sensitivity analyses is one of our future directions third the results of the clustering analysis may not always be clear cut for example the agents circles in fig 5 located next to the cluster borderlines may exhibit significantly different behaviors than those agents close to the centroid of that cluster the ambiguity may be partially attributed to the limitations of the k means clustering method future research will apply more sophisticated clustering algorithms such as gaussian mixture models reynolds et al 2000 to further explore the farmers characterization finally our abm only considers agriculture water use uncertainty and does not include other uncertainties in human systems such as population growth crop selections irrigation practices agriculture yields and food preference future research may incorporate other decisions and uncertainties in human systems modeling additionally we will consider investigating the impacts of current buy and dry practices and water leasing in the crb on water resources management in the long run 5 conclusions the colorado river basin crb is a complex non linear stochastic and dynamic coupled human natural system while those features are recognized in the literature sivapalan et al 2012 vogel et al 2015 most modeling studies have focused on the hydrological processes and overlooked the importance of the human counterpart such compromises in model development are inevitable due to the presence of high complexity and deep uncertainty hadjimichael et al 2020b quinn et al 2020 with the looming water crisis in the basin it is critical to incorporate the human response and manage the water scarcity uncertainty in developing climate adaptation policy this paper complements the existing natural process focused studies by investigating human water system interactions and the uncertainties in the human system with three numerical experiments uncertainty clustering and sensitivity analyses our contributions include quantifying water scarcity uncertainty in the crb caused by human adaptation exploring farmers decision making typology based on historical data and identifying opportunities to reduce model structure and parameter uncertainties in human behavior modeling the results of the uncertainty analysis reveal the escalating water scarcity and an urgent need for changes in water management in the basin the clustering analysis provides probabilistic information on farmers irrigation behavior characterization in the crb moreover our results indicate that farmers in the upper basin tend to change their water uses in response to climate signals whereas in the lower basin farmers are more cautious in adjusting their water uses our findings in clustering analysis suggest that water conservation programs can be more effective if we tailor management programs based on farmers characteristics the sensitivity analyses highlight the opportunity for future research on human behavioral modeling in the crb findings from the morris sa indicate a need to review the abm structure for agents with highly sensitive or insensitive parameters e g hopitribe and powers whereas the sobol sa quantifies individual parameters contribution to the outcome uncertainty thus signifying the potential for uncertainty reduction although the results of these analyses may not be directly applicable to policy making yet they form a foundation for policy discussion regarding human response and adaptation furthermore modeling human adaptation and quantifying the uncertainty of the co evolution in coupled human natural systems are critical research fields for coping with water scarcity issues in major river basins we demonstrated that the uncertainty clustering and sensitivity analyses could be applied to coupled human natural system models to quantify and manage the uncertainty our immediate future work will focus on improving human behavior modeling and scenario selection design for water scarcity uncertainty analysis another future research direction is to include climate uncertainty to provide a holistic view of water scarcity in the crb credit authorship contribution statement fengwei hung conceptualization methodology software visualization writing

3148,the colorado river basin crb supports the water supply for seven states and forty million people in the western united states us and has been suffering an extensive drought for more than two decades as climate change continues to reshape water resources distribution in the crb its impact can differ in intensity and location resulting in variations in human adaptation behaviors the feedback from human systems in response to the environmental changes and the associated uncertainty is critical to water resources management especially for water stressed basins this paper investigates how human adaptation affects water scarcity uncertainty in the crb and highlights the uncertainties in human behavior modeling our focus is on agricultural water consumption as approximately 80 of the water consumption in the crb is used in agriculture we adopted a coupled agent based and water resources modeling approach for exploring human water system dynamics in which an agent is a human behavior model that simulates a farmer s water consumption decisions we examined uncertainties at the system agent and parameter levels through uncertainty clustering and sensitivity analyses the uncertainty analysis results suggest that the crb water system may experience 13 to 30 years of water shortage during the 2019 2060 simulation period depending on the paths of farmers adaptation the clustering analysis identified three decision making classes bold prudent and forward looking and quantified the probabilities of an agent belonging to each class the sensitivity analysis results indicated agents whose decision making models require further investigation and the parameters with the higher uncertainty reduction potentials by conducting numerical experiments with the coupled model this paper presents quantitative and qualitative information about farmers adaptation water scarcity uncertainties and future research directions for improving human behavior modeling keywords reinforcement learning clustering analysis global sensitivity analysis coupled human natural system agent based modeling 1 introduction the colorado river basin crb provides freshwater for 40 million people and 5 5 million acres of farmland in seven states of the western united states us however the extensive drought since 2000 and growing water demand have resulted in increasing water scarcity in the basin in august 2021 the federal government declared the first tier water shortage for the first time in history due to the extremely low water levels in lake mead and lake powell consequently water supply to arizona and nevada will be curtailed by 18 and 7 of their total water allocations respectively usbr 2021a as climate change continues to affect water resource distribution in the basin human water demands as well as the ways water is used also shift in response to the changes frederick and major 1997 kallis 2010 the human water system co evolution can be affected by policies and infrastructure that influence people s perceptions of the system for example dams and reservoirs are designed to provide a stable water supply during droughts however the water infrastructure also provides a false sense of water security that encourages water consumption instead of conservation di baldassarre et al 2018 this phenomenon similar to the levee effects for flooding di baldassarre et al 2017 can contribute to severer water shortage during droughts and consequently causes significant economic losses previous studies have highlighted the importance of the co evolution of human water systems and urged more research to improve our understanding e g sivapalan et al 2012 vogel et al 2015 wagener et al 2010 studies of the crb have attempted to quantify water scarcity uncertainty and explore human water system dynamics despite the hydrological and institutional complexity of the water system several studies examined the hydrological responses in the crb to various future climate change scenarios christensen et al 2004 vano et al 2014 vano and lettenmaier 2014 yang et al 2020 explored scenario design for climate adaptation decision making gerlak et al 2021 quinn et al 2020 smith et al 2022 developed modeling tools for understanding the human and water system interactions hadjimichael et al 2020a hung and yang 2021 and investigated institutional and societal influence to the crb water resources distribution e g savelli et al 2022 taylor et al 2019 womble and hanemann 2020 nevertheless quantification of the human adaptation uncertainty in the crb and how such uncertainty affects the co evolution of human natural interactions remains unexplored quantifying and understanding the uncertainty resulting from the co evaluation is a critical step toward managing the uncertainty which is the goal of this paper literature has indicated farmers behavioral change due to climate and environmental changes for example both ding et al 2009 and zilberman et al 2011 concluded that historical droughts had caused farmers behavioral changes toward water conservation to investigate human adaptation and behavioral changes many researchers adopted the agent based modeling abm technique for its ability to simulate diverse human behaviors in a distributed system berglund 2015 giuliani and castelletti 2013 yang et al 2009 abm is a computation method for simulating actions and interactions of autonomous agents to improve understanding of emerging system behaviors and investigate perturbation impacts either climatic or human induced on water systems across multiple temporal and spatial scales berglund 2015 traditional abm studies use deterministic decision rules to describe observed human behaviors in response to environmental signals and algorithms to simulate rational agents who pursue strategies that optimize their objectives e g ligmann zielinska et al 2014 noël cai 2017 yang et al 2009 recently the focus has shifted to simulating human adaptive behaviors due to the increasing concern of water scarcity under future climate change e g al amin et al 2018 hyun et al 2019 and rieker and labadie 2012 however abms as models for human behaviors are prone to uncertainty reflecting our insufficient knowledge of human decision making processes ligmann zielinska et al 2014 also the co evolution of the coupled human natural systems can amplify the uncertainty due to climate and environmental changes solomatine and shrestha 2009 tyre and michaels 2011 vogel et al 2015 therefore it is critical to quantify and manage the model output uncertainty to properly interpret modeling results quantifying and managing the uncertainty of water scarcity has been a topic of interest within the scientific community since the 1990s rajaram et al 2015 uncertainty studies primarily focused on parametric uncertainty of hydrologic models and its effects on the model prediction uncertainty e g jung et al 2011 samuel et al 2012 solomatine shrestha 2009 and future water resources uncertainty caused by climate change e g knighton et al 2017 yang et al 2020 recently the uncertain societal and institutional influence on available water resources also became a concern and the need to properly handle these human system uncertainties has been recognized in the scientific community buchmann et al 2016 ligmann zielinska et al 2014 schindler 2013 however abm studies that explicitly quantify uncertainty are rare partly for lacking evaluation methods that fit the varieties of abms and coupled models ligmann zielinska et al 2020 and partly for the deep uncertainty involved in coupled human natural systems moallemi et al 2020b understanding the uncertainty of human impacts on water systems can facilitate the development of a robust climate adaptation policy to tackle stringent water scarcity issues in major river basins such as crb the advancing computer technology enables uncertainty quantification recent papers in the water resources and sustainability fields have advocated for using models to explore different scenarios to enhance the robustness of model inference and uncover the possibility of many future pathways for problems under deep uncertainty de haan et al 2016 moallemi et al 2020a quinn et al 2017 these studies acknowledge uncertainties in assumptions data and model structure and view modeling experiments and results as educated guesses of future realizations this idea is crucial for modeling human behaviors and coupled human natural systems due to the intrinsic uncertainty and our insufficient knowledge about the control mechanisms of the system behaviors we join forces with the researchers on uncertainty investigation to deconstruct the intricacies in the crb s water resources management focusing on human adaptation water demand changes we examine uncertainties at system agent and parameter levels through three numerical experiments the first experiment is the uncertainty analysis which quantifies the water scarcity uncertainty at multiple spatial scales due to stochasticity in the human system and uncertainty of human behaviors under various human adaptation assumptions the second experiment the clustering analysis classifies agents by their characteristics and quantifies the probability of agents being assigned to the behavioral classes finally the third experiment investigates abm structure and parameter uncertainties through two sensitivity analyses the results can be applied to diagnose agents that may be under or over parametrized and identify opportunities to reduce the uncertainties the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 explains the study area the coupled abm water resources management model and methodology section 3 shows the results of numerical experiments and section 4 discusses the lessons learned from the analyses and limitations finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology and study area 2 1 the colorado river basin crb the colorado river is a major water source for the southwestern us and mexico the map of the basin is shown in fig 1 left from the 1906 2018 flow record an average of 18 billion m3 14 8 million acre feet maf of freshwater is generated annually in the crb salehabadi et al 2020 the water allocation and dam operations are based on compacts federal laws court decisions and decrees contracts and regulatory guidelines collectively known as the law of the river stern sheikh 2019 however the future of the crb water resources is looming due to the extended drought since 2000 and the increasing human demands the mean flow in the current drought period is about 15 billion m3 12 4 maf average from 2000 to 2018 which is 3 5 billion m3 below the consumptive allocation of 18 5 billion m3 including 1 9 billion m3 of mexico uses salehabadi et al 2020 the increasing water scarcity in the crb has been a pressing issue for scientific and policy discussions castle et al 2014 christensen et al 2004 garrick et al 2008 mccabe wolock 2007 the us bureau of reclamation usbr regulates water distribution in the crb through operations of major reservoirs among which lake powell glen canyon dam and lake mead hoover dam are served as the indicators of water availability for the upper and lower basins abbreviated ub and lb hereafter the left figure in fig 1 respectively the 1922 compact states that the ub states comprising colorado new mexico utah wyoming and the upper part of arizona will not cause the flow to be depleted below an aggregate of 9 2 billion m3 7 5 maf in any period of 10 consecutive years for the consumptive uses of the lb states arizona california and nevada in year 2021 water levels in both lake powell and lake mead have dropped to historic lows usbr 2021b c which suggests an urgent need for changing current practices to maintain a sustainable water supply 2 2 model description in a river basin climate change can affect the quantity timing and distribution of precipitation and temperature of which the effects are variable uncertain and heterogeneous consequently water users may view climate change risks differently their perceptions and decision making at local scale can alter water resource distribution in the river basin at local sub basin and basin scales affecting future system responses they or others observed and experienced the dynamic system also involves delayed response and complex interactions among the water users and the water system following the conceptualization of a river basin we adopt an abm approach for the crb from a previous study hung and yang 2021 in which human water users agents are capable of learning to improve their decision making i e adaptation the abm i e the human system is coupled with a water resources management model the colorado river simulation system crss as the virtual environment for agents to interact with for illustration the right figure in fig 1 presents the schematic of the coupled abm model where agents adaptation is modeled by a reinforcement learning algorithm which we will explain shortly in section 2 2 2 the crss a long term planning model for crb water resources administration provides distributed hydrological information regarding the projected future state of the river basin and rulesets for dam operations and water allocation usbr 2007 the rulesets for water allocation were developed based on the current water right system and are assumed unchanged in the future simulation below we describe the coupled abm crss model hung and yang 2021 and the three approaches for assessing water scarcity uncertainty in the crb investigating alternative assumptions and key uncertainties in the abm 2 2 1 the coupled abm crss model the majority about 80 of the water in the crb is consumed by agriculture irrigation for simplicity only agriculture water users and their irrigation decisions are simulated as agents in the abm other water demands such as industrial and municipal demands are fixed inputs using the default values in the crss decisions such as crop selections fertilization and irrigation practices are not explicitly included in current models moreover the agriculture agents are aggregations of individual farmers irrigation districts tribal water users or a mix of farming entities within a geographical region since the agent design is for capturing the emergent phenomena in the water system an agent only represents the collective behavior of farmers at that location but not individual farmers decision making agents decisions are assumed pertaining to their prior knowledge about the river basin the new information learned i e hydrological response and their perception of the future climate change an agent s decision making is modeled as a partially observable markov decision process monahan 1982 that is agents take actions based on their beliefs about the system state i e overall water availability which is not known to agents and the observation available to them i e climate forecasts and dam water levels at the time and location of the decisions following the crss model design the abm simulates 31 22 in the lb and 9 in the ub agents water demands i e the agriculture water users in crss aggregated by locations and indicated by the purple dots in fig 1 and sends the water requests to the crss the agent group ids are enlarged in fig s1 and the corresponding agent names can be found in tables s2 and s3 supplementary information the crss then determines the actual water quantities delivered to the agents according to a predefined rule set that mimics the legal institutions and real world water allocation practices in the basin and provides water quantity and dam water level information to the abm upon receiving the feedback from the crss agents will update their prior knowledge of water availability and optimal strategies for water uses the updating of agents prior knowledge and strategies follows a reinforcement learning rl algorithm developed by hung and yang 2021 of which the key components are presented in the following subsection and the mathematical equations are presented in text s1 supplementary information with new strategies and knowledge of water availability agents will determine their water requests for the following year 2 2 2 the reinforcement learning rl algorithm the rl algorithm simulates an agent s decision making process including choosing an action a water request and updating the optimal water use strategy agents are assumed to utilize environmental information to facilitate their decision making we assume that the lb agents consider the reservoir s water level information in their decision making while the ub agents actions take into account the local precipitation the algorithm utilizes a function max q where q represents the expected utility to maximize an agent s utility by increasing or decreasing its diversion and a stochastic process to determine the quantity of change the stochastic process is assumed to follow a half normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ i e normal μ σ after receiving the water allocation from the crss the utility function q is updated by increasing or decreasing the expected value of the action taken moreover this algorithm adopts a penalty mechanism to punish actions that result in water deficits a multiplier regret is used to represent an agent s risk attitude toward water deficit and the penalty is equal to the deficit multiplied by the regret this design forms a reinforcement loop that encourages actions with high expected utilities and discourages the others another feature of the rl algorithm is the inclusion of the exploitation exploration tradeoff an agent may take exploration actions to search for better strategies this feature is critical since a water system can evolve and agents need to re assess strategies to learn whether the system has changed and the original strategy remains optimal the algorithm adopts an greedy design that an agent will take an exploration action with a probability there are two other parameters that control how an agent learns the learning rate α and discount rate γ the learning rate α represents how much an agent believes in the new information relative to its prior knowledge and the discount rate γ means an agent s view of future utility at the present time both α and γ are in the range of 0 1 α 1 means agents only believe the new information learned whereas α 0 means agents do not learn γ 1 means the future water is equally valuable as the present water and γ 0 represents an agent who does not consider future water no value in summary an agent i e a virtual farmer has six parameters controlling its adaptation actions i e diversion request two related to water use adjustment μ and σ and four for learning α γ and regret interested readers can refer to our previous paper for more details on the reinforcement learning algorithm hung and yang 2021 2 3 methods for water scarcity uncertainty quantification agent characterization and human behavior modeling diagnosis the coupled abm crss model is a sandbox to test various human adaptation assumptions with different numerical experiments to improve our understanding of the human water system dynamics human behavioral uncertainty and its impacts on water scarcity we conducted three analyses 1 uncertainty quantification 2 agent classification and 3 sensitivity analysis the uncertainty analysis aims to quantify the water scarcity uncertainty due to the uncertainty in farmers irrigation behavior at basin and sub basin levels the results can be viewed as a reference of the water scarcity uncertainty contributed by the human system in the crb and subsequently the following two analyses aim to inform future research directions for reducing the uncertainty the clustering analysis characterizes agents decision making into three classes and quantifies the probabilities of each agent being assigned to each class the results can inform future policy design to steer irrigation behavior changes for the sensitivity analysis the goal is to improve our understanding of the uncertainty in individual agents modeling and consequently reduce water scarcity uncertainty in the crb at various spatial scales below are detailed descriptions of the methods 2 3 1 uncertainty analysis uncertainty can be classified as either aleatory the inherent variation in a quantity that can be characterized by a probability distribution or epistemic uncertainty from analysts lack of knowledge roy and oberkampf 2011 both uncertainties can be characterized as probability distributions based on observations however the distinction of the uncertainty categories is not clear cut since we often learn what we thought aleatory is actually epistemic for example the aleatory uncertainty in decision making can be the result of a farmer s prediction errors and the epistemic uncertainty is related to our insufficient understanding of the farmer s decision making process in the abm an agent s action involves two decisions the direction and quantity of the change in water diversion moreover an agent is assumed to take the optimal action with probability 1 and the exploration actions selecting a sub optimal solution with probability the exploration rate represents the epistemic uncertainty in the decision since we do not know the exact reasons for that action the quantity of change is assumed following a half normal distribution for simulating the aleatory uncertainty in farmers decision making to gain insights into agents response to the non stationary climate and the subsequent impacts on water scarcity we focus on abm parameter uncertainty and its effects on key system outputs at sub basin and basin levels table 1 explains the uncertainty analysis workflow which includes a identify parameter ranges b generate parameter sets c evaluate the parameter set performance d identify behavioral sets and i assess model output uncertainty 2 3 2 clustering analysis the behavioral sets in the uncertainty analysis section 2 3 1 are the candidate representation of an agent s cognitive decision making process and essentially assumptions about the agent s behaviors since a parameter set describes an agent s decision making and learning behavior we will expect similarity in the behavioral sets especially when the observed data show a clear pattern to explore the similarity and dissimilarity among agents behavioral sets we applied the k means clustering for agent classification and investigated the characteristics of the agent classes k means clustering is a classification algorithm that partitions data into k clusters agent classes and recursively assigns data to the cluster whose centroid is closest to the data point until the assignment is stabilized macqueen 1967 by analyzing the characteristics of the agent classes we can develop agent behavior typology and refine the assumptions about agents behaviors to a few common types to help visualization and interpretation we applied the principal component analysis to project data from a high dimensional parameter space into a lower dimensional subspace this is a common practice for clustering analysis to reduce dimensionality and extract information from high dimensional data sets aubert et al 2013 hannah et al 2000 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis sa methods applied in this paper are global sensitivity analysis methods which investigate the relationships between the parameters including equation coefficients thresholds and input forcing and outputs of a simulation model norton 2015 in our abm model an agent s parameters are related to its cognitive decision making process i e learning rate α discount rate γ exploration rate and regret and stochastic actions of water use adjustment i e mean μ and standard deviation σ the model output of interest is the abm s performance in simulating the observed water consumption measured by kge there are a variety of sa methods which can be categorized into five broad groups based on the underlying mathematical concepts perturbation and derivatives elementary effect ee correlation and regression analysis methods and variance based methods pianosi et al 2016 since the sas methods have different mathematical properties and purposes applying multiple sa methods is recommended ligmann zielinska et al 2020 wagener and pianosi 2019 therefore we implemented two widely applied sa methods the morris sa morris 1991 and the sobol sa sobol 2001 in this study as diagnostic tools to improve our understanding of the abm and guide future abm research the morris sa is an ee method that calculates the changes in model outputs for a unit change in a parameter i e the ee in contrast the sobol sa a variance based method uses two variance ratios for the importance of parameters saltelli et al 2010 the first sobol ratio called the first order index measures the direct contribution to the output variance from individual parameters or equivalently the expected variance reduction if a parameter s value could be fixed the second ratio called the total order index measures the overall contribution from a parameter including the direct effects and interactions with other parameters pianosi et al 2016 we applied the morris sa for model structure diagnosis based on the rationale that the parameters of a proper model should have moderate ee values a parameter with a low ee value means that the model may be over parameterized and can be simplified by removing the parameter as a screening method in contrast a parameter with a high ee value may signify a poor representation of the observed behaviors and a need to review the model structure meanwhile the two sobol indices are calculated for ranking the potentials for uncertainty reduction in the agents behavior modeling therefore the sobol indices can inform future research directions on the mechanisms associated with a sensitive parameter or the estimation of that parameter value additionally the two sas also have different experiment designs the morris method requires generating traces of samples a trace consists of n 1 samples n is the number of parameters in the parameter space and calculates the mean absolute elementary effects the sobol method adopts monte carlo sampling methods to generate parameter sets and compute two sensitivity indices the parameter sets for the two sas are generated independently following the methods experiment designs the mathematical definitions of the sas sensitivity indices are presented in text s2 supplementary information 3 results 3 1 monte carlo simulation for water scarcity uncertainty assessment following the procedure described in table 1 we assessed the kge values of the 2 000 parameter sets for each agent the results are presented in figs s2 and s3 supplementary information an agent s parameter sets with kge values higher than a threshold value are selected as the behavioral sets top 10 ranked parameter sets 200 sets per agent although the same 2000 parameter sets are evaluated for each agent the resulting kge value for each set varies from agent to agent due to agents diverse historical behaviors consequently each agent has its own behavior parameter sets due to the heavy computation burden for simulating the coupled model we composed only five scenarios for this analysis a scenario consists of 31 agents i e 31 parameter sets the agents parameter sets are selected from their own behavioral sets based on the kge rankings in doing so we can maintain heterogeneity in agents decision making and fair representations of their observed behaviors the kge rankings for the five scenarios are 1 25 50 75 and 99 rankings of the behavior sets respectively and for clarity the scenarios are named after the percentile values i e q1 q25 q50 q75 and q99 since kge measures how close the simulated results are to the observed data the scenarios represent hypotheses of how agents future behavior would deviate from their historical patterns that is the q99 scenario assumes that the agent s future behavior will be similar to the past while the q75 q50 and q25 scenarios represent futures where agents can behave somehow differently from the past the five scenarios are simulated from 2019 to 2060 under the same future flow condition sum of all inflows in the basin the solid line in fig 2 a a recovering trend from a drought condition to a normal condition the dashed line in fig 2a the future flow series is generated from historical observation resampling and has two significant drought years in 2033 and 2047 to assess water scarcity uncertainty we chose the basin storage monthly average storage of all dams in the crb and mexico delivery shortage year counts as system level performance metrics a shortage year is a year with the annual flow to mexico less than 1 9 billion m3 stated in the 1944 mexico treaty fig 2b shows the mexico delivery shortage years of the five scenarios each has 30 simulations which range from 13 the lower limit of the q99 scenario to 30 years the upper limit of the q50 scenario we can see a trend that the higher percentile scenario is more likely to have a lower number of shortage years except for the q1 scenario interestingly the q1 scenario the dark blue circles in fig 2c is more likely to have a higher mean basin storage larger x axis values than the other scenarios even though the predicted shortage years median is higher than scenarios q75 and q99 fig 2b this result can be partially attributed to the q1 scenario s higher inter annual variability in the basin storage larger y axis values resulting from the farmer characteristics i e agent parameter values to further investigate human impacts on basin storage variability we compare the water consumption of scenarios q1 and q99 aggregated to sub basin and basin levels as fig 3 shows moreover we highlighted three time periods in fig 3 by the orange boxes separated by the 2033 and 2047 droughts to facilitate the discussion in period a from 2019 to 2032 the water stored in the reservoirs is sufficient to satisfy water demands so agents continue to exploit water resources fig s4 supplementary information until 2033 the excessive water uses in period a and the significantly lower natural flow depletes water storage in the basin resulting in a deep plunge in the basin and sub basin water consumption because the reservoirs are depleted agents have to adapt to the reduced water supply in period b to restore basin storage we named this period b the adaptation period for the substantial changes in the water system although agents in the three periods are active learning either for exploiting or conserving water resources in both scenarios the water consumption in the sub basins shows different patterns the ub consumption gradually recovers to the pre adaptation level while the lb consumption recovers to a lower than pre adaptation level the lb agents mainly rely on water flow release from lake mead which will be low in water storage after the 2033 drought so they need to restrain their water uses whereas many ub agents have access to the natural flow and can return to their normal water uses as long as the precipitation is within the normal conditions furthermore although the ub consumption patterns are much alike in the two scenarios we can see that the ub consumption in the q1 scenario has a higher recovering rate i e the slope of the water consumption than in the q99 scenario besides the wider band when another severe drought occurs in 2047 it triggers another round of adaptation in the crb and announces the arrival of the post adaptation period c given the experience of the adaptation period b agents are in a better position to cope with the shortage consequently the crb and the sub basin water consumption can quickly recover to the adaptation period level or higher the results of the two scenarios are very similar in this period except that the uncertainty measured by the range i e maximum minimum is higher in the q99 scenario this implies that agents in both scenarios may have similar water use strategies when the natural flow returns to the normal condition but some agents of the q99 scenario may learn more diverse strategies in the simulations for the wider bandwidth the difference between q1 and q99 is due to our assumptions about farmers characteristics i e agent parameter values fig 4 shows 31 agents parameter distributions parameter ranges are normalized to 0 1 range for the ease of reading in the two scenarios where the main difference lies in the probability of taking an exploration action and regrets a penalty for undersupply the q1 scenario s high exploration rate results in the higher consumption variability in periods a and b whereas the low exploration rate and high regret of the q99 scenario can explain the diverging trajectories in period c fig 4 also demonstrates that the scenario generation process can effectively generate distinct agent compositions while maintaining agent heterogeneity our analysis illustrates that the assumptions about farmers adaptation behaviors can substantially influence system level water scarcity outcomes however farmers adaptation depends on their perceptions of future water availability after shortages and their willingness to adapt both are controlled by the abm parameters it is important to note that learning and adaptation occur at the farmer agent level and can differ from farmer to farmer depending on their local environment and characteristics 3 2 clustering and principal component analyses for human behavior uncertainty assessment following the uncertainty analysis in section 3 1 we used the behavioral sets identified by the performance thresholds as the input data for clustering each agent has 200 behavioral sets the analysis includes two steps first we mapped the behavioral sets to a 2 dimensional principal component space using principal component analysis jolliffe 1986 for visual presentation and interpretation the principal components pcs are linear transformations of the original parameter space normalized to the range of 0 to 1 so that the pcs are linear uncorrelated the pcs are orthogonal directions with the high variance numbered conventionally by order of variance explained table 2 shows the coefficients of the linear transformation function of the two pcs pc1 mainly emphasizes the action parameters μ and σ and pc2 is related to the adaptation parameters α γ and regret a variable s coefficient close to zero means that the variable has little contribution to the pc based on the features of the pcs we named pc1 the boldness in action and pc2 the willingness to adapt then we tested the k means clustering by setting the number of clusters from 2 to 5 and found that three clusters yielded the most meaningful results the clustering performance results are shown in figs s5 and s6 supplementary information fig 5 shows the behavioral sets assigned to one of the three clusters prudent forward looking and bold the clusters naming is based on their mean parameter values which are shown at the bottom of fig 5 the prudent agents orange circles are cautious in adjusting amounts of water use low μ and σ inclined to conserve water after water shortages high regret and more willing to explore new strategies high the forward looking agents blue circles consider the value of future water high γ and deliberate in adaptation to environmental changes low α and whereas the bold agents green circles prefer making substantial adjustments in their water use high μ σ and α and do not regret nor value future water as much low γ and regret assuming each parameter set is equally likely to be a good representation of an agent s decision making we can then calculate the probabilities of an agent being assigned to each cluster tables s2 and s3 supplementary information for example fig 6 right shows the clustering results of two agents wy in the ub and welltonmohawkidd in the lb and the probabilities are calculated based on the point counts of the clusters the wy sets are mostly assigned to the bold or forward looking while the majority of the welltonmohawkidd sets are classified as the prudent fig 6 left shows the pie charts of the results aggregated to the state level and weighted by agents water consumption in 2018 the agents simulated may consist of many farmers in reality and therefore the classification results are weighted by the water consumption when aggregated to the state level the pie charts show that ub agents are likely to be categorized as either the bold or forward looking agents while the lb agents are likely to be assigned to the prudent cluster the classification and probability analysis of agent type can provide qualitative information about farmers adaptation behavior for example an agent may show prudent behaviors due to either the agent s own thinking or the institutional constraints explicitly modeling the institutional constraints can eliminate the latter and help us focus on agents thinking this will be a future research direction additionally other clustering algorithms may generate different results the comparison of multiple algorithms for better characterization can be another future research topic 3 3 morris and sobol sas for human behavior model diagnoses this section presents the results of two sas due to the high computation cost of the abm evaluation we limited the sample size for the sas to between 1 000 and 2 000 samples the model output selected for the sas is the kge and the parameters are sampled from the ranges listed in table s1 in supplementary information in morris sa an insensitive parameter i e a low mean value of ee means that the abm s output does not depend on the parameter value any value in the parameter range of that parameter would generate a similar result contrarily a sensitive parameter i e a high mean value of ee indicates that the abm performance is sensitive to the parameter value fig 7 shows the morris sa results on a scatter plot and each circle represents a parameter s ee of an agent total 186 circles 31 agents 6 parameters the numerical results are presented in tables s4 and s5 in supplementary information the circles are colored orange and blue to indicate the ub and lb agents parameters respectively we can see that the ees of the parameters vary in a wide range which suggests heterogeneity in farmers characteristics to improve our understanding of agents behaviors we examined the historical diversion data starting from the extremes we use hopitribe and powers as two examples to explain why abm performance is sensitive or insensitive to the changes in the parameter values the abm is designed to simulate changes in behavior through adaptive learning since the hopitribe shows no obvious changes in its water uses its performance would worsen when the parameters suggest more adaptation or a significant change hopitribe s high std is the result of applying a non linear abm to predict a rather linear behavior in contrast the powers has steady water use and a decreasing trend after a significant drop the abm training process is to equip an agent with initial strategies in the case of a simple trend like the powers agents can easily learn good strategies from training and perform well regardless of what the parameter values are when the abm performs well in capturing a farmer s adaptation behavior the parameters generally have moderate ees 0 2 0 4 as shown by mohavevalleyidd in fig 7 moreover we can see that the circles exhibit a linear relationship between the means and standard deviations stds of the ee values which implies a scale effect in the parameters ee distributions large stds also suggest the presence significant non linear effects iooss and lemaître 2015 interestingly the orange circles i e ub agents also show a linear relationship but some of the circles significantly deviate from the linear trend line fig 7 since performance metric kge is a composite metric of correlation mean and variance ratios between simulated and observed data parameters deviated from the trend line are indicators of the agents complex behaviors that require further investigation to investigate what abm parameters may require further attention we showed the same results color coded for parameters instead of sub basins in fig 8 we can see that regret blue asterisk orange square and α light blue diamond are more likely to deviate from the trend line this finding suggests non linear and non stationary mechanisms in the penalty exploration and learning behaviors in addition the magnitude of the mean ee values y axis indicates the potential abrupt twists in the agents historical water consumption patterns when the observation data has an evident change it is crucial for the model to capture the timing of the change failure to capture timing can result in a plunge in model performance measured by kge because the trajectory would be very different fig 9 shows the sobol sa results of the ub agents and the largest five agents in terms of water consumption in the lb the numerical results are presented in tables s6 and s7 in supplementary information since sobol sa is a variance based method σ the standard deviation of the water use change and the random exploration rate are expected to have higher first order sobol index values the statement is generally true for the lb agents but the results show that regret and α are also important parameters for many ub agents this finding implies that being able to adapt may be crucial for simulating ub agents historical water use patterns moreover suppose the parameters do not have significant interactions i e the higher order terms are close to 0 in that case the sum of an agent s first order indices and the sum of the total order indices should be close to 1 therefore the sum of the first order indices substantially deviates from 1 is an indicator of strong non linearity e g ut3 and az in the ub and crir az and yumamesa idd in the lb the total order sobol indices represent the variances contributed by a parameter and its interactions with other parameters this information can guide research to reduce the uncertainty of an agent s simulation performance for example regret is the most sensitive parameter in terms of the total order sobol index for many ub agents and if we can improve the regret estimations by collecting data and evidence of human cognitive thinking we can significantly reduce the uncertainty in modeling ub agents adaptation behaviors for the five lb agents future research should focus on σ and to improve understanding of agents water consumption variability and reasons to deviate from the agents normal water consumption patterns in addition from fig 9 we can see that co3 and crir az exhibit very different patterns in both sobol indices compared to other agents in the sub basin further investigation of these agents behaviors can be one of the future directions when comparing the morris and sobol methods results we observed that the two methods identify different sensitive parameters the first order sobol indices indicate σ and as the most influential parameters the total order sobol indices highlight regret and α for the ub agents and σ for the five lb agents and the morris method predicts the agent s parameter ees in a cluster these different results of sensitive parameters confirm that multiple sa methods should be used to investigate abm efficacy in representing farmers adaptation behaviors from multiple aspects future research can consider exploring the broad spectrum of the sa methods for abm model diagnosis 4 discussion the results of the three analyses can inform policy development and shed light on future water management and climate adaptation research in the crb below we discussed the lessons learned from the numerical experiments and the limitations 4 1 uncertainty analysis for exploration and improving understanding previously in section 3 1 we have shown that water storage shortages and consumption uncertainties at basin level can vary with the scenarios and abm parameterization figs 2 and 3 to further investigate the adaptation uncertainty effects at the sub basin level we summarized the water consumption results of the five scenarios in figs 10 and 11 and compared the results with the 2018 water consumption the boxplots in fig 10 indicate the higher water consumption uncertainty in the ub than the lb within and across scenarios fig 11 shows the time series plots of the ub and lb water consumptions in the q99 scenario stacked on top of the uncertainty band of all five scenarios as an example of the uncertainty propagation through time in the scenarios fig 10 we can see that the ub water consumption has substantial increases although in varying degrees while the lb consumption is always well below the 2018 consumption level the reasons are twofold first the ub water consumption has not yet reached the annual allowance of 9 25 billion m3 so the ub agents can continue to expand consumption except for the severe drought years in 2033 2043 and 2047 fig 11 in contrast the lb consumption in 2018 had already reached the 9 25 billion m3 allowance which left limited room for agents to expand their consumption second the severe water shortage in 2033 would deplete the basin storage which would result in a serious water security crisis for the lb agents for losing the stable water supply from lake mead moreover since water in the crb is originated from the mountain area in the ub the ub agents will have priority access to the water until its consumption reaches the sub basin allowance consequently the ub agents can continue to increase water consumption while the lb agents need to curtail consumption due to the limited available water after 2034 fig 11 however whether this is an economic and equitable distribution of the water resources under these shortage conditions may require further discussions and renegotiation among the stakeholders in the basin to tackle the water security issues 4 2 policy implications for human adaptation and water scarcity the crb s first tier water shortage declaration in august 2021 has stirred discussions on water conservation in the seven states consequently the water supplies to arizona and nevada are reduced by 18 and 7 of their total allocations respectively starting in 2022 according to the drought contingency plan without substantial actions for water conservation further curtailment would soon be needed as suggested by the simulation results fig 11 education programs can be effective tools to promote water conservation by triggering substantial learning that leads to water consumption behavior changes the coupled model can be applied to assess when we need behavior changes to happen and to what degree the learning parameters α γ and regret in our abm control how quickly agents respond to environmental changes therefore we can simulate the desired parameter values and design education programs to facilitate the transition moreover the classification results provide a basis for making assumptions about the evolution of agents decision making in response to the policies the abm can be applied to assess various policy combinations and assumptions to facilitate the discussion about the evolution in farmers irrigation behaviors and design policy accordingly to guide and quicken the evolution one example could be some education programs that convert bold agents to forward looking or prudent agents however research may be needed to further investigate farmers attitudes toward climate change to reduce the uncertainties in human behavior modeling including the model structure and parameter uncertainties and design education programs to change farmers perceptions the coupled abm crss is suitable for assisting such soft policy designs as demonstrated in a previous study hung and yang 2021 although the soft policy alone may not solve the water scarcity problem it can delay the decline in water storage for policymakers to generate solutions such as water right allocation renegotiation and water markets if the basin continues to stay in drought conditions due to climate change renegotiation of the water allocation will be needed for adaptation gerlak et al 2021 udall and overpeck 2017 one can only be proactive in tackling the water scarcity problem if one recognizes that the decline in water supply is ongoing and not temporary furthermore the timing of the actions is critical early actions to conserve water will help maintain reservoir storage at a more resilient level for climate adaptation and renegotiation failing to act promptly will cause an increased risk of depleting reservoirs as fig s4 shows and drive the basin to intense competition among water users our results suggest that it may be time to shift the water management paradigm from supply focus to risk focus to strengthen crb s adaptation capacity 4 3 limitations and future research directions the abm applied in this study simulates human decision making as stochastic processes to account for the inherent randomness and our insufficient knowledge about human behavior since the historical data is merely a single realization of many possibilities the abm parameterization should be viewed as an assumption of how agriculture irrigation consumption patterns may change in the future in the uncertainty analysis fig 3 we showed the extent of future water consumption in the crb could differ from the historical pattern the results can serve as a basis for future discussions on climate change adaptation and water resources management additionally the modeling results indicate that farmers would actively conserve water after substantial water shortages box b in fig 3 however in reality whether the water supply cuts starting in 2022 can trigger farmers adaptation for water conservation and synchronize the co evolution of the human and natural systems in the crb still need to be verified in fact studies of human behavioral modeling should be continuous and adaptive with new data and research findings becoming accessible we will be able to reduce the water scarcity uncertainty validate the results and improve the model s prediction regional survey and interview studies can be a complement to the clustering and sensitivity analyses and improve our understanding to reduce epistemic uncertainties from the technical perspective we summarize four future directions for quantifying and managing uncertainties in abms first sensitivity analyses for coupled abm crss are computationally expansive for the exponential growth in simulations with the increase of parameters future works can consider developing fully integrated models and utilizing high performance computing to improve the accuracy of the sensitivity indices second many sampled parameter sets performed poorly in the case study due to the model structure uncertainty and including these parameter sets can obscure the implications of the analysis studies suggest applying screening methods to refine behavioral parameter space pianosi et al 2016 wagener and pianosi 2019 yet methods that systematically generate the behavioral parameter space are still not seen in the literature except for the simple threshold method pappenberger et al 2008 developing screening methods for sensitivity analyses is one of our future directions third the results of the clustering analysis may not always be clear cut for example the agents circles in fig 5 located next to the cluster borderlines may exhibit significantly different behaviors than those agents close to the centroid of that cluster the ambiguity may be partially attributed to the limitations of the k means clustering method future research will apply more sophisticated clustering algorithms such as gaussian mixture models reynolds et al 2000 to further explore the farmers characterization finally our abm only considers agriculture water use uncertainty and does not include other uncertainties in human systems such as population growth crop selections irrigation practices agriculture yields and food preference future research may incorporate other decisions and uncertainties in human systems modeling additionally we will consider investigating the impacts of current buy and dry practices and water leasing in the crb on water resources management in the long run 5 conclusions the colorado river basin crb is a complex non linear stochastic and dynamic coupled human natural system while those features are recognized in the literature sivapalan et al 2012 vogel et al 2015 most modeling studies have focused on the hydrological processes and overlooked the importance of the human counterpart such compromises in model development are inevitable due to the presence of high complexity and deep uncertainty hadjimichael et al 2020b quinn et al 2020 with the looming water crisis in the basin it is critical to incorporate the human response and manage the water scarcity uncertainty in developing climate adaptation policy this paper complements the existing natural process focused studies by investigating human water system interactions and the uncertainties in the human system with three numerical experiments uncertainty clustering and sensitivity analyses our contributions include quantifying water scarcity uncertainty in the crb caused by human adaptation exploring farmers decision making typology based on historical data and identifying opportunities to reduce model structure and parameter uncertainties in human behavior modeling the results of the uncertainty analysis reveal the escalating water scarcity and an urgent need for changes in water management in the basin the clustering analysis provides probabilistic information on farmers irrigation behavior characterization in the crb moreover our results indicate that farmers in the upper basin tend to change their water uses in response to climate signals whereas in the lower basin farmers are more cautious in adjusting their water uses our findings in clustering analysis suggest that water conservation programs can be more effective if we tailor management programs based on farmers characteristics the sensitivity analyses highlight the opportunity for future research on human behavioral modeling in the crb findings from the morris sa indicate a need to review the abm structure for agents with highly sensitive or insensitive parameters e g hopitribe and powers whereas the sobol sa quantifies individual parameters contribution to the outcome uncertainty thus signifying the potential for uncertainty reduction although the results of these analyses may not be directly applicable to policy making yet they form a foundation for policy discussion regarding human response and adaptation furthermore modeling human adaptation and quantifying the uncertainty of the co evolution in coupled human natural systems are critical research fields for coping with water scarcity issues in major river basins we demonstrated that the uncertainty clustering and sensitivity analyses could be applied to coupled human natural system models to quantify and manage the uncertainty our immediate future work will focus on improving human behavior modeling and scenario selection design for water scarcity uncertainty analysis another future research direction is to include climate uncertainty to provide a holistic view of water scarcity in the crb credit authorship contribution statement fengwei hung conceptualization methodology software visualization writing

3149,the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation can change the hydrogeological flow system in karst areas however how to overcome the heterogeneity in karst aquifers and accurately evaluate the impacts of tunnel excavation on karst groundwater flow field and resources remains largely unknown in this study through geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and test and observations in 4 years the depth scale and spatial distribution of underground river conduits and hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation are obtained and the groundwater flow field before and after tunnel excavation was established by visual modflow observation and simulation indicate that two ponds 5 epikarst springs 1 borehole 1 railway tunnel and the underground river system were affected during tunnel excavation the drainage effect of tunnel is more significant in dry season three depression cones are formed and there is a drawdown of 10 30 m due to the tunnel excavation the simulation results predict that the drainage effect is more significant when the tunnels are below the groundwater level in the dry season driven by the increase of precipitation and tunnel drainage the seasonal variation of underground river discharge is exacerbated and the groundwater level near the tunnel in the rainy season is lower than that in the dry season which is opposite to that in natural state the groundwater flow budget calculation and prediction suggest that the net loss of groundwater storage was 6 1 105 m3 during tunnel excavation and the net loss of groundwater storage is about 1 7 105 m3 one year after the tunnels were completed and meanwhile the depression cones continue to expand the increase of precipitation raises the groundwater level and alleviates the drainage effect but the increased precipitation recharge is less than groundwater discharge and tunnel drainage so there is still a loss of groundwater storage it is difficult to restore the groundwater flow field and discharge in a short time this study provides evidence and a useful method to quantitatively evaluate the effects of tunnel excavation on the groundwater flow field and to inform better measures to protect karst groundwater resources keywords karst groundwater flow field tunnel excavation modeling karst trough valley 1 introduction karst aquifers as a source of drinking water to almost a quarter of the world s population are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and human impacts due to their unique hydrogeological characteristics ford and williams 2007 efficient transport relies strongly on road and railway tunnels in karst areas both for long distance traffic and in metropolitan areas butscher et al 2011 tunnels drilled through karst areas often cause many problems e g water inrush karst collapse and groundwater drawdown inflows to tunnels reduce the groundwater level kim et al 2001 expand the groundwater supply boundary vincenzi et al 2009 and thus change the natural hydrogeological flow around the tunnel in recent decades many efforts have focused on developing more sophisticated analytical solutions to estimate the water inflow during tunneling goodman et al 1965 el tani 2003 perrochet 2005 kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 el tani 2010 coli and pinzani 2014 maréchal et al 2014 using more reasonable methods to evaluate the impacts of tunnel excavation on water resources and hydrological processes laura et al 2003 vincenzi et al 2014 chiu and chia 2012 mossmark et al 2015 trying more accurate models to simulate the groundwater flow around tunnels butscher et al 2011 butscher 2012 koyama et al 2012 xia et al 2018 hadi and arash 2018 zhang et al 2019 scheidler et al 2019 li et al 2020 and using tree ring and isotope methods to track the changes in plant production rates and physiological processes caused by groundwater drawdown zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2019 cao et al 2020 continuous and high resolution monitoring can reflect the real time changes in surface water and groundwater due to tunnel excavation however because of the heterogeneity of karst groundwater and the inadequate number of boreholes and natural springs near tunnel sites the groundwater flow field must be partially studied by groundwater simulation software hydrological modeling has been used for simulations of underground water flow regimes or seepage fields under the influence of tunnels raposo et al 2010 chen et al 2020 for example visual modflow developed by the united states geological survey usgs is widely used in this approach the groundwater flow is described by the continuity and momentum balance equations that are mostly based on darcy s law zheng et al 2020 under more complex groundwater flow conditions non darcian flows have also been considered chen et al 2020 based on the partial differential equation that describes groundwater flow visual modflow has become a valuable tool for studying water resources in karst aquifers nevertheless the turbulence and flow in karst conduits have not been considered in view of the karst water system with the coexistence of conduits fractures and pores this model has been optimized and improved e g modflow cfp and demonstrated to be effective in recent years shoemaker et al 2008 hill et al 2010 hu et al 2012 gallegos et al 2013 chang et al 2015 giese et al 2018 zargham et al 2018 aliouache et al 2019 however although modflow cfp can calculate the flow process of different nodes it does not consider the hydrodynamic process inside the conduit and the description of the conduit characteristics is relatively vague it is assumed that the conduits are relatively uniform aqueous media and the heterogeneity is ignored in the selection of relevant parameters regardless of which model is used the accuracy of the karst conduit parameters is the key to the effectiveness of the model geophysical prospecting technology is an effective means to analyze underground karst to determine the depth shape and spatial distribution of underground river conduits many explorations have been carried out by using magnetotelluric sounding eh4 the high density resistivity method the transient electromagnetic method tem the shallow seismic reflection method the audio magnetotelluric method amt electrical resistivity tomography ert etc and the combination of different methods has proven to be effective in different cases li et al 2008 gan et al 2010 mastrocicco et al 2010 parsekian et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hydrogeological drilling can verify the interpretation of geophysical prospecting and directly reflect the characteristics of underground karst tracer tests pumping tests and water pressure tests are common methods used to obtain hydrogeological parameters vincenzi et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 therefore the location shape characteristics and hydrogeological parameters of karst conduits should be found out by the combination of geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and various hydrogeological tests and the hydrogeological model established in this way can be more effective studies have shown that tunnel excavation affects karst groundwater resources and flow field attanayake and waterman 2006 moon and jeong 2011 lv et al 2020 first tunnel drainage destroys the aquifer structure then surface water and groundwater drain forming a depression cone which expands with drainage time until the tunnel drainage fully accounts for the recharge from the boundary and therefore the groundwater flow field and water resources are changed however due to the complexity of karst geological structures and the multidirectional heterogeneity of karst groundwater the changes of karst groundwater flow field groundwater resources and hydrological process caused by groundwater drawdown remain largely unknown and the response of karst hydrogeological systems to tunnel drainage may be more complex than expected as an open dynamic system the changes of karst groundwater are highly sensitive to external climatic conditions at seasonal monthly daily or even hourly scales white 2007 liu et al 2007 driven by the external environment and human engineering activities the karst groundwater system may be more sensitive the change of precipitation may aggravate or alleviate the impact of tunnel excavation on karst groundwater therefore it is necessary to predict and evaluate the response of karst groundwater flow field and discharge to precipitation under the condition of tunnel interference besides many studies believe that after the completion of the tunnel lining the tunnel will no longer provide drainage or the drainage will be very small and the groundwater level and storage will return to the previous state gisbert et al 2009 zheng et al 2020 actually karst conduits and fissures were exposed in the process of tunnel excavation and more fissures appeared because of the impact of blasting vibration so the hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity in the tunnel site area changed accordingly therefore whether the groundwater resources and groundwater flow field can be restored remains to be clarified in this study based on geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and tests and observations in 4 years the depth scale and spatial distribution of underground river conduits and hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation are obtained and the groundwater flow field before and after tunnel excavation was established by visual modflow in a karst trough valley in southwest china here the following objects were addressed to reveal the variation process of tunnel drainage groundwater level and discharge through high resolution observation to quantitatively evaluate the change of groundwater flow field and the loss of groundwater storage through simulation and calculation of the groundwater flow budget to identify the response of groundwater level and discharge to precipitation under tunnel interference through simulation and predication to analyze the recovery of groundwater resources through simulation and predication of the groundwater flow budget this study will provide a better scientific basis for the planning site selection and construction decision making associated with tunnels in karst areas 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the mingyuexia karst trough valley 106 48 52 106 59 06 e 29 38 52 29 54 47 n which has an area of 63 56 km2 is located in the southern part of the mingyue mountains in northeastern chongqing southwest china fig 1 the regional climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1100 mm approximately 65 of precipitation occurs during the rainy season from may to september and a mean annual air temperature of 18 c the mingyuexia karst trough valley is located in the mingyuexia anticline extends north south and consists of a karst valley in the middle and two ridges on both sides the karst valley which is composed of carbonate rocks corresponding to the lower triassic daye t1 d and jialingjiang formations t1 j and the middle triassic leikoupo formation t2 l is located at the axis of the anticline with an elevation of 450 600 m fig 1 the ridges and slopes which are composed of clastic rocks corresponding to the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj and jurassic j strata are located on the wings of the anticline with an elevation range of 350 700 m this karst valley is approximately 27 km long and 2 km wide due to differential dissolution three parallel secondary valleys have formed in the eastern middle and western areas fig 1 horizontally the northern surface watershed 600 850 m above sea level is the recharge boundary of the groundwater system in the mingyuexia karst trough valley and the underground river in the south is the only outlet of the groundwater system which discharges into the yulin river 180 200 m above sea level the sandstone and shale of the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj on the eastern and western sides form the water separation boundary vertically the mudstone of the lower triassic feixianguan formations t1 f is the floor that separates the water and the limestone dolomite and argillaceous limestone of the lower triassic daye t1 d and jialingjiang formations t1 j and the middle triassic leikoupo formation t2 l are aquifers with thicknesses of 480 500 m many vertical open fractures in the limestone and dolomite in the valley provide the basic conditions for the formation of karst depressions and sinkholes rainwater and surface water quickly enter the karst aquifer through sinkholes fissures or shafts and the water then migrates from north to south and finally discharge in the form of karst springs or underground rivers before tunnel excavation there were 30 epikarst springs 0 5 l s and 1 underground river 45 1800 l s in the karst trough valley three karst branch conduits of the underground river are present in the three secondary karst valleys and converge to form a main conduit in the south which intersects and discharges into the yulin river with an outlet elevation of 185 m 2 2 tunnel excavation in the mingyuexia karst trough valley the mingyue mountains are located on the northeastern edge of the chongqing metropolitan area and the mountain range is an obstacle to urban expansion and external communication the construction of tunnels is an inevitable choice for urban development the mingyue tunnels are double track tunnels that are part of the third ring expressway in chongqing with lengths of 3220 m and 3270 m elevations of 260 290 m and a maximum depth of 380 m the tunnels were excavated from both ends toward the middle simultaneously and construction started in march 2018 and was completed in october 2020 the tunnels pass through mudstone sandstone and shale of the jurassic and upper triassic xujiahe formations and limestone of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation with maximum water inflows of 6 25 l s and 17 36 l s respectively fig 2 two north south directed underground river conduits p1 and p2 were exposed and were 11 12 m high and 5 m wide in july and september 2019 the underground water flowed into the mingyue tunnels from the karst conduit south of p1 after precipitation with a flow of 11 1 l s while the conduit north of p1 and p2 had no water inflow two other parallel railway tunnels in the karst trough valley cross the mingyue tunnels in plan view fig 1 but they are vertically 15 30 m higher the chongqing wanzhou railway tunnel was completed in 2014 and has an elevation of 301 m which is above the groundwater level a large number of dry karst caves were encountered during the construction period without a large amount of flowing water and there is currently no drainage the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel was completed in 2013 and has an elevation of 301 m which is above the groundwater level and the tunnel water inflow measured in december 2017 was 25 397 l s some epikarst springs dried up or were reduced after the excavation of these two tunnels 2 3 data acquisition hydrogeological surveys typical geological sections and cave measurements were performed in the hydrogeological unit of the mingyue tunnels to determine the karstification aquifer thickness water yield recharge runoff discharge conditions discharge and water level of different water bodies before tunnel excavation there are 34 observation stations on the northern and southern sides of the mingyue tunnels including 4 ponds 17 springs 1 underground river and 3 skylights 1 railway tunnel 1 manual observation station in a coal mine tunnel 6 automatic groundwater level observation stations in boreholes and 3 automatic rainfall stations fig 1 table 1 moreover the water inflows at the 4 exits and entrances of the mingyue tunnels under construction were observed in real time these observation stations constitute a monitoring network covering supply runoff and discharge areas and the data can reflect the changes in the karst groundwater flow field the discharge and water level are recorded by a triangular weir rectangular weir and water level gauge in the manual observation station once every 3 5 days with an accuracy of 0 5 mm the rainfall and water level are observed by a water level precipitation integrated automatic observation station yt yt 0100 or a water level automatic observation station yt yl 0300 once every half an hour with an accuracy of 0 1 mm from march 2018 to october 2021 9500 manually observed discharge and water level data and 42 000 automatically observed water level and rainfall data were obtained the precipitation infiltration coefficients α of different strata are calculated by measuring the discharge of springs and underground rivers in the dry season the thickness of different strata is obtained by measuring the stratigraphic profile the depth scale and spatial distribution of karst conduits are identified through geophysical exploration and hydrogeological boreholes and the permeability coefficients k are obtained by pumping tests and water pressure tests in 2021 21 boreholes sw1 sw21 were drilled in the study area the hydrogeological parameters and water level after tunnel excavation are mainly from these boreholes 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 conceptual model and boundary conditions visual modflow was developed by waterloo hydraulic inc in canada and is based on modflow software 1984 of the usgs in this paper we use visual modflow to simulate three dimensional saturated flow the karst aquifers of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation t1 j lower triassic daye formation t1 d and middle leikoupo formation t2 l are the main target layers of the simulation and they can be generalized into heterogeneous anisotropic phreatic confined water aquifers with unified groundwater levels the permeability of groundwater in the jurassic j strata upper triassic xujiahe formation t3xj and feixianguan formations t1 f is poor so these strata are treated as aquicludes horizontally according to the groundwater level monitoring results the maximum impact range of the tunnel is 7 1 km in the north so the surface watershed which is 8 km from the mingyue tunnels is taken as the northern boundary of the simulation area the first kind boundary γ1 the outlet of the underground river s1 is the discharge boundary in the south the second kind boundary γ2 some springs in the study area drained due to the construction of the two railway tunnels before 2013 at present the flow of surface karst springs in the study area is mostly less than 0 1l s table 1 accounting for a very small ratio of the underground river outlet flow 45 1800 l s therefore the underground river outlet is taken as the only outlet of this groundwater system in this study there is no hydraulic connection between the pond and groundwater so the pond is not used as a source or sink item during modeling the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj on the eastern and western sides is treated as impervious boundaries and the simulated area is 17 38 km2 vertically the feixianguan formation t1 f is an aquiclude and it is also the bottom boundary of the shallow groundwater system the average elevation of the top of the feixianguan formation t1 f in the simulation area is approximately 0 m burial depth of 450 800 m therefore the elevation of 0 above sea level is taken as the bottom boundary of the hydrogeological model the hydrogeological system is recharged by precipitation the surface topography as interpolated with a 30 m 30 m horizontal resolution is taken as the top boundary the hydrogeological map of the simulation area is shown in fig 3 2 4 2 mathematical model groundwater flow is generalized into heterogeneous isotropic and unstable groundwater flow systems the corresponding mathematical model is established as follows 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w u s h t h x y t t 0 h 0 x y x y d h x y z t γ 1 h x y z t x y z γ 1 t 0 k h n γ 2 q x y z t x y z γ 2 t 0 where kx ky and kz are the values of the permeability coefficients in the x y and z directions respectively h is the groundwater level w is the discharge per unit volume us is the specific storage t is the time d is the simulation area γ1 is the boundary with a fixed water head γ2 is the boundary with a fixed water flow n is the outer normal direction on the boundary and q is the discharge 2 4 3 geological and hydrogeological parameters eight geological profiles were measured in the simulation area fig 3 the thickness of the daye formation t1 d is 161 221 m the thickness of the jialingjiang formation t1 j is 397 419 m the thickness of the leikoupo formation t2 l is 19 113 m the thickness of the xujiahe formation t3 xj is 372 419 m the thickness of the ziliujing formation including the zhenzhuchong formation j1 zl is 377 404 4 m and the thickness of the xintiangou formation j2 x is between 111 118 m the precipitation was obtained from 10 springs and the precipitation infiltration coefficient was calculated formula 2 from discharge measurements in the dry season before tunnel excavation december 2017 and after tunnel excavation december 2020 before and after tunnel excavation the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the jurassic stratum j is 0 03 the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the sandstone section in the xujiahe formation t3 xj 2 t3 xj 4 t3 xj 6 is 0 18 and 0 2 respectively the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the mudstone section in the xujiahe formation t3 xj 1 t3 xj 3 t3 xj 5 is 0 03 and the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the leikoupo formation t2 l is 0 35 and 0 4 and the precipitation infiltration coefficients of the jialingjiang formation t1 j are 0 48 and 0 50 respectively 2 α i 3 15 q i 0 1 h f i where α i is the precipitation infiltration coefficient q i is the spring discharge in the dry season l s f i is the drainage area of spring km2 and h is the annual precipitation mm the permeability coefficient k is obtained from the pumping tests and water pressure tests performed in the 26 boreholes table 2 based on the permeability coefficients of boreholes zk1 zk3 and boreholes dk1 dk3 the initial value of the permeability coefficient in the simulation area is determined via interpolation before the excavation of the mingyue tunnels based on the permeability coefficients of boreholes sw1 sw21 the initial value of the permeability coefficient in the simulation area is determined interpolation after the excavation of the mingyue tunnels then further correction and comprehensive values are taken according to the characteristics of underground river conduits 2 4 4 tunnels and underground river conduits the underground river system consists of three karst branch conduits which are located in three secondary karst trough valleys to determine the characteristics of underground karst fractures conduits and caves geophysical prospecting was carried out by using magnetotelluric sounding eh4 tem and the high density resistivity method five magnetotelluric sounding profiles were created each with a length of approximately 2 km a point distance of 20 m and a depth of 650 m fig 3 then the high density resistivity method and tem are used for correction the formation lithology in the lower part of the survey line is determined according to the trend reflected by the resistivity chromatogram and the karst characteristics or groundwater enrichment is judged according to the significant difference in resistivity between the center and both sides or the low resistance closed circle the spatial distribution of underground karst fractures conduits and caves is shown in table 2 the elevation of karst conduits in the western trough valley is 203 450 m the elevation of karst conduits in the middle trough valley is 208 349 m and the elevation of karst conduits in the eastern trough valley is 225 350 m the lowest depth of karst conduits is in the middle trough valley followed by the eastern trough valley and the western trough valley the karst conduit in the middle trough valley should be considered the main conduit of the underground river system the epikarst zone in the western trough valley is the largest to further explore the spatial distribution and scale of karst conduits and verify the interpretation results of geophysical prospecting 26 hydrogeological boreholes were drilled around the three underground conduits fig 3 the core from a borehole can directly reflect the location and scale of underground karst conduits and caves fig 4 according to the drilling records karst caves and conduits are mainly present in the jialingjiang formation t1 j and decrease in abundance with increasing depth from the recharge area to the discharge area the elevations of karst caves and conduits are between 500 570 m 400 460 m and 350 365 m the stable water level in boreholes can represent the regional groundwater level analysis of the water levels in the boreholes table 2 shows that the groundwater level in the western trough valley is higher than those in the middle trough valley and the eastern trough valley in the runoff area the groundwater level in the middle trough valley is higher than that in the eastern trough valley while in the recharge area the opposite is true in summary based on hydrogeological surveys geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and tests the depth scale and spatial distribution of karst caves fracture zones and conduits are obtained the elevation of the underground river conduit is 450 500 m recharge area 300 350 m runoff area and 180 250 m discharge area the permeability coefficients k near the underground river conduit are assigned according to the maximum values of the pumping test or regional empirical values and then they are simulated and verified according to the observation value of the water level in the borehole finally the permeability coefficient k near the underground river conduit is inverted the corrected values of the permeability coefficient at different depths in each stratum are shown in table 3 the permeability coefficient k of the target layer is 0 25 0 72 m d there are three tunnels in the simulation area namely the chongqing wanzhou railway tunnels chongqing lichuan railway tunnels and mingyue tunnels there is only a small amount of water seepage in the chongqing wanzhou railway tunnels which can be ignored the drainage in the chongqing lichuan railway tunnels is 17 514 27 524 l s according to the construction observation records of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnels there are three main water inflow sections three virtual boreholes are set in these water inflow sections and the pumping capacity of a single borehole is approximately 400 1500 m3 d similarly seven virtual boreholes are set in the main water inflow sections of the mingyue tunnels and the pumping capacity of a single borehole is approximately 100 1500 m3 d with the plugging of the water inflow section in the mingyue tunnels the water inflow has decreased and the pumping capacity of the borehole has decreased accordingly 2 4 5 modeling based on the 8 measured stratigraphic sections in the simulation area virtual boreholes are set up at the intersection between the section and the main stratigraphic interface thus a 3d geological model of the model area is established fig 5 in plan view the simulation area is divided into 130 rows and 75 columns with a total of 9750 grid cells 2 4 6 model calibration based on the hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation the models before and after tunnel excavation are established respectively to test the consistency between the temporal and spatial distribution of the groundwater flow field in the initial model and the measured value model calibration is needed the water levels in boreholes zk1 zk3 and dk1 dk3 before excavation of the mingyue tunnels are selected as the reference values for model calibration and the water levels in boreholes zk1 zk3 and sw5 sw21 after mingyue tunnel excavation are selected as the reference values for model calibration the best fitting effect can be obtained by simulating the operation and properly adjusting the parameters the deviation error and fitting curve between the observed and simulated water levels of boreholes zk1 zk2 and zk3 are shown in fig 6 the mean value of the residual error between the observed value and the simulated value is 0 202 0 208 m indicating that the fitting degree of the model is good in the simulation process there is no obvious trend of error accumulation and expansion which shows that the mathematical model is reliable 3 results 3 1 tunnel drainage as shown in fig 2 and fig 7 during the construction period of the mingyue tunnels march 2018 october 2020 the maximum total drainage was 25 l s and the drainage was 9 43 l s the drainage in carbonate rock was greater than that in clastic rock the drainage of the right line entrance 2 and exit 2 was greater than that of the left line entrance 1 and exit 1 the tunnel drainage in the western trough valley and middle trough valley was high within one year after the completion of the mingyue tunnels november 2020 october 2021 the maximum total drainage was 20 14 l s and the average was 10 85 l s the drainage of the mingyue tunnels shows a precipitation effect and karst conduit effect the tunnel drainage in the rainy season accounts for more than 70 of the drainage over an entire year however when the tunnel exposes karst conduits p1 and p2 the conduit effect is significant for example the precipitation in august and december 2019 was 18 1 mm and 26 9 mm respectively but the tunnel drainage was as high as 22 22 l s and 17 01 l s the proportion of the drainage of the mingyue tunnels to the discharge of the underground river s1 is high in the dry season and low in the rainy season the proportions were 0 9 1 77 and 3 09 in the rainy season june september from 2019 to 2021 and 3 97 6 89 and 9 37 in the dry season obviously the drainage effect of the tunnel is stronger in the dry season than in the rainy season 3 2 changes in water level and quantity of surface water and groundwater as shown in fig 8 the water levels and discharges of surface ponds sh1 and sh2 epikarst springs s2 s3 s4 s6 and s7 borehole zk1 and chongqing lichuang railway tunnel f1 decreased due to the mingyue tunnel excavation other monitored springs or underground rivers exhibited no obvious changes the water levels of the two ponds sh1 and sh2 which are 100 m south and 360 m north of the mingyue tunnels in the western trough valley decreased significantly by 0 69 2 45 m from 2018 2020 while the water level of the two ponds sh3 and sh4 that are far away from the tunnel changed with precipitation when the drainage of the mingyue tunnels suddenly increased the water levels of the two ponds did not decrease significantly therefore tunnel drainage was not from surface water and the changes in surface water might be due to the blasting vibration during tunnel excavation which created cracks that penetrated to the bottom of the ponds resulting in the leakage of surface water during the mingyue tunnel excavation the discharges of s2 in the eastern trough valley and s4 in the middle trough valley almost dried up and the discharges of s3 s6 and s7 in the western trough valley decreased by more than 50 the discharges of these five springs decreased in the early stage of tunnel excavation when the tunnel drainage was low this might be due to the blasting vibration of tunnel excavation and the increase in water diversion cracks resulting in the leakage of spring water within one year after the mingyue tunnels were completed november 2020 october 2021 three springs s3 s6 and s7 fluctuated significantly with precipitation and the discharges had recovered to near the levels observed prior to the construction period the discharge of the underground river and the water level of the three skylights y1 y2 and y3 did not drop significantly the discharge of the underground river fluctuated greatly during the year so it was difficult to judge the change in the underground river only from the discharge in a short period of time however the discharge of a karst conduit p1 exposed by tunnel excavation after rain was 11 1 l s therefore it was inferred that the underground river system had been affected resulting in a decrease in outlet discharge the water level of the borehole zk1 above the mingyue tunnels decreased by approximately 20 m at the beginning of tunnel excavation march 2018 and then slowly decreased the water level change in the borehole was not correlated with precipitation or tunnel drainage therefore the sudden decrease in the water level might have been caused by blasting vibration during tunnel excavation the water levels of the other five boreholes did not change significantly due to blasting vibration and tunnel drainage and the seasonal variation range was 3 13 8 60 m the water inflow of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel 1700 m south of the mingyue tunnels has decreased since june 2018 the water inflow has decreased by 6 8 l s in the rainy season and 2 3 l s in the dry season and the seasonal variation has also decreased in june 2018 and july 2019 the drainage of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel decreased greatly while the water inflow of the mingyue tunnels entrance 2 increased by 3 6 l s and 8 33 l s respectively compared with that of the previous month the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel crosses the mingyue tunnels in plane view and is 15 30 m higher than mingyue tunnels vertically therefore the mingyue tunnels might capture part of the supply previously entering the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and cause some of the water to escape via leakage along cracks induced by blasting vibration 3 3 variation in the groundwater flow field the karst groundwater flow fields before and after the excavation of the mingyue tunnels are shown in fig 9 before tunnel excavation fig 9a the groundwater flow field in the simulation area was mainly controlled by the underground river and the groundwater level gradually decreased from north to south showing the pipeline catchment effect near the underground river pipeline the water level in some sections water level 310 250 m was abnormal therefore it is speculated that there was a local groundwater flow system the hydraulic gradient at the intersection of the underground river and the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel was large which was due to the drainage effect of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel forming a small depression cone additionally the gradients of the karst conduits were large by the end of 2019 the two tunnels on the western side had passed through the western trough and entered the middle trough while the two tunnels on the eastern side had not yet entered the carbonate rock stratum and the water inflow in the western side tunnel was significantly greater than that in the eastern side the karst groundwater flow field is shown in fig 9b there is a small depression cone in the western trough valley and the middle trough valley and the groundwater level in the depression cone is 30 m and 10 m lower than that in the surrounding area there is a drawdown of 10 25 m near the axis of mingyue tunnels and the decline range of the groundwater level decreases from the tunnel to the north and south sides the hydraulic gradient in the tunnel site area increases there is no depression cone in the eastern trough valley but the groundwater level has relatively consistent changes with the middle trough valley and the western trough valley which also proves that although the karst conduits in each secondary trough valley are independent of each other they belong to the same underground river system and have a relatively unified groundwater surface in the horizontal direction the main influence range is 2 3 km from the north and south sides of the mingyue tunnels in october 2020 the mingyue tunnels were completed the karst groundwater flow field is shown in fig 9c there was a drawdown of 5 10 m near the axis of mingyue tunnels in 2020 compared with 2019 due to the decline in the surrounding water level the depression cone in the middle trough valley disappeared in october 2021 one year after the tunnel was completed the drainage of mingyue tunnels tended to be stable and the area and depth of several depression cones increased at the intersection of the mingyue tunnels the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and the underground river a depression zone is formed and the groundwater level is approximately 10 m lower than that in the surrounding area which may be due to the superposition effect of tunnel drainage and conduit catchments the pattern of the groundwater flow field in other areas shows little change fig 9d there are two main changes in the groundwater flow field caused by the drainage of mingyue tunnels one is the formation of depression zones which mainly appear near several water inflow points of the tunnel due to the continuous water inflow similar to the continuous pumping of pumping wells the surrounding groundwater cannot be replenished in time resulting in a depression zone and the groundwater level in the depression zone will drop sharply the hydraulic gradient increases sharply and the flow velocity increases greatly the second main change is the drawdown the mingyue tunnels are near the discharge area of the groundwater system the tunnel seizes the recharge water source of the underground river and forms an artificial groundwater discharge outlet resulting in the drawdown and the change in the flow field in this hydrogeological unit 3 4 groundwater flow budget the groundwater flow budget calculation using the above model suggests that the tunnels excavation results in a slight decrease in the groundwater storage in the study area during the tunnel construction period the net loss of groundwater storage in the hydrogeological unit is about 6 1 105 m3 and the net loss of groundwater storage is about 1 7 105 m3 one year after the tunnels were completed before the excavation of mingyue tunnels the underground water in the hydrogeological unit was mainly discharged through underground river conduits and the railway tunnel after the excavation of mingyue tunnels they become new groundwater discharge outlets the drainage of the mingyue tunnels accounted for 0 9 9 37 of the underground river s1 discharge from 2019 to 2021 which may result in a reduction in underground river discharge as shown in the fig 10 the predicted discharge of the underground river s1 by the above model is in good agreement with the measured discharge the discharge of underground river s1 fluctuates obviously with precipitation the simulated discharge in dry season is slightly less than the measured flow when the tunnel drainage increases significantly in the rainy season in 2019 and 2020 the simulated underground river s1 discharge is less than the measured flow 4 discussion 4 1 impact of tunnel drainage on the groundwater flow field and groundwater resources 4 1 1 judgment of the relative position of mingyue tunnels and underground river conduits the records of tunnel construction and drainage show that large underground river conduits were not exposed during tunnel excavation therefore the main conduits of the underground river should be below the mingyue tunnels within the seasonal variation zone of groundwater and the underground river conduit of the western trough valley should be closer to the mingyue tunnels the main evidence is as follows first evidence from geophysical prospecting and hydrogeological drilling shows that the location and water level of the underground river conduit in the western trough valley are higher than those in the eastern and middle trough valleys and the connectivity of the karst groundwater system is better therefore the underground river conduit in the western trough valley is closest to the mingyue tunnels and is most vulnerable to the influence of tunnel excavation second according to the water level difference and distance between the skylight y3 and the outlet of the underground river in the dry season the average hydraulic gradient of the underground river in the western trough valley is calculated to be 2 5 based on this calculation the water level of the underground river in the western trough valley near the tunnel site area in the dry season is approximately 227 5 m while the elevation of the mingyue tunnels is 257 64 282 46 m therefore the mingyue tunnels are above the groundwater level in the dry season in this area fig 11 third the tunnel excavation exposed two karst conduits p1 and p2 and the groundwater flow from the karst conduit p1 featured a discharge of 11 1 l s after precipitation the discharge of this karst conduit p1 is very stable in the rainy season while it dries up in the dry season indicating that the mingyue tunnels are below the regional groundwater level finally the tunnel drainage had a significant response to precipitation the precipitation in the dry season is low but the tunnel still has relatively stable drainage the tunnel drainage was 3 82 4 21 l s in the dry season after the tunnel was connected and it accounts for 8 63 10 72 of the underground river discharge in the dry season indicating that the tunnel should be near the groundwater level in the dry season fig 11 4 1 2 impact mode and mechanism due to the excavation of mingyue tunnels the water levels of two surface ponds sh1 and sh2 the water level of a borehole zk1 and the discharge of three epikarst springs in the western trough valley decreased the discharge of an epikarst spring s4 in the middle trough valley and an epikarst spring s2 in the eastern trough valley decreased the discharge of surface karst springs s3 s6 and s7 gradually recovered after the mingyue tunnels were connected therefore it is speculated that during tunnel excavation the northern boundary of the horizontal influence range was 7100 m s7 from the mingyue tunnels the southern boundary was 1700 m underground river outlet s1 from the mingyue tunnels and the east west influence range was between the tunnel entrance and exit the groundwater flow field simulation shows that the impact is relatively serious within 2 km of the mingyue tunnels on both sides vertically the influence range should be from the ground to the bottom of the mingyue tunnels 257 64 282 46 m and it gradually decreases from the tunnel site to the north and south the drainage of the mingyue tunnels has both precipitation and conduit effects during tunnel excavation the drainage in the rainy season accounted for 65 49 75 41 of the annual drainage while the drainage in the dry season accounted for only 24 59 34 51 in july and september 2019 when two karst conduits p1 and p2 were exposed during the excavation of the mingyue tunnels the conduit effect of tunnel drainage was significant from july to october 2019 the tunnel drainage was 17 01 25 0 l s which was the maximum drainage during the excavation and was not affected by the precipitation after the completion of the mingyue tunnels the tunnel drainage no longer had a conduit effect it is speculated that the tunnel drainage reduced the groundwater level and the groundwater level in the rainy season was lower than that of karst conduit p1 before tunnel excavation there are significant temporal and spatial differences in the impact of mingyue tunnel drainage on the groundwater flow field from 2019 to 2021 the tunnel drainage in the rainy season accounted for 0 9 3 09 of the underground river s1 discharge in the same period while the tunnel drainage in the dry season accounted for 3 97 9 37 therefore the tunnel drainage effect is stronger in the dry season precipitation recharge in the rainy season can alleviate the decline in the groundwater level caused by tunnel excavation groundwater resources in karst areas are unevenly distributed in their natural state the maximum discharge of underground rivers in the rainy season is usually dozens of times that in the dry season and the water level may differ by tens of meters the tunnel drainage aggravates the spatial temporal distribution differences in water resources among all kinds of surface water and underground water bodies monitored the most obvious drainage changes were in the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel adjacent to the mingyue tunnels followed by the epikarst springs and ponds the underground river system was also affected but not significantly due to the small proportion of tunnel drainage for underground river discharge although 6 boreholes were monitored only the water level of borehole zk1 above the mingyue tunnels was affected by tunnel drainage the impact of tunnel drainage on the groundwater system in the western trough valley is greater than that in the middle trough valley and the eastern trough valley there are more epikarst springs sinkholes and underground river skylights in the western trough valley and the connectivity of the groundwater system is better the conduits of the underground river and groundwater level in the western trough valley are higher and thus the response to the drainage via the mingyue tunnels is stronger the water bodies south of the mingyue tunnels are more obviously affected by the tunnel drainage the outlet of the underground river epikarst spring s2 pond sh1 and the exit of chongqing lichuan railway tunnel f1 are all south of the mingyue tunnels and karst conduit p1 is mainly discharged from the southern section this difference is mainly because the monitoring water bodies in the south are close to the mingyue tunnels and the mingyue tunnels also intercepted the recharge water source of the southern groundwater body there are two ways in which tunnel excavation affects the groundwater flow field one is the blasting vibration induced by tunnel excavation which leads to the expansion of karst fractures or the generation of new fractures destroys the aqueous medium and leads to the leakage of some shallow groundwater and surface water into the tunnel fig 11 the reduction in shallow water resources will affect groundwater dependent ecosystems liu et al 2019 second the tunnel excavation exposed karst conduits resulting in the groundwater once flowing through these conduits being directly discharged into the tunnel the groundwater level dropping below the conduit the underground river system being damaged and the tunnel becoming a new groundwater outlet in the long term the karstification process can even be altered which in turn may amplify or weaken the effects of climate on vegetation growth jiang et al 2020 4 2 influence of tunnel location on its drainage effect the location of the tunnel directly affects the amount of drainage so it is the most important factor that changes the groundwater flow field vertically although some tunnels in karst mountains may start in the vadose zone at each end they may pass into a transient zone or even a steady state phreatic zone in their central parts creating an elongated zone of depression that permits gravity driven drainage and resulting in a lowered groundwater level ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 and the drying up of springs and even underground rivers if tunnels are excavated above the low groundwater level in the dry season in karst areas and if the tunnel is located below the high groundwater level in the rainy season some epikarst springs may be drained and the shallow groundwater in the aeration zone may be reduced horizontally if the tunnel is located in the recharge area and is near the surface it may affect only the epikarst springs around the recharge area resulting in a slight decrease in underground river discharge downstream while not affecting the epikarst springs downstream if the tunnel is located in the groundwater discharge area and is deep there will be a large drawdown which can affect the whole groundwater system there was no abrupt decrease in the groundwater level or severe drainage of the underground river after the excavation of the mingyue tunnels mainly due to the relatively high position of the tunnel as mentioned above the mingyuen tunnels are at the bottom of the seasonal variation zone that is above the water level in the dry season and below the water level in the wet season close to the dry season water level assuming that the tunnel is below the low water level in the dry season the tunnel drainage may increase several times according to the drainage of several water inflow points in the mingyue tunnels estimated based on the discharge of the underground river in the dry season the groundwater flow field of this hydrogeological unit is reconstructed when the mingyue tunnels are below the groundwater level in the dry season fig 12 when the mingyue tunnels were completed in october 2020 compared with the groundwater flow field when the tunnels are above the groundwater level in the dry season the area of several depression cones near the axis of mingyue tunnels expanded by 2 3 times the depth increased by 30 70 m the catchment effect at the intersection of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and the underground river strengthened and the hydraulic gradient of groundwater increased the horizontal influence range of the mingyue tunnel drainage expanded from 3 km to 8 0 km one year after the completion of the mingyue tunnels in october 2021 compared with the groundwater flow field when the tunnel is above the groundwater level in the dry season the depth of several depression cones near the axis of the mingyue tunnel increased by 20 80 m the catchment effect at the intersection of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and the underground river was stronger and the hydraulic gradient of groundwater and the scope of influence were larger 4 3 influence of precipitation on the tunnel drainage effect the main source of recharge in the study area is precipitation in the natural state the response of the groundwater level and underground river discharge to precipitation is very significant considering the interference of tunnel variations of the tunnel drainage the groundwater level near the tunnel and the flow of underground river s1 under different precipitation conditions are predicted fig 13 when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the drainage of mingyue tunnels in dry season increase by 15 59 with an average increase of 35 and the drainage of mingyue tunnels in rainy season increase by 3 23 with an average increase of 10 when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the drainage of mingyue tunnels in dry season increase by 19 62 with an average increase of 38 and the drainage of mingyue tunnels in rainy season increase by 14 35 with an average increase of 21 fig 13a the drainage of mingyue tunnels responds more significantly to precipitation in dry season which is consistent with the previous observation results when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 5 7 in dry season with an average increase of 6 and the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 5 in rainy season when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 13 14 in dry season with an average increase of 14 and the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 10 11 in rainy season with an average increase of 11 fig 13b the annual average groundwater level near the mingyue tunnels rises up by 12 46 m and 16 42 m respectively with the increase of precipitation however the increase of precipitation promotes the underground river discharge and tunnel drainage resulting in the drawdown of groundwater level near the tunnel in the same period and the drawdown is greater in rainy season than that in dry season therefore the groundwater level near the tunnel in rainy season is lower than that in dry season which is significantly different from that in natural state when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the discharge of underground river s1 in dry season increases by 7 94 with an average increase of 40 and the discharge of underground river s1 in rainy season increases by 36 106 with an average increase of 81 when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the discharge of underground river s1 in dry season increases by 20 125 with an average increase of 62 and the discharge of underground river s1 in rainy season increases by 54 182 with an average increase of 120 fig 13c under the interference of mingyue tunnels the discharge of underground river s1 still responds significantly to the increase of precipitation and the increase in rainy season is greater than that in dry season when the precipitation increases by 200 mm and 400 mm respectively the average discharge ratio of the underground river in rainy season and dry season increases from 5 7 to 7 76 and 7 82 respectively as mentioned above the drainage effect of tunnel is more significant in dry season and the tunnel drainage accounts for a larger proportion of underground river discharge therefore driven by the increase of precipitation and tunnel drainage the seasonal variation of underground river discharge is exacerbated 4 4 recovery of groundwater resources the prediction of groundwater flow budget shows that the net loss of groundwater storage is 1 7 105 m3 a under the current precipitation conditions the net loss of groundwater storage is 1 2 105 m3 a when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the net loss of groundwater storage is 0 5 105 m3 a when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the simulation prediction indicates that although the increase of precipitation raises the groundwater level and alleviates the drainage effect there is still a loss of groundwater storage 4 5 limitations and improvement methods some limitations and improvement methods in this study are as follows first the karst aquifer is heterogeneous so the hydrogeological parameters vary greatly and will change due to tunnel interference the detailed hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation are the most important factor for the success of modeling in this study 8 geological profiles were measured and the real thicknesses of the strata in the simulation area were obtained the discharges of 10 springs in the dry season were measured twice and the precipitation infiltration coefficients before and after tunnel excavation were obtained three geophysical prospecting methods and twenty six hydrogeological boreholes were used to confirm the distribution and elevation of underground karst fractures conduits and caves more than 26 pumping tests and water pressure tests were carried out before and after tunnel excavation and the hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation were obtained the model is calibrated by using the water level observation data before and after tunnel excavation to ensure the effectiveness of the model second visual modflow assumes that the flow field is continuous and that flow movement obeys darcy s law and it is not an ideal model to simulate karst groundwater flow some efforts have been made to solve the contradiction between the heterogeneity in karst aquifers and the assumptions of the model a large number of hydrogeological parameters are obtained before and after tunnel excavation then due to the heterogeneity in the karst aqueous medium different parameters are assigned to different karst conduits with different elevations based on abundant observed water level data before and after tunnel excavation the model is modified and the hydrogeological parameters are inverted to establish a more realistic groundwater flow field finally due to the limitations of the model the water exchange between underground river and conduits with metrix is not considered this study improves the accuracy of simulation by increasing hydrogeological tests and obtaining more hydrogeological parameters 5 conclusion and prospects thirty four surface ponds springs underground rivers and boreholes were monitored in a karst trough valley in southwest china and visual modflow was used to simulate predict and calculate the groundwater flow field and discharge thus the change in the groundwater flow field and the discharge of the underground river were revealed and then the hydrogeological impact of tunnel excavation on the karst groundwater aquifer was quantitatively evaluated observation and simulation indicate that tunnel excavation has a differential impact on groundwater flow field and discharge the drainage effect of tunnel is more significant in dry season the underground system in the western trough valley responds more strongly to the tunnel drainage the surface water level dropped by 0 69 2 45 m the discharge of five epikarst springs dropped abruptly or almost drained the drainage of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel decreased by approximately a quarter and the groundwater level of the borehole dropped by approximately 20 m the northern and southern boundaries of the horizontal influence range were 7100 m and 1700 m from the mingyue tunnels respectively vertically the influence range extends from the ground to the bottom of the mingyue tunnels there is a drawdown of 10 30 m due to the excavation of the mingyue tunnels the simulation results predict that the drainage effect is more significant when the tunnels are below the groundwater level in the dry season driven by the increase of precipitation and tunnel drainage the seasonal variation of underground river discharge is exacerbated the increase of precipitation promotes the underground river discharge and tunnel drainage resulting in the drawdown of groundwater level near the tunnel in the same period therefore the groundwater level near the tunnel in the rainy season is lower than that in the dry season which is opposite to that in natural state the groundwater flow budget calculation and prediction suggest that the net loss of groundwater storage was 6 1 105 m3 during tunnel excavation and the net loss of groundwater storage is about 1 7 105 m3 one year after the tunnels were completed while the depression cones continue to expand the net loss of groundwater storage is 1 2 105 m3 a and 0 5 105 m3 a when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm and 400 mm respectively the increase of precipitation raises the groundwater level and alleviates the drainage effect but the increased precipitation recharge is less than groundwater discharge and tunnel drainage and there is still a loss of groundwater storage so it is difficult to restore the groundwater flow field and discharge in a short time this study provides evidence and a useful method to quantitatively evaluate the effects of tunnel excavation on the groundwater flow field and to inform better measures to protect karst groundwater resources in the future we will continue to observe the groundwater level and hydrochemical characteristics around the completed mingyue tunnels to study the recovery process of the groundwater flow field credit

3149,the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation can change the hydrogeological flow system in karst areas however how to overcome the heterogeneity in karst aquifers and accurately evaluate the impacts of tunnel excavation on karst groundwater flow field and resources remains largely unknown in this study through geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and test and observations in 4 years the depth scale and spatial distribution of underground river conduits and hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation are obtained and the groundwater flow field before and after tunnel excavation was established by visual modflow observation and simulation indicate that two ponds 5 epikarst springs 1 borehole 1 railway tunnel and the underground river system were affected during tunnel excavation the drainage effect of tunnel is more significant in dry season three depression cones are formed and there is a drawdown of 10 30 m due to the tunnel excavation the simulation results predict that the drainage effect is more significant when the tunnels are below the groundwater level in the dry season driven by the increase of precipitation and tunnel drainage the seasonal variation of underground river discharge is exacerbated and the groundwater level near the tunnel in the rainy season is lower than that in the dry season which is opposite to that in natural state the groundwater flow budget calculation and prediction suggest that the net loss of groundwater storage was 6 1 105 m3 during tunnel excavation and the net loss of groundwater storage is about 1 7 105 m3 one year after the tunnels were completed and meanwhile the depression cones continue to expand the increase of precipitation raises the groundwater level and alleviates the drainage effect but the increased precipitation recharge is less than groundwater discharge and tunnel drainage so there is still a loss of groundwater storage it is difficult to restore the groundwater flow field and discharge in a short time this study provides evidence and a useful method to quantitatively evaluate the effects of tunnel excavation on the groundwater flow field and to inform better measures to protect karst groundwater resources keywords karst groundwater flow field tunnel excavation modeling karst trough valley 1 introduction karst aquifers as a source of drinking water to almost a quarter of the world s population are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and human impacts due to their unique hydrogeological characteristics ford and williams 2007 efficient transport relies strongly on road and railway tunnels in karst areas both for long distance traffic and in metropolitan areas butscher et al 2011 tunnels drilled through karst areas often cause many problems e g water inrush karst collapse and groundwater drawdown inflows to tunnels reduce the groundwater level kim et al 2001 expand the groundwater supply boundary vincenzi et al 2009 and thus change the natural hydrogeological flow around the tunnel in recent decades many efforts have focused on developing more sophisticated analytical solutions to estimate the water inflow during tunneling goodman et al 1965 el tani 2003 perrochet 2005 kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 el tani 2010 coli and pinzani 2014 maréchal et al 2014 using more reasonable methods to evaluate the

isotope methods to track the changes in plant production rates and physiological processes caused by groundwater drawdown zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2019 cao et al 2020 continuous and high resolution monitoring can reflect the real time changes in surface water and groundwater due to tunnel excavation however because of the heterogeneity of karst groundwater and the inadequate number of boreholes and natural springs near tunnel sites the groundwater flow field must be partially studied by groundwater simulation software hydrological modeling has been used for simulations of underground water flow regimes or seepage fields under the influence of tunnels raposo et al 2010 chen et al 2020 for example visual modflow developed by the united states geological survey usgs is widely used in this approach the groundwater flow is described by the continuity and momentum balance equations that are mostly based on darcy s law zheng et al 2020 under more complex groundwater flow conditions non darcian flows have also been considered chen et al 2020 based on the partial differential equation that describes groundwater flow visual modflow has become a valuable tool for studying water resources in karst aquifers nevertheless the turbulence and flow in karst conduits have not been considered in view of the karst water system with the coexistence of conduits fractures and pores this model has been optimized and improved e g modflow cfp and demonstrated to be effective in recent years shoemaker et al 2008 hill et al 2010 hu et al 2012 gallegos et al 2013 chang et al 2015 giese et al 2018 zargham et al 2018 aliouache et al 2019 however although modflow cfp can calculate the flow process of different nodes it does not consider the hydrodynamic process inside the conduit and the description of the conduit characteristics is relatively vague it is assumed that the conduits are relatively uniform aqueous media and the heterogeneity is ignored in the selection of relevant parameters regardless of which model is used the accuracy of the karst conduit parameters is the key to the effectiveness of the model geophysical prospecting technology is an effective means to analyze underground karst to determine the depth shape and spatial distribution of underground river conduits many explorations have been carried out by using magnetotelluric sounding eh4 the high density resistivity method the transient electromagnetic method tem the shallow seismic reflection method the audio magnetotelluric method amt electrical resistivity tomography ert etc and the combination of different methods has proven to be effective in different cases li et al 2008 gan et al 2010 mastrocicco et al 2010 parsekian et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hydrogeological drilling can verify the interpretation of geophysical prospecting and directly reflect the characteristics of underground karst tracer tests pumping tests and water pressure tests are common methods used to obtain hydrogeological parameters vincenzi et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 therefore the location shape characteristics and hydrogeological parameters of karst conduits should be found out by the combination of geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and various hydrogeological tests and the hydrogeological model established in this way can be more effective studies have shown that tunnel excavation affects karst groundwater resources and flow field attanayake and waterman 2006 moon and jeong 2011 lv et al 2020 first tunnel drainage destroys the aquifer structure then surface water and groundwater drain forming a depression cone which expands with drainage time until the tunnel drainage fully accounts for the recharge from the boundary and therefore the groundwater flow field and water resources are changed however due to the complexity of karst geological structures and the multidirectional heterogeneity of karst groundwater the changes of karst groundwater flow field groundwater resources and hydrological process caused by groundwater drawdown remain largely unknown and the response of karst hydrogeological systems to tunnel drainage may be more complex than expected as an open dynamic system the changes of karst groundwater are highly sensitive to external climatic conditions at seasonal monthly daily or even hourly scales white 2007 liu et al 2007 driven by the external environment and human engineering activities the karst groundwater system may be more sensitive the change of precipitation may aggravate or alleviate the impact of tunnel excavation on karst groundwater therefore it is necessary to predict and evaluate the response of karst groundwater flow field and discharge to precipitation under the condition of tunnel interference besides many studies believe that after the completion of the tunnel lining the tunnel will no longer provide drainage or the drainage will be very small and the groundwater level and storage will return to the previous state gisbert et al 2009 zheng et al 2020 actually karst conduits and fissures were exposed in the process of tunnel excavation and more fissures appeared because of the impact of blasting vibration so the hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity in the tunnel site area changed accordingly therefore whether the groundwater resources and groundwater flow field can be restored remains to be clarified in this study based on geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and tests and observations in 4 years the depth scale and spatial distribution of underground river conduits and hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation are obtained and the groundwater flow field before and after tunnel excavation was established by visual modflow in a karst trough valley in southwest china here the following objects were addressed to reveal the variation process of tunnel drainage groundwater level and discharge through high resolution observation to quantitatively evaluate the change of groundwater flow field and the loss of groundwater storage through simulation and calculation of the groundwater flow budget to identify the response of groundwater level and discharge to precipitation under tunnel interference through simulation and predication to analyze the recovery of groundwater resources through simulation and predication of the groundwater flow budget this study will provide a better scientific basis for the planning site selection and construction decision making associated with tunnels in karst areas 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the mingyuexia karst trough valley 106 48 52 106 59 06 e 29 38 52 29 54 47 n which has an area of 63 56 km2 is located in the southern part of the mingyue mountains in northeastern chongqing southwest china fig 1 the regional climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1100 mm approximately 65 of precipitation occurs during the rainy season from may to september and a mean annual air temperature of 18 c the mingyuexia karst trough valley is located in the mingyuexia anticline extends north south and consists of a karst valley in the middle and two ridges on both sides the karst valley which is composed of carbonate rocks corresponding to the lower triassic daye t1 d and jialingjiang formations t1 j and the middle triassic leikoupo formation t2 l is located at the axis of the anticline with an elevation of 450 600 m fig 1 the ridges and slopes which are composed of clastic rocks corresponding to the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj and jurassic j strata are located on the wings of the anticline with an elevation range of 350 700 m this karst valley is approximately 27 km long and 2 km wide due to differential dissolution three parallel secondary valleys have formed in the eastern middle and western areas fig 1 horizontally the northern surface watershed 600 850 m above sea level is the recharge boundary of the groundwater system in the mingyuexia karst trough valley and the underground river in the south is the only outlet of the groundwater system which discharges into the yulin river 180 200 m above sea level the sandstone and shale of the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj on the eastern and western sides form the water separation boundary vertically the mudstone of the lower triassic feixianguan formations t1 f is the floor that separates the water and the limestone dolomite and argillaceous limestone of the lower triassic daye t1 d and jialingjiang formations t1 j and the middle triassic leikoupo formation t2 l are aquifers with thicknesses of 480 500 m many vertical open fractures in the limestone and dolomite in the valley provide the basic conditions for the formation of karst depressions and sinkholes rainwater and surface water quickly enter the karst aquifer through sinkholes fissures or shafts and the water then migrates from north to south and finally discharge in the form of karst springs or underground rivers before tunnel excavation there were 30 epikarst springs 0 5 l s and 1 underground river 45 1800 l s in the karst trough valley three karst branch conduits of the underground river are present in the three secondary karst valleys and converge to form a main conduit in the south which intersects and discharges into the yulin river with an outlet elevation of 185 m 2 2 tunnel excavation in the mingyuexia karst trough valley the mingyue mountains are located on the northeastern edge of the chongqing metropolitan area and the mountain range is an obstacle to urban expansion and external communication the construction of tunnels is an inevitable choice for urban development the mingyue tunnels are double track tunnels that are part of the third ring expressway in chongqing with lengths of 3220 m and 3270 m elevations of 260 290 m and a maximum depth of 380 m the tunnels were excavated from both ends toward the middle simultaneously and construction started in march 2018 and was completed in october 2020 the tunnels pass through mudstone sandstone and shale of the jurassic and upper triassic xujiahe formations and limestone of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation with maximum water inflows of 6 25 l s and 17 36 l s respectively fig 2 two north south directed underground river conduits p1 and p2 were exposed and were 11 12 m high and 5 m wide in july and september 2019 the underground water flowed into the mingyue tunnels from the karst conduit south of p1 after precipitation with a flow of 11 1 l s while the conduit north of p1 and p2 had no water inflow two other parallel railway tunnels in the karst trough valley cross the mingyue tunnels in plan view fig 1 but they are vertically 15 30 m higher the chongqing wanzhou railway tunnel was completed in 2014 and has an elevation of 301 m which is above the groundwater level a large number of dry karst caves were encountered during the construction period without a large amount of flowing water and there is currently no drainage the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel was completed in 2013 and has an elevation of 301 m which is above the groundwater level and the tunnel water inflow measured in december 2017 was 25 397 l s some epikarst springs dried up or were reduced after the excavation of these two tunnels 2 3 data acquisition hydrogeological surveys typical geological sections and cave measurements were performed in the hydrogeological unit of the mingyue tunnels to determine the karstification aquifer thickness water yield recharge runoff discharge conditions discharge and water level of different water bodies before tunnel excavation there are 34 observation stations on the northern and southern sides of the mingyue tunnels including 4 ponds 17 springs 1 underground river and 3 skylights 1 railway tunnel 1 manual observation station in a coal mine tunnel 6 automatic groundwater level observation stations in boreholes and 3 automatic rainfall stations fig 1 table 1 moreover the water inflows at the 4 exits and entrances of the mingyue tunnels under construction were observed in real time these observation stations constitute a monitoring network covering supply runoff and discharge areas and the data can reflect the changes in the karst groundwater flow field the discharge and water level are recorded by a triangular weir rectangular weir and water level gauge in the manual observation station once every 3 5 days with an accuracy of 0 5 mm the rainfall and water level are observed by a water level precipitation integrated automatic observation station yt yt 0100 or a water level automatic observation station yt yl 0300 once every half an hour with an accuracy of 0 1 mm from march 2018 to october 2021 9500 manually observed discharge and water level data and 42 000 automatically observed water level and rainfall data were obtained the precipitation infiltration coefficients α of different strata are calculated by measuring the discharge of springs and underground rivers in the dry season the thickness of different strata is obtained by measuring the stratigraphic profile the depth scale and spatial distribution of karst conduits are identified through geophysical exploration and hydrogeological boreholes and the permeability coefficients k are obtained by pumping tests and water pressure tests in 2021 21 boreholes sw1 sw21 were drilled in the study area the hydrogeological parameters and water level after tunnel excavation are mainly from these boreholes 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 conceptual model and boundary conditions visual modflow was developed by waterloo hydraulic inc in canada and is based on modflow software 1984 of the usgs in this paper we use visual modflow to simulate three dimensional saturated flow the karst aquifers of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation t1 j lower triassic daye formation t1 d and middle leikoupo formation t2 l are the main target layers of the simulation and they can be generalized into heterogeneous anisotropic phreatic confined water aquifers with unified groundwater levels the permeability of groundwater in the jurassic j strata upper triassic xujiahe formation t3xj and feixianguan formations t1 f is poor so these strata are treated as aquicludes horizontally according to the groundwater level monitoring results the maximum impact range of the tunnel is 7 1 km in the north so the surface watershed which is 8 km from the mingyue tunnels is taken as the northern boundary of the simulation area the first kind boundary γ1 the outlet of the underground river s1 is the discharge boundary in the south the second kind boundary γ2 some springs in the study area drained due to the construction of the two railway tunnels before 2013 at present the flow of surface karst springs in the study area is mostly less than 0 1l s table 1 accounting for a very small ratio of the underground river outlet flow 45 1800 l s therefore the underground river outlet is taken as the only outlet of this groundwater system in this study there is no hydraulic connection between the pond and groundwater so the pond is not used as a source or sink item during modeling the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj on the eastern and western sides is treated as impervious boundaries and the simulated area is 17 38 km2 vertically the feixianguan formation t1 f is an aquiclude and it is also the bottom boundary of the shallow groundwater system the average elevation of the top of the feixianguan formation t1 f in the simulation area is approximately 0 m burial depth of 450 800 m therefore the elevation of 0 above sea level is taken as the bottom boundary of the hydrogeological model the hydrogeological system is recharged by precipitation the surface topography as interpolated with a 30 m 30 m horizontal resolution is taken as the top boundary the hydrogeological map of the simulation area is shown in fig 3 2 4 2 mathematical model groundwater flow is generalized into heterogeneous isotropic and unstable groundwater flow systems the corresponding mathematical model is established as follows 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w u s h t h x y t t 0 h 0 x y x y d h x y z t γ 1 h x y z t x y z γ 1 t 0 k h n γ 2 q x y z t x y z γ 2 t 0 where kx ky and kz are the values of the permeability coefficients in the x y and z directions respectively h is the groundwater level w is the discharge per unit volume us is the specific storage t is the time d is the simulation area γ1 is the boundary with a fixed water head γ2 is the boundary with a fixed water flow n is the outer normal direction on the boundary and q is the discharge 2 4 3 geological and hydrogeological parameters eight geological profiles were measured in the simulation area fig 3 the thickness of the daye formation t1 d is 161 221 m the thickness of the jialingjiang formation t1 j is 397 419 m the thickness of the leikoupo formation t2 l is 19 113 m the thickness of the xujiahe formation t3 xj is 372 419 m the thickness of the ziliujing formation including the zhenzhuchong formation j1 zl is 377 404 4 m and the thickness of the xintiangou formation j2 x is between 111 118 m the precipitation was obtained from 10 springs and the precipitation infiltration coefficient was calculated formula 2 from discharge measurements in the dry season before tunnel excavation december 2017 and after tunnel excavation december 2020 before and after tunnel excavation the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the jurassic stratum j is 0 03 the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the sandstone section in the xujiahe formation t3 xj 2 t3 xj 4 t3 xj 6 is 0 18 and 0 2 respectively the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the mudstone section in the xujiahe formation t3 xj 1 t3 xj 3 t3 xj 5 is 0 03 and the precipitation infiltration coefficient of the leikoupo formation t2 l is 0 35 and 0 4 and the precipitation infiltration coefficients of the jialingjiang formation t1 j are 0 48 and 0 50 respectively 2 α i 3 15 q i 0 1 h f i where α i is the precipitation infiltration coefficient q i is the spring discharge in the dry season l s f i is the drainage area of spring km2 and h is the annual precipitation mm the permeability coefficient k is obtained from the pumping tests and water pressure tests performed in the 26 boreholes table 2 based on the permeability coefficients of boreholes zk1 zk3 and boreholes dk1 dk3 the initial value of the permeability coefficient in the simulation area is determined via interpolation before the excavation of the mingyue tunnels based on the permeability coefficients of boreholes sw1 sw21 the initial value of the permeability coefficient in the simulation area is determined interpolation after the excavation of the mingyue tunnels then further correction and comprehensive values are taken according to the characteristics of underground river conduits 2 4 4 tunnels and underground river conduits the underground river system consists of three karst branch conduits which are located in three secondary karst trough valleys to determine the characteristics of underground karst fractures conduits and caves geophysical prospecting was carried out by using magnetotelluric sounding eh4 tem and the high density resistivity method five magnetotelluric sounding profiles were created each with a length of approximately 2 km a point distance of 20 m and a depth of 650 m fig 3 then the high density resistivity method and tem are used for correction the formation lithology in the lower part of the survey line is determined according to the trend reflected by the resistivity chromatogram and the karst characteristics or groundwater enrichment is judged according to the significant difference in resistivity between the center and both sides or the low resistance closed circle the spatial distribution of underground karst fractures conduits and caves is shown in table 2 the elevation of karst conduits in the western trough valley is 203 450 m the elevation of karst conduits in the middle trough valley is 208 349 m and the elevation of karst conduits in the eastern trough valley is 225 350 m the lowest depth of karst conduits is in the middle trough valley followed by the eastern trough valley and the western trough valley the karst conduit in the middle trough valley should be considered the main conduit of the underground river system the epikarst zone in the western trough valley is the largest to further explore the spatial distribution and scale of karst conduits and verify the interpretation results of geophysical prospecting 26 hydrogeological boreholes were drilled around the three underground conduits fig 3 the core from a borehole can directly reflect the location and scale of underground karst conduits and caves fig 4 according to the drilling records karst caves and conduits are mainly present in the jialingjiang formation t1 j and decrease in abundance with increasing depth from the recharge area to the discharge area the elevations of karst caves and conduits are between 500 570 m 400 460 m and 350 365 m the stable water level in boreholes can represent the regional groundwater level analysis of the water levels in the boreholes table 2 shows that the groundwater level in the western trough valley is higher than those in the middle trough valley and the eastern trough valley in the runoff area the groundwater level in the middle trough valley is higher than that in the eastern trough valley while in the recharge area the opposite is true in summary based on hydrogeological surveys geophysical prospecting hydrogeological drilling and tests the depth scale and spatial distribution of karst caves fracture zones and conduits are obtained the elevation of the underground river conduit is 450 500 m recharge area 300 350 m runoff area and 180 250 m discharge area the permeability coefficients k near the underground river conduit are assigned according to the maximum values of the pumping test or regional empirical values and then they are simulated and verified according to the observation value of the water level in the borehole finally the permeability coefficient k near the underground river conduit is inverted the corrected values of the permeability coefficient at different depths in each stratum are shown in table 3 the permeability coefficient k of the target layer is 0 25 0 72 m d there are three tunnels in the simulation area namely the chongqing wanzhou railway tunnels chongqing lichuan railway tunnels and mingyue tunnels there is only a small amount of water seepage in the chongqing wanzhou railway tunnels which can be ignored the drainage in the chongqing lichuan railway tunnels is 17 514 27 524 l s according to the construction observation records of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnels there are three main water inflow sections three virtual boreholes are set in these water inflow sections and the pumping capacity of a single borehole is approximately 400 1500 m3 d similarly seven virtual boreholes are set in the main water inflow sections of the mingyue tunnels and the pumping capacity of a single borehole is approximately 100 1500 m3 d with the plugging of the water inflow section in the mingyue tunnels the water inflow has decreased and the pumping capacity of the borehole has decreased accordingly 2 4 5 modeling based on the 8 measured stratigraphic sections in the simulation area virtual boreholes are set up at the intersection between the section and the main stratigraphic interface thus a 3d geological model of the model area is established fig 5 in plan view the simulation area is divided into 130 rows and 75 columns with a total of 9750 grid cells 2 4 6 model calibration based on the hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation the models before and after tunnel excavation are established respectively to test the consistency between the temporal and spatial distribution of the groundwater flow field in the initial model and the measured value model calibration is needed the water levels in boreholes zk1 zk3 and dk1 dk3 before excavation of the mingyue tunnels are selected as the reference values for model calibration and the water levels in boreholes zk1 zk3 and sw5 sw21 after mingyue tunnel excavation are selected as the reference values for model calibration the best fitting effect can be obtained by simulating the operation and properly adjusting the parameters the deviation error and fitting curve between the observed and simulated water levels of boreholes zk1 zk2 and zk3 are shown in fig 6 the mean value of the residual error between the observed value and the simulated value is 0 202 0 208 m indicating that the fitting degree of the model is good in the simulation process there is no obvious trend of error accumulation and expansion which shows that the mathematical model is reliable 3 results 3 1 tunnel drainage as shown in fig 2 and fig 7 during the construction period of the mingyue tunnels march 2018 october 2020 the maximum total drainage was 25 l s and the drainage was 9 43 l s the drainage in carbonate rock was greater than that in clastic rock the drainage of the right line entrance 2 and exit 2 was greater than that of the left line entrance 1 and exit 1 the tunnel drainage in the western trough valley and middle trough valley was high within one year after the completion of the mingyue tunnels november 2020 october 2021 the maximum total drainage was 20 14 l s and the average was 10 85 l s the drainage of the mingyue tunnels shows a precipitation effect and karst conduit effect the tunnel drainage in the rainy season accounts for more than 70 of the drainage over an entire year however when the tunnel exposes karst conduits p1 and p2 the conduit effect is significant for example the precipitation in august and december 2019 was 18 1 mm and 26 9 mm respectively but the tunnel drainage was as high as 22 22 l s and 17 01 l s the proportion of the drainage of the mingyue tunnels to the discharge of the underground river s1 is high in the dry season and low in the rainy season the proportions were 0 9 1 77 and 3 09 in the rainy season june september from 2019 to 2021 and 3 97 6 89 and 9 37 in the dry season obviously the drainage effect of the tunnel is stronger in the dry season than in the rainy season 3 2 changes in water level and quantity of surface water and groundwater as shown in fig 8 the water levels and discharges of surface ponds sh1 and sh2 epikarst springs s2 s3 s4 s6 and s7 borehole zk1 and chongqing lichuang railway tunnel f1 decreased due to the mingyue tunnel excavation other monitored springs or underground rivers exhibited no obvious changes the water levels of the two ponds sh1 and sh2 which are 100 m south and 360 m north of the mingyue tunnels in the western trough valley decreased significantly by 0 69 2 45 m from 2018 2020 while the water level of the two ponds sh3 and sh4 that are far away from the tunnel changed with precipitation when the drainage of the mingyue tunnels suddenly increased the water levels of the two ponds did not decrease significantly therefore tunnel drainage was not from surface water and the changes in surface water might be due to the blasting vibration during tunnel excavation which created cracks that penetrated to the bottom of the ponds resulting in the leakage of surface water during the mingyue tunnel excavation the discharges of s2 in the eastern trough valley and s4 in the middle trough valley almost dried up and the discharges of s3 s6 and s7 in the western trough valley decreased by more than 50 the discharges of these five springs decreased in the early stage of tunnel excavation when the tunnel drainage was low this might be due to the blasting vibration of tunnel excavation and the increase in water diversion cracks resulting in the leakage of spring water within one year after the mingyue tunnels were completed november 2020 october 2021 three springs s3 s6 and s7 fluctuated significantly with precipitation and the discharges had recovered to near the levels observed prior to the construction period the discharge of the underground river and the water level of the three skylights y1 y2 and y3 did not drop significantly the discharge of the underground river fluctuated greatly during the year so it was difficult to judge the change in the underground river only from the discharge in a short period of time however the discharge of a karst conduit p1 exposed by tunnel excavation after rain was 11 1 l s therefore it was inferred that the underground river system had been affected resulting in a decrease in outlet discharge the water level of the borehole zk1 above the mingyue tunnels decreased by approximately 20 m at the beginning of tunnel excavation march 2018 and then slowly decreased the water level change in the borehole was not correlated with precipitation or tunnel drainage therefore the sudden decrease in the water level might have been caused by blasting vibration during tunnel excavation the water levels of the other five boreholes did not change significantly due to blasting vibration and tunnel drainage and the seasonal variation range was 3 13 8 60 m the water inflow of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel 1700 m south of the mingyue tunnels has decreased since june 2018 the water inflow has decreased by 6 8 l s in the rainy season and 2 3 l s in the dry season and the seasonal variation has also decreased in june 2018 and july 2019 the drainage of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel decreased greatly while the water inflow of the mingyue tunnels entrance 2 increased by 3 6 l s and 8 33 l s respectively compared with that of the previous month the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel crosses the mingyue tunnels in plane view and is 15 30 m higher than mingyue tunnels vertically therefore the mingyue tunnels might capture part of the supply previously entering the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and cause some of the water to escape via leakage along cracks induced by blasting vibration 3 3 variation in the groundwater flow field the karst groundwater flow fields before and after the excavation of the mingyue tunnels are shown in fig 9 before tunnel excavation fig 9a the groundwater flow field in the simulation area was mainly controlled by the underground river and the groundwater level gradually decreased from north to south showing the pipeline catchment effect near the underground river pipeline the water level in some sections water level 310 250 m was abnormal therefore it is speculated that there was a local groundwater flow system the hydraulic gradient at the intersection of the underground river and the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel was large which was due to the drainage effect of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel forming a small depression cone additionally the gradients of the karst conduits were large by the end of 2019 the two tunnels on the western side had passed through the western trough and entered the middle trough while the two tunnels on the eastern side had not yet entered the carbonate rock stratum and the water inflow in the western side tunnel was significantly greater than that in the eastern side the karst groundwater flow field is shown in fig 9b there is a small depression cone in the western trough valley and the middle trough valley and the groundwater level in the depression cone is 30 m and 10 m lower than that in the surrounding area there is a drawdown of 10 25 m near the axis of mingyue tunnels and the decline range of the groundwater level decreases from the tunnel to the north and south sides the hydraulic gradient in the tunnel site area increases there is no depression cone in the eastern trough valley but the groundwater level has relatively consistent changes with the middle trough valley and the western trough valley which also proves that although the karst conduits in each secondary trough valley are independent of each other they belong to the same underground river system and have a relatively unified groundwater surface in the horizontal direction the main influence range is 2 3 km from the north and south sides of the mingyue tunnels in october 2020 the mingyue tunnels were completed the karst groundwater flow field is shown in fig 9c there was a drawdown of 5 10 m near the axis of mingyue tunnels in 2020 compared with 2019 due to the decline in the surrounding water level the depression cone in the middle trough valley disappeared in october 2021 one year after the tunnel was completed the drainage of mingyue tunnels tended to be stable and the area and depth of several depression cones increased at the intersection of the mingyue tunnels the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and the underground river a depression zone is formed and the groundwater level is approximately 10 m lower than that in the surrounding area which may be due to the superposition effect of tunnel drainage and conduit catchments the pattern of the groundwater flow field in other areas shows little change fig 9d there are two main changes in the groundwater flow field caused by the drainage of mingyue tunnels one is the formation of depression zones which mainly appear near several water inflow points of the tunnel due to the continuous water inflow similar to the continuous pumping of pumping wells the surrounding groundwater cannot be replenished in time resulting in a depression zone and the groundwater level in the depression zone will drop sharply the hydraulic gradient increases sharply and the flow velocity increases greatly the second main change is the drawdown the mingyue tunnels are near the discharge area of the groundwater system the tunnel seizes the recharge water source of the underground river and forms an artificial groundwater discharge outlet resulting in the drawdown and the change in the flow field in this hydrogeological unit 3 4 groundwater flow budget the groundwater flow budget calculation using the above model suggests that the tunnels excavation results in a slight decrease in the groundwater storage in the study area during the tunnel construction period the net loss of groundwater storage in the hydrogeological unit is about 6 1 105 m3 and the net loss of groundwater storage is about 1 7 105 m3 one year after the tunnels were completed before the excavation of mingyue tunnels the underground water in the hydrogeological unit was mainly discharged through underground river conduits and the railway tunnel after the excavation of mingyue tunnels they become new groundwater discharge outlets the drainage of the mingyue tunnels accounted for 0 9 9 37 of the underground river s1 discharge from 2019 to 2021 which may result in a reduction in underground river discharge as shown in the fig 10 the predicted discharge of the underground river s1 by the above model is in good agreement with the measured discharge the discharge of underground river s1 fluctuates obviously with precipitation the simulated discharge in dry season is slightly less than the measured flow when the tunnel drainage increases significantly in the rainy season in 2019 and 2020 the simulated underground river s1 discharge is less than the measured flow 4 discussion 4 1 impact of tunnel drainage on the groundwater flow field and groundwater resources 4 1 1 judgment of the relative position of mingyue tunnels and underground river conduits the records of tunnel construction and drainage show that large underground river conduits were not exposed during tunnel excavation therefore the main conduits of the underground river should be below the mingyue tunnels within the seasonal variation zone of groundwater and the underground river conduit of the western trough valley should be closer to the mingyue tunnels the main evidence is as follows first evidence from geophysical prospecting and hydrogeological drilling shows that the location and water level of the underground river conduit in the western trough valley are higher than those in the eastern and middle trough valleys and the connectivity of the karst groundwater system is better therefore the underground river conduit in the western trough valley is closest to the mingyue tunnels and is most vulnerable to the influence of tunnel excavation second according to the water level difference and distance between the skylight y3 and the outlet of the underground river in the dry season the average hydraulic gradient of the underground river in the western trough valley is calculated to be 2 5 based on this calculation the water level of the underground river in the western trough valley near the tunnel site area in the dry season is approximately 227 5 m while the elevation of the mingyue tunnels is 257 64 282 46 m therefore the mingyue tunnels are above the groundwater level in the dry season in this area fig 11 third the tunnel excavation exposed two karst conduits p1 and p2 and the groundwater flow from the karst conduit p1 featured a discharge of 11 1 l s after precipitation the discharge of this karst conduit p1 is very stable in the rainy season while it dries up in the dry season indicating that the mingyue tunnels are below the regional groundwater level finally the tunnel drainage had a significant response to precipitation the precipitation in the dry season is low but the tunnel still has relatively stable drainage the tunnel drainage was 3 82 4 21 l s in the dry season after the tunnel was connected and it accounts for 8 63 10 72 of the underground river discharge in the dry season indicating that the tunnel should be near the groundwater level in the dry season fig 11 4 1 2 impact mode and mechanism due to the excavation of mingyue tunnels the water levels of two surface ponds sh1 and sh2 the water level of a borehole zk1 and the discharge of three epikarst springs in the western trough valley decreased the discharge of an epikarst spring s4 in the middle trough valley and an epikarst spring s2 in the eastern trough valley decreased the discharge of surface karst springs s3 s6 and s7 gradually recovered after the mingyue tunnels were connected therefore it is speculated that during tunnel excavation the northern boundary of the horizontal influence range was 7100 m s7 from the mingyue tunnels the southern boundary was 1700 m underground river outlet s1 from the mingyue tunnels and the east west influence range was between the tunnel entrance and exit the groundwater flow field simulation shows that the impact is relatively serious within 2 km of the mingyue tunnels on both sides vertically the influence range should be from the ground to the bottom of the mingyue tunnels 257 64 282 46 m and it gradually decreases from the tunnel site to the north and south the drainage of the mingyue tunnels has both precipitation and conduit effects during tunnel excavation the drainage in the rainy season accounted for 65 49 75 41 of the annual drainage while the drainage in the dry season accounted for only 24 59 34 51 in july and september 2019 when two karst conduits p1 and p2 were exposed during the excavation of the mingyue tunnels the conduit effect of tunnel drainage was significant from july to october 2019 the tunnel drainage was 17 01 25 0 l s which was the maximum drainage during the excavation and was not affected by the precipitation after the completion of the mingyue tunnels the tunnel drainage no longer had a conduit effect it is speculated that the tunnel drainage reduced the groundwater level and the groundwater level in the rainy season was lower than that of karst conduit p1 before tunnel excavation there are significant temporal and spatial differences in the impact of mingyue tunnel drainage on the groundwater flow field from 2019 to 2021 the tunnel drainage in the rainy season accounted for 0 9 3 09 of the underground river s1 discharge in the same period while the tunnel drainage in the dry season accounted for 3 97 9 37 therefore the tunnel drainage effect is stronger in the dry season precipitation recharge in the rainy season can alleviate the decline in the groundwater level caused by tunnel excavation groundwater resources in karst areas are unevenly distributed in their natural state the maximum discharge of underground rivers in the rainy season is usually dozens of times that in the dry season and the water level may differ by tens of meters the tunnel drainage aggravates the spatial temporal distribution differences in water resources among all kinds of surface water and underground water bodies monitored the most obvious drainage changes were in the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel adjacent to the mingyue tunnels followed by the epikarst springs and ponds the underground river system was also affected but not significantly due to the small proportion of tunnel drainage for underground river discharge although 6 boreholes were monitored only the water level of borehole zk1 above the mingyue tunnels was affected by tunnel drainage the impact of tunnel drainage on the groundwater system in the western trough valley is greater than that in the middle trough valley and the eastern trough valley there are more epikarst springs sinkholes and underground river skylights in the western trough valley and the connectivity of the groundwater system is better the conduits of the underground river and groundwater level in the western trough valley are higher and thus the response to the drainage via the mingyue tunnels is stronger the water bodies south of the mingyue tunnels are more obviously affected by the tunnel drainage the outlet of the underground river epikarst spring s2 pond sh1 and the exit of chongqing lichuan railway tunnel f1 are all south of the mingyue tunnels and karst conduit p1 is mainly discharged from the southern section this difference is mainly because the monitoring water bodies in the south are close to the mingyue tunnels and the mingyue tunnels also intercepted the recharge water source of the southern groundwater body there are two ways in which tunnel excavation affects the groundwater flow field one is the blasting vibration induced by tunnel excavation which leads to the expansion of karst fractures or the generation of new fractures destroys the aqueous medium and leads to the leakage of some shallow groundwater and surface water into the tunnel fig 11 the reduction in shallow water resources will affect groundwater dependent ecosystems liu et al 2019 second the tunnel excavation exposed karst conduits resulting in the groundwater once flowing through these conduits being directly discharged into the tunnel the groundwater level dropping below the conduit the underground river system being damaged and the tunnel becoming a new groundwater outlet in the long term the karstification process can even be altered which in turn may amplify or weaken the effects of climate on vegetation growth jiang et al 2020 4 2 influence of tunnel location on its drainage effect the location of the tunnel directly affects the amount of drainage so it is the most important factor that changes the groundwater flow field vertically although some tunnels in karst mountains may start in the vadose zone at each end they may pass into a transient zone or even a steady state phreatic zone in their central parts creating an elongated zone of depression that permits gravity driven drainage and resulting in a lowered groundwater level ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 and the drying up of springs and even underground rivers if tunnels are excavated above the low groundwater level in the dry season in karst areas and if the tunnel is located below the high groundwater level in the rainy season some epikarst springs may be drained and the shallow groundwater in the aeration zone may be reduced horizontally if the tunnel is located in the recharge area and is near the surface it may affect only the epikarst springs around the recharge area resulting in a slight decrease in underground river discharge downstream while not affecting the epikarst springs downstream if the tunnel is located in the groundwater discharge area and is deep there will be a large drawdown which can affect the whole groundwater system there was no abrupt decrease in the groundwater level or severe drainage of the underground river after the excavation of the mingyue tunnels mainly due to the relatively high position of the tunnel as mentioned above the mingyuen tunnels are at the bottom of the seasonal variation zone that is above the water level in the dry season and below the water level in the wet season close to the dry season water level assuming that the tunnel is below the low water level in the dry season the tunnel drainage may increase several times according to the drainage of several water inflow points in the mingyue tunnels estimated based on the discharge of the underground river in the dry season the groundwater flow field of this hydrogeological unit is reconstructed when the mingyue tunnels are below the groundwater level in the dry season fig 12 when the mingyue tunnels were completed in october 2020 compared with the groundwater flow field when the tunnels are above the groundwater level in the dry season the area of several depression cones near the axis of mingyue tunnels expanded by 2 3 times the depth increased by 30 70 m the catchment effect at the intersection of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and the underground river strengthened and the hydraulic gradient of groundwater increased the horizontal influence range of the mingyue tunnel drainage expanded from 3 km to 8 0 km one year after the completion of the mingyue tunnels in october 2021 compared with the groundwater flow field when the tunnel is above the groundwater level in the dry season the depth of several depression cones near the axis of the mingyue tunnel increased by 20 80 m the catchment effect at the intersection of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel and the underground river was stronger and the hydraulic gradient of groundwater and the scope of influence were larger 4 3 influence of precipitation on the tunnel drainage effect the main source of recharge in the study area is precipitation in the natural state the response of the groundwater level and underground river discharge to precipitation is very significant considering the interference of tunnel variations of the tunnel drainage the groundwater level near the tunnel and the flow of underground river s1 under different precipitation conditions are predicted fig 13 when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the drainage of mingyue tunnels in dry season increase by 15 59 with an average increase of 35 and the drainage of mingyue tunnels in rainy season increase by 3 23 with an average increase of 10 when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the drainage of mingyue tunnels in dry season increase by 19 62 with an average increase of 38 and the drainage of mingyue tunnels in rainy season increase by 14 35 with an average increase of 21 fig 13a the drainage of mingyue tunnels responds more significantly to precipitation in dry season which is consistent with the previous observation results when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 5 7 in dry season with an average increase of 6 and the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 5 in rainy season when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 13 14 in dry season with an average increase of 14 and the groundwater level near mingyue tunnels increases by 10 11 in rainy season with an average increase of 11 fig 13b the annual average groundwater level near the mingyue tunnels rises up by 12 46 m and 16 42 m respectively with the increase of precipitation however the increase of precipitation promotes the underground river discharge and tunnel drainage resulting in the drawdown of groundwater level near the tunnel in the same period and the drawdown is greater in rainy season than that in dry season therefore the groundwater level near the tunnel in rainy season is lower than that in dry season which is significantly different from that in natural state when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the discharge of underground river s1 in dry season increases by 7 94 with an average increase of 40 and the discharge of underground river s1 in rainy season increases by 36 106 with an average increase of 81 when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the discharge of underground river s1 in dry season increases by 20 125 with an average increase of 62 and the discharge of underground river s1 in rainy season increases by 54 182 with an average increase of 120 fig 13c under the interference of mingyue tunnels the discharge of underground river s1 still responds significantly to the increase of precipitation and the increase in rainy season is greater than that in dry season when the precipitation increases by 200 mm and 400 mm respectively the average discharge ratio of the underground river in rainy season and dry season increases from 5 7 to 7 76 and 7 82 respectively as mentioned above the drainage effect of tunnel is more significant in dry season and the tunnel drainage accounts for a larger proportion of underground river discharge therefore driven by the increase of precipitation and tunnel drainage the seasonal variation of underground river discharge is exacerbated 4 4 recovery of groundwater resources the prediction of groundwater flow budget shows that the net loss of groundwater storage is 1 7 105 m3 a under the current precipitation conditions the net loss of groundwater storage is 1 2 105 m3 a when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm the net loss of groundwater storage is 0 5 105 m3 a when the annual precipitation increases by 400 mm the simulation prediction indicates that although the increase of precipitation raises the groundwater level and alleviates the drainage effect there is still a loss of groundwater storage 4 5 limitations and improvement methods some limitations and improvement methods in this study are as follows first the karst aquifer is heterogeneous so the hydrogeological parameters vary greatly and will change due to tunnel interference the detailed hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation are the most important factor for the success of modeling in this study 8 geological profiles were measured and the real thicknesses of the strata in the simulation area were obtained the discharges of 10 springs in the dry season were measured twice and the precipitation infiltration coefficients before and after tunnel excavation were obtained three geophysical prospecting methods and twenty six hydrogeological boreholes were used to confirm the distribution and elevation of underground karst fractures conduits and caves more than 26 pumping tests and water pressure tests were carried out before and after tunnel excavation and the hydrogeological parameters before and after tunnel excavation were obtained the model is calibrated by using the water level observation data before and after tunnel excavation to ensure the effectiveness of the model second visual modflow assumes that the flow field is continuous and that flow movement obeys darcy s law and it is not an ideal model to simulate karst groundwater flow some efforts have been made to solve the contradiction between the heterogeneity in karst aquifers and the assumptions of the model a large number of hydrogeological parameters are obtained before and after tunnel excavation then due to the heterogeneity in the karst aqueous medium different parameters are assigned to different karst conduits with different elevations based on abundant observed water level data before and after tunnel excavation the model is modified and the hydrogeological parameters are inverted to establish a more realistic groundwater flow field finally due to the limitations of the model the water exchange between underground river and conduits with metrix is not considered this study improves the accuracy of simulation by increasing hydrogeological tests and obtaining more hydrogeological parameters 5 conclusion and prospects thirty four surface ponds springs underground rivers and boreholes were monitored in a karst trough valley in southwest china and visual modflow was used to simulate predict and calculate the groundwater flow field and discharge thus the change in the groundwater flow field and the discharge of the underground river were revealed and then the hydrogeological impact of tunnel excavation on the karst groundwater aquifer was quantitatively evaluated observation and simulation indicate that tunnel excavation has a differential impact on groundwater flow field and discharge the drainage effect of tunnel is more significant in dry season the underground system in the western trough valley responds more strongly to the tunnel drainage the surface water level dropped by 0 69 2 45 m the discharge of five epikarst springs dropped abruptly or almost drained the drainage of the chongqing lichuan railway tunnel decreased by approximately a quarter and the groundwater level of the borehole dropped by approximately 20 m the northern and southern boundaries of the horizontal influence range were 7100 m and 1700 m from the mingyue tunnels respectively vertically the influence range extends from the ground to the bottom of the mingyue tunnels there is a drawdown of 10 30 m due to the excavation of the mingyue tunnels the simulation results predict that the drainage effect is more significant when the tunnels are below the groundwater level in the dry season driven by the increase of precipitation and tunnel drainage the seasonal variation of underground river discharge is exacerbated the increase of precipitation promotes the underground river discharge and tunnel drainage resulting in the drawdown of groundwater level near the tunnel in the same period therefore the groundwater level near the tunnel in the rainy season is lower than that in the dry season which is opposite to that in natural state the groundwater flow budget calculation and prediction suggest that the net loss of groundwater storage was 6 1 105 m3 during tunnel excavation and the net loss of groundwater storage is about 1 7 105 m3 one year after the tunnels were completed while the depression cones continue to expand the net loss of groundwater storage is 1 2 105 m3 a and 0 5 105 m3 a when the annual precipitation increases by 200 mm and 400 mm respectively the increase of precipitation raises the groundwater level and alleviates the drainage effect but the increased precipitation recharge is less than groundwater discharge and tunnel drainage and there is still a loss of groundwater storage so it is difficult to restore the groundwater flow field and discharge in a short time this study provides evidence and a useful method to quantitatively evaluate the effects of tunnel excavation on the groundwater flow field and to inform better measures to protect karst groundwater resources in the future we will continue to observe the groundwater level and hydrochemical characteristics around the completed mingyue tunnels to study the recovery process of the groundwater flow field credit
