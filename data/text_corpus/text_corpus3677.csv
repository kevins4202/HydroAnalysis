metatranscriptomics 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps designed for nitrogen removal are essential for environmental protection from the increasing anthropogenic wastewater and nitrogen pollution the nitrification denitrification procedure has been widely used for ammonium rich wastewater treatment in which ammonia is firstly oxidized to nitrate via nitrite under aerobic condition and later the oxidized nitrate is anaerobically converted to nitrogen gas in the presence of organic carbons as a source of electron however it is economically expensive due to the high oxygen demand for complete nitrification the requirement of external carbon source for heterotrophic denitrifiers and the high sludge production and greenhouse gases n2o emission shalini and joseph 2012 nitrogen removal from wastewater by anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process a short cut in the nitrogen removal by direct transforming ammonium and nitrite to nitrogen gas kartal et al 2013 has been recognized as an efficient and cost effective alternative to the nitrification denitrification process ali and okabe 2015 ma et al 2016 shalini and joseph 2012 since the first discovery of anammox in a denitrifying fluidized bed reactor in the netherlands mulder et al 1995 extensive researches have been carried out to develop anammox based technologies several processes and reactor types have been proposed and designed for efficient use of anammox partial nitrification anammox pna procedure was designed for anammox application to treat ammonium rich wastewater with low c n ratio van dongen et al 2001 nevertheless most of the ammonium rich wastewater was produced with a certain concentration range of organic carbon such as landfill leachates chen et al 2009 due to the negative effect of organic carbon on anammox activity waki et al 2007 reactors that combine application of anammox and heterotrophic denitrification were designed for the ammonium rich and organic carbon rich wastewater treatment such as simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification snad procedure chen et al 2009 lan et al 2011 however it is very time consuming to establish anammox in full scale conventional wwtps and produce enough biomass for effective inorganic nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment because of the long doubling time and low biomass yield of anammox bacteria ali et al 2015 awata et al 2013 cho et al 2011 strous et al 1998 van der star et al 2007 interestingly anammox bacteria were observed as visible granules in some wwtps treating ammonium rich landfill leachate with high efficiency in nitrogen removal and subsequent inoculation to similar plants with the anammox pellets was made and successful establishment of anammox was observed in as little as six months meng et al 2017 yang et al 2018 this provides us with an alternative and more economical approach for the application of anammox in full scale ammonium rich wwtps most previous studies on nitrogen removal related microorganisms in wwtps were focused on ecological distribution using 16s rrna gene or functional gene sequencing han et al 2017 li and gu 2016 zhou et al 2017 2018 with the development of high throughput sequencing techniques and the subsequent data analysis methods it is possible to further reveal the in depth potential molecular and metabolic mechanisms of the major microorganisms in wwtps metagenomics was successfully used to reveal antibiotic resistance genes liu et al 2019 ng et al 2019 biological phosphorus removal law et al 2016 and bacterial response to operational disturbance p√©rez et al 2019 in full scale municipal wwtps relying on the genome centric metagenomics a genome based ecological model of the microbial community in a full scale pna reactor was built speth et al 2016 and the potential interactions between heterotrophic bacteria and anammox bacteria in a laboratory scale anammox bioreactor was analyzed lawson et al 2017 however our knowledge on the complex microbial nitrogen cycling networks in anammox driven conventional wwtps that use exogenous active anammox pellets as seeds for inoculation is still lacking consequently the objectives of this study were to i investigate the feasibility of anammox establishment and application in distinct full scale wwtps by direct inoculation of the exogenous active anammox pellets ii describe the microbial community in these three wastewater treatment ecosystems iii construct the complex nitrogen cycling networks carried out by the cooperation of different active microbial groups the metagenomic approach was applied to confirm the existence of anammox identify the metagenomic assembled genomes mags of anammox bacteria and reconstruct the overall microbial nitrogen cycling networks the metatranscriptomic approach was used to confirm the activity of the established anammox bacteria and estimate the potential contributions of active microbial groups to nitrogen removal furthermore the activity of nitrification was confirmed by batch cultivation and the rates of anammox and denitrification processes to n2 release were evaluated by nitrogen 15 based isotope pairing tests this is the first system wide metagenomic and metatranscriptomic description of the feasibility of anammox establishment in full scale systems by direct inoculation of the exogenous anammox pellets and overall microbial nitrogen removal in anammox inoculated conventional wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection three distinct conventional wwtps from taiwan including bali bl and linkou lk wwtps in new taipei and wenshan ws wwtp in taichung were used to investigate the microbial nitrogen cycling network after direct inoculation of the exogenous anammox pellets tables 1 and s1 bl and ws are equipped with an aeration tank and a deep oxidation ditch for biological nitrogen removal respectively figs s1 and s3 the aeration in lk is configured as an anaerobic aerobic anoxic aerobic anoxic aoaoa system fig s2 macroscopic anammox pellets were naturally formed in the aeration tank of an ammonium rich wwtp tianwaitian twt in keelung treating landfill leachate from which three tons activated sludge with active anammox pellets were inoculated into the aeration tank of bl and the deep oxidation ditch of ws in april 2011 table 1 the aeration intensity in the aeration tank of bl and the deep oxidation ditch of ws was kept at relatively low levels table s1 to reduce the inhibition of oxygen to anammox bacteria macroscopic anammox pellets were formed in the aerobic tank of bl after six months subsequently three tons activated sludge from the aeration tank of bl were inoculated into the anaerobic tank of lk in october 2011 table 1 after five years of stable operation activated sludge samples were collected from bl lk and ws on december 25 26 2015 fresh activated sludges were transported to the lab and inoculated into a modified ammonia oxidizing microorganism medium see below for batch cultivation to measure the rates of anammox and denitrification processes to n2 release by 15no3 based isotope pairing fresh activated sludges were transferred into the sealed glass vials immediately during sampling to furthest reduce the negative effect of oxygen on the activity of anammox bacteria activated sludge samples for nucleic acids isolation were collected in three technical replicates at each sampling site samples for dna isolation were stored at 20 c and samples for rna isolation were preserved in rnalater mo bio usa total dna and rna extractions from the same sample were finished within one week the free ammonia concentration was calculated by ammonia calculator http www hbuehrer ch rechner ammonia html 2 2 aerobic ammonium oxidation activity fresh activated sludges were inoculated 20 v v into a modified ammonia oxidizing microorganism aom medium lebedeva et al 2013 with 1 mm nh4cl and incubated at 28 c the ph of the medium was kept around 7 6 by the nahco3 buffering system during cultivation the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were measured every day until ammonium was fully oxidized the concentration of ammonium was measured photometrically hood nowotny et al 2010 kandeler and gerber 1988 nitrate was reduced to nitrite by vanadium chloride and nitrite and nitrate were determined photometrically miranda et al 2001 batch cultivation of fresh activated sludge was done in three technical replicates for each sampling site 2 3 15no3 based anammox and denitrification rates anammox and denitrification rates of these three activated sludges samples were measured by 15no3 based isotope pairing as previous descriptions hou et al 2012 risgaard petersen et al 2004 in brief the fresh activated sludges were transferred into 50 ml helium flushed glass vials activated sludges were pre incubated for 24 h to remove residual nox and oxygen at room temperature 25 c after pre incubation these activated sludges were spiked through the septum with helium purged 15no3 15n at 99 stock solution with a 100 Œºm final concentration of 15n activated sludges were incubated at room temperature for 8 h and the incubation was stopped by injecting 2 ml 50 zncl2 solution the produced 29n2 and 30n2 over the incubation period were measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden finally rates of anammox and denitrification and their contributions to total n2 production were calculated as previous descriptions thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 trimmer et al 2003 anammox and denitrification rates were measured in four technical replicates in each sampling site 2 4 extraction of nucleic acids and pyrosequencing as described above activated sludge samples for nucleic acids extraction were collected in three technical replicates at each sampling site dna and rna were extracted from each replicate to collect sufficient amounts of nucleic acids for deep sequencing the dna or rna respectively extracted from each sample was then pooled activated sludge samples were centrifuged 3214 g 10 min 4 c to remove the supernatant total dna and rna were extracted using the powermax soil dna isolation kit mo bio usa and rna powersoil total rna isolation kit mo bio usa respectively following rna extraction genomic dna was removed from total rna using the turbo dna free kit ambion usa and the remaining rna was concentrated using the rneasy minelute cleanup kit qiagen germany concentrated rna was converted to double strand cdna using the superscript iii first strand synthesis system invitrogen usa with priming via random hexamers for first strand synthesis and the superscript double stranded cdna synthesis kit invitrogen usa for second stranded synthesis total dna and the synthetic double stranded

hyatt et al 2010 the annotation of nitrogen cycle related gene table s6 were done by the doe joint genome institutes jgi integrated microbial genomes pipeline furthermore predicted orfs were searched by blastp against the custom databases with e value 10 10 all blast hits were compared against the ncbi refseq protein database only those that had the highest identity to nitrogen cycle related genes were considered for the custom databases construction amino acid sequences of each nitrogen cycle related gene were downloaded from ncbi and uniprotkb swiss prot all downloaded amino acid sequences

with e value 10 10 the phylogenic tree was generated using the 16s rrna gene sequences length 800 bp from all mags and reference sequences in the silva 128 ssuref database hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao like enzymes were evolved from cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfa bergmann et al 2005 that referential nrfa and hao sequences together with hao like sequences identified in the three anammox bacterial mags in this study were used for phylogenetic analysis the comparison of anammox bacterial community between the exogenous anammox pellets from the aerobic tank of twt and the two anammox driven wwtps bl and ws with the formation of macroscopic anammox pellets were analyzed all the anammox bacterial operational taxonomic units otus 97 identity were extracted from the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing datasets of twt bl and ws unpublished results phylogenetic analysis was carried out between these extracted otus and anammox bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences deposited in the silva 128 ssuref database in all above phylogenetic analyses amino acids or nucleotide sequences were aligned with mafft yamada et al 2016 the gaps in the multiple sequence alignment were removed by

cgi 2 8 data availability raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences can be found on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under bioproject prjna406858 the three anammox bacterial mags bl1 bl10 and ws118 are available in ncbi genbank under the accession numbers phfz00000000 phfy00000000 and phfx00000000 3 results and discussion 3 1 anammox establishment and nitrogen removal performance the concentrations of ammonium nitrate bod and cod in the influent wastewater and effluent wastewater over a one month period before the time of sampling are provided table s1 bl and ws are the ammonium rich wwtps treating landfill leachate lk is the municipal wwtp with a relatively low concentration of ammonium table s1 the unexpectedly high bod and cod in lk was because the supernatant and filtrate from sludge thickening and dewatering were poured into the influent wastewater fig s2 nearly 28 38 and 50 of the consumed ammonium was completely oxidized and discharged in the form of nitrate in bl lk and ws respectively table s1 ammonium was completely removed in lk and ws only 40 5 of the inputted ammonium was removed in bl but it removed the highest amount of total nitrogen 97 mg l table s1 the relative low ammonium removal rate of bl might because of the high ammonium input and relative short hydraulic retention time table s1 that the reactor could not efficiently remove all the influent ammonium according to the records macroscopic anammox granules were not naturally formed in bl lk and ws wwtps notably after the inoculation of extraneous anammox pellets for at least six months macroscopic anammox granules were formed in the aeration tank of bl and the deep oxidation ditch of ws the two ammonium rich wwtps table s1 in total six anammox bacterial otus were detected in the exogenous activated sludge from twt source of anammox pellets meanwhile all six otus were also detected in bl and three of them were detected in ws fig s4 but additional anammox bacterial otus were not found in these two wwtps this reflects the established anammox bacteria in bl and ws likely come from the inoculation of exogenous anammox pellets the rates of anammox and denitrification processes in bl lk and ws were measured by 15no3 isotope pairing fig 1 a anammox was the dominant process for n2 production in bl where denitrification activity could not be detected fig 1a on the contrary denitrification was the major n2 production process in lk and ws meanwhile anammox activity could be detected in ws fig 1a in addition the activity of aerobic ammonium oxidation was identified by cultivation in the optimized aom medium all the three diluted 5 fold activated sludge samples could completely oxidize 1 mm ammonium within three days fig 1b c d reflects nitrifiers in activated sludges were active a significant concentration of nitrite was accumulated in bl nearly 0 6 mm after one day of cultivation fig 1b this may because of the enormous imbalance of the abundances of aob and nob see below 3 2 genome reconstruction shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on the three activated sludge samples collected from bl lk and ws produced a total of 1 48 billion metagenomic reads and 1 06 billion metatranscriptomic reads table s3 liu et al 2019 more than 90 million non rrna metatranscriptomic reads were acquired after removing rrna reads de novo assembly and binning of the metagenomic reads result in a total of 905 mags 196 of them were the near complete mags with completeness larger than 80 and contamination smaller than 10 table s4 most of the acquired mags are bacteria only except for the four mags in lk lk223 and ws ws9 ws208 ws191 which were clustered in phyla euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota fig s5 fig s6 table s5 3 3 abundance and transcript of nitrogen cycle related gene most of the nitrogen cycle related genes table s6 detected in assembled scaffolds were also detected in mags after binning fig s7 so that gene content and transcript analyses of mags can provide enough resolution to obtain comprehensive insights into microbial nitrogen removal ammonium consumption processes including nitrification amo hao and nxr denitrification narg nirk s norb z and nos anammox hzs hao and nxr and ammonium assimilation glna related genes were much high in both abundances and transcript levels fig 2 in contrast ammonium production processes including dinitrogen n2 fixation nifh dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium nrf and urea decomposition ure related genes were in relatively low levels fig 2 ammonia appears to be rapidly oxidized in all the three plants by aerobic ammonia oxidizers according to the high transcript levels of amo and hao genes fig 2 genes of hzs hao and nxr were highly transcribed in bl and ws fig 2 reflects the established anammox bacteria actively participated in nitrogen removal more functional genes were highly transcribed in ws compared to another two plants which reflects more diverse organisms actively contributed to nitrogen transformation and removal fig 2 notably abundances and transcript levels of nitrogen cycle related functional genes in the municipal wwtp lk were much lower than the two ammonium rich wwtps bl and ws fig 2 3 4 nitrogen removal related microorganisms nitrification serves a key function in nitrogen removal by providing nox to denitrification and anammox processes in bl nitrosomonas bl36 and bl56 was the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob with the high transcripts of functional genes amo and hao fig 3 b nitrospira bl254 was the unique nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in bl but the transcripts of all the three subunits of nxr were not detected fig 3b nitrosomonas was also the dominant aob in the anaerobic tank of lk but canonical nob was not detected fig 3b unexpectedly complete ammonia oxidizers comammox nitrospira lk70 265 daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 dominated the nitrifier community in lk although the presence of aob nitrosomonas fig 3b members of comammox nitrospira ws110 ws238 were also detected in ws fig 3b comammox organisms appear to oxidize ammonia actively in these two plants as the transcripts of comammox functional genes were detected in all the four comammox mags fig 3b unexpectedly ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa thaumarchaeota ws9 ws192 ws208 were the dominant nitrifier in the ammonium rich ws with the highest amo transcript fig 3b differ from bl and lk nxr genes of a canonical nob nitrospira ws74 and an unclassified nitrospirae bacterium ws250 were highly transcribed in ws fig 3b so that the oxidized nitrite could be further oxidized to nitrate by nob denitrification is a respiratory process in which nitrate is reduced stepwise to dinitrogen gas no3 no2 no n2o n2 nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nirk s nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos are the key denitrifying enzymes in some denitrifiers the function of membrane bound nar complex could be replaced by periplasmic nitrate reductase nap kraft et al 2011 unlike anammox and nitrification denitrification is carried out by a diverse population organisms that contain at least one denitrifying gene were regarded as denitrifiers in this study the distribution of denitrifying genes in the top 20 abundant near complete genomes in each metagenomic dataset 60 mags in total was summarized fig s8 most of mags contain at least one denitrifying marker gene but only five mags encoded the complete denitrification pathway fig s8 consistently studies on agricultural soils and activated sludge showed that none of the recovered putative denitrifier genomes encoded the complete denitrification pathway orellana et al 2018 speth et al 2016 there is a growing realization on denitrification that complete denitrification by single microorganisms is the exception rather than the rule kuypers et al 2018 anammox bacterial mags were only recovered from bl and ws the two ammonium rich wwtps treating landfill leachate illustrating the strong selection towards wastewater source for anammox establishment a ca brocadia strain bl1 and a ca kuenenia strain bl10 were accumulated in bl and a ca brocadia strain ws118 was detected in ws fig 3b consistent with previous studies kartal et al 2011 van de vossenberg et al 2013 hao and hzs were excessively transcribed by both ca brocadia and ca kuenenia fig 3b ca brocadia is the predominant anammox bacteria in both bl and ws as well as previously studied wwtps lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 yang et al 2018 3 5 complex microbial nitrogen cycling networks a typical pna nitrogen removal procedure was established in bl which is the cost effectively and widely used nitrogen removal system for ammonium rich wastewater treatment lackner et al 2014 in which anammox and partial nitrification nh3 no2 were the two major components fig 3a niche preferences of the two components are quite distinguish that most of aob distribute in the granule surface to acquire oxygen for aerobic ammonia oxidation and the oxygen sensitive anammox bacteria prefer to stay in the anaerobic granule core speth et al 2016 the surface aob provides nitrite and anaerobic environment to anammox bacteria in the granule core by partly oxidizing ammonia to nitrite and sufficiently consuming the dissolved oxygen anammox bacteria could acquire energy for growth and achieve shortcut nitrogen removal by transforming the oxidized nitrite and the remaining ammonium to nitrogen gas benefit from the protection of o2 respiring community anammox bacteria could be alive in aerobic tanks even when do exceeds 2 mg l wang et al 2015 the transcript of nxr gene could not be detected under such high sequencing depth table s3 despite the existence of nob nitrospira fig 3b operation at limiting oxygen concentration in a pna system allowed stable suppression of the activity of nob laureni et al 2016 and larger than 95 nitrite accumulation rate was achieved when do was maintained at 0 4 0 7 mg l in a continuous pilot plant ma et al 2009 the lower oxygen monod half saturation constant of aob than nob blackburne et al 2008 guisasola et al 2005 allowed aob to consume oxygen rapidly by efficiently oxidizing ammonia and reducing the oxygen accessibility for nob nozhevnikova et al 2012 wang and yang 2004 furthermore the high concentration of ammonium in wastewater might directly inhibit the activity of nob the free ammonia in bl was 5 4 mg l table 1 which is larger than the inhibition thresholds of nitrospira sp strain nd1 0 85 mg l and nitrospira japonica strain nj1 4 3 mg l ushiki et al 2017 therefore the activity of nob in bl appears to be inhibited by the low aeration and the high residual ammonium table 1 table s1 as well as some unknown nob inhibitors in the complex wastewater however the activity of nob was rapidly recovered by inoculating the activated sludge into the optimal nitrifier medium fig 1b the presence of nob in bl might be because of the microbial migration from influent wastewater since some microorganisms even become the most abundant groups despite with low activities in activated sludge owing to the high migration from influent wastewater saunders et al 2016 therefore nitrite could not be oxidized to nitrate by nob under such operation conditions table 1 table s1 but nitrate was accumulated in the effluent wastewater table s1 which might be the byproduct of co2 fixation of anammox bacteria by oxidizing nitrite to nitrate to generate reducing equivalents jetten et al 2009 lotti et al 2014 strous et al 2006 since nxr gene was highly transcribed by anammox bacteria bl1 and bl10 fig 3b according to the mean oxidized ammonium in bl table s1 around 35 1 and 21 7 mg l nitrate could be generated by anammox bacteria based on the original strous et al 1998 and the revised lotti et al 2014 anammox stoichiometries respectively the low transcripts of functional genes of denitrification fig 3 and the undetectable denitrification activity in the isotope pairing experiment fig 1a reflect denitrifying activity is very weak in bl because of this only a tiny amount of organic pollutions was consumed table s1 around 40 5 135 mg l of the incoming ammonium from influent wastewater were consumed by the established pna system table s1 less than 30 of the consumed ammonium was oxidized to nitrate and more than 70 of them likely be released in the form of n2 through anammox process table s1 in ws wwtp nitrification denitrification nitrogen removal procedure was established in which nitrifiers and denitrifiers were the dominant players while active anammox bacteria was also detected fig 3a aerobic nitrifiers mainly distribute in the outer part of the granule and oxygen sensitive anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers usually hide in the granule core chen et al 2009 the high active nitrifiers could effectively oxidize ammonia and provide nox and anaerobic microenvironment to anammox bacteria and denitrifiers in the granule core different from bl nxr genes of nob and comammox organisms were highly transcribed fig 3 so that the oxidized nitrite could be rapidly oxidized to nitrate in ws the relative abundance of anammox bacteria in ws was much lower compared to the predominance of anammox bacteria in bl this appears to be because of the relatively low ammonium input high biodegradable organic compounds table 1 table s1 and the fierce substrate competition from aoa aob comammox nob and denitrifiers fig 3 while the high active heterotrophic denitrifiers in ws fig 3 might retard the inhibition of organic carbon on anammox anjali and sabumon 2014 waki et al 2007 unexpectedly aoa thaumarchaeota ws9 ws192 ws208 dominated the nitrifying community in ws in the presence of aob nitrosomonas fig 3b aoa was reported mainly found in low dissolved oxygen levels and long solid retention times wwtps park et al 2006 yet how did aoa accumulate in ws remains unclear nearly 95 112 mg l of the incoming ammonium was consumed in ws table s1 half of the consumed ammonium was completely oxidized and discharged into effluent wastewater in the form of nitrate another half appeared to be removed through anammox and denitrification processes table s1 according to the isotopic tracing fig 1a denitrification process likely carried out more n2 release in ws compared to anammox reasonably because of the high denitrification activity figs 1a and 3 the highest rate of organic matters was consumed in ws table s1 anammox bacteria was not detected in lk fig 3 under such high metagenomic sequencing depth table s3 consistently n2 release by anammox process was not detected in the isotope pairing experiment fig 1a instead nitrification denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal process fig 3 unexpectedly comammox nitrospira lk70 lk265 was the most abundant nitrifier in this anaerobic reactor with a relative low concentration of ammonium and an extremely high concentration of organic carbon fig 3b the extremely low dissolved oxygen in the anaerobic tank table 1 table s1 likely restrict the activity of aob nitrosomonas but the anaerobic condition may favor the growth of comammox organisms because it was reported a high degree of comammox nitrospira enrichment was acquired in low dissolved oxygen bioreactor inoculated with activated sludge camejo et al 2017 around 98 4 62 mg l of the incoming ammonium was oxidized and removed in lk table s1 nearly 38 of the removed ammonium was discharged into effluent wastewater in the form of nitrate in the absence of nob table s1 illustrating ammonia and nitrite oxidation activity of comammox organisms is considerable in the full scale municipal wwtp a heterotrophic chlorobi affiliated bacterium was proposed as the biggest contributor to the degradation of protein and peptides produced by anammox bacteria while recycling nitrate to nitrite to feed anammox bacteria in the anammox community lawson et al 2017 chlorobi affiliated nitrate reducers were also found in bl bl7 bl45 bl118 and ws ws140 fig s5 the two systems with shortcut nitrogen removal by anammox transcripts of nitrate reductase genes in bl7 bl45 and ws140 were also detected indicating they might be the active cooperators of anammox bacteria by partially reducing nitrate and forming nitrite loop with the nitrite oxidation process of anammox bacteria 3 6 description of the nitrite reductase and hao like proteins of anammox bacteria three anammox bacterial mags bl1 bl10 and ws118 were recovered from bl and ws fig 3 which were tentatively named as ca brocadia sp bl1 ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genome bl10 and ca brocadia sp ws118 in ca kuenenia and ca scalindua nirs is the enzyme catalyzing no2 reduction to no the precursor of n2h4 synthesis kartal et al 2011 van de vossenberg et al 2013 the function of nirs is replaced by nirk in ca jettenia hira et al 2012 hu et al 2012 while both nirs and nirk were not found in ca brocadia lawson et al 2017 oshiki et al 2016 speth et al 2016 consistently no forming nitrite reductase nirs or nirk was not found in bl1 but a nirs was found in ws118 with a very weak transcript fig 4 to the best of our knowledge this is the first discovery of nirs gene in ca brocadia nh2oh rather than no was identified as the precursor of n2h4 synthesis of ca brocadia sinica but the nh2oh generation nitrite reductase is still unknown oshiki et al 2016 the multiple hao like proteins were proposed as the candidate enzymes catalyzing no2 reduction to nh2oh in ca brocadia kartal et al 2013 oshiki et al 2016 a nh4 forming cytochrome c nitrite reductase gene cluster nrf was only found in the two ca brocadia mags bl1 and ws110 fig 4 almost all the recovered subunits of nrf were transcribed fig 4b but the function of nrf enzyme in anammox metabolism is still unclear in the absence of ammonium the way of nitrite reducing to ammonium was regarded as a missing piece in the anammox puzzle kartal and keltjens 2016 nitrite may serve as the electron acceptor for organic compounds oxidation meanwhile generating ammonium by nrf enzyme kartal et al 2013 another possibility is the encoded nrf and nirk s in ca brocadia work for detoxification in cell physiology by eliminating the accumulated harmful intermediates including no2 and nh2oh this function likely contributes to the tolerance of ca brocadia to a relatively high nitrite concentration langone et al 2014 lotti et al 2012 at least six hao like protein coding genes were recovered from each anammox bacterial mag and most of them were transcribed fig s9 suggesting hao like proteins play important roles in anammox metabolisms hao like proteins are evolved from nrf bergmann et al 2005 but have quite different

identified in the three mags were clustered into the same group with kustc1061 in the phylogenetic tree fig s9 illustrating the high nh2oh and n2h4 oxidizing activities in anammox metabolisms 4 conclusions and implications our results present the first system wide microbial nitrogen cycling networks in conventional wwtps after anammox inoculation by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics modern pna procedure with shortcut nitrogen removal by anammox was established in the ammonium rich wwtp of bl and a tiny amount of active anammox bacteria was also established in ws using exogenous anammox pellets as seeds for inoculation the activities of anammox in the two wwtps were confirmed by the combined metatranscriptome and nitrogen 15 based isotope pairing the establishment of active anammox bacteria identifies the feasibility to establish anammox and achieve shortcut nitrogen removal in ammonium rich systems by direct inoculation of the existing anammox pellets unexpectedly the newly identified comammox nitrospira dominated the nitrifying community in the anaerobic tank of the municipal wwtp which is characterized by a plethora of organic matters furthermore aoa thaumarchaeota predominated the nitrifier communities in the deep oxidation ditch of an ammonium rich wwtp the metabolic versatilities adaptive mechanisms and application potential in optimizing nitrogen removal in current and new bioreactor of these comammox and aoa organisms are of great interests to be investigated in further studies furthermore the symbiotic relationships between autotrophic nitrogen removal microorganisms and the dominant heterotrophic microorganisms deserve more attention the roles of variables in shaping nitrogen transforming microbial networks such as the

metatranscriptomics 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps designed for nitrogen removal are essential for environmental protection from the increasing anthropogenic wastewater and nitrogen pollution the nitrification denitrification procedure has been widely used for ammonium rich wastewater treatment in which ammonia is firstly oxidized to nitrate via nitrite under aerobic condition and later the oxidized nitrate is anaerobically converted to nitrogen gas in the presence of organic carbons as a source of electron however it is economically expensive due to the high oxygen demand for complete nitrification the requirement of external carbon source for heterotrophic denitrifiers and the high sludge production and greenhouse gases n2o emission shalini and joseph 2012 nitrogen removal from wastewater by anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process a short cut in the nitrogen removal by direct transforming ammonium and nitrite to nitrogen gas kartal et al 2013 has been recognized as an efficient and cost effective alternative to the nitrification denitrification process ali and okabe 2015 ma et al 2016 shalini and joseph 2012 since the first discovery of anammox in a denitrifying fluidized bed reactor in the netherlands mulder et al 1995 extensive researches have been carried out to develop anammox based technologies several processes and reactor types have been proposed and designed for efficient use of anammox partial nitrification anammox pna procedure was designed for anammox application to treat ammonium rich wastewater with low c n ratio van dongen et al 2001 nevertheless most of the ammonium rich wastewater was produced with a certain concentration range of organic carbon such as landfill leachates chen et al 2009 due to the negative effect of organic carbon on anammox activity waki et al 2007 reactors that combine application of anammox and heterotrophic denitrification were designed for the ammonium rich and organic carbon rich wastewater treatment such as simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification snad procedure chen et al 2009 lan et al 2011 however it is very time consuming to establish anammox in full scale conventional wwtps and produce enough biomass for effective inorganic nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment because of the long doubling time and low biomass yield of anammox bacteria ali et al 2015 awata et al 2013 cho et al 2011 strous et al 1998 van der star et al 2007 interestingly anammox bacteria were observed as visible granules in some wwtps treating ammonium rich landfill leachate with high efficiency in nitrogen removal and subsequent inoculation to similar plants with the anammox pellets was made and successful establishment of anammox was observed in as little as six months meng et al 2017 yang et al 2018 this provides us with an alternative and more economical approach for the application of anammox in full scale ammonium rich wwtps most previous studies on nitrogen removal related microorganisms in wwtps were focused on ecological distribution using 16s rrna gene or functional gene sequencing han et al 2017 li and gu 2016 zhou et al 2017 2018 with the development of high throughput sequencing techniques and the subsequent data analysis methods it is possible to further reveal the in depth potential molecular and metabolic mechanisms of the major microorganisms in wwtps metagenomics was successfully used to reveal antibiotic resistance genes liu et al 2019 ng et al 2019 biological phosphorus removal law et al 2016 and bacterial response to operational disturbance p√©rez et al 2019 in full scale municipal wwtps relying on the genome centric metagenomics a genome based ecological model of the microbial community in a full scale pna reactor was built speth et al 2016 and the potential interactions between heterotrophic bacteria and anammox bacteria in a laboratory scale anammox bioreactor was analyzed lawson et al 2017 however our knowledge on the complex microbial nitrogen cycling networks in anammox driven conventional wwtps that use exogenous active anammox pellets as seeds for inoculation is still lacking consequently the objectives of this study were to i investigate the feasibility of anammox establishment and application in distinct full scale wwtps by direct inoculation of the exogenous active anammox pellets ii describe the microbial community in these three wastewater treatment ecosystems iii construct the complex nitrogen cycling networks carried out by the cooperation of different active microbial groups the metagenomic approach was applied to confirm the existence of anammox identify the metagenomic assembled genomes mags of anammox bacteria and reconstruct the overall microbial nitrogen cycling networks the metatranscriptomic approach was used to confirm the activity of the established anammox bacteria and estimate the potential contributions of active microbial groups to nitrogen removal furthermore the activity of nitrification was confirmed by batch cultivation and the rates of anammox and denitrification processes to n2 release were evaluated by nitrogen 15 based isotope pairing tests this is the first system wide metagenomic and metatranscriptomic description of the feasibility of anammox establishment in full scale systems by direct inoculation of the exogenous anammox pellets and overall microbial nitrogen removal in anammox inoculated conventional wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection three distinct conventional wwtps from taiwan including bali bl and linkou lk wwtps in new taipei and wenshan ws wwtp in taichung were used to investigate the microbial nitrogen cycling network after direct inoculation of the exogenous anammox pellets tables 1 and s1 bl and ws are equipped with an aeration tank and a deep oxidation ditch for biological nitrogen removal respectively figs s1 and s3 the aeration in lk is configured as an anaerobic aerobic anoxic aerobic anoxic aoaoa system fig s2 macroscopic anammox pellets were naturally formed in the aeration tank of an ammonium rich wwtp tianwaitian twt in keelung treating landfill leachate from which three tons activated sludge with active anammox pellets were inoculated into the aeration tank of bl and the deep oxidation ditch of ws in april 2011 table 1 the aeration intensity in the aeration tank of bl and the deep oxidation ditch of ws was kept at relatively low levels table s1 to reduce the inhibition of oxygen to anammox bacteria macroscopic anammox pellets were formed in the aerobic tank of bl after six months subsequently three tons activated sludge from the aeration tank of bl were inoculated into the anaerobic tank of lk in october 2011 table 1 after five years of stable operation activated sludge samples were collected from bl lk and ws on december 25 26 2015 fresh activated sludges were transported to the lab and inoculated into a modified ammonia oxidizing microorganism medium see below for batch cultivation to measure the rates of anammox and denitrification processes to n2 release by 15no3 based isotope pairing fresh activated sludges were transferred into the sealed glass vials immediately during sampling to furthest reduce the negative effect of oxygen on the activity of anammox bacteria activated sludge samples for nucleic acids isolation were collected in three technical replicates at each sampling site samples for dna isolation were stored at 20 c and samples for rna isolation were preserved in rnalater mo bio usa total dna and rna extractions from the same sample were finished within one week the free ammonia concentration was calculated by ammonia calculator http www hbuehrer ch rechner ammonia html 2 2 aerobic ammonium oxidation activity fresh activated sludges were inoculated 20 v v into a modified ammonia oxidizing microorganism aom medium lebedeva et al 2013 with 1 mm nh4cl and incubated at 28 c the ph of the medium was kept around 7 6 by the nahco3 buffering system during cultivation the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were measured every day until ammonium was fully oxidized the concentration of ammonium was measured photometrically hood nowotny et al 2010 kandeler and gerber 1988 nitrate was reduced to nitrite by vanadium chloride and nitrite and nitrate were determined photometrically miranda et al 2001 batch cultivation of fresh activated sludge was done in three technical replicates for each sampling site 2 3 15no3 based anammox and denitrification rates anammox and denitrification rates of these three activated sludges samples were measured by 15no3 based isotope pairing as previous descriptions hou et al 2012 risgaard petersen et al 2004 in brief the fresh activated sludges were transferred into 50 ml helium flushed glass vials activated sludges were pre incubated for 24 h to remove residual nox and oxygen at room temperature 25 c after pre incubation these activated sludges were spiked through the septum with helium purged 15no3 15n at 99 stock solution with a 100 Œºm final concentration of 15n activated sludges were incubated at room temperature for 8 h and the incubation was stopped by injecting 2 ml 50 zncl2 solution the produced 29n2 and 30n2 over the incubation period were measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden finally rates of anammox and denitrification and their contributions to total n2 production were calculated as previous descriptions thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 trimmer et al 2003 anammox and denitrification rates were measured in four technical replicates in each sampling site 2 4 extraction of nucleic acids and pyrosequencing as described above activated sludge samples for nucleic acids extraction were collected in three technical replicates at each sampling site dna and rna were extracted from each replicate to collect sufficient amounts of nucleic acids for deep sequencing the dna or rna respectively extracted from each sample was then pooled activated sludge samples were centrifuged 3214 g 10 min 4 c to remove the supernatant total dna and rna were extracted using the powermax soil dna isolation kit mo bio usa and rna powersoil total rna isolation kit mo bio usa respectively following rna extraction genomic dna was removed from total rna using the turbo dna free kit ambion usa and the remaining rna was concentrated using the rneasy minelute cleanup kit qiagen germany concentrated rna was converted to double strand cdna using the superscript iii first strand synthesis system invitrogen usa with priming via random hexamers for first strand synthesis and the superscript double stranded cdna synthesis kit invitrogen usa for second stranded synthesis total dna and the synthetic double stranded

by blastp against the custom databases with e value 10 10 all blast hits were compared against the ncbi refseq protein database only those that had the highest identity to nitrogen cycle related genes were considered for the custom databases construction amino acid sequences of each nitrogen cycle related gene were downloaded from ncbi and uniprotkb swiss prot all downloaded amino acid sequences

hao like enzymes were evolved from cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfa bergmann et al 2005 that referential nrfa and hao sequences together with hao like sequences identified in the three anammox bacterial mags in this study were used for phylogenetic analysis the comparison of anammox bacterial community between the exogenous anammox pellets from the aerobic tank of twt and the two anammox driven wwtps bl and ws with the formation of macroscopic anammox pellets were analyzed all the anammox bacterial operational taxonomic units otus 97 identity were extracted from the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing datasets of twt bl and ws unpublished results phylogenetic analysis was carried out between these extracted otus and anammox bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences deposited in the

cgi 2 8 data availability raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences can be found on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under bioproject prjna406858 the three anammox bacterial mags bl1 bl10 and ws118 are available in ncbi genbank under the accession numbers phfz00000000 phfy00000000 and phfx00000000 3 results and discussion 3 1 anammox establishment and nitrogen removal performance the concentrations of ammonium nitrate bod and cod in the influent wastewater and effluent wastewater over a one month period before the time of sampling are provided table s1 bl and ws are the ammonium rich wwtps treating landfill leachate lk is the municipal wwtp with a relatively low concentration of ammonium table s1 the unexpectedly high bod and cod in lk was because the supernatant and filtrate from sludge thickening and dewatering were poured into the influent wastewater fig s2 nearly 28 38 and 50 of the consumed ammonium was completely oxidized and discharged in the form of nitrate in bl lk and ws respectively table s1 ammonium was completely removed in lk and ws only 40 5 of the inputted ammonium was removed in bl but it removed the highest amount of total nitrogen 97 mg l table s1 the relative low ammonium removal rate of bl might because of the high ammonium input and relative short hydraulic retention time table s1 that the reactor could not efficiently remove all the influent ammonium according to the records macroscopic anammox granules were not naturally formed in bl lk and ws wwtps notably after the inoculation of extraneous anammox pellets for at least six months macroscopic anammox granules were formed in the aeration tank of bl and the deep oxidation ditch of ws the two ammonium rich wwtps table s1 in total six anammox bacterial otus were detected in the exogenous activated sludge from twt source of anammox pellets meanwhile all six otus were also detected in bl and three of them were detected in ws fig s4 but additional anammox bacterial otus were not found in these two wwtps this reflects the established anammox bacteria in bl and ws likely come from the inoculation of exogenous anammox pellets the rates of anammox and denitrification processes in bl lk and ws were measured by 15no3 isotope pairing fig 1 a anammox was the dominant process for n2 production in bl where denitrification activity could not be detected fig 1a on the contrary denitrification was the major n2 production process in lk and ws meanwhile anammox activity could be detected in ws fig 1a in addition the activity of aerobic ammonium oxidation was identified by cultivation in the optimized aom medium all the three diluted 5 fold activated sludge samples could completely oxidize 1 mm ammonium within three days fig 1b c d reflects nitrifiers in activated sludges were active a significant concentration of nitrite was accumulated in bl nearly 0 6 mm after one day of cultivation fig 1b this may because of the enormous imbalance of the abundances of aob and nob see below 3 2 genome reconstruction shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on the three activated sludge samples collected from bl lk and ws produced a total of 1 48 billion metagenomic reads and 1 06 billion metatranscriptomic reads table s3 liu et al 2019 more than 90 million non rrna metatranscriptomic reads were acquired after removing rrna reads de novo assembly and binning of the metagenomic reads result in a total of 905 mags 196 of them were the near complete mags with completeness larger than 80 and contamination smaller than 10 table s4 most of the acquired mags are bacteria only except for the four mags in lk lk223 and ws ws9 ws208 ws191 which were clustered in phyla euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota fig s5 fig s6 table s5 3 3 abundance and transcript of nitrogen cycle related gene most of the nitrogen cycle related genes table s6 detected in assembled scaffolds were also detected in mags after binning fig s7 so that gene content and transcript analyses of mags can provide enough resolution to obtain comprehensive insights into microbial nitrogen removal ammonium consumption processes including nitrification amo hao and nxr denitrification narg nirk s norb z and nos anammox hzs hao and nxr and ammonium assimilation glna related genes were much high in both abundances and transcript levels fig 2 in contrast ammonium production processes including dinitrogen n2 fixation nifh dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium nrf and urea decomposition ure related genes were in relatively low levels fig 2 ammonia appears to be rapidly oxidized in all the three plants by aerobic ammonia oxidizers according to the high transcript levels of amo and hao genes fig 2 genes of hzs hao and nxr were highly transcribed in bl and ws fig 2 reflects the established anammox bacteria actively participated in nitrogen removal more functional genes were highly transcribed in ws compared to another two plants which reflects more diverse organisms actively contributed to nitrogen transformation and removal fig 2 notably abundances and transcript levels of nitrogen cycle related functional genes in the municipal wwtp lk were much lower than the two ammonium rich wwtps bl and ws fig 2 3 4 nitrogen removal related microorganisms nitrification serves a key function in nitrogen removal by providing nox to denitrification and anammox processes in bl nitrosomonas bl36 and bl56 was the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob with the high transcripts of functional genes amo and hao fig 3 b nitrospira bl254 was the unique nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in bl but the transcripts of all the three subunits of nxr were not detected fig 3b nitrosomonas was also the dominant aob in the anaerobic tank of lk but canonical nob was not detected fig 3b unexpectedly complete ammonia oxidizers comammox nitrospira lk70 265 daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 dominated the nitrifier community in lk although the presence of aob nitrosomonas fig 3b members of comammox nitrospira ws110 ws238 were also detected in ws fig 3b comammox organisms appear to oxidize ammonia actively in these two plants as the transcripts of comammox functional genes were detected in all the four comammox mags fig 3b unexpectedly ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa thaumarchaeota ws9 ws192 ws208 were the dominant nitrifier in the ammonium rich ws with the highest amo transcript fig 3b differ from bl and lk nxr genes of a canonical nob nitrospira ws74 and an unclassified nitrospirae bacterium ws250 were highly transcribed in ws fig 3b so that the oxidized nitrite could be further oxidized to nitrate by nob denitrification is a respiratory process in which nitrate is reduced stepwise to dinitrogen gas no3 no2 no n2o n2 nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nirk s nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos are the key denitrifying enzymes in some denitrifiers the function of membrane bound nar complex could be replaced by periplasmic nitrate reductase nap kraft et al 2011 unlike anammox and nitrification denitrification is carried out by a diverse population organisms that contain at least one denitrifying gene were regarded as denitrifiers in this study the distribution of denitrifying genes in the top 20 abundant near complete genomes in each metagenomic dataset 60 mags in total was summarized fig s8 most of mags contain at least one denitrifying marker gene but only five mags encoded the complete denitrification pathway fig s8 consistently studies on agricultural soils and activated sludge showed that none of the recovered putative denitrifier genomes encoded the complete denitrification pathway orellana et al 2018 speth et al 2016 there is a growing realization on denitrification that complete denitrification by single microorganisms is the exception rather than the rule kuypers et al 2018 anammox bacterial mags were only recovered from bl and ws the two ammonium rich wwtps treating landfill leachate illustrating the strong selection towards wastewater source for anammox establishment a ca brocadia strain bl1 and a ca kuenenia strain bl10 were accumulated in bl and a ca brocadia strain ws118 was detected in ws fig 3b consistent with previous studies kartal et al 2011 van de vossenberg et al 2013 hao and hzs were excessively transcribed by both ca brocadia and ca kuenenia fig 3b ca brocadia is the predominant anammox bacteria in both bl and ws as well as previously studied wwtps lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 yang et al 2018 3 5 complex microbial nitrogen cycling networks a typical pna nitrogen removal procedure was established in bl which is the cost effectively and widely used nitrogen removal system for ammonium rich wastewater treatment lackner et al 2014 in which anammox and partial nitrification nh3 no2 were the two major components fig 3a niche preferences of the two components are quite distinguish that most of aob distribute in the granule surface to acquire oxygen for aerobic ammonia oxidation and the oxygen sensitive anammox bacteria prefer to stay in the anaerobic granule core speth et al 2016 the surface aob provides nitrite and anaerobic environment to anammox bacteria in the granule core by partly oxidizing ammonia to nitrite and sufficiently consuming the dissolved oxygen anammox bacteria could acquire energy for growth and achieve shortcut nitrogen removal by transforming the oxidized nitrite and the remaining ammonium to nitrogen gas benefit from the protection of o2 respiring community anammox bacteria could be alive in aerobic tanks even when do exceeds 2 mg l wang et al 2015 the transcript of nxr gene could not be detected under such high sequencing depth table s3 despite the existence of nob nitrospira fig 3b operation at limiting oxygen concentration in a pna system allowed stable suppression of the activity of nob laureni et al 2016 and larger than 95 nitrite accumulation rate was achieved when do was maintained at 0 4 0 7 mg l in a continuous pilot plant ma et al 2009 the lower oxygen monod half saturation constant of aob than nob blackburne et al 2008 guisasola et al 2005 allowed aob to consume oxygen rapidly by efficiently oxidizing ammonia and reducing the oxygen accessibility for nob nozhevnikova et al 2012 wang and yang 2004 furthermore the high concentration of ammonium in wastewater might directly inhibit the activity of nob the free ammonia in bl was 5 4 mg l table 1 which is larger than the inhibition thresholds of nitrospira sp strain nd1 0 85 mg l and nitrospira japonica strain nj1 4 3 mg l ushiki et al 2017 therefore the activity of nob in bl appears to be inhibited by the low aeration and the high residual ammonium table 1 table s1 as well as some unknown nob inhibitors in the complex wastewater however the activity of nob was rapidly recovered by inoculating the activated sludge into the optimal nitrifier medium fig 1b the presence of nob in bl might be because of the microbial migration from influent wastewater since some microorganisms even become the most abundant groups despite with low activities in activated sludge owing to the high migration from influent wastewater saunders et al 2016 therefore nitrite could not be oxidized to nitrate by nob under such operation conditions table 1 table s1 but nitrate was accumulated in the effluent wastewater table s1 which might be the byproduct of co2 fixation of anammox bacteria by oxidizing nitrite to nitrate to generate reducing equivalents jetten et al 2009 lotti et al 2014 strous et al 2006 since nxr gene was highly transcribed by anammox bacteria bl1 and bl10 fig 3b according to the mean oxidized ammonium in bl table s1 around 35 1 and 21 7 mg l nitrate could be generated by anammox bacteria based on the original strous et al 1998 and the revised lotti et al 2014 anammox stoichiometries respectively the low transcripts of functional genes of denitrification fig 3 and the undetectable denitrification activity in the isotope pairing experiment fig 1a reflect denitrifying activity is very weak in bl because of this only a tiny amount of organic pollutions was consumed table s1 around 40 5 135 mg l of the incoming ammonium from influent wastewater were consumed by the established pna system table s1 less than 30 of the consumed ammonium was oxidized to nitrate and more than 70 of them likely be released in the form of n2 through anammox process table s1 in ws wwtp nitrification denitrification nitrogen removal procedure was established in which nitrifiers and denitrifiers were the dominant players while active anammox bacteria was also detected fig 3a aerobic nitrifiers mainly distribute in the outer part of the granule and oxygen sensitive anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers usually hide in the granule core chen et al 2009 the high active nitrifiers could effectively oxidize ammonia and provide nox and anaerobic microenvironment to anammox bacteria and denitrifiers in the granule core different from bl nxr genes of nob and comammox organisms were highly transcribed fig 3 so that the oxidized nitrite could be rapidly oxidized to nitrate in ws the relative abundance of anammox bacteria in ws was much lower compared to the predominance of anammox bacteria in bl this appears to be because of the relatively low ammonium input high biodegradable organic compounds table 1 table s1 and the fierce substrate competition from aoa aob comammox nob and denitrifiers fig 3 while the high active heterotrophic denitrifiers in ws fig 3 might retard the inhibition of organic carbon on anammox anjali and sabumon 2014 waki et al 2007 unexpectedly aoa thaumarchaeota ws9 ws192 ws208 dominated the nitrifying community in ws in the presence of aob nitrosomonas fig 3b aoa was reported mainly found in low dissolved oxygen levels and long solid retention times wwtps park et al 2006 yet how did aoa accumulate in ws remains unclear nearly 95 112 mg l of the incoming ammonium was consumed in ws table s1 half of the consumed ammonium was completely oxidized and discharged into effluent wastewater in the form of nitrate another half appeared to be removed through anammox and denitrification processes table s1 according to the isotopic tracing fig 1a denitrification process likely carried out more n2 release in ws compared to anammox reasonably because of the high denitrification activity figs 1a and 3 the highest rate of organic matters was consumed in ws table s1 anammox bacteria was not detected in lk fig 3 under such high metagenomic sequencing depth table s3 consistently n2 release by anammox process was not detected in the isotope pairing experiment fig 1a instead nitrification denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal process fig 3 unexpectedly comammox nitrospira lk70 lk265 was the most abundant nitrifier in this anaerobic reactor with a relative low concentration of ammonium and an extremely high concentration of organic carbon fig 3b the extremely low dissolved oxygen in the anaerobic tank table 1 table s1 likely restrict the activity of aob nitrosomonas but the anaerobic condition may favor the growth of comammox organisms because it was reported a high degree of comammox nitrospira enrichment was acquired in low dissolved oxygen bioreactor inoculated with activated sludge camejo et al 2017 around 98 4 62 mg l of the incoming ammonium was oxidized and removed in lk table s1 nearly 38 of the removed ammonium was discharged into effluent wastewater in the form of nitrate in the absence of nob table s1 illustrating ammonia and nitrite oxidation activity of comammox organisms is considerable in the full scale municipal wwtp a heterotrophic chlorobi affiliated bacterium was proposed as the biggest contributor to the degradation of protein and peptides produced by anammox bacteria while recycling nitrate to nitrite to feed anammox bacteria in the anammox community lawson et al 2017 chlorobi affiliated nitrate reducers were also found in bl bl7 bl45 bl118 and ws ws140 fig s5 the two systems with shortcut nitrogen removal by anammox transcripts of nitrate reductase genes in bl7 bl45 and ws140 were also detected indicating they might be the active cooperators of anammox bacteria by partially reducing nitrate and forming nitrite loop with the nitrite oxidation process of anammox bacteria 3 6 description of the nitrite reductase and hao like proteins of anammox bacteria three anammox bacterial mags bl1 bl10 and ws118 were recovered from bl and ws fig 3 which were tentatively named as ca brocadia sp bl1 ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis genome bl10 and ca brocadia sp ws118 in ca kuenenia and ca scalindua nirs is the enzyme catalyzing no2 reduction to no the precursor of n2h4 synthesis kartal et al 2011 van de vossenberg et al 2013 the function of nirs is replaced by nirk in ca jettenia hira et al 2012 hu et al 2012 while both nirs and nirk were not found in ca brocadia lawson et al 2017 oshiki et al 2016 speth et al 2016 consistently no forming nitrite reductase nirs or nirk was not found in bl1 but a nirs was found in ws118 with a very weak transcript fig 4 to the best of our knowledge this is the first discovery of nirs gene in ca brocadia nh2oh rather than no was identified as the precursor of n2h4 synthesis of ca brocadia sinica but the nh2oh generation nitrite reductase is still unknown oshiki et al 2016 the multiple hao like proteins were proposed as the candidate enzymes catalyzing no2 reduction to nh2oh in ca brocadia kartal et al 2013 oshiki et al 2016 a nh4 forming cytochrome c nitrite reductase gene cluster nrf was only found in the two ca brocadia mags bl1 and ws110 fig 4 almost all the recovered subunits of nrf were transcribed fig 4b but the function of nrf enzyme in anammox metabolism is still unclear in the absence of ammonium the way of nitrite reducing to ammonium was regarded as a missing piece in the anammox puzzle kartal and keltjens 2016 nitrite may serve as the electron acceptor for organic compounds oxidation meanwhile generating ammonium by nrf enzyme kartal et al 2013 another possibility is the encoded nrf and nirk s in ca brocadia work for detoxification in cell physiology by eliminating the accumulated harmful intermediates including no2 and nh2oh this function likely contributes to the tolerance of ca brocadia to a relatively high nitrite concentration langone et al 2014 lotti et al 2012 at least six hao like protein coding genes were recovered from each anammox bacterial mag and most of them were transcribed fig s9 suggesting hao like proteins play important roles in anammox metabolisms hao like proteins are evolved from nrf bergmann et al 2005 but have quite different phylogenies fig s9 which have been proposed as the candidate enzymes catalyzing no2 reduction to nh2oh in ca brocadia kartal et al 2013 oshiki et al 2016 hao like protein kustc1061 from ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was identified can catalyze the oxidation of n2h4 to n2 as well as nh2oh to no kartal et al 2011 the highly transcribed hao like protein cv082 14220 cv080 03825 and cv087 09870 identified in the three mags were clustered into the same group with kustc1061 in the phylogenetic tree fig s9 illustrating the high nh2oh and n2h4 oxidizing activities in anammox metabolisms 4 conclusions and implications our results present the first system wide microbial nitrogen cycling networks in conventional wwtps after anammox inoculation by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics modern pna procedure with shortcut nitrogen removal by anammox was established in the ammonium rich wwtp of bl and a tiny amount of active anammox bacteria was also established in ws using exogenous anammox pellets as seeds for inoculation the activities of anammox in the two wwtps were confirmed by the combined metatranscriptome and nitrogen 15 based isotope pairing the establishment of active anammox bacteria identifies the feasibility to establish anammox and achieve shortcut nitrogen removal in ammonium rich systems by direct inoculation of the existing anammox pellets unexpectedly the newly identified comammox nitrospira dominated the nitrifying community in the anaerobic tank of the municipal wwtp which is characterized by a plethora of organic matters furthermore aoa thaumarchaeota predominated the nitrifier communities in the deep oxidation ditch of an ammonium rich wwtp the metabolic versatilities adaptive mechanisms and application potential in optimizing nitrogen removal in current and new bioreactor of these comammox and aoa organisms are of great interests to be investigated in further studies furthermore the symbiotic relationships between autotrophic nitrogen removal microorganisms and the dominant heterotrophic microorganisms deserve more attention the roles of variables in shaping nitrogen transforming microbial networks such as the niche preference alternative substrates cellular energy requirements and sensitive to physicochemical factors is a subject of great interest to provide the valuable reference for the establishment and

18386,glyphosate is the most widely used pesticide for weed control in agriculture and in urban and residential areas this is the first study to quantify glyphosate and ampa levels in surface water in australia from different land uses glyphosate and ampa was measured in surface water from 10 rural streams 30 urban stormwater wetlands and 9 urban streams located in and around the city of melbourne australia on five occasions between october 2017 and february 2018 glyphosate and ampa were present in most of the urban surface water samples the frequency of detection of glyphosate was 77 in wetlands and 79 in urban streams whereas it was only detected in 4 of the rural streams similarly ampa detection was 91 in wetlands and 97 in urban streams whereas it was only present in 6 of the rural stream samples in both urban streams and wetlands the highest average glyphosate concentrations occurred in november 1 8 2 2 Œºg l 1 overall wetlands and streams associated with urban land use are vulnerable to glyphosate contamination these results highlight the importance of screening for contaminants in urban stormwater to identify the source of pollutants that may end up in aquatic ecosystems and the risks therefrom graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate wetlands stormwater streams urban land use 1 introduction the study of glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine occurrence in the environment is of major relevance due to its widespread use and its potential negative impacts on ecosystems glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide in agricultural areas throughout the world for the removal of unwanted weeds benbrook 2016 it is also applied to eliminate competing weeds in the growing stage of genetically modified glyphosate resistant crops such as soybean cotton and maize furthermore glyphosate is widely used on non agricultural land to control noxious weeds invasive woody species and in urban areas for weed control on pavements sidewalks garage driveways residential lawns and golf courses skark et al 2004 it is estimated that by the year 2014 more than 800 million kg of glyphosate had been used globally of which 90 was for agricultural use and 10 for non agricultural purposes benbrook 2016 fig 1 making glyphosate the most used pesticide worldwide in this context glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide in australia and in the state of victoria where there are more than 500 glyphosate based products registered for use apvma 2018 however there are no available data on the amounts of glyphosate based herbicides that are sold or applied in the region glyphosate is a systemic post emergence broad spectrum foliar herbicide it is targeted to the plant leaves but the foliar spray may reach the soil beneath by endo drift processes okada et al 2018 glyphosate is found in its anionic form pka 2 2 6 5 8 and 10 8 sprankle et al 1975 within the ph range of most soils ph 4 8 the negatively charged glyphosate molecule sorbs strongly to the soil matrix because it has a high affinity to cations exchanged from the clay fraction and to fe and al oxides morillo et al 2000 borggaard and gimsing 2008 the strong sorption to the soil matrix reduces glyphosate bioavailability and increases its persistence in soil okada et al 2017 glyphosate is degraded by the microbiota into aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa or sarcosine borggaard and gimsing 2008 ampa is the most commonly studied metabolite because it is highly persistent in the environment simonsen et al 2008 whereas sarcosine is easily degradable and does not accumulate in soil the detection of glyphosate and ampa in surface water is usually concomitant battaglin et al 2014 van stempvoort et al 2016 however ampa is also a degradation product of household and industrial phosphonate detergents and therefore it can also be found in wastewater treatment plant outlets grandcoin et al 2017 glyphosate and ampa share similar physico chemical characteristics they are polar compounds highly water soluble and non volatile both molecules are zwitterions and are found negatively charged at ph 6 glyphosate and ampa may be transported off site by exo drift processes such as spray drift during application and via particle bound residues that are wind eroded or by surface runoff yang et al 2015 bento et al 2017 as a consequence these compounds may end up far from zones of application in aquatic ecosystems and can be found in the water column battaglin et al 2014 p√©rez et al 2017a okada et al 2018 streambed sediments okada et al 2018 tush et al 2018 and aquatic plants p√©rez et al 2017b melbourne is the largest city in the state of victoria australia the metropolitan area of this sprawling city is home to 5 million people mostly housed in low density suburbs that stretch over 40 km west to east and between around 25 to 45 km north to south as the city extends along the northern and eastern shorelines of port philip bay several studies have investigated the presence of pesticides in streams and rivers of the yarra river catchment an important source of drinking water for melbourne with simazine the most commonly observed agrochemical e g sch√§fer et al 2011 wightwick et al 2012 allinson et al 2014 screening has also been undertaken for herbicides in constructed stormwater wetlands in some of melbourne s urban areas e g see allinson et al 2015 allinson et al 2017 in the latter study allinson et al 2017 also found simazine was the most frequently detected herbicide 100 detection followed by 2 4 diphenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d 93 and 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxy acetic acid mcpa 83 rippy et al 2017 also found that the most detected pesticides in australian stormwater were herbicides i e diuron mcpa 2 4 d simazine and triclopyr however none of the above mentioned studies included the analytical screening of glyphosate or its metabolite ampa therefore in this work we present for the first time data on non target environmental concentrations and seasonal variations of glyphosate and ampa in aquatic environments from australia the objectives of the study were to 1 compare glyphosate and ampa occurrence in waterbodies subject to different land uses 2 study the temporal variation of glyphosate and ampa levels in constructed stormwater wetlands and streams within urban and rural land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection this study was conducted in the urban area of greater melbourne and the rural area of the upper yarra river valley to melbourne s northeast fig 2 a five major catchments that discharge into port phillip bay were sampled moorabool river werribee river maribyrnong river yarra river and bunyip river catchments fig 2b table a1 surface water sampling sites were grouped according to source wetland or stream and main type of land use rural or urban fig 2c the spatial information to characterize the sample sites limits of the catchments streams and land use data were obtained from victoria state government web site state government of victoria 2019 and the riparian vegetation width was estimated using google earth images water samples were taken during dry periods daily rainfall 10 mm 7 days prior to time of sampling except for the samples taken in december which were taken after a heavy rainfall 60 mm see appendix a although stream flow was not measured at each site samples were taken at base flow during october november january and february during the december sampling time most of the streams had bank over flow or evidence that the bank had overflowed as a consequence of the heavy rainstorm 2 1 1 rural streams rural streams correspond to ten sites from several streams from the upper and middle yarra catchment fig 2c appendix b land use in this watershed varies from protected forests and rural areas in the upper and middle yarra valley to peri urban development fig 2c the waterways located in the upper yarra system provide around 70 of melbourne s drinking water melbourne water 2017a the middle yarra valley has many small scale rural activities although it is mainly used for horticulture i e grapevine fruit and vegetable production and grasslands for beef and dairy cattle all the sites sampled for the rural streams were located within agricultural land except for site s14 located in a protected forest area at the maroondah reservoir park see appendix b fig b1 this site was used as a reference site since we expected to find no glyphosate or ampa residues at this site 2 1 2 urban streams nine sites located within urban and industrial land uses were sampled as urban streams fig 2c appendix b these sites were in the werribee maribyrnong lower yarra and bunyip catchments which flow through the city s sub urban and urban areas into port phillip bay the vast majority of melbourne s suburban households are connected to a reticulated sewerage system with stormwater directed into a separated system that directs the water into local streams and rivers consequently surface water in this area receives large amounts of urban run off which reduces the water quality and changes the water flow rates in general the metropolitan area of the catchment has poor quality vegetation due to urbanization and industrial impact in residential areas the waterway channels are significantly altered by urbanization i e straightening channeling and concrete lining which reduces the amount of riparian vegetation the sampling sites of the urban streams were located within sub catchments that receive mostly runoff water from urban areas see appendix b fig b1 although influence from upstream cannot be disregarded since the water samples were taken from the stream and not exclusively from run off water 2 1 3 stormwater wetlands thirty stormwater treatment wetlands in urban and peri urban developments located in the moorabol werribee maribyrnong lower yarra and bunyip catchments were sampled fig 2c appendix b new residential developments incorporate stormwater wetland systems built to deliver effective stormwater flow management and pollutant reduction as well as a secondary community amenity and habitat outcomes melbourne water 2017b some are also built to provide a source for irrigation water for nearby parks and sports fields these constructed wetlands help retard the water flow of around 540 gl year of stormwater that enters natural drainage systems allinson et al 2017 stormwater wetlands are diverse in size and design they are built site specifically to capture and treat the run off generated by impervious or hard surfaces and to reduce nutrient sediment loading of natural waterways in this sense wetlands are buffer zones that can intercept and partly retain run off related pesticides imfeld et al 2013 the selected sampled wetlands were located within sub catchments that receive mostly runoff water from urban areas see appendix b fig b1 2 2 sampling samples were collected monthly from october 2017 to february 2018 using 500 ml polypropylene bottles rinsed three times with the sampled water the temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do

commercial elisa kit for glyphosate to compare the results obtained by the lc ms ms method appendix d fig d1 2 4 data analysis glyphosate and ampa results from the lc msms analysis were compared among source rural stream urban stream or wetland and month of sampling november december january february using a linear mixed model proc mixed data from the october samples was not used in the statistical analysis because no urban streams were sampled in that month mean comparisons were evaluated with a significance level of 0 0001 using lsmeans 3 results and discussion 3 1 glyphosate and ampa occurrence glyphosate and ampa were present in the majority of the urban samples from wetlands and streams but rarely in stream samples taken from rural areas fig 3 in samples from rural streams glyphosate and ampa frequency of detection fod was 4 and 10 2 respectively fig 3 glyphosate concentrations were 0 3 Œºg l 1 and ampa levels were 0 8 Œºg l 1 on the other hand streams and wetlands situated within urban land use had a much higher fod of both glyphosate and ampa compared to that of the rural landuse water samples glyphosate was present in 79 of the urban stream samples mean 1 1 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 4 8 Œºg l 1 and in 77 of the stormwater wetland samples mean 1 1 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 14 2 Œºg l 1 ampa was detected in 91 of urban streams mean 1 6 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 4 3 Œºg l 1 and 97 of the sampled wetlands mean 1 3 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 10 Œºg l 1 for more details on the spatial and temporal variations of glyphosate and ampa levels see fig e1 appendix e the streams in the upper forested mountainous area of the yarra river catchment feed water storages that are used for drinking water the sample taken at site s14 is located upstream of the agricultural area in the maroondah reservoir park a protected water supply catchment this sample had no detectable levels of glyphosate or ampa throughout the studied period the yarra river then flows through the yarra valley characterized by horticultural and viticulture production and livestock previous studies have shown that the application of glyphosate in agricultural soils can cause the non point source pollution of groundwater surface water and sediments okada et al 2018 however in this study the detection of glyphosate and ampa in the rural streams was low despite glyphosate being widely used throughout the growing season of intensive cultures such as vine and fruit orchards preston 2018 in this case glyphosate dispersion into aquatic environments may have been attenuated by the soil capacity to strongly sorb both glyphosate and ampa okada et al 2016 sidoli et al 2016 also the presence of riparian vegetation syversen and bechmann 2004 reduces the probability of glyphosate reaching surface waters for instance several studies have found that riparian vegetation of 5 m or more have a pesticide retention efficiency higher than 40 reichenberger et al 2007 in our study the average riparian vegetation width at the rural stream sites was 15 m except for two sampling points where the width was 400 m so pesticide surface runoff may have been strongly attenuated other factors that may have reduced the occurrence of glyphosate and ampa in rural streams are i correct glyphosate management practices ii organic farming iii no applications near time of sampling since the sampling scheme did not cover the paddock preparation period prior to sowing april to early june the highest glyphosate levels were detected in wetland samples with concentrations as high as 11 5 and 14 2 Œºg l 1 the highest ampa concentrations were also detected in wetland samples with values of 6 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 the average concentrations in urban streams and wetlands are consistent with previous reports on glyphosate and ampa levels in urban catchments from other countries table 1 although non agricultural use represents less than 10 of the total glyphosate usage urban contributions of glyphosate into surface waters should not be underrated the application of glyphosate for weed control in residential industrial areas can be a source of contamination of surface waters skark et al 2004 in this sense a significant amount of glyphosate and ampa is washed away in urban stormwater botta et al 2009 tang et al 2015 mauffrey et al 2017 and then accumulated in the wetlands built to retain excess runoff in addition sub urban environments increase the area of impermeable surfaces such as asphalt and concrete compared to pre development conditions while at the same time reducing the extent of vegetation hence evapotranspiration and infiltration are reduced while stormwater run off increases allinson et al 2017 also glyphosate loss from hard surfaces is higher than from agricultural fields because glyphosate sorption to soil is stronger than to concrete or asphalt ramwell et al 2014 however more than 75 of glyphosate can be lost in run off from asphalt spanoghe et al 2005 because asphalt paving material is composed of a mixture of asphalt cement sand and crushed rock with limited clay or mineral content thus with fewer sites for glyphosate sorption 3 2 seasonal variations rural streams only had detectable levels of glyphosate in early summer december although trace levels of ampa were detected in november december and february fig 4 in urban streams and wetlands the highest glyphosate concentrations were detected in early spring november and then concentrations decreased in mid summer february fig 4 average glyphosate concentrations in urban wetlands and urban streams were broadly correlated except in january where glyphosate concentrations in wetlands were observed at similar values as in november whereas concentrations in urban streams remained almost constant overall the fod of glyphosate was similar in urban streams and wetlands being higher than 80 in november december and january and decreasing to less than 60 in february fig 4 in a similar manner to glyphosate ampa was detected at very low concentrations in rural streams throughout the sampled months on the other hand ampa fod in urban wetlands and urban streams from october to february was between 80 and 100 fig 4 in the case of wetlands the highest concentrations were detected in november whereas in urban streams ampa levels tended to be higher in january fig 4 no significant differences were found in glyphosate concentrations between urban streams and wetlands using the mixed linear model and there was no interaction between source of sample and month p 0 05 data not shown when glyphosate data is analysed altogether there is a significant seasonal variation in which glyphosate has its highest value at the beginning of spring november p 0 05 fig 5 in the case of ampa there were no significant differences between urban streams and wetlands data not shown or between time of sampling p 0 05 fig 5 it is important to note that samples were taken during base flow except for the samples taken in december which were taken after a heavy rainfall see appendix a fig a1 in december most of the streams had bankfull flow bank over flow or evidence that the bank had overflowed as a consequence of the heavy rainstorm however we did not find a clear association between levels of glyphosate and ampa and precipitation events in average the highest glyphosate concentrations were detected in november springtime which may result from recent herbicide applications due to spring weed control in amenity areas pavements and gardens we observed that the urban councils performed herbicide sprayings during spring and summer in parks and near creeks and riverbanks during our sampling trips this type of weed management is relevant in the studied area since there are 87 species of declared invasive plants in the state of victoria which are considered noxious weeds calp act 1994 of which each council has the responsibility to control and manage from december to february glyphosate concentration decreased reaching its lowest values towards the end of the study fig 5 ampa levels tended to be higher than glyphosate concentrations and remained steady throughout the sampled period fig 5 this can be a result of several factors first there are fewer weed controls at the end of the dry victorian summer secondly during the warmer months glyphosate concentration decreases because biological degradation is favoured at higher environmental temperatures bento et al 2016 at the same time the ampa that is produced as a degradation product is more persistent than glyphosate wang et al 2016 la cecilia et al 2018 sun et al 2019 third glyphosate may also be removed from the water column because it is strongly sorbed to sediments coupe et al 2012 and can also undergo fast chemical degradation paudel et al 2015 la cecilia and maggi 2018 lastly household and industrial detergents such as diamine tetramethylene phosphonate edtmp or diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp also degrade into ampa nowack 2003 in this study the detection of ampa in urban streams cannot be attributed to the discharge of wastewater treatment plant effluents since in melbourne sewerage system and stormwater are separated except on rare occasions however it is possible that phosphonate detergents end up in the stormwater from general household use e g washing down of patios decks cars in driveways etc 3 3 risks urban wetlands not only act as water retention and depuration areas but also offer an appealing environment for diverse biota such as endemic birds frogs and fish these constructed aquatic ecosystems are mainly quiescent water bodies that only have a major water input during storm events they are therefore a sink for any chemicals that may be washed away from houses or industrial developments allinson et al 2015 and can be affected by the accumulation of pollutants such as glyphosate there are guidelines for the construction of these stormwater wetlands in victoria melbourne water 2017a b but not for chemicals in entrained stormwater other than for total nitrogen and phosphorus the water in and or extracted from stormwater retention ponds and wetlands may pose a real or perceived risk to soil and aquatic organisms from chemicals contained therein in this context the concentrations of glyphosate detected in this study were well below the strictest level of protection for freshwater species 99 in pristine ecosystems 370 Œºg l 1 established by the australian and new zealand guidelines for fresh and marine water quality anzecc and armcanz 2000 the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality guidelines has set a value of 800 Œºg l 1 as the benchmark for protection of aquatic life from glyphosate canadian council of ministers of the environment 2012 in the usa the chronic aquatic life benchmarks for glyphosate are 25 700 and 49 900 Œºg l 1 for fish and for aquatic invertebrates respectively epa 2016 in the eu there are no defined environmental quality standards for glyphosate or ampa in surface water sz√©k√°cs and darvas 2018 however the eu has a very strict maximum allowed level of glyphosate in drinking water of 0 1 Œºg l 1 european parliament and council 1998 currently there is no agreement among countries regulation agencies on the human health based limits for glyphosate in drinking water for example in australia the guideline value for glyphosate in drinking water is 1000 Œºg l 1 hmrc and nrmmc 2011 while in the usa the limit is 700 Œºg l 1 us epa 2002 and in canada the maximum allowed concentration is 280 Œºg l 1 guidelines for canadian drinking water quality 2014 although the sampled wetlands and streams are not used as a source of drinking water none of the samples exceeded the guideline value established by the australian drinking water guidelines hmrc and nrmmc 2011 although glyphosate in surface water can disturb aquatic communities the concentrations detected in this study do not suggest an environmental risk from this chemical alone for example glyphosate concentrations of 360 Œºg l 1 are required to increase infection of the freshwater fish galaxias anomalus by a flatworm parasite kelly et al 2010 even higher chronic exposure levels of glyphosate 3600 Œºg l 1 are needed to cause deleterious effects in the reproductive cycle of silver catfish rhamdia quelen soso et al 2007 constructed stormwater wetlands are habitat for many types of frog in victoria however the risks to these organisms also appears low since glyphosate concentrations as high as 300 000 Œºg l 1 do not cause histopathologic lesions in the liver of tadpoles of the frog leptodactylus latrans bach et al 2018 in the case of re using stormwater as a source of irrigation the concentrations that we have detected in this study likely do not pose a risk to crops comes and kelley 1979 however other pesticides may be present in aquatic environments and can have an additive synergistic or antagonist effect as described earlier in allinson et al 2017 melbourne s stormwater wetlands contain many other herbicides such as simazine mcpa diuron atrazine and 2 4 d some of these compounds increase their toxicity when in the presence of glyphosate for example diuron and glyphosate have been shown to have a potential synergic sublethal effect in tropical fish rossi et al 2011 another commonly detected herbicide in melbourne s urban waters 2 4 d also has a synergistic effect on fish mortality when combined with glyphosate ruiz de arcaute et al 2018 consequently the risk to aquatic ecosystems from

18386,glyphosate is the most widely used pesticide for weed control in agriculture and in urban and residential areas this is the first study to quantify glyphosate and ampa levels in surface water in australia from different land uses glyphosate and ampa was measured in surface water from 10 rural streams 30 urban stormwater wetlands and 9 urban streams located in and around the city of melbourne australia on five occasions between october 2017 and february 2018 glyphosate and ampa were present in most of the urban surface water samples the frequency of detection of glyphosate was 77 in wetlands and 79 in urban streams whereas it was only detected in 4 of the rural streams similarly ampa detection was 91 in wetlands and 97 in urban streams whereas it was only present in 6 of the rural stream samples in both urban streams and wetlands the highest average glyphosate concentrations occurred in november 1 8 2 2 Œºg l 1 overall wetlands and streams associated with urban land use are vulnerable to glyphosate contamination these results highlight the importance of screening for contaminants in urban stormwater to identify the source of pollutants that may end up in aquatic ecosystems and the risks therefrom graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate wetlands stormwater streams urban land use 1 introduction the study of glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine occurrence in the environment is of major relevance due to its widespread use and its potential negative impacts on ecosystems glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide in agricultural areas throughout the world for the removal of unwanted weeds benbrook 2016 it is also applied to eliminate competing weeds in the growing stage of genetically modified glyphosate resistant crops such as soybean cotton and maize furthermore glyphosate is widely used on non agricultural land to control noxious weeds invasive woody species and in urban areas for weed control on pavements sidewalks garage driveways residential lawns and golf courses skark et al 2004 it is estimated that by the year 2014 more than 800 million kg of glyphosate had been used globally of which 90 was for agricultural use and 10 for non agricultural purposes benbrook 2016 fig 1 making glyphosate the most used pesticide worldwide in this context glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide in australia and in the state of victoria where there are more than 500 glyphosate based products registered for use apvma 2018 however there are no available data on the amounts of glyphosate based herbicides that are sold or applied in the region glyphosate is a systemic post emergence broad spectrum foliar herbicide it is targeted to the plant leaves but the foliar spray may reach the soil beneath by endo drift processes okada et al 2018 glyphosate is found in its anionic form pka 2 2 6 5 8 and 10 8 sprankle et al 1975 within the ph range of most soils ph 4 8 the negatively charged glyphosate molecule sorbs strongly to the soil matrix because it has a high affinity to cations exchanged from the clay fraction and to fe and al oxides morillo et al 2000 borggaard and gimsing 2008 the strong sorption to the soil matrix reduces glyphosate bioavailability and increases its persistence in soil okada et al 2017 glyphosate is degraded by the microbiota into aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa or sarcosine borggaard and gimsing 2008 ampa is the most commonly studied metabolite because it is highly persistent in the environment simonsen et al 2008 whereas sarcosine is easily degradable and does not accumulate in soil the detection of glyphosate and ampa in surface water is usually concomitant battaglin et al 2014 van stempvoort et al 2016 however ampa is also a degradation product of household and industrial phosphonate detergents and therefore it can also be found in wastewater treatment plant outlets grandcoin et al 2017 glyphosate and ampa share similar physico chemical characteristics they are polar compounds highly water soluble and non volatile both molecules are zwitterions and are found negatively charged at ph 6 glyphosate and ampa may be transported off site by exo drift processes such as spray drift during application and via particle bound residues that are wind eroded or by surface runoff yang et al 2015 bento et al 2017 as a consequence these compounds may end up far from zones of application in aquatic ecosystems and can be found in the water column battaglin et al 2014 p√©rez et al 2017a okada et al 2018 streambed sediments okada et al 2018 tush et al 2018 and aquatic plants p√©rez et al 2017b melbourne is the largest city in the state of victoria australia the metropolitan area of this sprawling city is home to 5 million people mostly housed in low density suburbs that stretch over 40 km west to east and between around 25 to 45 km north to south as the city extends along the northern and eastern shorelines of port philip bay several studies have investigated the presence of pesticides in streams and rivers of the yarra river catchment an important source of drinking water for melbourne with simazine the most commonly observed agrochemical e g sch√§fer et al 2011 wightwick et al 2012 allinson et al 2014 screening has also been undertaken for herbicides in constructed stormwater wetlands in some of melbourne s urban areas e g see allinson et al 2015 allinson et al 2017 in the latter study allinson et al 2017 also found simazine was the most frequently detected herbicide 100 detection followed by 2 4 diphenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d 93 and 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxy acetic acid mcpa 83 rippy et al 2017 also found that the most detected pesticides in australian stormwater were herbicides i e diuron mcpa 2 4 d simazine and triclopyr however none of the above mentioned studies included the analytical screening of glyphosate or its metabolite ampa therefore in this work we present for the first time data on non target environmental concentrations and seasonal variations of glyphosate and ampa in aquatic environments from australia the objectives of the study were to 1 compare glyphosate and ampa occurrence in waterbodies subject to different land uses 2 study the temporal variation of glyphosate and ampa levels in constructed stormwater wetlands and streams within urban and rural land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection this study was conducted in the urban area of greater melbourne and the rural area of the upper yarra river valley to melbourne s northeast fig 2 a five major catchments that discharge into port phillip bay were sampled moorabool river werribee river maribyrnong river yarra river and bunyip river catchments fig 2b table a1 surface water sampling sites were grouped according to source wetland or stream and main type of land use rural or urban fig 2c the spatial information to characterize the sample sites limits of the catchments streams and land use data were obtained from victoria state government web site state government of victoria 2019 and the riparian vegetation width was estimated using google earth images water samples were taken during dry periods daily rainfall 10 mm 7 days prior to time of sampling except for the samples taken in december which were taken after a heavy rainfall 60 mm see appendix a although stream flow was not measured at each site samples were taken at base flow during october november january and february during the december sampling time most of the streams had bank over flow or evidence that the bank had overflowed as a consequence of the heavy rainstorm 2 1 1 rural streams rural streams correspond to ten sites from several streams from the upper and middle yarra catchment fig 2c appendix b land use in this watershed varies from protected forests and rural areas in the upper and middle yarra valley to peri urban development fig 2c the waterways located in the upper yarra system provide around 70 of melbourne s drinking water melbourne water 2017a the middle yarra valley has many small scale rural activities although it is mainly used for horticulture i e grapevine fruit and vegetable production and grasslands for beef and dairy cattle all the sites sampled for the rural streams were located within agricultural land except for site s14 located in a protected forest area at the maroondah reservoir park see appendix b fig b1 this site was used as a reference site since we expected to find no glyphosate or ampa residues at this site 2 1 2 urban streams nine sites located within urban and industrial land uses were sampled as urban streams fig 2c appendix b these sites were in the werribee maribyrnong lower yarra and bunyip catchments which flow through the city s sub urban and urban areas into port phillip bay the vast majority of melbourne s suburban households are connected to a reticulated sewerage system with stormwater directed into a separated system that directs the water into local streams and rivers consequently surface water in this area receives large amounts of urban run off which reduces the water quality and changes the water flow rates in general the metropolitan area of the catchment has poor quality vegetation due to urbanization and industrial impact in residential areas the waterway channels are significantly altered by urbanization i e straightening channeling and concrete lining which reduces the amount of riparian vegetation the sampling sites of the urban streams were located within sub catchments that receive mostly runoff water from urban areas see appendix b fig b1 although influence from upstream cannot be disregarded since the water samples were taken from the stream and not exclusively from run off water 2 1 3 stormwater wetlands thirty stormwater treatment wetlands in urban and peri urban developments located in the moorabol werribee maribyrnong lower yarra and bunyip catchments were sampled fig 2c appendix b new residential developments incorporate stormwater wetland systems built to deliver effective stormwater flow management and pollutant reduction as well as a secondary community amenity and habitat outcomes melbourne water 2017b some are also built to provide a source for irrigation water for nearby parks and sports fields these constructed wetlands help retard the water flow of around 540 gl year of stormwater that enters natural drainage systems allinson et al 2017 stormwater wetlands are diverse in size and design they are built site specifically to capture and treat the run off generated by impervious or hard surfaces and to reduce nutrient sediment loading of natural waterways in this sense wetlands are buffer zones that can intercept and partly retain run off related pesticides imfeld et al 2013 the selected sampled wetlands were located within sub catchments that receive mostly runoff water from urban areas see appendix b fig b1 2 2 sampling samples were collected monthly from october 2017 to february 2018 using 500 ml polypropylene bottles rinsed three times with the sampled water the temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do

commercial elisa kit for glyphosate to compare the results obtained by the lc ms ms method appendix d fig d1 2 4 data analysis glyphosate and ampa results from the lc msms analysis were compared among source rural stream urban stream or wetland and month of sampling november december january february using a linear mixed model proc mixed data from the october samples was not used in the statistical analysis because no urban streams were sampled in that month mean comparisons were evaluated with a significance level of 0 0001 using lsmeans 3 results and discussion 3 1 glyphosate and ampa occurrence glyphosate and ampa were present in the majority of the urban samples from wetlands and streams but rarely in stream samples taken from rural areas fig 3 in samples from rural streams glyphosate and ampa frequency of detection fod was 4 and 10 2 respectively fig 3 glyphosate concentrations were 0 3 Œºg l 1 and ampa levels were 0 8 Œºg l 1 on the other hand streams and wetlands situated within urban land use had a much higher fod of both glyphosate and ampa compared to that of the rural landuse water samples glyphosate was present in 79 of the urban stream samples mean 1 1 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 4 8 Œºg l 1 and in 77 of the stormwater wetland samples mean 1 1 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 14 2 Œºg l 1 ampa was detected in 91 of urban streams mean 1 6 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 4 3 Œºg l 1 and 97 of the sampled wetlands mean 1 3 Œºg l 1 range 0 25 10 Œºg l 1 for more details on the spatial and temporal variations of glyphosate and ampa levels see fig e1 appendix e the streams in the upper forested mountainous area of the yarra river catchment feed water storages that are used for drinking water the sample taken at site s14 is located upstream of the agricultural area in the maroondah reservoir park a protected water supply catchment this sample had no detectable levels of glyphosate or ampa throughout the studied period the yarra river then flows through the yarra valley characterized by horticultural and viticulture production and livestock previous studies have shown that the application of glyphosate in agricultural soils can cause the non point source pollution of groundwater surface water and sediments okada et al 2018 however in this study the detection of glyphosate and ampa in the rural streams was low despite glyphosate being widely used throughout the growing season of intensive cultures such as vine and fruit orchards preston 2018 in this case glyphosate dispersion into aquatic environments may have been attenuated by the soil capacity to strongly sorb both glyphosate and ampa okada et al 2016 sidoli et al 2016 also the presence of riparian vegetation syversen and bechmann 2004 reduces the probability of glyphosate reaching surface waters for instance several studies have found that riparian vegetation of 5 m or more have a pesticide retention efficiency higher than 40 reichenberger et al 2007 in our study the average riparian vegetation width at the rural stream sites was 15 m except for two sampling points where the width was 400 m so pesticide surface runoff may have been strongly attenuated other factors that may have reduced the occurrence of glyphosate and ampa in rural streams are i correct glyphosate management practices ii organic farming iii no applications near time of sampling since the sampling scheme did not cover the paddock preparation period prior to sowing april to early june the highest glyphosate levels were detected in wetland samples with concentrations as high as 11 5 and 14 2 Œºg l 1 the highest ampa concentrations were also detected in wetland samples with values of 6 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 the average concentrations in urban streams and wetlands are consistent with previous reports on glyphosate and ampa levels in urban catchments from other countries table 1 although non agricultural use represents less than 10 of the total glyphosate usage urban contributions of glyphosate into surface waters should not be underrated the application of glyphosate for weed control in residential industrial areas can be a source of contamination of surface waters skark et al 2004 in this sense a significant amount of glyphosate and ampa is washed away in urban stormwater botta et al 2009 tang et al 2015 mauffrey et al 2017 and then accumulated in the wetlands built to retain excess runoff in addition sub urban environments increase the area of impermeable surfaces such as asphalt and concrete compared to pre development conditions while at the same time reducing the extent of vegetation hence evapotranspiration and infiltration are reduced while stormwater run off increases allinson et al 2017 also glyphosate loss from hard surfaces is higher than from agricultural fields because glyphosate sorption to soil is stronger than to concrete or asphalt ramwell et al 2014 however more than 75 of glyphosate can be lost in run off from asphalt spanoghe et al 2005 because asphalt paving material is composed of a mixture of asphalt cement sand and crushed rock with limited clay or mineral content thus with fewer sites for glyphosate sorption 3 2 seasonal variations rural streams only had detectable levels of glyphosate in early summer december although trace levels of ampa were detected in november december and february fig 4 in urban streams and wetlands the highest glyphosate concentrations were detected in early spring november and then concentrations decreased in mid summer february fig 4 average glyphosate concentrations in urban wetlands and urban streams were broadly correlated except in january where glyphosate concentrations in wetlands were observed at similar values as in november whereas concentrations in urban streams remained almost constant overall the fod of glyphosate was similar in urban streams and wetlands being higher than 80 in november december and january and decreasing to less than 60 in february fig 4 in a similar manner to glyphosate ampa was detected at very low concentrations in rural streams throughout the sampled months on the other hand ampa fod in urban wetlands and urban streams from october to february was between 80 and 100 fig 4 in the case of wetlands the highest concentrations were detected in november whereas in urban streams ampa levels tended to be higher in january fig 4 no significant differences were found in glyphosate concentrations between urban streams and wetlands using the mixed linear model and there was no interaction between source of sample and month p 0 05 data not shown when glyphosate data is analysed altogether there is a significant seasonal variation in which glyphosate has its highest value at the beginning of spring november p 0 05 fig 5 in the case of ampa there were no significant differences between urban streams and wetlands data not shown or between time of sampling p 0 05 fig 5 it is important to note that samples were taken during base flow except for the samples taken in december which were taken after a heavy rainfall see appendix a fig a1 in december most of the streams had bankfull flow bank over flow or evidence that the bank had overflowed as a consequence of the heavy rainstorm however we did not find a clear association between levels of glyphosate and ampa and precipitation events in average the highest glyphosate concentrations were detected in november springtime which may result from recent herbicide applications due to spring weed control in amenity areas pavements and gardens we observed that the urban councils performed herbicide sprayings during spring and summer in parks and near creeks and riverbanks during our sampling trips this type of weed management is relevant in the studied area since there are 87 species of declared invasive plants in the state of victoria which are considered noxious weeds calp act 1994 of which each council has the responsibility to control and manage from december to february glyphosate concentration decreased reaching its lowest values towards the end of the study fig 5 ampa levels tended to be higher than glyphosate concentrations and remained steady throughout the sampled period fig 5 this can be a result of several factors first there are fewer weed controls at the end of the dry victorian summer secondly during the warmer months glyphosate concentration decreases because biological degradation is favoured at higher environmental temperatures bento et al 2016 at the same time the ampa that is produced as a degradation product is more persistent than glyphosate wang et al 2016 la cecilia et al 2018 sun et al 2019 third glyphosate may also be removed from the water column because it is strongly sorbed to sediments coupe et al 2012 and can also undergo fast chemical degradation paudel et al 2015 la cecilia and maggi 2018 lastly household and industrial detergents such as diamine tetramethylene phosphonate edtmp or diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp also degrade into ampa nowack 2003 in this study the detection of ampa in urban streams cannot be attributed to the discharge of wastewater treatment plant effluents since in melbourne sewerage system and stormwater are separated except on rare occasions however it is possible that phosphonate detergents end up in the stormwater from general household use e g washing down of patios decks cars in driveways etc 3 3 risks urban wetlands not only act as water retention and depuration areas but also offer an appealing environment for diverse biota such as endemic birds frogs and fish these constructed aquatic ecosystems are mainly quiescent water bodies that only have a major water input during storm events they are therefore a sink for any chemicals that may be washed away from houses or industrial developments allinson et al 2015 and can be affected by the accumulation of pollutants such as glyphosate there are guidelines for the construction of these stormwater wetlands in victoria melbourne water 2017a b but not for chemicals in entrained stormwater other than for total nitrogen and phosphorus the water in and or extracted from stormwater retention ponds and wetlands may pose a real or perceived risk to soil and aquatic organisms from chemicals contained therein in this context the concentrations of glyphosate detected in this study were well below the strictest level of protection for freshwater species 99 in pristine ecosystems 370 Œºg l 1 established by the australian and new zealand guidelines for fresh and marine water quality anzecc and armcanz 2000 the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality guidelines has set a value of 800 Œºg l 1 as the benchmark for protection of aquatic life from glyphosate canadian council of ministers of the environment 2012 in the usa the chronic aquatic life benchmarks for glyphosate are 25 700 and 49 900 Œºg l 1 for fish and for aquatic invertebrates respectively epa 2016 in the eu there are no defined environmental quality standards for glyphosate or ampa in surface water sz√©k√°cs and darvas 2018 however the eu has a very strict maximum allowed level of glyphosate in drinking water of 0 1 Œºg l 1 european parliament and council 1998 currently there is no agreement among countries regulation agencies on the human health based limits for glyphosate in drinking water for example in australia the guideline value for glyphosate in drinking water is 1000 Œºg l 1 hmrc and nrmmc 2011 while in the usa the limit is 700 Œºg l 1 us epa 2002 and in canada the maximum allowed concentration is 280 Œºg l 1 guidelines for canadian drinking water quality 2014 although the sampled wetlands and streams are not used as a source of drinking water none of the samples exceeded the guideline value established by the australian drinking water guidelines hmrc and nrmmc 2011 although glyphosate in surface water can disturb aquatic communities the concentrations detected in this study do not suggest an environmental risk from this chemical alone for example glyphosate concentrations of 360 Œºg l 1 are required to increase infection of the freshwater fish galaxias anomalus by a flatworm parasite kelly et al 2010 even higher chronic exposure levels of glyphosate 3600 Œºg l 1 are needed to cause deleterious effects in the reproductive cycle of silver catfish rhamdia quelen soso et al 2007 constructed stormwater wetlands are habitat for many types of frog in victoria however the risks to these organisms also appears low since glyphosate concentrations as high as 300 000 Œºg l 1 do not cause histopathologic lesions in the liver of tadpoles of the frog leptodactylus latrans bach et al 2018 in the case of re using stormwater as a source of irrigation the concentrations that we have detected in this study likely do not pose a risk to crops comes and kelley 1979 however other pesticides may be present in aquatic environments and can have an additive synergistic or antagonist effect as described earlier in allinson et al 2017 melbourne s stormwater wetlands contain many other herbicides such as simazine mcpa diuron atrazine and 2 4 d some of these compounds increase their toxicity when in the presence of glyphosate for example diuron and glyphosate have been shown to have a potential synergic sublethal effect in tropical fish rossi et al 2011 another commonly detected herbicide in melbourne s urban waters 2 4 d also has a synergistic effect on fish mortality when combined with glyphosate ruiz de arcaute et al 2018 consequently the risk to aquatic ecosystems from glyphosate may be higher than predicted when considering glyphosate alone especially considering its high fod in urban surface waters 4 conclusions this is the first report of glyphosate and ampa occurrence and seasonal variations in surface waters associated with urban land use in australia glyphosate and ampa were ubiquitous in stormwater wetlands and streams from sub urban and urban areas of melbourne in this case the sources of environmental contamination of glyphosate and ampa were associated with urban uses instead of agricultural practices glyphosate and ampa should be considered

18387,electrochemical systems have emerged as an advantageous approach for decentralized management of source separated urine with the possibility of recovering or removing nutrients and generating energy in this study the kinetics and byproduct selectivity of the electrolytic removal of urea were investigated using a boron doped diamond working electrode under varied operational conditions with a primary focus on comparing undivided and divided reactors the urea removal rate in the undivided and divided reactors was similar but the divided reactor had an increased required cell voltage needed to maintain the equivalent current density the current efficiency was similar for 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 a 33 3 83 3 167 ma cm2 suggesting no interference from competing reactions at higher potentials in a divided reactor increasing the anolyte ph reduced the urea removal rate presumably from hydroxyl radical scavenging by hydroxide further for all divided reactor experiments the final ph was less than 1 suggesting that the transport of protons across the ion exchange membrane to the cathode was slower than the oxidation reactions producing protons the nitrogen byproduct selectivity was markedly different in the undivided and divided reactors in both reactors nitrate no3 formed as the main byproduct at the anode but in the undivided reactor it was reduced at the stainless steel cathode to ammonia in the presence of 1 m chloride the urea removal kinetics improved from the generation of reactive chlorine species and the byproduct selectivity was shifted away from no3 to presumably chloramines and n2 overall these results indicate that the electrochemical reactor configuration should be carefully considered depending on the desired outcome of treating source separated

with wastewater as it flows from the toilet to the treatment plant effluent and the concomitant hydrolysis of urea to ammonia kinetic studies are critical for developing technologies to address the issue of wastewater n additionally the production of undesirable treatment byproducts including n and cl species compromises the viability of many electrochemical systems garcia segura et al 2018

anolyte ph on urea removal for the undivided reactor the unadjusted ph of the anolytes was 1 31 1 n h2so4 6 45 1 n naclo4 and 13 94 1 n koh the observed average percent removals of urea after 80 min were 73 11 71 3 0 and 12 3 0 respectively there was no significant difference between the acidic and circumneutral anolyte conditions p 0 20 the difference in conductivity values for the supporting electrolytes e g 1 n h2so4 211 ms cm 1 n koh 178 ms cm rumble 2019 is unlikely to have a marked effect on the urea removal kinetics because of the high supporting electrolyte concentrations used 1 n bdd is an inactive electrode with no unique electrochemical signature for urea fig s2 which supports ho production as the dominant electrochemical oxidation pathway of urea the low urea removal observed for alkaline conditions can be attributed to the reaction between and hydroxide oh which can recombine with ho to form h2o hayashi et al 2016 at alkaline ph the abundance of oh retarded the oxidation of urea by ho the average required cell voltage negatively correlated r2 0 99 with ph fig s3 and table s3 with voltages decreasing from 6 3 v for ph 1 31 3 8 v for ph 13 94 this is presumably due to a combination of conductivity differences between electrolytes and or a nernst relationship where the redox reactions will have a lower required potential with increasing higher ph though not directly observed here alkaline conditions can also change the surface morphology of bdd producing inhibitory conditions for organic oxidation and ultimately degrading the bdd surface declements and swain 1997 gonzalez gonzalez et al 2010 griesbach et al 2005 for remaining experiments unless otherwise stated naclo4 was used as the conductive supporting anolyte to reduce resistance caused by large electrode spacing in realistic applications due to its toxicity its use would be eliminated using advanced reactor design in a divided reactor the cathode ph is important because it can alter the flow of protons across the pem and change the anolyte ph thus affecting the urea oxidation rate and required cell potentials fig 1 b shows the effect of catholyte ph 0 58 6 12 13 98 on the urea removal kinetics at the anode for a divided reactor all catholyte phs tested resulted in similar urea removal kinetics p 1 0 and a decrease in the anolyte ph the initial anolyte ph for the three conditions was an average of 6 7 and it decreased to an average of 0 65 after 140 min the ph of the catholyte increased less than 0 5 over 140 min for the acidic 0 58 and alkaline 13 98 reactors but for the circumneutral condition 6 12 the ph increased to 12 95 the negligible change in the catholyte ph for the acidic and alkaline conditions is attributed to the buffer intensity afforded by water at the extreme ph i e ph 3 or ph 11 in contrast the ph of the electrolyte in the undivided experiments i e fig 1a did not change significantly 5 table s3 the ph change observed in the divided reactor is attributed to h reaction and transport kinetics for bdd the oxidation of h2o forms ho equation 1 which remains physisorbed at a bdd site chaplin 2014 the weakly bound ho i e bdd ho can then react with h2o equation 2 or an organic species r equation 3 all reactions produce h at the anode and h can be reduced at the cathode the surplus of h produced at the anode should migrate through the pem to the cathode to maintain a steady state ph but because of the drastic ph changes observed in the anode and cathode chambers this suggests that the kinetics of h production anode and consumption cathode were much faster than transport of h through the pem comninellis 1994 panizza and cerisola 2009 1 b d d h 2 o b d d h o h e 2 b d d h o h 2 o b d d o 2 3 h 3 e 3 b d d h o r b d d c o 2 h 2 o h e 3 1 2 comparison of undivided and divided reactors for urea and synthetic urine separating the electrodes into two chambers can prevent the back reaction of byproducts in solution or at the electrode surfaces but this may have unwanted consequences on the kinetics the kinetics of urea removal were compared for an undivided and divided reactor for urea and dilute synthetic urine solutions fig 2 under all conditions urea was removed to the mdl within 140 min there was no significant difference observed between the two solutions for each reactor undivided p 0 31 divided p 1 0 nor did dividing the reactor have any significant impact on the urea removal kinetics of either solution urea p 1 0 synthetic urine p 0 36 the temporary stabilization of the rate around q 0 5 observed for synthetic urine solutions in both reactors is presumably due ho competition by intermediates e g ammonium other constituents in urine could also inhibit the urea oxidation kinetics whether due to side and competing reactions or electrode interference and degradation griesbach et al 2005 schranck et al 2018 however this was not observed for either reactor configuration and voltammetry characterization supported this result i e fig s2 compared to the undivided reactor maintaining 0 1 a in the divided reactor required an approximately two fold increase of the required cell voltage from 5 1 to 11 v this increase is due to an increase in the total internal resistance r which is the sum of non ohmic and ohmic resistances elmekawy et al 2013 generally non ohmic resistances are caused by activation i e charge transfer and concentration i e mass transport losses and ohmic resistances are caused by poor electronic contacts ion migration within the electrolyte and ion conductivity of the separation membrane fan et al 2008 sleutels et al 2009 using ohm s law i v r 1 r was calculated for the undivided and divided reactors as 51 and 110 œâ respectively using current interrupt logan et al 2006 an ohmic resistance of 14 3 and 15 2 œâ was measured for the undivided and divided reactors respectively assuming the ohmic contact resistance was similar in the divided and undivided reactors the minor increase i e 0 9 œâ in ohmic resistance when dividing the reactor can be attributed to the increased electrode distance and addition of the pem cho and hoffmann 2014 2017 garcia segura et al 2018 hu et al 2008 logan et al 2006 rozendal et al 2007 the increase in ohmic resistance was minor thus most of the increased resistance for the divided cell was due to non ohmic resistances which were presumably caused by concentration polarization losses from the ph imbalance between the anode and cathode chambers elmekawy et al 2013 this imbalance occurs because the h diffusion through the pem is slower than the h reaction at the electrodes daud et al 2015 causing the ph of anode and cathode cells to decrease and increase respectively as observed in this study in practical applications ohmic resistances can be reduced by using a reactor that has a negligible electrode spacing chouler et al 2016 logan et al 2006 moon et al 2015 mousset et al 2019 and using thin conductive membranes daud et al 2015 reducing non ohmic resistances is more challenging but in the scenario presented herein the resistances imparted by the ph imbalance can be mitigated by using a more proton conductive exchange membrane 3 1 3 effect of varied current in a divided reactor fig 3 a shows the impact of varying applied current on urea removal as a function of time in the divided reactor the 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 a 33 3 83 3 167 ma cm2 applied currents corresponded to cell voltages of 8 90 15 8 and 21 9 v increasing the current density resulted in a linearly proportional increase of the urea conversion r2 0 99 not shown current efficiency ce was calculated assuming an 8 electron oxidation to nitrate based on selectivity data in section 3 2 the current efficiencies at 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 a for approximately 80 urea conversion were 39 39 and 42 respectively the current efficiency decreased with passing time e g for 0 1 a at t 20 min ce 94 and at t 60 min ce 50 indicative of a pseudo first order reaction table s3 the urea conversion at each q was similar for all current densities indicating relatively no change in the current efficiency with increasing current and voltage this suggests that side reactions and mass transfer limitations were not impacting urea conversion bard and faulkner 2001 this data further promotes the stability of bdd for urea removal at high potentials and predictable nature of urea removal between 0 1 and 0 5 a 33 3 167 ma cm2 for this divided reactor 3 2 nitrogen byproduct selectivity 3 2 1 effect of varied voltage byproduct selectivity is critical for understanding the fate of n during urea removal and it can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms considering all other factors to be constant the voltage must be increased to get increased reaction rates however changing voltage may alter the urea oxidation pathway and byproduct selectivity fig 4 shows the impact of reactor configuration and applied working electrode voltage 3 and 4 v vs sce on the removal of urea and subsequent formation of no3 and tan no urea removal was observed when 2 v was applied presumably because the overpotential required to produce ho for bdd 2 62 v vs sce bard et al 1985 kapalka et al 2009 panizza and cerisola 2009 was not reached as expected in both undivided and divided reactors the urea removal at 60 min was greater for 4 v compared to 3 v with respective removals of 92 and 42 for the undivided reactor figs 4a and 72 and 31 for the divided reactor fig 4b and table s3 no3 no2 and tan were measured as aqueous byproducts of urea removal for undivided and divided reactors fig 4c d no2 concentrations were typically low not shown with maximum values of 0 9 and 1 5 mg n l 1 observed in both the undivided and divided reactors respectively in previous studies on urea or tan oxidation much less no2 was formed than no3 and oftentimes no2 concentrations peaked as no3 continued to increase dbira et al 2015a 2016 lacasa et al 2012 li et al 2015 perez et al 2012a 2012b zollig et al 2017 in the undivided reactor no3 production peaked at approximately 55 mg n l 1 around 60 min for 4 v and at 42 mg n l 1 around 120 min for 3v for both 3 and 4 v conditions no3 was subsequently removed in conjunction with tan formation these results complement the anticipated conclusion that tan is a byproduct of no3 reduction at the cathode garcia segura et al 2018 and that voltage increases the rate of reaction without altering the product pathway for 4 v tan reached a peak of 84 mg n l 1 after 180 min before leveling and then it began to decrease peak by product selectivities for tan and no3 were approximately 65 and 20 respectively there are two hypothesized reactions that can account for the missing 15 n byproduct in the undivided reactor the final ph for the 4 v experiment was approximately 10 21 so nh3 would account for approximately 90 of tan i e pka 9 25 nh3 can volatilize tarpeh et al 2018 or it can be oxidized at bdd to n2 michels et al 2010 without the addition of a stripping gas the nh3 mass volatilized would be low at the timescales used here thus the remaining 15 n in this study was attributed to mostly n2 gas formation as it is the most thermodynamically stable n gas species garcia segura et al 2018 however other n gases are also plausible for n organics e g n2o no garcia segura et al 2017 in the divided reactor the byproduct selectivity was markedly different no3 formation continually increased throughout the experiment reaching a maximum of 83 and 102 mg n l 1 for 3 and 4 v respectively before the reaction period ceased for both 3 and 4 v conditions minor amounts of tan 15 mg n l 1 were formed at approximately the same rate up to 60 min and then steadied the final ph in anode chamber of the divided reactor was 1 so nearly 100 of the tan would be nh4 for 3 and 4 v a maximum byproduct selectivity of approximately 80 and 20 was observed for no3 and nh4 respectively all no3 or nh4 formed was not removed by electrooxidation and the sum of no3 and nh4 accounted for approximately 100 of n so no n2 was formed from urea oxidation this agrees with previous studies that showed nh3 must be present for n2 formation michels et al 2010 in both reactors urea oxidation forms no3 in the undivided reactor no3 migrates to the cathode and is reduced to tan as mostly nh3 which is then either volatilized at the cathode or transports to the anode and becomes oxidized to n2 in the divided reactor no3 cannot pass through the pem to the cathode and thus accumulates in the anode chamber since urea and tan have the same iii oxidation state the observed formation of tan in the divided reactor cannot be from a redox reaction thus tan is being produced by some other mechanism hydrolysis of urea to tan has been observed chemically khan et al 1996 warner 1942 and electrochemically in the presence of oh lu and botte 2015 2017 presumably some minor hydrolysis of urea occurred which reached equilibrium after 60 min in the divided reactor this reaction likely occurred in the undivided reactor as well but was not observed due to the formation of tan from no3 reduction 3 2 2 effect of nano3 and nh4cl on n selectivity during urea removal to confirm the reaction pathways observed in fig 4 additional experiments were conducted in the undivided and divided reactors starting with either no3 or tan i e no urea in the undivided reactor starting with no3 no3 was reduced at the cathode to tan with approximately 75 selectivity fig 5 a no no3 removal was observed in the divided reactor fig 5b confirming no3 is reduced at the cathode in the undivided reactor when starting with tan tan decreased by 18 and 27 in the undivided and divided reactors respectively and insignificant no3 was formed 5 in both reactors fig 5c and d while this suggests tan is slowly volatilized or oxidized to n gases the presence of cl in these experiments may cause misleading results as significant tan oxidation was not observed in the divided reactor experiments starting with urea i e fig 4d cl can oxidize on the bdd anode to reactive chlorine species rcs which then further oxidize urea 74 and this may change the urea removal kinetics and byproduct selectivity this is further explored in the next section 3 2 3 effect of reactive chlorine species on byproduct selectivity urine contains a significant amount of cl 200 mm which can be oxidized at the anode to rcs many studies have investigated rcs as an oxidation mediator but also as a producer of undesirable cl disinfection byproducts bergmann et al 2009 cho and hoffmann 2014 cho et al 2014 dbira et al 2015b garcia segura et al 2018 kapalka et al 2010c lacasa et al 2012 landolt and ibl 1970 mostafa et al 2018 perez et al 2012b zollig et al 2015b fig 6 shows the no3 and tan byproduct formation during urea oxidation in undivided and divided reactors containing dilute synthetic urine in either an unreactive electrolyte naclo4 or rcs electrolyte nacl in the undivided reactor with nacl urea conversion at 60 min reached approximately 100 compared to 40 for naclo4 for the divided reactor with nacl urea conversion at 60 min reached approximately 65 compared to 45 for naclo4 the faster rate of urea removal with nacl is attributed to the production of cl2 which rapidly reacts in h2o to form the rcs hypochlorite clo and hypochlorous acid hocl experiments with nacl also presented unique byproduct selectivity compared to those with naclo4 fig 6c and d with nacl in both the undivided and divided reactors no3 and tan accounted for less than 5 of the byproducts in both the undivided and divided reactors in contrast with naclo4 no3 tan and no3 accounted for approximately 60 75 of the byproducts for the undivided and divided reactor respectively in the presence of nacl nearly 95 of the byproducts were not accounted for by no3 and tan suggesting formation of either n gases e g n2 n2o or inorganic chloramines e g nhcl2 inorganic chloramine formation using bdd is possible from the reaction between rcs and tan garcia segura et al 2019 but no tan was detected in either the divided or undivided reactors while the rapid oxidation of tan to inorganic chloramines such that it is undetectable is still possible inorganic chloramines will further oxidize form n2 and n2o gases dbira et al 2015a 2015b these results implicate cl as a more effective electrolyte for more rapid removal of urea and production of n gases as a final oxidation byproduct however the presence of cl under oxidizing conditions has the potential to form unwanted cl byproducts such as chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 cho and hoffmann 2014 dbira et al 2015a perez et al 2012a in this study clo3 and clo4 were measured at the end i e 140 min of the nacl experiments corresponding to 90 removal of urea approximately 57 mg l 1 clo3 and 35 mg l 1 clo4 were produced in the undivided reactor and approximately 26 mg l 1 clo3 and 27 mg l 1 clo4 were produced in the divided reactor though the concentrations of clo3 and clo4 are high their cl selectivity is low 5 compared to the starting concentration of cl 1 m cl reactions at the cathode must also be considered because it has been shown to diminish cathodic production of h2 park et al 2009 but this would not an issue if using a divided reactor 4 conclusion data presented herein on undivided and divided reactors with various operational conditions including electrolyte selection ph anolyte matrix and cell voltage presents valuable insights into reaction kinetics and byproduct selectivity for urea oxidation using a bdd anode the most significant differences between undivided and divided reactors were the byproduct selectivity and final ph the fate of n was dependent on whether no3 species can migrate to the cathode and be reduced to tan the working electrode voltage up to 4 v vs sce did not change the n byproducts nor did increasing the applied current up to 0 5 a or 167 ma cm2 alter the reaction pathway or current efficiency in the presence of cl which is found in urine the n byproducts will be shifted away from no3 toward chloramines and n gases in undivided and divided reactors though chloramine selectivity will be small in real urine solutions that contain competing compounds and lower cl concentration than that tested here garcia segura et

divided reactor could be used to produce no3 and this would also allow simultaneous h2 production in the cathode chamber or if ammonia was the preferred n product an undivided reactor could be used and ammonia could be stripped and recovered tarpeh et al 2018 while similar to the natural enzymatic formation of ammonia an electrochemical system would be faster and allow more control over system operation if only n removal is desired then an undivided reactor with rcs species is likely the best option due to the ability of rcs to remove n from urine quickly with high n gas selectivity though this results in clo3 and clo4 byproduct formation that must be addressed by subsequent treatment the results of this study support further development of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes to address nitrogen management in source separated urine future research directions should continue to focus on optimal reactor design as it pertains to these applications there is a need to evaluate

18387,electrochemical systems have emerged as an advantageous approach for decentralized management of source separated urine with the possibility of recovering or removing nutrients and generating energy in this study the kinetics and byproduct selectivity of the electrolytic removal of urea were investigated using a boron doped diamond working electrode under varied operational conditions with a primary focus on comparing undivided and divided reactors the urea removal rate in the undivided and divided reactors was similar but the divided reactor had an increased required cell voltage needed to maintain the equivalent current density the current efficiency was similar for 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 a 33 3 83 3 167 ma cm2 suggesting no interference from competing reactions at higher potentials in a divided reactor increasing the anolyte ph reduced the urea removal rate presumably from hydroxyl radical scavenging by hydroxide further for all divided reactor experiments the final ph was less than 1 suggesting that the transport of protons across the ion exchange membrane to the cathode was slower than the oxidation reactions producing protons the nitrogen byproduct selectivity was markedly different in the undivided and divided reactors in both reactors nitrate no3 formed as the main byproduct at the anode but in the undivided reactor it was reduced at the stainless steel cathode to ammonia in the presence of 1 m chloride the urea removal kinetics improved from the generation of reactive chlorine species and the byproduct selectivity was shifted away from no3 to

anolyte ph on urea removal for the undivided reactor the unadjusted ph of the anolytes was 1 31 1 n h2so4 6 45 1 n naclo4 and 13 94 1 n koh the observed average percent removals of urea after 80 min were 73 11 71 3 0 and 12 3 0 respectively there was no significant difference between the acidic and circumneutral anolyte conditions p 0 20 the difference in conductivity values for the supporting electrolytes e g 1 n h2so4 211 ms cm 1 n koh 178 ms cm rumble 2019 is unlikely to have a marked effect on the urea removal kinetics because of the high supporting electrolyte concentrations used 1 n bdd is an inactive electrode with no unique electrochemical signature for urea fig s2 which supports ho production as the dominant electrochemical oxidation pathway of urea the low urea removal observed for alkaline conditions can be attributed to the reaction between and hydroxide oh which can recombine with ho to form h2o hayashi et al 2016 at alkaline ph the abundance of oh retarded the oxidation of urea by ho the average required cell voltage negatively correlated r2 0 99 with ph fig s3 and table s3 with voltages decreasing from 6 3 v for ph 1 31 3 8 v for ph 13 94 this is presumably due to a combination of conductivity differences between electrolytes and or a nernst relationship where the redox reactions will have a lower required potential with increasing higher ph though not directly observed here alkaline conditions can also change the surface morphology of bdd producing inhibitory conditions for organic oxidation and ultimately degrading the bdd surface declements and swain 1997 gonzalez gonzalez et al 2010 griesbach et al 2005 for remaining experiments unless otherwise stated naclo4 was used as the conductive supporting anolyte to reduce resistance caused by large electrode spacing in realistic applications due to its toxicity its use would be eliminated using advanced reactor design in a divided reactor the cathode ph is important because it can alter the flow of protons across the pem and change the anolyte ph thus affecting the urea oxidation rate and required cell potentials fig 1 b shows the effect of catholyte ph 0 58 6 12 13 98 on the urea removal kinetics at the anode for a divided reactor all catholyte phs tested resulted in similar urea removal kinetics p 1 0 and a decrease in the anolyte ph the initial anolyte ph for the three conditions was an average of 6 7 and it decreased to an average of 0 65 after 140 min the ph of the catholyte increased less than 0 5 over 140 min for the acidic 0 58 and alkaline 13 98 reactors but for the circumneutral condition 6 12 the ph increased to 12 95 the negligible change in the catholyte ph for the acidic and alkaline conditions is attributed to the buffer intensity afforded by water at the extreme ph i e ph 3 or ph 11 in contrast the ph of the electrolyte in the undivided experiments i e fig 1a did not change significantly 5 table s3 the ph change observed in the divided reactor is attributed to h reaction and transport kinetics for bdd the oxidation of h2o forms ho equation 1 which remains physisorbed at a bdd site chaplin 2014 the weakly bound ho i e bdd ho can then react with h2o equation 2 or an organic species r equation 3 all reactions produce h at the anode and h can be reduced at the cathode the surplus of h produced at the anode should migrate through the pem to the cathode to maintain a steady state ph but because of the drastic ph changes observed in the anode and cathode chambers this suggests that the kinetics of h production anode and consumption cathode were much faster than transport of h through the pem comninellis 1994 panizza and cerisola 2009 1 b d d h 2 o b d d h o h e 2 b d d h o h 2 o b d d o 2 3 h 3 e 3 b d d h o r b d d c o 2 h 2 o h e 3 1 2 comparison of undivided and divided reactors for urea and synthetic urine separating the electrodes into two chambers can prevent the back reaction of byproducts in solution or at the electrode surfaces but this may have unwanted consequences on the kinetics the kinetics of urea removal were compared for an undivided and divided reactor for urea and dilute synthetic urine solutions fig 2 under all conditions urea was removed to the mdl within 140 min there was no significant difference observed between the two solutions for each reactor undivided p 0 31 divided p 1 0 nor did dividing the reactor have any significant impact on the urea removal kinetics of either solution urea p 1 0 synthetic urine p 0 36 the temporary stabilization of the rate around q 0 5 observed for synthetic urine solutions in both reactors is presumably due ho competition by intermediates e g ammonium other constituents in urine could also inhibit the urea oxidation kinetics whether due to side and competing reactions or electrode interference and degradation griesbach et al 2005 schranck et al 2018 however this was not observed for either reactor configuration and voltammetry characterization supported this result i e fig s2 compared to the undivided reactor maintaining 0 1 a in the divided reactor required an approximately two fold increase of the required cell voltage from 5 1 to 11 v this increase is due to an increase in the total internal resistance r which is the sum of non ohmic and ohmic resistances elmekawy et al 2013 generally non ohmic resistances are caused by activation i e charge transfer and concentration i e mass transport losses and ohmic resistances are caused by poor electronic contacts ion migration within the electrolyte and ion conductivity of the separation membrane fan et al 2008 sleutels et al 2009 using ohm s law i v r 1 r was calculated for the undivided and divided reactors as 51 and 110 œâ respectively using current interrupt logan et al 2006 an ohmic resistance of 14 3 and 15 2 œâ was measured for the undivided and divided reactors respectively assuming the ohmic contact resistance was similar in the divided and undivided reactors the minor increase i e 0 9 œâ in ohmic resistance when dividing the reactor can be attributed to the increased electrode distance and addition of the pem cho and hoffmann 2014 2017 garcia segura et al 2018 hu et al 2008 logan et al 2006 rozendal et al 2007 the increase in ohmic resistance was minor thus most of the increased resistance for the divided cell was due to non ohmic resistances which were presumably caused by concentration polarization losses from the ph imbalance between the anode and cathode chambers elmekawy et al 2013 this imbalance occurs because the h diffusion through the pem is slower than the h reaction at the electrodes daud et al 2015 causing the ph of anode and cathode cells to decrease and increase respectively as observed in this study in practical applications ohmic resistances can be reduced by using a reactor that has a negligible electrode spacing chouler et al 2016 logan et al 2006 moon et al 2015 mousset et al 2019 and using thin conductive membranes daud et al 2015 reducing non ohmic resistances is more challenging but in the scenario presented herein the resistances imparted by the ph imbalance can be mitigated by using a more proton conductive exchange membrane 3 1 3 effect of varied current in a divided reactor fig 3 a shows the impact of varying applied current on urea removal as a function of time in the divided reactor the 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 a 33 3 83 3 167 ma cm2 applied currents corresponded to cell voltages of 8 90 15 8 and 21 9 v increasing the current density resulted in a linearly proportional increase of the urea conversion r2 0 99 not shown current efficiency ce was calculated assuming an 8 electron oxidation to nitrate based on selectivity data in section 3 2 the current efficiencies at 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 a for approximately 80 urea conversion were 39 39 and 42 respectively the current efficiency decreased with passing time e g for 0 1 a at t 20 min ce 94 and at t 60 min ce 50 indicative of a pseudo first order reaction table s3 the urea conversion at each q was similar for all current densities indicating relatively no change in the current efficiency with increasing current and voltage this suggests that side reactions and mass transfer limitations were not impacting urea conversion bard and faulkner 2001 this data further promotes the stability of bdd for urea removal at high potentials and predictable nature of urea removal between 0 1 and 0 5 a 33 3 167 ma cm2 for this divided reactor 3 2 nitrogen byproduct selectivity 3 2 1 effect of varied voltage byproduct selectivity is critical for understanding the fate of n during urea removal and it can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms considering all other factors to be constant the voltage must be increased to get increased reaction rates however changing voltage may alter the urea oxidation pathway and byproduct selectivity fig 4 shows the impact of reactor configuration and applied working electrode voltage 3 and 4 v vs sce on the removal of urea and subsequent formation of no3 and tan no urea removal was observed when 2 v was applied presumably because the overpotential required to produce ho for bdd 2 62 v vs sce bard et al 1985 kapalka et al 2009 panizza and cerisola 2009 was not reached as expected in both undivided and divided reactors the urea removal at 60 min was greater for 4 v compared to 3 v with respective removals of 92 and 42 for the undivided reactor figs 4a and 72 and 31 for the divided reactor fig 4b and table s3 no3 no2 and tan were measured as aqueous byproducts of urea removal for undivided and divided reactors fig 4c d no2 concentrations were typically low not shown with maximum values of 0 9 and 1 5 mg n l 1 observed in both the undivided and divided reactors respectively in previous studies on urea or tan oxidation much less no2 was formed than no3 and oftentimes no2 concentrations peaked as no3 continued to increase dbira et al 2015a 2016 lacasa et al 2012 li et al 2015 perez et al 2012a 2012b zollig et al 2017 in the undivided reactor no3 production peaked at approximately 55 mg n l 1 around 60 min for 4 v and at 42 mg n l 1 around 120 min for 3v for both 3 and 4 v conditions no3 was subsequently removed in conjunction with tan formation these results complement the anticipated conclusion that tan is a byproduct of no3 reduction at the cathode garcia segura et al 2018 and that voltage increases the rate of reaction without altering the product pathway for 4 v tan reached a peak of 84 mg n l 1 after 180 min before leveling and then it began to decrease peak by product selectivities for tan and no3 were approximately 65 and 20 respectively there are two hypothesized reactions that can account for the missing 15 n byproduct in the undivided reactor the final ph for the 4 v experiment was approximately 10 21 so nh3 would account for approximately 90 of tan i e pka 9 25 nh3 can volatilize tarpeh et al 2018 or it can be oxidized at bdd to n2 michels et al 2010 without the addition of a stripping gas the nh3 mass volatilized would be low at the timescales used here thus the remaining 15 n in this study was attributed to mostly n2 gas formation as it is the most thermodynamically stable n gas species garcia segura et al 2018 however other n gases are also plausible for n organics e g n2o no garcia segura et al 2017 in the divided reactor the byproduct selectivity was markedly different no3 formation continually increased throughout the experiment reaching a maximum of 83 and 102 mg n l 1 for 3 and 4 v respectively before the reaction period ceased for both 3 and 4 v conditions minor amounts of tan 15 mg n l 1 were formed at approximately the same rate up to 60 min and then steadied the final ph in anode chamber of the divided reactor was 1 so nearly 100 of the tan would be nh4 for 3 and 4 v a maximum byproduct selectivity of approximately 80 and 20 was observed for no3 and nh4 respectively all no3 or nh4 formed was not removed by electrooxidation and the sum of no3 and nh4 accounted for approximately 100 of n so no n2 was formed from urea oxidation this agrees with previous studies that showed nh3 must be present for n2 formation michels et al 2010 in both reactors urea oxidation forms no3 in the undivided reactor no3 migrates to the cathode and is reduced to tan as mostly nh3 which is then either volatilized at the cathode or transports to the anode and becomes oxidized to n2 in the divided reactor no3 cannot pass through the pem to the cathode and thus accumulates in the anode chamber since urea and tan have the same iii oxidation state the observed formation of tan in the divided reactor cannot be from a redox reaction thus tan is being produced by some other mechanism hydrolysis of urea to tan has been observed chemically khan et al 1996 warner 1942 and electrochemically in the presence of oh lu and botte 2015 2017 presumably some minor hydrolysis of urea occurred which reached equilibrium after 60 min in the divided reactor this reaction likely occurred in the undivided reactor as well but was not observed due to the formation of tan from no3 reduction 3 2 2 effect of nano3 and nh4cl on n selectivity during urea removal to confirm the reaction pathways observed in fig 4 additional experiments were conducted in the undivided and divided reactors starting with either no3 or tan i e no urea in the undivided reactor starting with no3 no3 was reduced at the cathode to tan with approximately 75 selectivity fig 5 a no no3 removal was observed in the divided reactor fig 5b confirming no3 is reduced at the cathode in the undivided reactor when starting with tan tan decreased by 18 and 27 in the undivided and divided reactors respectively and insignificant no3 was formed 5 in both reactors fig 5c and d while this suggests tan is slowly volatilized or oxidized to n gases the presence of cl in these experiments may cause misleading results as significant tan oxidation was not observed in the divided reactor experiments starting with urea i e fig 4d cl can oxidize on the bdd anode to reactive chlorine species rcs which then further oxidize urea 74 and this may change the urea removal kinetics and byproduct selectivity this is further explored in the next section 3 2 3 effect of reactive chlorine species on byproduct selectivity urine contains a significant amount of cl 200 mm which can be oxidized at the anode to rcs many studies have investigated rcs as an oxidation mediator but also as a producer of undesirable cl disinfection byproducts bergmann et al 2009 cho and hoffmann 2014 cho et al 2014 dbira et al 2015b garcia segura et al 2018 kapalka et al 2010c lacasa et al 2012 landolt and ibl 1970 mostafa et al 2018 perez et al 2012b zollig et al 2015b fig 6 shows the no3 and tan byproduct formation during urea oxidation in undivided and divided reactors containing dilute synthetic urine in either an unreactive electrolyte naclo4 or rcs electrolyte nacl in the undivided reactor with nacl urea conversion at 60 min reached approximately 100 compared to 40 for naclo4 for the divided reactor with nacl urea conversion at 60 min reached approximately 65 compared to 45 for naclo4 the faster rate of urea removal with nacl is attributed to the production of cl2 which rapidly reacts in h2o to form the rcs hypochlorite clo and hypochlorous acid hocl experiments with nacl also presented unique byproduct selectivity compared to those with naclo4 fig 6c and d with nacl in both the undivided and divided reactors no3 and tan accounted for less than 5 of the byproducts in both the undivided and divided reactors in contrast with naclo4 no3 tan and no3 accounted for approximately 60 75 of the byproducts for the undivided and divided reactor respectively in the presence of nacl nearly 95 of the byproducts were not accounted for by no3 and tan suggesting formation of either n gases e g n2 n2o or inorganic chloramines e g nhcl2 inorganic chloramine formation using bdd is possible from the reaction between rcs and tan garcia segura et al 2019 but no tan was detected in either the divided or undivided reactors while the rapid oxidation of tan to inorganic chloramines such that it is undetectable is still possible inorganic chloramines will further oxidize form n2 and n2o gases dbira et al 2015a 2015b these results implicate cl as a more effective electrolyte for more rapid removal of urea and production of n gases as a final oxidation byproduct however the presence of cl under oxidizing conditions has the potential to form unwanted cl byproducts such as chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 cho and hoffmann 2014 dbira et al 2015a perez et al 2012a in this study clo3 and clo4 were measured at the end i e 140 min of the nacl experiments corresponding to 90 removal of urea approximately 57 mg l 1 clo3 and 35 mg l 1 clo4 were produced in the undivided reactor and approximately 26 mg l 1 clo3 and 27 mg l 1 clo4 were produced in the divided reactor though the concentrations of clo3 and clo4 are high their cl selectivity is low 5 compared to the starting concentration of cl 1 m cl reactions at the cathode must also be considered because it has been shown to diminish cathodic production of h2 park et al 2009 but this would not an issue if using a divided reactor 4 conclusion data presented herein on undivided and divided reactors with various operational conditions including electrolyte selection ph anolyte matrix and cell voltage presents valuable insights into reaction kinetics and byproduct selectivity for urea oxidation using a bdd anode the most significant differences between undivided and divided reactors were the byproduct selectivity and final ph the fate of n was dependent on whether no3 species can migrate to the cathode and be reduced to tan the working electrode voltage up to 4 v vs sce did not change the n byproducts nor did increasing the applied current up to 0 5 a or 167 ma cm2 alter the reaction pathway or current efficiency in the presence of cl which is found in urine the n byproducts will be shifted away from no3 toward chloramines and n gases in undivided and divided reactors though chloramine selectivity will be small in real urine solutions that contain competing compounds and lower cl concentration than that tested here garcia segura et

divided reactor could be used to produce no3 and this would also allow simultaneous h2 production in the cathode chamber or if ammonia was the preferred n product an undivided reactor could be used and ammonia could be stripped and recovered tarpeh et al 2018 while similar to the natural enzymatic formation of ammonia an electrochemical system would be faster and allow more control over system operation if only n removal is desired then an undivided reactor with rcs species is likely the best option due to the ability of rcs to remove n from urine quickly with high n gas selectivity though this results in clo3 and clo4 byproduct formation that must be addressed by subsequent treatment the results of this study support further development of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes to address nitrogen management in source separated urine future research directions should continue to focus on optimal reactor design as it pertains to these applications there is a need to evaluate these electrochemical systems using real urine which contains numerous compounds not found in synthetic urine e g micropollutants that may alter reaction kinetics and byproduct selectivity declaration

524 beijing 10084 people s republic of china the disinfection performance of a flow through electrode system fes was systematically evaluated using different carbonized c1 c2 and c3 and corresponding graphitized g1 g2 and g3 carbon fiber felt cff electrodes the physicochemical and electrochemical properties were characterized to identify the differences among cffs graphitized cffs gcffs can achieve complete inactivation of escherichia coli 6 log at the voltage of 3 v and flux of 120 3600 l m2 h for high conductivity and chemical stability while carbonized cffs ccffs only achieved around 1 log removal with obvious carbon corrosion for the gcffs g1 6 log removal with higher conductivity better graphite structure and larger surface area related to fiber diameter and density presented better disinfection performance at the flow rate of 30 ml min than g2 3 log and g3 1 log furthermore no regrowth and reactivation of bacteria occurred during the storage under visible light illumination after fes treatment three parallel fess with g1 were operated continuously for one week 24 h per day 7 days treating the solution with an e coli concentration ranging from 106 to 107 cfu ml at the applied voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 20 ml min no live bacteria were detected in the effluent of any of these three fess in situ sampling experiments demonstrated that the inactivation of bacteria on anode was the dominant mechanism for fes treatment which can be attributed to the sequential adsorption direct oxidation and desorption process on anode instead of indirect oxidation by generating chemical oxidants in addition hydroxide ion generated from cathode reaction enhanced anode adsorption and inactivation of bacteria by providing alkaline environment combining the analysis results of material properties and disinfection performance the gcff based fes was suggested to be a low cost high efficiency and safe alternative for future water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbonized carbon fiber felt graphitized carbon fiber felt flow through electrode system electrochemical disinfection 1 introduction the pathogen inactivation is of great importance for public health and environmental concerns fan et al 2018 shannon et al 2008 mainly by the conventional disinfection technologies such as chlorination du et al 2017 gallard and gunten 2002 and ultraviolet uv radiation hijnen et al 2006 however it has been revealed that the active chlorine species such as cl2 hclo and clo inevitably generate toxic and carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps with organic contaminants during the disinfection chu et al 2016 tang et al 2014 although uv can effectively avoid the formation of chlorinated dbps high level energy consumption and regrowth of bacteria via photoreactivation dark repair preclude its wide application guo et al 2012 li et al 2017 to address these issues there is a critical need to develop an alternative disinfection technology that can inactivate bacteria with less potential dbps formation and energy consumption the electrochemical disinfection has been studied for its environmental compatibility easy operation and onsite generation of disinfectants diao et al 2004 huang et al 2016 wouters et al 2001 the mostly accepted mechanisms of electrochemical disinfection are electric field destruction such as electroporation huo et al 2016 liu et al 2013 direct oxidation by anode and indirect oxidation by the production of disinfectants such as hydroxyl radicals oh and chlorine on anode and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on cathode cotillas et al 2015 jelena and sedlak 2015 laxman et al 2015 among them the generation of disinfectants may require a high applied voltage which possibly results in the formation of the dbps and high energy consumption reactor configuration and electrode materials are the key factors to determine the electrochemical disinfection efficiency two dimensional 2d plate electrodes are well studied in flow by or sequencing batch modes battisti et al 2018 ghasemian et al 2017 jin et al 2019 but the limited electrode surface area leads to weak mass transfer function in turn high voltage and or long residence time are required to guarantee the disinfection efficiency which result in the high energy consumption therefore a flow through reactor based on three dimensional 3d electrodes with high surface area is explored to improve mass transfer resulting in enhanced convection of bacteria to the electrode surface and achieving excellent disinfection performance at the low voltage with less energy consumption and generation of free chlorine and its potential dbps gao and vecitis 2012 huo et al 2018b liu et al 2015 on basis of this reactor configuration nanomaterial electrodes such as copper oxide nanowire assisted cuonw copper foam huo et al 2016 and carbon nanotube cnt filter rahaman et al 2012 are applied successfully for bacterial inactivation for instance huo et al 2016 fabricated a cuonw 3d copper foam electrode which inactivated bacteria at a low applied voltage of 1 v and short hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 s by the mechanism of electroporation however the durability of the copper foam electrodes was limited by the poor stability of the cuonw under mechanical erosion and chemical corrosion the anodic cnt filter was also investigated to effectively remove bacteria and virus at the voltage of 3 v under the flux of 140 l m2 h but the nanoscale pore structure restricted the disinfection performance of cnt filter by low flux and easy fouling in addition the manufacturing cost of nanomaterials should be taken into consideration hence a concern of future use of the flow through reactor is to explore an economical and stable electrode material carbon fiber felts cffs are considered as an ideal porous electrode for its high void space fraction 90 chemical stability conductivity and low cost casta√±eda et al 2017 huong le et al 2017 smith et al 2015 the cffs are manufactured by various micro fiber substrates through thermal treatment into carbonized cffs below 1500 c and graphitized cffs over 2000 c they have been extensively applied as anode to induce direct oxidation of organics or as cathode to generate h2o2 for electro fenton reactions casta√±eda et al 2017 huong le et al 2017 jie et al 2014 and to electro adsorb heavy metal ions such as pb ii brandon et al 2003 and cr vi abda et al 1991 a few studies have proved the highly efficient e coli removal using cff cathode and anode liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 however there are many types of cffs which can be commercially produced on the market and limited relevant study has been conducted to compare the difference of inactivation performance among them and evaluate the main material properties related to disinfection here in this study we constructed a flow through electrode system fes by using six different carbonized and graphitized cff materials as electrodes the physicochemical properties of the cff electrodes were characterized and compared systematically by scanning electron microscopy sem analysis brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area analysis elemental analysis raman spectrum and thermogravimetric analysis tga also these cffs were compared at the applied voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 1 50 ml min toward a representative bacterium escherichia coli e coli from the aspect of disinfection performance energy consumption and electrode stability the in situ sampling experiment live dead staining experiment and sem analysis for the e coli and cff electrodes before and after disinfection were carried out to evaluate the disinfection contribution and function of these cff cathodes and anodes the results can offer sound suggestions for future researches on pathogen inactivation through carbon fiber based flow through electrode systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 carbon fiber felt cff electrodes six carbon fiber felts cffs were utilized as flow through electrodes and they were classified into carbonized cffs ccffs produced at around 1000 1500 c named as c1 c2 c3 and the corresponding graphitized cffs gcffs fabricated over 2000 c named as g1 g2 g3 g1 2200 c and c1 1200 c were obtained from jingu carbon material co ltd liaoning china g2 2200 c and c2 1100 c were purchased from jing long te carbon co ltd beijing china g3 2000 c and c3 1500 c were acquired from qingdao carbon fiber co ltd qingdao china the carbon fiber felts were cut into cylinder with 2 5 cm in diameter and 0 47 0 01 cm in thickness as electrodes the electrodes were pretreated by wetting and washing with ultrasonic cleaning using 1 1 ethanol and deionized di water for 5 min to remove residual impurities washed thoroughly with di water and stored in di water until use 2 2 construction of the flow through electrode system fes the flow through electrode cell made of plexiglass was described previously liu et al 2019 specifically the inner diameter of each electrode chamber was 2 5 cm and the height was 4 7 mm fig s1 the cylindrical cff electrodes were served as both cathode and anode and settled into the electrode chamber with a quantitative filter paper pore diameter 20 25 Œºm as the insulating layer the electrode was connected with a dc power supply dg1718e 5 by titanium wires the influent was pumped into the fes by a peristaltic pump and treated by the sequential cathode anode under different flow rates 2 3 characterization of cff electrodes the morphology of

renishaw uk with the excitation laser of 532 nm the resistance r of the electrode was measured with a digital multimeter uni t ut39c and the conductivity œÉ was calculated using the formula œÉ l rs where l was the length and s was the cross sectional area 2 4 electrochemical disinfection and analysis escherichia coli cgmcc 1 3373 as a model pathogen provided by institute of microbiology chinese academy of science was cultured to the log phase 16 h in 37 c the cells were harvested and washed with 10 mm nacl twice by centrifugation hitachi rx2 series 14500 rpm for 10 min at 4 c and resuspended in 10 mm nacl solution to obtain a desired concentration of approximately 106 107 cfu ml each water sample was flowed through the fes equipped with the prepared cff electrodes at different flow rates from 1 to 50 ml min flux of 120 6000 l m2 h and an applied voltage of 3 v the long term operation experiment was conducted at the flow rate of 20 ml min and the applied voltage of 3 v with three parallel experiments the standard plate counting method was used to measure the bacterial concentration the water samples before and after disinfection were collected in autoclaved centrifugal tubes diluted serially plated in triplicate and incubated at 37 c for 18 h the bacterial concentrations of the influent n 0 and effluent n were compared to determine the log removal by the formula log n 0 n all disinfection experiments of each sample were performed at least three times providing error bars unfolding the standard deviation of figures the morphology of e coli before and after the fes treatment was imaged with fe sem hitachi su8220 japan and details of the bacterial sample pretreatment were described in supporting information si the storage experiment was designed to investigate whether the bacteria after fes treatment will regrow water samples with 106 107 cfu ml e coli passed the fes equipped with g1 electrodes at the applied voltage of 3 v with the flow rate of 30 ml min and 50 ml min treated and untreated samples were collected and stored in 10 mm nacl solution in a constant temperature incubator at 25 c for 0 1 2 4 6 12 h under visible light illumination in addition the staining experiment with fluorescence microscope was carried out to identify the flow scouring effect on the desorption process which was described in supporting information the hydrogen peroxide

applied to explain the live dead condition of bacteria using live dead baclight bacterial viability and counting kit thermo fisher usa with syto 9 and pi dye staining samples were examined with fluorescence microscopy after around 30 min storage in the dark 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of cff materials the physicochemical properties of ccffs and gcffs are listed in table 1 the sem morphology of the cff materials is shown in fig s2 in general the cffs produced from the same substrate showed the similar fiber shape and the diameter of gcffs 8 20 Œºm was smaller than that of the corresponding ccffs 10 25 Œºm for example g1 9 3 Œºm c1 18 6 Œºm the cff samples possessed high void space fraction 91 95 the micro scale fiber and high void space fraction guaranteed the high contact area for micro sized e coli and the large void space between carbon fibers led to high efficiency mass transfer the low specific surface area and few micropores in fibers ensured that most of the surface area was for the e coli inactivation in addition the ccffs had approximately the same true density while the true density of gcffs followed the order g1 1 96 g cm3 g2 1 85 g cm3 g3 1 33 g cm3 which was related to the graphite structure as shown in table 1 among cff electrodes the ccffs contained around 15 wt of elemental o h and n with c contents of around 85 wt while the gcffs were mainly composed of elemental c with over 99 wt the raman spectra of as prepared cff samples are shown in fig s3 the ccffs were observed as amorphous carbonaceous materials with only two broad peaks at 1340 1360 cm 1 for the disordered carbon structure d band and 1580 1600 cm 1 for graphitic carbon g band sadezky et al 2005 however the cffs which were fabricated and graphitized at the temperature over 2000 c had an obvious 2d band 2680 2690 cm 1 for the ideal graphitic lattice the integrated intensity ratio i d i g of the gcffs was further compared to identify the degree of graphitization and their values followed an order of g2 1 22 g1 1 32 g3 1 47 which indicated that g1 and g2 had more highly ordered graphite structure than g3 as shown in fig s4 the graphitic lattice also led to the thermal stability of gcffs which the temperature of graphitized carbon fibers over 700 c that started to degrade and decompose under static air atmosphere was significantly higher than that of carbonized carbon fibers below 670 c among the gcffs the weight loss peaks of g1 and g2 815 c in dtg versus t were higher than that of g3 700 c due to the higher degree of graphitization in addition the gcffs achieved higher conductivity than ccffs obviously which was according to the better ordered graphite structure the conductivity of g1 and g2 was two times larger than that of g3 which was coincident to the results that g1 and g2 had better graphite structure in raman spectra and higher weight loss peak in dtg curves 3 2 disinfection performance of cff electrodes the electrochemical disinfection performance of cff electrodes was carried out at a voltage of 3 v using electrolyte concentration of 10 mm nacl with e coli of around 106 107 cfu ml at the flow rate from 1 ml min to 50 ml min equivalent to the flux of 120 6000 l m2 h as presented in fig 1 a the removal of e coli using ccff electrodes c1 c2 and c3 was very poor less than 1 log while the gcffs g1 g2 and g3 exhibited much superior disinfection performance and achieved more than 6 log removal no detectable live e coli at the flow rate below 30 20 and 1 ml min respectively generally the steady state current increased incrementally with the increase of flow rate indicating that the high flow rate can enhance the mass transfer and improve the contact between reactants and electrode surface fig 1 b it was worth noting that the current of ccffs was higher than that of the corresponding gcffs the possible reason was attributed to side reactions of carbon corrosion oxidation instead of bacterial inactivation thus the total carbon tc concentration of the influent and effluent after fes treatment with different cff electrodes was plotted versus the operation time at the voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 30 ml min in fig 2 significant tc 0 3 0 8 mg l was detected in the effluent of the fes with c1 c2 and c3 which was ascribed to the oxidation of cff electrodes maass et al 2008 gao et al 2015 limited tc was observed in the effluent using gcffs as electrodes indicating that the gcffs exhibited relatively promising electrochemical stability at 3 v combining the results of disinfection performance and tc concentration in the effluent it was showed that ccff electrodes were not the appropriate choice for electrochemical disinfection in addition the viability of e coli after fes treatment during 1 12 h storage under visible light illumination was investigated using g1 as the electrodes as shown in fig 3 a e coli cells were inactivated completely at the applied voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 30 ml min and there was no e coli regrowth after the inactivation during storage although considerable e coli cells were still alive after the treatment at 50 ml min at the beginning the concentration decreased gradually and 80 bacterial cells became inactivated during storage compared with the e coli in untreated samples 20 fig 3 b it was revealed that the fes treatment caused irreversible damage to e coli cells furthermore the disinfection performance during long term and continuous operation was also investigated at the voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 20 ml min to evaluate the stability and effectiveness of fes with g1 electrodes as shown in fig 4 the fes enabled the complete inactivation no live bacteria detected in the effluent by the standard plating method for at least 7 days continuous operation 24 h per day which guaranteed the possibility for future application of long term operation the energy consumption was further calculated for gcffs using the formula energy voltage current flow rate wh m3 under condition of the applied voltage of 3 v with over 6 6 log removal undetectable live e coli in the effluent thus the energy consumption for g1 g2 and g3 was 37 7 40 6 and 102 5 wh m3 at the flow rate of 30 20 and 1 ml min respectively as shown in table s1 the energy consumption of fes 5 7 34 2 wh m3 per log was comparable to that of low pressure uv lp uv system 2 148 5 wh m3 per log and significantly lower than that of uv led system 50 10 000 wh m3 per log however there was no sign of photoreactivation after gcff based fes treatment which was superior to lp uv by synthesizing the results above gcff electrodes had the potential for bacterial inactivation in fes treatment therefore gcffs were further used to recognize the main physicochemical properties influencing their disinfection performance and also to analyze their disinfection mechanism in the following parts 3 3 identification of the key parameters of cffs for high efficiency disinfection the open circuit potential ocp and electrochemical impendence analyses eis were carried out to analyze the electrochemical properties the ocp for both cathode and anode of gcff electrodes was displayed versus the applied voltages from 0 5 v to 3 v fig 5 the anode potential vs ag agcl of three electrodes was similar around 1 0 1 1 v at the applied voltage of 3 v and potential shifted more to cathode which cathode potential of g1 g2 and g3 was 1 72 1 58 and 0 87 v respectively the potential drop of g3 was over 1 v which was evidently higher than g1 and g2 possibly due to much lower conductivity of g3 the result was also confirmed by electrochemical impendence analyses fig s5 the high frequency region of eis plot was semicircular tan et al 2018 the diameter of the semicircle of three electrodes was following the order g1 10 œâ g2 20 œâ g3 40 œâ which showed that the charge transfer resistance of g3 was obviously higher than g1 and g2 the conductivity of g3 was relatively low for its poor graphite structure in coincidence with the electrochemical properties restricting the disinfection performance the physicochemical properties of g1 and g2 were similar according to the analysis results of elemental composition raman spectra and tga the main parameters for their difference of disinfection efficiency can be attributed to surface area for the electrochemical reactions which mainly related to the fiber diameter and true density the surface area of g1 and g2 was further calculated by equations 1 and 2 with the assumption of smooth and uniform fiber cylinder and negligible base area of fiber cylinder compared with the side area 1 s 2œÄrl 2 m œÅv œÅœÄr 2 l where s was the surface area per electrode cm2 electrode r represented the average semidiameter of fibers cm l was the average length of fibers cm m was the average weight of each electrode g œÅ was the true density of carbon fiber g cm3 the surface area of g1 and g2 was estimated to be 501 and 375 cm2 electrode indicating that g1 electrodes can provide more surface area for the adsorption and oxidation inactivation of e coli combining the results of disinfection performance and physicochemical analysis it can be revealed that the higher conductivity of gcffs could reduce potential drop during electrochemical process and the larger surface area could offer more reaction sites for direct oxidation which guaranteed the high efficiency performance of fes disinfection 3 4 disinfection mechanism of the fes using gcff electrodes the electrochemical disinfection mechanism was considered due to the synergistic effect of direct anode oxidation and indirect effect resulting from the formation of radicals on the cathode and anode drogui et al 2001 feng et al 2004 in attempt to identify the complex electrochemical process of fes disinfection an in situ sampling experiment was designed fig 6 a inserted using the needle to withdraw the water sample only treated by cathode at the voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 30 ml min from fig 6 a the removal percentage of e coli after cathode treatment using g1 g2 and g3 was relatively low around 31 21 and 13 respectively however after further treatment by the sequential anode the removal of bacteria in the effluent was over 6 log undetectable live e coli for g1 over 3 log around 99 96 for g2 and around 1 log around 86 for g3 these results indicated the main disinfection occurred on the anodes to further confirm the disinfection contribution of the anodes the effluent and cathode treated influent samples for the fes with g1 electrodes were taken after 10 min continuous operation and analyzed with staining experiment water samples were mixed with green fluorescent syto 9 dye and red fluorescent pi dye fig 6 b d the syto 9 can stain both live and dead bacteria and pi can only stain dead bacteria with compromised membrane as compared with the total amount of e coli fig 6 b limited e coli was inactivated after cathode treatment fig 6 c indicating the limited disinfection performance via indirect oxidation by cathode the number of pi stained dead bacteria in the effluent fig 6 d was nearly equivalent to the number of live cells in the influent fig 6 b which was coincident with the disinfection result over 6 log removal above the possible anode inactivation mechanism may be direct oxidation and indirect oxidation by generating of oxidant for indirect oxidation mechanism the production of chemical oxidants near anode surface may be hydroxyl radical or free chlorine the hydroxyl radical was unlikely to appear for its high anode potential required over 2 v trellu et al 2018 vecitis et al 2011 free chlorine eq 3 1 15 v vs ag agcl was possibly produced in fes treatment thus the 10 mm naf was selected as electrolyte for its high oxidation potential of f eq 4 2 66 v vs ag agcl to confirm whether the function of free chlorine is significant the disinfection performance under 10 mm naf was compared to the inactivation performance under 10 mm nacl at the applied voltage of 3 v as shown in fig s6 there were no differences between two electrolytes at the flow rate of 20 ml min over 6 log removal and undetectable live bacteria and negligible differences at 40 and 60 ml min in addition the colorimetric dpd method with detection limit of 10 Œºg l as cl2 was used to measure the concentration of free chlorine in the effluent however the free chlorine was not detectable indicating that the concentration was below 10 Œºg l these results implied the fes disinfection process was independent to indirect oxidation by generation of free chlorine and the main mechanism was attributed to the anode direct oxidation 3 cl 2 2 e 2 cl e 0 1 15 v vs ag agcl 3 5 m kcl 4 f 2 2 e 2 f e 0 2 66 v vs ag agcl 3 5 m kcl to further explore the anode direct oxidation process the effluent samples after 1 3 5 10 and 15 min treatment using g1 were collected and also analyzed by staining experiment using fluorescence microscope as shown in fig s7 a f it was shown that the proportion of dead bacteria stained by pi was gradually increasing and stabilizing on 10 min operation which was nearly equal to the amount in influent fig s7 g meanwhile there were no live bacteria detected using the standard plate counting method through the whole operation it was supposed that adsorption oxidation and deposition process existed at this disinfection system the sem images fig 7 a b also showed the adsorption process obviously that the e coli cells were adsorbed on carbon fibers at the voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 30 ml min the additional staining experiment with fluorescence microscope was carried out to identify the flow scouring effect on the desorption process detailed method in si as shown in fig s8 the number of e coli cells attached on electrodes after 2 min flushing process with sterilized 10 mm nacl at the flow rate of 30 ml min and applied voltage of 3 v was significant less than that on the electrodes with only 1 min flushing process which demonstrated that the flow scouring effect with high flow rate can lead to e coli desorption effectively and guarantee the fes for long term disinfection as shown in fig 7 c d the morphology of live e coli in the influent was plump and the cells of dead e coli were dehydrated and shriveled after fes treatment using g1 as the electrode possibly due to the change of cell membrane permeability which was also verified by previous staining experiment because only membrane compromised cell can be stained by pi dye it was demonstrated that the cff based fes can cause the irreversible damage to bacterial cells which was in accordance with the results above of no bacterial regrowth during storage fig 3 in addition the disinfectants generated during cathode treatment may be oh and h2o2 according to the following reactions eqs 5 7 which were also confirmed by in situ sampling experiments

disinfection performance it was presumed that oh was dominant for cathode disinfection process in this study the short hydraulic residence time 4 6 s was not sufficient for h2o2 disinfection jin et al 2019 implying that h2o2 had few direct effects on bacterial inactivation additionally oh led to the negative charge of e coli isoelectric point around 4 6 huo et al 2018a for the alkaline water near cathode zhang et al 2015 then e coli can be absorbed on the sequential anode and inactivated via direct oxidation 4 conclusion the fes assembled with carbonaceous cffs as the electrodes was effective for the inactivation of e coli wherein the gcff electrodes 6 log removal outperformed the ccff electrodes 1 log removal at a low operational voltage 3 v with high flux 120 3600 l m2 h the better performance of gcffs was attributed to the physiochemical properties of higher conductivity and chemical stability the optimization of gcffs on the physiochemical properties higher conductivity and surface area could achieve higher inactivation and thus the fes assemble with g1 6 log showed higher log removal of e coli than g2 3 log and g3 1 log at the flow rate of 30 ml min furthermore no regrowth and reactivation of bacteria occurred during the storage under visible light illumination after fes treatment the stability of fes assembled with g1 was demonstrated during the continuous operation for one week 24 h per day 7 days at the applied voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 20 ml min no live bacteria were detected in the effluent of any of the parallel fess the cffs electrodes achieved the inactivation dominantly by direct oxidation on anode rather than the indirect oxidation of generating oxidative reagents hydroxyl radical or free chlorine in addition cathode enhanced anode adsorption and oxidation performance by the generation of hydroxide ion to provide alkaline environment therefore the disinfection mechanism can be the synergistic effects of adsorption direct

524 beijing 10084 people s republic of china the disinfection performance of a flow through electrode system fes was systematically evaluated using different carbonized c1 c2 and c3 and corresponding graphitized g1 g2 and g3 carbon fiber felt cff electrodes the physicochemical and electrochemical properties were characterized to identify the differences among cffs graphitized cffs gcffs can achieve complete inactivation of escherichia coli 6 log at the voltage of 3 v and flux of 120 3600 l m2 h for high conductivity and chemical stability while carbonized cffs ccffs only achieved around 1 log removal with obvious carbon corrosion for the gcffs g1 6 log removal with higher conductivity better graphite structure and larger surface area related to fiber diameter and density presented better disinfection performance at the flow rate of 30 ml min than g2 3 log and g3 1 log furthermore no regrowth and reactivation of bacteria occurred during the storage under visible light illumination after fes treatment three parallel fess with g1 were operated continuously for one week 24 h per day 7 days treating the solution with an e coli concentration ranging from 106 to 107 cfu ml at the applied voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 20 ml min no live bacteria were detected in the effluent of any of these three fess in situ sampling experiments demonstrated that the inactivation of bacteria on anode was the dominant mechanism for fes treatment which can be attributed to the sequential adsorption direct oxidation and desorption process on anode instead of indirect oxidation by generating chemical oxidants in addition hydroxide ion generated from cathode reaction enhanced anode adsorption and inactivation of bacteria by providing alkaline environment combining the analysis results of material properties and disinfection performance the gcff based fes was suggested to be a low cost high efficiency and safe alternative for future water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbonized carbon fiber felt graphitized carbon fiber felt flow through electrode system electrochemical disinfection 1 introduction the pathogen inactivation is of great importance for public health and environmental concerns fan et al 2018 shannon et al 2008 mainly by the conventional disinfection technologies such as chlorination du et al 2017 gallard and gunten 2002 and ultraviolet uv radiation hijnen et al 2006 however it has been revealed that the active chlorine species such as cl2 hclo and clo inevitably generate toxic and carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps with organic contaminants during the disinfection chu et al 2016 tang et al 2014 although uv can effectively avoid the formation of chlorinated dbps high level energy consumption and regrowth of bacteria via photoreactivation dark repair preclude its wide application guo et al 2012 li et al 2017 to address these issues there is a critical need to develop an alternative disinfection technology that can inactivate bacteria with less potential dbps formation and energy consumption the electrochemical disinfection has been studied for its environmental compatibility easy operation and onsite generation of disinfectants diao et al 2004 huang et al 2016 wouters et al 2001 the mostly accepted mechanisms of electrochemical disinfection are electric field destruction such as electroporation huo et al 2016 liu et al 2013 direct oxidation by anode and indirect oxidation by the production of disinfectants such as hydroxyl radicals oh and chlorine on anode and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on cathode cotillas et al 2015 jelena and sedlak 2015 laxman et al 2015 among them the generation of disinfectants may require a high applied voltage which possibly results in the formation of the dbps and high energy consumption reactor configuration and electrode materials are the key factors to determine the electrochemical disinfection efficiency two dimensional 2d plate electrodes are well studied in flow by or sequencing batch modes battisti et al 2018 ghasemian et al 2017 jin et al 2019 but the limited electrode surface area leads to weak mass transfer function in turn high voltage and or long residence time are required to guarantee the disinfection efficiency which result in the high energy consumption therefore a flow through reactor based on three dimensional 3d electrodes with high surface area is explored to improve mass transfer resulting in enhanced convection of bacteria to the electrode surface and achieving excellent disinfection performance at the low voltage with less energy consumption and generation of free chlorine and its potential dbps gao and vecitis 2012 huo et al 2018b liu et al 2015 on basis of this reactor configuration nanomaterial electrodes such as copper oxide nanowire assisted cuonw copper foam huo et al 2016 and carbon nanotube cnt filter rahaman et al 2012 are applied successfully for bacterial inactivation for instance huo et al 2016 fabricated a cuonw 3d copper foam electrode which inactivated bacteria at a low applied voltage of 1 v and short hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 s by the mechanism of electroporation however the durability of the copper foam electrodes was limited by the poor stability of the cuonw under mechanical erosion and chemical corrosion the anodic cnt filter was also investigated to effectively remove bacteria and virus at the voltage of 3 v under the flux of 140 l m2 h but the nanoscale pore structure restricted the disinfection performance of cnt filter by low flux and easy fouling in addition the manufacturing cost of nanomaterials should be taken into consideration hence a concern of future use of the flow through reactor is to explore an economical and stable electrode material carbon fiber felts cffs are considered as an ideal porous electrode for its high void space fraction 90 chemical stability conductivity and low cost casta√±eda et al 2017 huong le et al 2017 smith et al 2015 the cffs are manufactured by various micro fiber substrates through thermal treatment into carbonized cffs below 1500 c and graphitized cffs over 2000 c they have been extensively applied as anode to induce direct oxidation of organics or as cathode to generate h2o2 for electro fenton reactions casta√±eda et al 2017 huong le et al 2017 jie et al 2014 and to electro adsorb heavy metal ions such as pb ii brandon et al 2003 and cr vi abda et al 1991 a few studies have proved the highly efficient e coli removal using cff cathode and anode liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 however there are many types of cffs which can be commercially produced on the market and limited relevant study has been conducted to compare the difference of inactivation performance among them and evaluate the main material properties related to disinfection here in this study we constructed a flow through electrode system fes by using six different carbonized and graphitized cff materials as electrodes the physicochemical properties of the cff electrodes were characterized and compared systematically by scanning electron microscopy sem analysis brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area analysis elemental analysis raman spectrum and thermogravimetric analysis tga also these cffs were compared at the applied voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 1 50 ml min toward a representative bacterium escherichia coli e coli from the aspect of disinfection performance energy consumption and electrode stability the in situ sampling experiment live dead staining experiment and sem analysis for the e coli and cff electrodes before and after disinfection were carried out to evaluate the disinfection contribution and function of these cff cathodes and anodes the results can offer sound suggestions for future researches on pathogen inactivation through carbon fiber based flow through electrode systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 carbon fiber felt cff electrodes six carbon fiber felts cffs were utilized as flow through electrodes and they were classified into carbonized cffs ccffs produced at around 1000 1500 c named as c1 c2 c3 and the corresponding graphitized cffs gcffs fabricated over 2000 c named as g1 g2 g3 g1 2200 c and c1 1200 c were obtained from jingu carbon material co ltd liaoning china g2 2200 c and c2 1100 c were purchased from jing long te carbon co ltd beijing china g3 2000 c and c3 1500 c were acquired from qingdao carbon fiber co ltd qingdao china the carbon fiber felts were cut into cylinder with 2 5 cm in diameter and 0 47 0 01 cm in thickness as electrodes the electrodes were pretreated by wetting and washing with ultrasonic cleaning using 1 1 ethanol and deionized di water for 5 min to remove residual impurities washed thoroughly with di water and stored in di water until use 2 2 construction of the flow through electrode system fes the flow through electrode cell made of plexiglass was described previously liu et al 2019 specifically the inner diameter of each electrode chamber was 2 5 cm and the height was 4 7 mm fig s1 the cylindrical cff electrodes were served as both cathode and anode and settled into the electrode chamber with a quantitative filter paper pore diameter 20 25 Œºm as the insulating layer the electrode was connected with a dc power supply dg1718e 5 by titanium wires the influent was pumped into the fes by a peristaltic pump and treated by the sequential cathode anode under different flow rates 2 3 characterization of cff electrodes the morphology of electrode samples was imaged with field emission scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 7001f fe sem japan at an operating voltage of 20 kv the fiber diameter was measured with image j to calculate the average diameter of fibers in sem images the specific surface area was analyzed by the brunauer emmett teller bet method with autosorb iq2 c quantachrome instruments usa autopore iv 9510 micromeritics usa was applied to characterize the void space fraction the true density namely the density of the carbon fiber material excluding the pore volume was measured by the gas pycnometry method with accupyc 1330 micromeritics usa elemental composition was tested with euro ea3000 elemental analyzer eurovector s p a italy the thermogravimetric analysis tga and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves were obtained with sta449f3 jupiter netzsch german and the samples were heated from the room temperature to 950 c at 10 c min raman spectra were examined using invia reflex raman microscope renishaw uk with the excitation laser of 532 nm the resistance r of the electrode was measured with a digital multimeter uni t ut39c and the conductivity œÉ was calculated using the formula œÉ l rs where l was the length and s was the cross sectional area 2 4 electrochemical disinfection and analysis escherichia coli cgmcc 1 3373 as a model pathogen provided by institute of microbiology chinese academy of science was cultured to the log phase 16 h in 37 c the cells were harvested and washed with 10 mm nacl twice by centrifugation hitachi rx2 series 14500 rpm for 10 min at 4 c and resuspended in 10 mm nacl solution to obtain a desired concentration of approximately 106 107 cfu ml each water sample was flowed through the fes equipped with the prepared cff electrodes at different flow rates from 1 to 50 ml min flux of 120 6000 l m2 h and an applied voltage of 3 v the long term operation experiment was conducted at the flow rate of 20 ml min and the applied voltage of 3 v with three parallel experiments the standard plate counting method was used to measure the bacterial concentration the water samples before and after disinfection were collected in autoclaved centrifugal tubes diluted serially plated in triplicate and incubated at 37 c for 18 h the bacterial concentrations of the influent n 0 and effluent n were compared to determine the log removal by the formula log n 0 n all disinfection experiments of each sample were performed at least three times providing error bars unfolding the standard deviation of figures the morphology of e coli before and after the fes treatment was imaged with fe sem hitachi su8220 japan and details of the bacterial sample pretreatment were described in supporting information si the storage experiment was designed to investigate whether the bacteria after fes treatment will regrow water samples with 106 107 cfu ml e coli passed the fes equipped with g1 electrodes at the applied voltage of 3 v with the flow rate of 30 ml min and 50 ml min treated and untreated samples were collected and stored in 10 mm nacl solution in a constant temperature incubator at 25 c for 0 1 2 4 6 12 h under visible light illumination in addition the staining experiment with fluorescence microscope was carried out to identify the flow scouring effect on the desorption process which was described in supporting information the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by the iodide method √∂zcan et al 2008 and the absorbance of the solution was measured with spectramax m5 molecular devices usa at 350 nm the concentrations of total carbon in the samples were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan a three electrode system with two cff electrodes and an ag agcl reference electrode was used to describe the open circuit potential ocp and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis with zennium pro electrochemical workstation zahner german the staining experiment was applied to explain the live dead condition of bacteria using live dead baclight bacterial viability and counting kit thermo fisher usa with syto 9 and pi dye staining samples were examined with fluorescence microscopy after around 30 min storage in the dark 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of cff materials the physicochemical properties of ccffs and gcffs are listed in table 1 the sem morphology of the cff materials is shown in fig s2 in general the cffs produced from the same substrate showed the similar fiber shape and the diameter of gcffs 8 20 Œºm was smaller than that of the corresponding ccffs 10 25 Œºm for example g1 9 3 Œºm c1 18 6 Œºm the cff samples possessed high void space fraction 91 95 the micro scale fiber and high void space fraction guaranteed the high contact area for micro sized e coli and the large void space between carbon fibers led to high efficiency mass transfer the low specific surface area and few micropores in fibers ensured that most of the surface area was for the e coli inactivation in addition the ccffs had approximately the same true density while the true density of gcffs followed the order g1 1 96 g cm3 g2 1 85 g cm3 g3 1 33 g cm3 which was related to the graphite structure as shown in table 1 among cff electrodes the ccffs contained around 15 wt of elemental o h and n with c contents of around 85 wt while the gcffs were mainly composed of elemental c with over 99 wt the raman spectra of as prepared cff samples are shown in fig s3 the ccffs were observed as amorphous carbonaceous materials with only two broad peaks at 1340 1360 cm 1 for the disordered carbon structure d band and 1580 1600 cm 1 for graphitic carbon g band sadezky et al 2005 however the cffs which were fabricated and graphitized at the temperature over 2000 c had an obvious 2d band 2680 2690 cm 1 for the ideal graphitic lattice the integrated intensity ratio i d i g of the gcffs was further compared to identify the degree of graphitization and their values followed an order of g2 1 22 g1 1 32 g3 1 47 which indicated that g1 and g2 had more highly ordered graphite structure than g3 as shown in fig s4 the graphitic lattice also led to the thermal stability of gcffs which the temperature of graphitized carbon fibers over 700 c that started to degrade and decompose under static air atmosphere was significantly higher than that of carbonized carbon fibers below 670 c among the gcffs the weight loss peaks of g1 and g2 815 c in dtg versus t were higher than that of g3 700 c due to the higher degree of graphitization in addition the gcffs achieved higher conductivity than ccffs obviously which was according to the better ordered graphite structure the conductivity of g1 and g2 was two times larger than that of g3 which was coincident to the results that g1 and g2 had better graphite structure in raman spectra and higher weight loss peak in dtg curves 3 2 disinfection performance of cff electrodes the electrochemical disinfection performance of cff electrodes was carried out at a voltage of 3 v using electrolyte concentration of 10 mm nacl with e coli of around 106 107 cfu ml at the flow rate from 1 ml min to 50 ml min equivalent to the flux of 120 6000 l m2 h as presented in fig 1 a the removal of e coli using ccff electrodes c1 c2 and c3 was very poor less than 1 log while the gcffs g1 g2 and g3 exhibited much superior disinfection performance and achieved more than 6 log removal no detectable live e coli at the flow rate below 30 20 and 1 ml min respectively generally the steady state current increased incrementally with the increase of flow rate indicating that the high flow rate can enhance the mass transfer and improve the contact between reactants and electrode surface fig 1 b it was worth noting that the current of ccffs was higher than that of the corresponding gcffs the possible reason was attributed to side reactions of carbon corrosion oxidation instead of bacterial inactivation thus the total carbon tc concentration of the influent and effluent after fes treatment with different cff electrodes was plotted versus the operation time at the voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 30 ml min in fig 2 significant tc 0 3 0 8 mg l was detected in the effluent of the fes with c1 c2 and c3 which was ascribed to the oxidation of cff electrodes maass et al 2008 gao et al 2015 limited tc was observed in the effluent using gcffs as electrodes indicating that the gcffs exhibited relatively promising electrochemical stability at 3 v combining the results of disinfection performance and tc concentration in the effluent it was showed that ccff electrodes were not the appropriate choice for electrochemical disinfection in addition the viability of e coli after fes treatment during 1 12 h storage under visible light illumination was investigated using g1 as the electrodes as shown in fig 3 a e coli cells were inactivated completely at the applied voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 30 ml min and there was no e coli regrowth after the inactivation during storage although considerable e coli cells were still alive after the treatment at 50 ml min at the beginning the concentration decreased gradually and 80 bacterial cells became inactivated during storage compared with the e coli in untreated samples 20 fig 3 b it was revealed that the fes treatment caused irreversible damage to e coli cells furthermore the disinfection performance during long term and continuous operation was also investigated at the voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 20 ml min to evaluate the stability and effectiveness of fes with g1 electrodes as shown in fig 4 the fes enabled the complete inactivation no live bacteria detected in the effluent by the standard plating method for at least 7 days continuous operation 24 h per day which guaranteed the possibility for future application of long term operation the energy consumption was further calculated for gcffs using the formula energy voltage current flow rate wh m3 under condition of the applied voltage of 3 v with over 6 6 log removal undetectable live e coli in the effluent thus the energy consumption for g1 g2 and g3 was 37 7 40 6 and 102 5 wh m3 at the flow rate of 30 20 and 1 ml min respectively as shown in table s1 the energy consumption of fes 5 7 34 2 wh m3 per log was comparable to that of low pressure uv lp uv system 2 148 5 wh m3 per log and significantly lower than that of uv led system 50 10 000 wh m3 per log however there was no sign of photoreactivation after gcff based fes treatment which was superior to lp uv by synthesizing the results above gcff electrodes had the potential for bacterial inactivation in fes treatment therefore gcffs were further used to recognize the main physicochemical properties influencing their disinfection performance and also to analyze their disinfection mechanism in the following parts 3 3 identification of the key parameters of cffs for high efficiency disinfection the open circuit potential ocp and electrochemical impendence analyses eis were carried out to analyze the electrochemical properties the ocp for both cathode and anode of gcff electrodes was displayed versus the applied voltages from 0 5 v to 3 v fig 5 the anode potential vs ag agcl of three electrodes was similar around 1 0 1 1 v at the applied voltage of 3 v and potential shifted more to cathode which cathode potential of g1 g2 and g3 was 1 72 1 58 and 0 87 v respectively the potential drop of g3 was over 1 v which was evidently higher than g1 and g2 possibly due to much lower conductivity of g3 the result was also confirmed by electrochemical impendence analyses fig s5 the high frequency region of eis plot was semicircular tan et al 2018 the diameter of the semicircle of three electrodes was following the order g1 10 œâ g2 20 œâ g3 40 œâ which showed that the charge transfer resistance of g3 was obviously higher than g1 and g2 the conductivity of g3 was relatively low for its poor graphite structure in coincidence with the electrochemical properties restricting the disinfection performance the physicochemical properties of g1 and g2 were similar according to the analysis results of elemental composition raman spectra and tga the main parameters for their difference of disinfection efficiency can be attributed to surface area for the electrochemical reactions which mainly related to the fiber diameter and true density the surface area of g1 and g2 was further calculated by equations 1 and 2 with the assumption of smooth and uniform fiber cylinder and negligible base area of fiber cylinder compared with the side area 1 s 2œÄrl 2 m œÅv œÅœÄr 2 l where s was the surface area per electrode cm2 electrode r represented the average semidiameter of fibers cm l was the average length of fibers cm m was the average weight of each electrode g œÅ was the true density of carbon fiber g cm3 the surface area of g1 and g2 was estimated to be 501 and 375 cm2 electrode indicating that g1 electrodes can provide more surface area for the adsorption and oxidation inactivation of e coli combining the results of disinfection performance and physicochemical analysis it can be revealed that the higher conductivity of gcffs could reduce potential drop during electrochemical process and the larger surface area could offer more reaction sites for direct oxidation which guaranteed the high efficiency performance of fes disinfection 3 4 disinfection mechanism of the fes using gcff electrodes the electrochemical disinfection mechanism was considered due to the synergistic effect of direct anode oxidation and indirect effect resulting from the formation of radicals on the cathode and anode drogui et al 2001 feng et al 2004 in attempt to identify the complex electrochemical process of fes disinfection an in situ sampling experiment was designed fig 6 a inserted using the needle to withdraw the water sample only treated by cathode at the voltage of 3 v and flow rate of 30 ml min from fig 6 a the removal percentage of e coli after cathode treatment using g1 g2 and g3 was relatively low around 31 21 and 13 respectively however after further treatment by the sequential anode the removal of bacteria in the effluent was over 6 log undetectable live e coli for g1 over 3 log around 99 96 for g2 and around 1 log around 86 for g3 these results indicated the main disinfection occurred on the anodes to further confirm the disinfection contribution of the anodes the effluent and cathode treated influent samples for the fes with g1 electrodes were taken after 10 min continuous operation and analyzed with staining experiment water samples were mixed with green fluorescent syto 9 dye and red fluorescent pi dye fig 6 b d the syto 9 can stain both live and dead bacteria and pi can only stain dead bacteria with compromised membrane as compared with the total amount of e coli fig 6 b limited e coli was inactivated after cathode treatment fig 6 c indicating the limited disinfection performance via indirect oxidation by cathode the number of pi stained dead bacteria in the effluent fig 6 d was nearly equivalent to the number of live cells in the influent fig 6 b which was coincident with the disinfection result over 6 log removal above the possible anode inactivation mechanism may be direct oxidation and indirect oxidation by generating of oxidant for indirect oxidation mechanism the production of chemical oxidants near anode surface may be hydroxyl radical or free chlorine the hydroxyl radical was unlikely to appear for its high anode potential required over 2 v trellu et al 2018 vecitis et al 2011 free chlorine eq 3 1 15 v vs ag agcl was possibly produced in fes treatment thus the 10 mm naf was selected as electrolyte for its high oxidation potential of f eq 4 2 66 v vs ag agcl to confirm whether the function of free chlorine is significant the disinfection performance under 10 mm naf was compared to the inactivation performance under 10 mm nacl at the applied voltage of 3 v as shown in fig s6 there were no differences between two electrolytes at the flow rate of 20 ml min over 6 log removal and undetectable live bacteria and negligible differences at 40 and 60 ml min in addition the colorimetric dpd method with detection limit of 10 Œºg l as cl2 was used to measure the concentration of free chlorine in the effluent however the free chlorine was not detectable indicating that the concentration was below 10 Œºg l these results implied the fes disinfection process was independent to indirect oxidation by generation of free chlorine and the main mechanism was attributed to the anode direct oxidation 3 cl 2 2 e 2 cl e 0 1 15 v vs ag agcl 3 5 m kcl 4 f 2 2 e 2 f e 0 2 66 v vs ag agcl 3 5 m kcl to further explore the anode direct oxidation process the effluent samples after 1 3 5 10 and 15 min treatment using g1 were collected and also analyzed by staining experiment using fluorescence microscope as shown in fig s7 a f it was shown that the proportion of dead bacteria stained by pi was gradually increasing and stabilizing on 10 min operation which was nearly equal to the amount in influent fig s7 g meanwhile there were no live bacteria detected using the standard plate counting method through the whole operation it was supposed that adsorption oxidation and deposition process existed at this disinfection system the sem images fig 7 a b also showed the adsorption process obviously that the e coli cells were adsorbed on carbon fibers at the voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 30 ml min the additional staining experiment with fluorescence microscope was carried out to identify the flow scouring effect on the desorption process detailed method in si as shown in fig s8 the number of e coli cells attached on electrodes after 2 min flushing process with sterilized 10 mm nacl at the flow rate of 30 ml min and applied voltage of 3 v was significant less than that on the electrodes with only 1 min flushing process which demonstrated that the flow scouring effect with high flow rate can lead to e coli desorption effectively and guarantee the fes for long term disinfection as shown in fig 7 c d the morphology of live e coli in the influent was plump and the cells of dead e coli were dehydrated and shriveled after fes treatment using g1 as the electrode possibly due to the change of cell membrane permeability which was also verified by previous staining experiment because only membrane compromised cell can be stained by pi dye it was demonstrated that the cff based fes can cause the irreversible damage to bacterial cells which was in accordance with the results above of no bacterial regrowth during storage fig 3 in addition the disinfectants generated during cathode treatment may be oh and h2o2 according to the following reactions eqs 5 7 which were also confirmed by in situ sampling experiments 5 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 oh e 0 1 033 v vs ag agcl 3 5 m kcl 6 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 oh e 0 0 196 v vs ag agcl 3 5 m kcl 7 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 o 2 2 oh e 0 0 351 v vs ag agcl 3 5 m kcl as shown in fig 8 a and b for the cathode treated influent samples the h2o2 concentration followed an order of g1 51 Œºm g3 79 Œºm g2 94 Œºm and the bulk solution ph showed an order g1 10 08 g2 10 04 g3 9 74 combing the disinfection performance it was presumed that oh was dominant for cathode disinfection process in this study the short hydraulic residence time 4 6 s was not sufficient for h2o2 disinfection jin et al 2019 implying that h2o2 had few direct effects on bacterial inactivation additionally oh led to the negative charge of e coli isoelectric point around 4 6 huo et al 2018a for the alkaline water near cathode zhang et al 2015 then e coli can be absorbed on the sequential anode and inactivated via direct oxidation 4 conclusion the fes assembled with carbonaceous cffs as the electrodes was effective for the inactivation of e coli wherein the gcff electrodes 6 log removal outperformed the ccff electrodes 1 log removal at a low operational voltage 3 v with high flux 120 3600 l m2 h the better performance of gcffs was attributed to the physiochemical properties of higher conductivity and chemical stability the optimization of gcffs on the physiochemical properties higher conductivity and surface area could achieve higher inactivation and thus the fes assemble with g1 6 log showed higher log removal of e coli than g2 3 log and g3 1 log at the flow rate of 30 ml min furthermore no regrowth and reactivation of bacteria occurred during the storage under visible light illumination after fes treatment the stability of fes assembled with g1 was demonstrated during the continuous operation for one week 24 h per day 7 days at the applied voltage of 3 v and the flow rate of 20 ml min no live bacteria were detected in the effluent of any of the parallel fess the cffs electrodes achieved the inactivation dominantly by direct oxidation on anode rather than the indirect oxidation of generating oxidative reagents hydroxyl radical or free chlorine in addition cathode enhanced anode adsorption and oxidation performance by the generation of hydroxide ion to provide alkaline environment therefore the disinfection mechanism can be the synergistic effects of adsorption direct

18389,cow manure cm was added to a dynamic membrane bioreactor dmbr operated under anaerobic condition for enhancing food waste fw digestion for over 300 days with stepwise increase of organic loading rates olrs from 1 07 to 11 9 g cod l day at a fw cm ratio of 3 5 1 based on volatile solids the mixed liquor ph was always above 8 0 and no apparent volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation occurred even at the highest olr of 11 9 g cod l day hydraulic retention time as 10 days and solid retention time as 15 5 days correspondingly indicating a very stable operation condition which resulted in an average ch4 yield as high as 250 ml g cod and ch4 production as high as 2 71 l ch4 l day the hardly biodegradable organic components such as cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were effectively degraded by 78 3 58 8 and 47 5 respectively significantly high anaerobic digestion reaction ratios especially the hydrolysis ratio which is usually the limiting factor were calculated based on experimental results furthermore the high lignocellulase contents and coenzyme f420 levels along with the decrease of cellulose crystallinity from 72 6 to 16 4 in the feedstock provided strong evidence of an enhanced biological activity by cm addition by high throughput sequencing analysis more abundant and diverse bacterial archaeal and fungal genera were identified from the dmbr sludge with cm addition the biodegradation of lignocellulose might have produced sufficient h2 and co2 for the hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium which were highly tolerant to ammonium inhibition and then the elevated ammonium level would have provided high buffering capacity in the dmbr thus ensuring a stable condition for high rate fw digestion and ch4 production graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion cow manure dynamic membrane bioreactor dmbr food waste microbial community stable operation 1 introduction with the rapid development of the modern catering industry food waste fw production is increasing rapidly the fw production of urban areas has been predicted to increase by 44 from 2005 to 2025 due to economic and population growth particularly in developing countries melikoglu et al 2013 fw is mainly composed of carbohydrate polymers starch cellulose hemicellulose lignin proteins lipids organic acids and a smaller inorganic part xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and is an easily biodegradable organic substrate for anaerobic digestion ad due to its high potential for bio methane production dahiya et al 2018 neves et al 2009 however inhibition has always occurred when fw was digested alone at high organic loading rates olrs zhang et al 2014 to counteract the inhibition and to improve the performance of digesting fw alone wastewater brown and li 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 waste activated sludge li et al 2017a 2018a and paper waste qin et al 2018 have been used as a co substrate in batch and semi continuous tests the large amount of cow manure cm that exists has been continuously increasing as a result of livestock industry growth ti≈°ma et al 2018 due to the high buffering capacity and nutrient balance of fw digestion along with the addition of cm the methane yield and system stability of fw digesters were improved el mashad and zhang 2010 li et al 2009 mara√±√≥n et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 found that the digestion of fw with cm not only improved the maximum acceptable organic loading rates but also promoted the methane yield in semi continuous digestion li et al 2009 obtained a 44 improvement in the methane yield by adding cm to digestion of fw digesting most organic wastes with fw improves the efficiency of methane production and the stability of the system adding cm to ad of fw may enhance the stability of the anaerobic process mainly due to an increased carbon to nitrogen c n balance and an increased buffer capacity which has been reported by previous studies el mashad and zhang 2010 as we know the balance of the microbial community can also result in process stability and the microbial community structure is also shaped by substrate and operating parameters to date no study has been carried out to address the microbial community shift in fw digestion when cm is added the bioenergy conversion efficiency of digesting fw alone is not ideal because fw has a long hydraulic retention time hrt of more than 20 days a low olr of 1 6 g vs l day and a low bioenergy conversion rate of 40 70 ma et al 2018 a stable and high rate digestion of fw for efficient bioenergy conversion has significantly correlation with the applied mode batch or continuous reactor type whether digestion is performed in one or two stages and operating parameters temperature olr hrt and solid retention time srt compared with two phase ad single stage digestion requires a lower degree of control and less space which may be the reason why there are few examples of two stage processes run on a commercial scale schn√ºrer 2016 for a single phase system stable operation and a high substrate load can further reduce the occupied space a higher load requires a high biomass activity and a large biomass amount use of an anaerobic membrane reactor anmbr is considered an efficient method for methane generation from solid waste and wastewater li et al 2015 hrt and srt in anmbr can be independently controlled to extend process applicability for treating wastewaters and solid wastes however the intensive use of anmbr is limited by several critical obstacles such as low flux membrane fouling and high capital and operation costs dynamic membrane dm technology offers an innovative way to address these issues associated with conventional membrane technology tang et al 2017 cayetano et al 2019 investigated the applicability of external dm technology in the anaerobic treatment of fw for biomethane recovery their relatively high biomass retention enabled the digestion of fw with ch4 production rates of up to 1 2 l l day under an olr of 5 0 g cod l day therefore it is believed that by combining the positive effects of cm and dynamic membrane bioreactor dmbr on fw degradation and slow growing bacteria stable methane fermentation may be achieved under higher olrs although cm addition has been found effective to improve fw digestion efficiency in the aforementioned studies to our knowledge the underlying mechanisms are still unclear especially the system characteristics in long term operation and microbial community features therefore the main objective of this study was to reveal the characteristics of biogas production using a dmbr with fw as main substrate and cm as additive attentions were paid to the system stability under varied olrs in long term operation and the associated microbial community covering bacteria archaea and fungi 2 materials and methods 2 1 feedstock and inoculum the fw was manually prepared based on the characteristics of fw in china details about the processing procedures of fw are given in the authors previous study li et al 2017a the fw consisted of cabbage 20 pork meat 10 chicken meat 5 egg 5 cooking oil 1 potato 20 carrot 13 8 rice 15 noodles 10 and table salt 0 2 all based on wet weights cm was obtained from a rural area near xi an china to obtain higher methane yields the fw and cm were mixed at the optimum fw cm ratio of 3 5 1 which was based on volatile solids vs content and determined from preliminary experimental results data not shown the mixture was then crushed for 10 min using a blender and diluted with tap water to obtain feedstock with a ts content of approximately 7 0 the inoculum sludge was taken from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic reactor of a brewery plant in xi an china the physicochemical characteristics of the fw cm and inoculum used in this study were determined and they are presented in table 1 2 2 reactor configuration operation and experimental procedure a long term experiment was conducted via a dmbr with a working volume of 0 7 l as shown in fig 1 a submerged filtration module made of a nylon mesh with an equivalent aperture of 50 Œºm was used to support the growth of the dm cake layer the filtration module had a surface area of 14 4 cm2 two parallel filtering surfaces of 3 8 3 8 cm a water jacket and thermostatically controlled water baths were used to control the temperature of the reactor under mesophilic conditions 39 c feedstock was pumped from a substrate tank to the dmbr by a peristaltic pump that was maintained at 4 c a digital pressure meter sin p300 sinomeasure china was installed between the membrane module and the effluent extraction pump to record the trans membrane pressure tmp the final pressure increased gradually with time in constant flux operation mode when the final pressure increased to 16 kpa a physical cleaning method biogas backwashing with a flow rate of 10 l min for 2 min was applied for permeability recovery the experiment included ten stages which divided by different hrts from 100 to 10 days as showed in table 2 for a stable start up the reactor was initially seeded with 0 7 l of seed sludge and fed at a low olr of 1 07 g cod l day stage 1 after the initial stage which lasted for 47 days hrt was shortened gradually in the manner indicated in table 2 for accurate hrt control a suction pump was operated under prescribed on off frequency for extracting effluent from the reactor in each operation cycle 7 ml effluent was extracted and the same volume of feedstock was added to the reactor with increasing frequency of pump operation both olr and hrt were controlled and maintained in each stage as indicated in table 2 until the final stage stage 10 where olr was increased to 11 9 g cod l day and hrt was decreased to 10 days the filtration performance metrics of the dm membrane such as solid interception levels fouling rate and associated cleaning frequency were then determined accordingly meanwhile the reaction ratios and enzyme contents of dmbr sludge and cellulose hemicellulose lignin and the microbial community of feedstock and dmbr sludge were sampled and investigated and x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy were applied 2 3 lignocellulose degrading enzyme and coenzyme f420 content samples for lignocellulose degrading enzyme were centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min and then the supernatant was filtered using a syringe membrane with a 0 45 Œºm pore size the sample was diluted with deionized water to obtain absorbance readings in a linear measurement range and these readings were converted to activity in u ml the lignocellulolytic enzymes that were analysed were lignin peroxidase lip manganese peroxidase mnp laccase lac xylanase carboxymethyl cellulase cmcase xylitolase xylan esterase Œ≤ glucosidase bg endoglucanase eg and cellobiose hydrolase cbh the contents of lignocellulose degrading enzymes were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits mskbio wuhan china absorbance was measured by a multiscan spectrophotometer varioskan lux thermo fisher finland at 450 nm the concentration of conenzyme f420 in dmbr sludge was determined according to the methods described by reynolds and colleran 1987 2 4 microbial community analysis samples were collected from seed sludge feedstock and the dmbr on day 262 to characterize the diversity of microbial communities via high throughput sequencing technology dna was extracted with the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad

gene were sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 sequencer sangon biotech shanghai co ltd china the obtained sequence fragments were assembled using flash software rarefaction curves and the shannon diversity index chao1 species richness estimator and coverage index were calculated by mothur to identify the species diversity for each sample zhang et al 2017 uchime was then used to remove chimaeric sequences and sequences with more than 97 similarity were clustered to form operation taxonomic units otus the ribosomal database project was used for alignment at a confidence threshold of

flux of the dm with a volumetric method the biogas production composition of the various biogases ch4 co2 n2 and h2 and volatile fatty acid vfa levels were measured as described by li et al 2017a the elemental composition of c h o n and s were analysed using an elemental analyser vario pyro cube elementar company germany analysis of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was conducted using an hplc

particle size distribution psds of the feedstock cake sludge and fermentation mixture were analysed using a laser granularity distribution analyser ls 230 svm beckman coulter corporation usa with a detection range of 0 4 2000 Œºm the morphological properties of the membrane and nylon mesh were observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem mla650 feg fei usa analyser according to the methods described by hu et al 2016 the crystallinity of the raw materials and residues were studied using xrd the crystallinity index is calculated from the ratio of the area of all crystalline peaks 101 10ƒ´ 021 002 and 040 to the total area basis on the corresponding xrd patterns park et al 2010 chemical bond changes were studied by ftir at 4000 400 cm 1 the free ammonia concentration in the digestate was calculated based on equilibrium as proposed by anthonisen et al 1976 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term stable operation of fw digestion with cm as additive 3 1 1 performance of the dmbr ad was found to be unstable when fw or cm was used as mono substrate zhang et al 2013 our preliminary experimental results data not shown indicated that ch4 yield could be improved by 83 in comparison with the weighted average of mono digestion of fw and cm about 2 times of the ch4 yield increase 44 for the co digestion of kitchen waste and cm in comparison with the mono digestion of kitchen waste li et al 2009 in order to achieve more stable operation and higher biogas production efficiency cm was chosen as an additive for the fw digester in this study of long term continuous operation with different olrs in the dmbr table 2 biogas production gp methane production mp methane content vfas and ph in the dmbr are shown in fig 2 according to the data shown in table 2 the average ch4 yield could be calculated as 408 ml ch4 g vs approximately equivalent to 92 5 of the theoretical ch4 yield 441 ml ch4 g vs based on buswell and mueller 1952 and the elemental composition of fw and cm table 1 during stage 1 the methane content increased with time which possibly indicated that the microbial community was acclimated to gradually adapting the substrates and enrichment in the dmbr subsequently the methane content of the biogas in the dmbr fig 2 b approached the theoretical level buswell and mueller 1952 indicating that with cm as additive the feed stock could be steadily converted to biogas as shown in fig 2 c and table 2 the maximum total volatile fatty acid tvfa was only 170 mg cod l and the average output ph phoutput values changed in the range of 7 7 8 4 table 2 in the whole operation period furthermore the high alkalinity concentrations were in the range of 2 1 2 9 g caco3 l in the dmbr from day 274 to day 300 therefore the tvfa to alkalinity ratio was significantly lower than 0 4 which is considered the threshold for system stability higher values indicate unstable operating conditions in the digester li et al 2017a it can be seen from fig 2 c after day 150 only acetic acid was frequently measured at low level in the digester these results suggest that the addition of cm to fw stabilizes the anaerobic system in line with previous findings zhang et al 2013 generally methanogenesis was severely inhibited after 250 mg nh3 l was reached in reactors with unacclimated sludge yenigun and demirel 2013 however stable reactor operation was achieved with 529 mg nh3 l 1880 mg nh4 n l and a ph value of 8 31 on day 244 at a ph of 8 14 and free ammonia concentration of 283 mg nh3 l 1376 mg nh4 n l the digester could also be operated satisfactorily on day 312 therefore it can be concluded that the fw digester can operate stably even with a high olr 11 9 0 87 g cod l day and free ammonia along with long term cm addition into the dmbr which was consistent with agyeman and tao 2014 typically the nutrient balance and relatively high buffer capacity were considered the main reasons for the stability of fw and cm digestion however according to the report by el mashad and zhang 2007 the fw digester showed unstable performance at an olr of 4 g vs l day after 65 days of operation under an olr of 2 g vs l day and a substrate mixture of 48 based on vs fw and 52 cm the fluctuation may be due to the abundance and conversion ratio of the microbial community not being strong enough without long term accumulation and or very large increase in olr meanwhile only 71 3 methane production and less than 64 8 degradability were achieved after 10 days of using the same feedstock fw cm of 3 5 1 vs vs and inoculum table 1 at an organic loading of 7 1 0 5 g vs l in biochemical methane potential assays however stable digester performance and good biogas production rate and yield were obtained at an olr of 7 1 0 5 g vs l day and an hrt of 10 days those results indicated that the long term microbial community accumulation and bioaugmentation with sequential biocatalyst addition may be considered the main reason for the dmbr performance stability 3 1 2 performance of dm module the stability in the dm performance is an important prerequisite for the application of dmbr in ad which can be used to control the srt and hrt during solid waste energy recovery cayetano et al 2019 the membrane flux effluent turbidity and tmp between subsequent cleaning events from days 284 294 are shown in fig 3 the flux reached a stable performance after four efflux events then the average fluxes and effluent turbidity turned to be stable after dm layer recovery fig 3 under the condition of periodic on off of the suction pump tmp jumped to the upper bound 40 kpa and then gradually decreased in a regular way however there was also a gradual increase of the lower bound of tmp when this lower bound increased to 11 8 15 9 kpa fig 3 the dm module needed to be backwashed using biogas for the recovery of filtration flux following the authors previous experiences hu et al 2016 tang et al 2017 pictures of the dm module with a stable filtering layer showed the dm layer to be compact and thin as shown in fig s1 meanwhile compared with the morphology and sem images of a new membrane and an air dried fouled membrane without any pretreatment fig s2 the nylon mesh was not deformed which indicated that the nylon mesh was stable and durable for digestion in further practical application engineering in addition the psd of reactor sludge being larger than those of feedstock and cake sludge at the end of stage 10 fig s3 indicated that the ability retained by the dm layer was efficient and beneficial for the further degradation of the substrate and may achieve higher conversion efficiency than continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs under the same olr and hrt 3 2 high rate performance of fw digestion with cm as an additive 3 2 1 high ch4 production as shown in table 2 and fig 2 the average ch4 production of 2 71 0 32 l ch4 l day was achieved at 11 9 0 87 g cod l day with effluent vfa levels of 4 1 3 1 mg cod l which was 1 6 2 5 times of the reported ch4 production of 1 1 l ch4 l day in treating high strength fw using dmbr cayetano et al 2019 1 06 1 65 l ch4 l day in mesophilic fw fermentation using a cstr type reactor qiang et al 2012 2013 vfas accumulation up to 1 2 3 0 g l apparently hindered ch4 production in these reported studies vfas accumulation at high olrs would also bring about ph decrease which resulted in digester failure ma et al 2018 cm addition to the dmbr in the current study thus significantly improved the condition for efficient fermentation on the other hand under an operation mode of continuous feeding of diluted fw the ch4 production could be as high as 2 78 l ch4 l day at 8 6 g cod l day with effluent vfa level controlled at 402 mg cod l park et al 2018 thus it can be inferred that changing the feeding mode from step wise to continuous results in a higher ch4 production rate and stable digestion of fw and cm in dmbr which should be further investigated and confirmed in the future 3 2 2 reaction ratios and enzyme content as shown in fig 4 the reaction ratios of the four ad steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis during the initial and steady period and lignocellulase and coenzyme f420 levels during the steady period were calculated and measured respectively hydrolysis is generally the rate limiting stage in ad of organic solid waste agyeman and tao 2014 as shown in fig 4 a the hydrolysis rate increased significantly from 11 0 1 7 to 28 1 1 4 after 300 days of culture in the dmbr meanwhile the acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis rates were also increased fig 4 a which was consistent with the improvement in ch4 yield from 103 to 250 ml ch4 g cod and high ch4 production table 2 the high ch4 production correlated significantly with the coenzyme f420 activity of methanogens during anaerobic biodegradation as shown in fig 4 b the level of coenzyme f420 in dmbr was 0 23 Œºmol g vs during the steady period which can be considered a rather high value with respect to those reported in the literature for ad systems 0 006 0 49 Œºmol g vss salkinoja salonen 1982 moreover the lignocellulose degrading enzyme is composed of lignin degrading enzymes lip lac and mnps hemicellulose degrading enzymes xylanase cmcase xylitolase and xylan esterase and cellulose degrading enzymes bg eg and cbh the concentrations of lignocellulose degrading enzyme in the dmbr were similar with the lignocellulose degrading enzyme contents in cow rumen fluid xing et al 2019 which was also consistent with the hydrolysis rate in the steady period fig 4 these results suggest that the stable and high rate digestion of fw and cm under an olr of 11 9 0 87 g cod l day was mainly due to high hydrolysis and methanogenesis rates which had significant positive correlations with lignocellulase and coenzyme f420 concentrations however the hydrolysis rate was still the limiting rate for co digestion with fw and cm therefore improving the hydrolysis rate of lignocellulose biomass is still a key problem for further enhancing the bioenergy recovery efficiency of ad with fw and cm 3 2 3 degradation of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin to definite the changes of lignocellulose of fw and cm in dmbr the degradation of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was investigated fig 5 shows the xrd patterns and ftir spectra of cm fw feedstock and sludge samples from the dmbr digester at the end of stage 10 the cellulose crystallinity was approximately 72 6 for feedstock and decreased to 16 4 0 7 in the dmbr this result indicated that 56 2 of the crystalline structure of cellulose in dmbr was removed which was consistent with the 78 3 decrease in cellulose content table 3 the decreased crystallinity of cellulose might be attributed to the induced and selective enrichment of some cellulose hydrolysing microbial species with cm as an additive which will be further investigated in section 3 3 the ftir spectra of the feedstock and sludge sampling in the dmbr are shown in fig 5 b the relative absorbances of the characteristic bands of lignin at 1460 and 1155 cm 1 decreased and those at 1252 cm 1 slightly increased with digestion which indicated that the degradation of the aromatic methyl group and aromatic c h in plane deformation guaiacyl type was greater than that of the guaiacyl ring breathing with a c o group meanwhile the relative absorbances of the characteristic bands of cellulose at 1641 cm 1 decreased and those at 1387 and 1049 cm 1 increased which suggested that the bending of absorbed water decreased and was related to the main degradation component of cellulose additionally the relative absorbances of the characteristic bands of hemicellulose at 1736 cm 1 decreased which was consistent with the 58 8 decrease in hemicellulose content after digestion in the dmbr table 3 as shown in table 3 lignin content increased slightly from 11 1 g l to 11 5 0 8 g l and the lignin percentage increased from 16 1 to 29 8 2 1 which was consistent with the changes in ftir spectra fig 5 b meanwhile the cellulose level decreased significantly from 6 3 g l to 2 1 0 2 g l corresponding to a decrease in the cellulose percentage of 9 2 to 5 5 0 6 during stage 10 hrt 10 days srt 15 5 days the hemicellulose content also decreased from 3 7 g l to 2 7 0 1 g l through complex and systematic calculations the removal efficiencies of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and ts were determined to be 78 3 58 8 47 5 and 66 8 respectively table 3 indicating that the amount of lignocellulose degraded in feedstock was in the order of cellulose hemicellulose lignin the degradation efficiencies of the main components in feedstock can rival that of lignocellulosic waste using rumen microorganisms as reported by hu et al 2008 3 3 analysis of the microbial community 3 3 1 species diversity and richness the high rate and stable performance of fw fermentation with cm as additive has a closely relationship with the diversity and richness of microbial community in the dmbr system the shannon index and ace chao 1 estimator are ecological indexes estimating species diversity and richness respectively as shown in table 4 the coverage for bacteria archaea and fungi was more than 0 96 indicating that most sequences were detected that the numerical values of these factors for the bacterial and archaeal sequences and otus were larger than those of fungi indicated that bacterial and archaeal diversity and richness greatly exceeded those of fungi table 4 the number of otus and the ecological indexes for bacteria and archaea of reactor sludge were higher than those of the seed sludge which indicated that the addition of cm to fw digestion could increase the abundance and variety of bacteria and archaea however the reactor sludge had fewer otus and a lower shannon index for fungi than for seed sludge which meant that some of the fungal species faded away during the ad of fw and cm meanwhile the ace and chao 1 estimator were higher for fungi than for seed sludge which indicated that the addition of cm to fw could also increase the abundance of some fungi an explanation for the increase in bacterial archaeal and fungal abundance in the reactor sludge could be that the mixture of fw and cm created complementary substrates which in turn could stimulate bacterial archaeal and fungal growth and therefore enhance degradation and ch4 production the rich and diverse bacteria archaea and fungi in the fw and cm co digestion system after long term operation could thus provide microbiological evidence for the essential reasons of stable and high rate ch4 production achieved in the current study by dmbr operation as well as other related studies by different operation modes el mashad and zhang 2010 li et al 2009 mara√±√≥n et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 using cm as an additive 3 3 2 bacterial community as shown in fig 6 the taxonomy of the otus of seed sludge feedstock and reactor sludge was classified at the genus level and genera with a relative abundance higher than 1 were defined as the dominant genera the dominant bacterial genera in reactor sludge were syntrophomonas 13 32 candidatus cloacamonas 13 27 clostridium iii 4 41 and sedimentibacter 1 99 the members of syntrophomonas as obligately anaerobic and syntrophic bacteria have the ability to oxidize vfas such as butyrate into acetate which usually occurs in syntrophic association with a h2 using methanogen and enriches those h2 using methanogens zhang et al 2017 the relative abundance ra of syntrophomonas in seed sludge and feedstock were 0 03 and 0 01 respectively their existence in the system though not abundant in the start period might have much induced functional microorganism growth and enhanced the digestion process other functional microorganisms such as candidatus cloacamonas clostridium iii and sedimentibacter were not from the seed sludge but from cm although their ra values were very low in the feedstock they also performed important role to enhance the digestion process members of candidatus cloacamonas branching from the spirochaetes were previously found to be hydrogen producing syntrophs that are involved in the oxidation of propionate into acetate and co2 pelletier et al 2008 this reaction is thermodynamically favourable only when the h2 partial pressure remains low and occurs by coupling the propionate oxidizing reaction with the hydrogen utilizing reaction mediated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens li et al 2017b therefore the dominance of candidatus cloacamonas might be attributed to the promoted growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens of methanomassiliicoccus in the dmbr as shown in fig 6 b clostridium iii was a genus of bacteria in the family ruminococcaceae whose members are able to hydrolyse a diverse range of lignocellulosic biomass li et al 2018b sedimentibacter species are amino acid utilizing bacteria that degrade the amino acids and produce acetate propionate ammonia etc as end products imachi et al 2016 ammonia ensures sufficient buffer capacity of ad and maintains a neutral ph thus increasing the stability of ad zhang et al 2017 which is a possible main reason for the high ch4 production in the dmbr obviously using cm as an additive is worth the in situ bioaugmentation in the ad of fw the most abundant bacterial genus in feedstock was lactobacillus which belongs to the lactobacillaceae family the abundance of lactobacillus dropped as the ph increased from 4 0 to 5 0 as reported by tang et al 2017 which is in accord with the lower abundance of lactobacillus in the reactor sludge 0 05 with a ph of 8 39 than in the feedstock 84 39 moreover many genera were washed out from the seed sludge after long term ad e g methanothrix thermogutta and levilinea additionally the ra of unclassified in seed sludge feedstock and reactor sludge was 22 88 1 03 and 52 77 respectively explicitly identifying the species and metabolic pathways of those unclassified bacteria using metagenomic approaches will be beneficial to further explaining the high ch4 production and stability of fw digestion with cm as an additive that was observed in this study 3 3 3 archaeal community fig 6 b shows the methanogenic microbial composition at the genus level the majority of sequence reads were assigned to methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus methanosarcina methanothrix and methanobacterium and the five genera accounted for 70 01 11 45 8 74 2 41 and 1 03 of the total methanogenic microbial composition respectively therefore the total proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium was higher than that of acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix many researchers have indicated that acetoclastic methanogens are more sensitive to ammonium inhibition than hydrogenotrophic methanogens xie et al 2014 yang et al 2019 therefore the acetate utilizing methanogens were inhibited in the presence the high nh4 n concentrations 1880 mg l mentioned above which was consistent with the ras of methanothrix in seed sludge and feedstock of 90 14 and 0 52 respectively moreover methanosarcina is the most metabolically and physiologically versatile methanogen that can convert different substrates such as acetate h2 and methyl containing groups to ch4 kurade et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the enrichment of methanosarcina might have enhanced ch4 production by using various substrates which was in agreement with the results of ch4 production fig 2 similarly the major archaea in the reactor sludge including methanoculleus and methanomassiliicoccus were also not detected in seed sludge indicating that the cm addition enhanced the diversity of the archaeal community during the fw and cm digestion process five archaeal genera i e methanobrevibacter 85 07 methanosphaera 5 73 methanosarcina 2 78 methanimicrococcus 1 7 and methanomassiliicoccus 1 58 were dominant in the feedstock accounting for more than 96 86 of the total archaeal population potential aciduric methanogens such as methanobrevibacter and methanomassiliicoccus were responsible for bio methanation from hemicellulose li et al 2018b these characteristic bacteria and methanogens are worth using for in situ bioaugmentation in the ad of lignocellulosic biomass 3 3 4 fungal community prevalent fungal genera detected in the seed sludge feedstock and reactor sludge are shown in fig 6 c the identified fungi in reactor sludge mainly fell into five genera mucor 56 77 cladosporium 8 32 sugiyamaella 5 43 lentinula 4 36 and penicillium 3 74 the most abundant fungal species in reactor sludge was mucor circinelloides 56 55 m circinelloides can secrete a cmcase and cellulase for degrading crystalline cellulose baba et al 2005 and is one of the dominant fungal species in the feedstock 35 43 cladosporium a lignin and cellulose degrading fungal strain jin et al 2012 secretes lac and eg and is found mostly in feedstocks with a ra of 59 66 sugiyamaella xylanicola 5 41 is a xylan degrading species as reported by morais et al 2013 s xylanicola is able to grow in medium with xylan as sole carbon source and produces extracellular enzymes with xylanolytic activities moreover lentinula and penicillium contain species that degrade lignin and cellulose ohga and royse 2001 sun et al 2015 the saccharomyces genus was washed out in the reactor sludge due to a high ph of 8 0 which is not suitable for its multiplication fungi produce many different lignocellulolytic enzymes fig 4 b that are considerably important for the biodegradation of lignocellulose meanwhile the mycelia of fungi can penetrate cellulose to create pores thus increasing the available surface area for enzymatic attacks and correspondingly increasing the hydrophilicity of cellulose chen et al 2017 hu et al 2008 furthermore fungal groups can produce a large amount of h2 and co2 while decomposing cellulose which is suitable for the metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the dmbr the association of methanogens and fungi can be further attributed to cellulose degradation and result in the significant acceleration of cellulose degradation chen et al 2017 to develop an in depth understanding of the relationship between bacteria archaea and fungi the main metabolic pathways of the microbial communities were derived from measurements of end product fluxes in combination with reviews of the published literature fig 7 the cellulose hemicellulose and lignin of feedstock were mainly degraded by fungi the genera m circinelloides s xylanicola lentinula and penicillium and bacteria the genus clostridium iii the fermentation products pentose and hexose sugar can be converted to pyruvate and then produced vfas meanwhile the other products h2 and co2 can be utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium with a high tolerance of ammonium inhibition thus the biodegradation of lignocellulose further improved the ch4 yield of fw digestion with cm as additive on the other hand the protein in dmbr was mainly degraded by the genera sedimentibacter and the produced nh4 n further improved the ad buffer capacity a virtuous cycle was formed between bacteria archaea and fungi in the stable and high rate dmbr reactor therefore using cm as additive is a promising alternative for improving stability and biogas production of fw digestion due to bioaugmentation with bacteria archaea and fungi 4 conclusions a long term stable and high rate anaerobic mesophilic digestion of fw was achieved with cm as an additive in a semi continuous dmbr adding cm to the fw digestion resulted in a better c n balance increased buffer capacity and the stable dm module which were beneficial for the stability of the anaerobic process the average ch4 yield and ch4 production were 250 ml g cod and 2 71 l ch4 l day respectively at an olr of 11 9 g cod l day hrt of 10 days and srt of 15 5 days the degradation rates of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were 78 3 58 8 and 47 5 respectively as could be verified by the xrd and ftir spectra the improved reaction ratios coenzyme f420 content and lignocellulose degrading enzyme levels were significantly correlated with the high rate performance of fw and cm digestion and the microbial community in dmbr sludge the abundance and number of varieties of bacteria archaea and fungi in the dmbr reactor were determined to be enhanced with cm addition through high throughput sequencing analysis the biodegradation of lignocellulose can further improve the ch4 yield of fw digestion and produce h2 and co2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens with a high tolerance of ammonium inhibition and ammonium then improves the ad buffer capacity a virtuous cycle was formed in the fw digestion system with cm as an additive that was also responsible for the stable and high rate ch4 production by fw digestion further studies may still be required for optimizing the scheme of cm addition to achieve high rate fw digestion without large quantity of additive

18389,cow manure cm was added to a dynamic membrane bioreactor dmbr operated under anaerobic condition for enhancing food waste fw digestion for over 300 days with stepwise increase of organic loading rates olrs from 1 07 to 11 9 g cod l day at a fw cm ratio of 3 5 1 based on volatile solids the mixed liquor ph was always above 8 0 and no apparent volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation occurred even at the highest olr of 11 9 g cod l day hydraulic retention time as 10 days and solid retention time as 15 5 days correspondingly indicating a very stable operation condition which resulted in an average ch4 yield as high as 250 ml g cod and ch4 production as high as 2 71 l ch4 l day the hardly biodegradable organic components such as cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were effectively degraded by 78 3 58 8 and 47 5 respectively significantly high anaerobic digestion reaction ratios especially the hydrolysis ratio which is usually the limiting factor were calculated based on experimental results furthermore the high lignocellulase contents and coenzyme f420 levels along with the decrease of cellulose crystallinity from 72 6 to 16 4 in the feedstock provided strong evidence of an enhanced biological activity by cm addition by high throughput sequencing analysis more abundant and diverse bacterial archaeal and fungal genera were identified from the dmbr sludge with cm addition the biodegradation of lignocellulose might have produced sufficient h2 and co2 for the hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium which were highly tolerant to ammonium inhibition and then the elevated ammonium level would have provided high buffering capacity in the dmbr thus ensuring a stable condition for high rate fw digestion and ch4 production graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion cow manure dynamic membrane bioreactor dmbr food waste microbial community stable operation 1 introduction with the rapid development of the modern catering industry food waste fw production is increasing rapidly the fw production of urban areas has been predicted to increase by 44 from 2005 to 2025 due to economic and population growth particularly in developing countries melikoglu et al 2013 fw is mainly composed of carbohydrate polymers starch cellulose hemicellulose lignin proteins lipids organic acids and a smaller inorganic part xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and is an easily biodegradable organic substrate for anaerobic digestion ad due to its high potential for bio methane production dahiya et al 2018 neves et al 2009 however inhibition has always occurred when fw was digested alone at high organic loading rates olrs zhang et al 2014 to counteract the inhibition and to improve the performance of digesting fw alone wastewater brown and li 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 waste activated sludge li et al 2017a 2018a and paper waste qin et al 2018 have been used as a co substrate in batch and semi continuous tests the large amount of cow manure cm that exists has been continuously increasing as a result of livestock industry growth ti≈°ma et al 2018 due to the high buffering capacity and nutrient balance of fw digestion along with the addition of cm the methane yield and system stability of fw digesters were improved el mashad and zhang 2010 li et al 2009 mara√±√≥n et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 found that the digestion of fw with cm not only improved the maximum acceptable organic loading rates but also promoted the methane yield in semi continuous digestion li et al 2009 obtained a 44 improvement in the methane yield by adding cm to digestion of fw digesting most organic wastes with fw improves the efficiency of methane production and the stability of the system adding cm to ad of fw may enhance the stability of the anaerobic process mainly due to an increased carbon to nitrogen c n balance and an increased buffer capacity which has been reported by previous studies el mashad and zhang 2010 as we know the balance of the microbial community can also result in process stability and the microbial community structure is also shaped by substrate and operating parameters to date no study has been carried out to address the microbial community shift in fw digestion when cm is added the bioenergy conversion efficiency of digesting fw alone is not ideal because fw has a long hydraulic retention time hrt of more than 20 days a low olr of 1 6 g vs l day and a low bioenergy conversion rate of 40 70 ma et al 2018 a stable and high rate digestion of fw for efficient bioenergy conversion has significantly correlation with the applied mode batch or continuous reactor type whether digestion is performed in one or two stages and operating parameters temperature olr hrt and solid retention time srt compared with two phase ad single stage digestion requires a lower degree of control and less space which may be the reason why there are few examples of two stage processes run on a commercial scale schn√ºrer 2016 for a single phase system stable operation and a high substrate load can further reduce the occupied space a higher load requires a high biomass activity and a large biomass amount use of an anaerobic membrane reactor anmbr is considered an efficient method for methane generation from solid waste and wastewater li et al 2015 hrt and srt in anmbr can be independently controlled to extend process applicability for treating wastewaters and solid wastes however the intensive use of anmbr is limited by several critical obstacles such as low flux membrane fouling and high capital and operation costs dynamic membrane dm technology offers an innovative way to address these issues associated with conventional membrane technology tang et al 2017 cayetano et al 2019 investigated the applicability of external dm technology in the anaerobic treatment of fw for biomethane recovery their relatively high biomass retention enabled the digestion of fw with ch4 production rates of up to 1 2 l l day under an olr of 5 0 g cod l day therefore it is believed that by combining the positive effects of cm and dynamic membrane bioreactor dmbr on fw degradation and slow growing bacteria stable methane fermentation may be achieved under higher olrs although cm addition has been found effective to improve fw digestion efficiency in the aforementioned studies to our knowledge the underlying mechanisms are still unclear especially the system characteristics in long term operation and microbial community features therefore the main objective of this study was to reveal the characteristics of biogas production using a dmbr with fw as main substrate and cm as additive attentions were paid to the system stability under varied olrs in long term operation and the associated microbial community covering bacteria archaea and fungi 2 materials and methods 2 1 feedstock and inoculum the fw was manually prepared based on the characteristics of fw in china details about the processing procedures of fw are given in the authors previous study li et al 2017a the fw consisted of cabbage 20 pork meat 10 chicken meat 5 egg 5 cooking oil 1 potato 20 carrot 13 8 rice 15 noodles 10 and table salt 0 2 all based on wet weights cm was obtained from a rural area near xi an china to obtain higher methane yields the fw and cm were mixed at the optimum fw cm ratio of 3 5 1 which was based on volatile solids vs content and determined from preliminary experimental results data not shown the mixture was then crushed for 10 min using a blender and diluted with tap water to obtain feedstock with a ts content of approximately 7 0 the inoculum sludge was taken from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic reactor of a brewery plant in xi an china the physicochemical characteristics of the fw cm and inoculum used in this study were determined and they are presented in table 1 2 2 reactor configuration operation and experimental procedure a long term experiment was conducted via a dmbr with a working volume of 0 7 l as shown in fig 1 a submerged filtration module made of a nylon mesh with an equivalent aperture of 50 Œºm was used to support the growth of the dm cake layer the filtration module had a surface area of 14 4 cm2 two parallel filtering surfaces of 3 8 3 8 cm a water jacket and thermostatically controlled water baths were used to control the temperature of the reactor under mesophilic conditions 39 c feedstock was pumped from a substrate tank to the dmbr by a peristaltic pump that was maintained at 4 c a digital pressure meter sin p300 sinomeasure china was installed between the membrane module and the effluent extraction pump to record the trans membrane pressure tmp the final pressure increased gradually with time in constant flux operation mode when the final pressure increased to 16 kpa a physical cleaning method biogas backwashing with a flow rate of 10 l min for 2 min was applied for permeability recovery the experiment included ten stages which divided by different hrts from 100 to 10 days as showed in table 2 for a stable start up the reactor was initially seeded with 0 7 l of seed sludge and fed at a low olr of 1 07 g cod l day stage 1 after the initial stage which lasted for 47 days hrt was shortened gradually in the manner indicated in table 2 for accurate hrt control a suction pump was operated under prescribed on off frequency for extracting effluent from the reactor in each operation cycle 7 ml effluent was extracted and the same volume of feedstock was added to the reactor with increasing frequency of pump operation both olr and hrt were controlled and maintained in each stage as indicated in table 2 until the final stage stage 10 where olr was increased to 11 9 g cod l day and hrt was decreased to 10 days the filtration performance metrics of the dm membrane such as solid interception levels fouling rate and associated cleaning frequency were then determined accordingly meanwhile the reaction ratios and enzyme contents of dmbr sludge and cellulose hemicellulose lignin and the microbial community of feedstock and dmbr sludge were sampled and investigated and x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy were applied 2 3 lignocellulose degrading enzyme and coenzyme f420 content samples for lignocellulose degrading enzyme were centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min and then the supernatant was filtered using a syringe membrane with a 0 45 Œºm pore size the sample was diluted with deionized water to obtain absorbance readings in a linear measurement range and these readings were converted to activity in u ml the lignocellulolytic enzymes that were analysed were lignin peroxidase lip manganese peroxidase mnp laccase lac xylanase carboxymethyl cellulase cmcase xylitolase xylan esterase Œ≤ glucosidase bg endoglucanase eg and cellobiose hydrolase cbh the contents of lignocellulose degrading enzymes were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits mskbio wuhan china absorbance was measured by a multiscan spectrophotometer varioskan lux thermo fisher finland at 450 nm the concentration of conenzyme f420 in dmbr sludge was determined according to the methods described by reynolds and colleran 1987 2 4 microbial community analysis samples were collected from seed sludge feedstock and the dmbr on day 262 to characterize the diversity of microbial communities via high throughput sequencing technology dna was extracted with the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad

diversity index chao1 species richness estimator and coverage index were calculated by mothur to identify the species diversity for each sample zhang et al 2017 uchime was then used to remove chimaeric sequences and sequences with more than 97 similarity were clustered to form operation taxonomic units otus the ribosomal database project was used for alignment at a confidence threshold of

elemental composition of c h o n and s were analysed using an elemental analyser vario pyro cube elementar company germany analysis of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was conducted using an hplc

particle size distribution psds of the feedstock cake sludge and fermentation mixture were analysed using a laser granularity distribution analyser ls 230 svm beckman coulter corporation usa with a detection range of 0 4 2000 Œºm the morphological properties of the membrane and nylon mesh were observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem mla650 feg fei usa analyser according to the methods described by hu et al 2016 the crystallinity of the raw materials and residues were studied using xrd the crystallinity index is calculated from the ratio of the area of all crystalline peaks 101 10ƒ´ 021 002 and 040 to the total area basis on the corresponding xrd patterns park et al 2010 chemical bond changes were studied by ftir at 4000 400 cm 1 the free ammonia concentration in the digestate was calculated based on equilibrium as proposed by anthonisen et al 1976 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term stable operation of fw digestion with cm as additive 3 1 1 performance of the dmbr ad was found to be unstable when fw or cm was used as mono substrate zhang et al 2013 our preliminary experimental results data not shown indicated that ch4 yield could be improved by 83 in comparison with the weighted average of mono digestion of fw and cm about 2 times of the ch4 yield increase 44 for the co digestion of kitchen waste and cm in comparison with the mono digestion of kitchen waste li et al 2009 in order to achieve more stable operation and higher biogas production efficiency cm was chosen as an additive for the fw digester in this study of long term continuous operation with different olrs in the dmbr table 2 biogas production gp methane production mp methane content vfas and ph in the dmbr are shown in fig 2 according to the data shown in table 2 the average ch4 yield could be calculated as 408 ml ch4 g vs approximately equivalent to 92 5 of the theoretical ch4 yield 441 ml ch4 g vs based on buswell and mueller 1952 and the elemental composition of fw and cm table 1 during stage 1 the methane content increased with time which possibly indicated that the microbial community was acclimated to gradually adapting the substrates and enrichment in the dmbr subsequently the methane content of the biogas in the dmbr fig 2 b approached the theoretical level buswell and mueller 1952 indicating that with cm as additive the feed stock could be steadily converted to biogas as shown in fig 2 c and table 2 the maximum total volatile fatty acid tvfa was only 170 mg cod l and the average output ph phoutput values changed in the range of 7 7 8 4 table 2 in the whole operation period furthermore the high alkalinity concentrations were in the range of 2 1 2 9 g caco3 l in the dmbr from day 274 to day 300 therefore the tvfa to alkalinity ratio was significantly lower than 0 4 which is considered the threshold for system stability higher values indicate unstable operating conditions in the digester li et al 2017a it can be seen from fig 2 c after day 150 only acetic acid was frequently measured at low level in the digester these results suggest that the addition of cm to fw stabilizes the anaerobic system in line with previous findings zhang et al 2013 generally methanogenesis was severely inhibited after 250 mg nh3 l was reached in reactors with unacclimated sludge yenigun and demirel 2013 however stable reactor operation was achieved with 529 mg nh3 l 1880 mg nh4 n l and a ph value of 8 31 on day 244 at a ph of 8 14 and free ammonia concentration of 283 mg nh3 l 1376 mg nh4 n l the digester could also be operated satisfactorily on day 312 therefore it can be concluded that the fw digester can operate stably even with a high olr 11 9 0 87 g cod l day and free ammonia along with long term cm addition into the dmbr which was consistent with agyeman and tao 2014 typically the nutrient balance and relatively high buffer capacity were considered the main reasons for the stability of fw and cm digestion however according to the report by el mashad and zhang 2007 the fw digester showed unstable performance at an olr of 4 g vs l day after 65 days of operation under an olr of 2 g vs l day and a substrate mixture of 48 based on vs fw and 52 cm the fluctuation may be due to the abundance and conversion ratio of the microbial community not being strong enough without long term accumulation and or very large increase in olr meanwhile only 71 3 methane production and less than 64 8 degradability were achieved after 10 days of using the same feedstock fw cm of 3 5 1 vs vs and inoculum table 1 at an organic loading of 7 1 0 5 g vs l in biochemical methane potential assays however stable digester performance and good biogas production rate and yield were obtained at an olr of 7 1 0 5 g vs l day and an hrt of 10 days those results indicated that the long term microbial community accumulation and bioaugmentation with sequential biocatalyst addition may be considered the main reason for the dmbr performance stability 3 1 2 performance of dm module the stability in the dm performance is an important prerequisite for the application of dmbr in ad which can be used to control the srt and hrt during solid waste energy recovery cayetano et al 2019 the membrane flux effluent turbidity and tmp between subsequent cleaning events from days 284 294 are shown in fig 3 the flux reached a stable performance after four efflux events then the average fluxes and effluent turbidity turned to be stable after dm layer recovery fig 3 under the condition of periodic on off of the suction pump tmp jumped to the upper bound 40 kpa and then gradually decreased in a regular way however there was also a gradual increase of the lower bound of tmp when this lower bound increased to 11 8 15 9 kpa fig 3 the dm module needed to be backwashed using biogas for the recovery of filtration flux following the authors previous experiences hu et al 2016 tang et al 2017 pictures of the dm module with a stable filtering layer showed the dm layer to be compact and thin as shown in fig s1 meanwhile compared with the morphology and sem images of a new membrane and an air dried fouled membrane without any pretreatment fig s2 the nylon mesh was not deformed which indicated that the nylon mesh was stable and durable for digestion in further practical application engineering in addition the psd of reactor sludge being larger than those of feedstock and cake sludge at the end of stage 10 fig s3 indicated that the ability retained by the dm layer was efficient and beneficial for the further degradation of the substrate and may achieve higher conversion efficiency than continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs under the same olr and hrt 3 2 high rate performance of fw digestion with cm as an additive 3 2 1 high ch4 production as shown in table 2 and fig 2 the average ch4 production of 2 71 0 32 l ch4 l day was achieved at 11 9 0 87 g cod l day with effluent vfa levels of 4 1 3 1 mg cod l which was 1 6 2 5 times of the reported ch4 production of 1 1 l ch4 l day in treating high strength fw using dmbr cayetano et al 2019 1 06 1 65 l ch4 l day in mesophilic fw fermentation using a cstr type reactor qiang et al 2012 2013 vfas accumulation up to 1 2 3 0 g l apparently hindered ch4 production in these reported studies vfas accumulation at high olrs would also bring about ph decrease which resulted in digester failure ma et al 2018 cm addition to the dmbr in the current study thus significantly improved the condition for efficient fermentation on the other hand under an operation mode of continuous feeding of diluted fw the ch4 production could be as high as 2 78 l ch4 l day at 8 6 g cod l day with effluent vfa level controlled at 402 mg cod l park et al 2018 thus it can be inferred that changing the feeding mode from step wise to continuous results in a higher ch4 production rate and stable digestion of fw and cm in dmbr which should be further investigated and confirmed in the future 3 2 2 reaction ratios and enzyme content as shown in fig 4 the reaction ratios of the four ad steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis during the initial and steady period and lignocellulase and coenzyme f420 levels during the steady period were calculated and measured respectively hydrolysis is generally the rate limiting stage in ad of organic solid waste agyeman and tao 2014 as shown in fig 4 a the hydrolysis rate increased significantly from 11 0 1 7 to 28 1 1 4 after 300 days of culture in the dmbr meanwhile the acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis rates were also increased fig 4 a which was consistent with the improvement in ch4 yield from 103 to 250 ml ch4 g cod and high ch4 production table 2 the high ch4 production correlated significantly with the coenzyme f420 activity of methanogens during anaerobic biodegradation as shown in fig 4 b the level of coenzyme f420 in dmbr was 0 23 Œºmol g vs during the steady period which can be considered a rather high value with respect to those reported in the literature for ad systems 0 006 0 49 Œºmol g vss salkinoja salonen 1982 moreover the lignocellulose degrading enzyme is composed of lignin degrading enzymes lip lac and mnps hemicellulose degrading enzymes xylanase cmcase xylitolase and xylan esterase and cellulose degrading enzymes bg eg and cbh the concentrations of lignocellulose degrading enzyme in the dmbr were similar with the lignocellulose degrading enzyme contents in cow rumen fluid xing et al 2019 which was also consistent with the hydrolysis rate in the steady period fig 4 these results suggest that the stable and high rate digestion of fw and cm under an olr of 11 9 0 87 g cod l day was mainly due to high hydrolysis and methanogenesis rates which had significant positive correlations with lignocellulase and coenzyme f420 concentrations however the hydrolysis rate was still the limiting rate for co digestion with fw and cm therefore improving the hydrolysis rate of lignocellulose biomass is still a key problem for further enhancing the bioenergy recovery efficiency of ad with fw and cm 3 2 3 degradation of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin to definite the changes of lignocellulose of fw and cm in dmbr the degradation of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was investigated fig 5 shows the xrd patterns and ftir spectra of cm fw feedstock and sludge samples from the dmbr digester at the end of stage 10 the cellulose crystallinity was approximately 72 6 for feedstock and decreased to 16 4 0 7 in the dmbr this result indicated that 56 2 of the crystalline structure of cellulose in dmbr was removed which was consistent with the 78 3 decrease in cellulose content table 3 the decreased crystallinity of cellulose might be attributed to the induced and selective enrichment of some cellulose hydrolysing microbial species with cm as an additive which will be further investigated in section 3 3 the ftir spectra of the feedstock and sludge sampling in the dmbr are shown in fig 5 b the relative absorbances of the characteristic bands of lignin at 1460 and 1155 cm 1 decreased and those at 1252 cm 1 slightly increased with digestion which indicated that the degradation of the aromatic methyl group and aromatic c h in plane deformation guaiacyl type was greater than that of the guaiacyl ring breathing with a c o group meanwhile the relative absorbances of the characteristic bands of cellulose at 1641 cm 1 decreased and those at 1387 and 1049 cm 1 increased which suggested that the bending of absorbed water decreased and was related to the main degradation component of cellulose additionally the relative absorbances of the characteristic bands of hemicellulose at 1736 cm 1 decreased which was consistent with the 58 8 decrease in hemicellulose content after digestion in the dmbr table 3 as shown in table 3 lignin content increased slightly from 11 1 g l to 11 5 0 8 g l and the lignin percentage increased from 16 1 to 29 8 2 1 which was consistent with the changes in ftir spectra fig 5 b meanwhile the cellulose level decreased significantly from 6 3 g l to 2 1 0 2 g l corresponding to a decrease in the cellulose percentage of 9 2 to 5 5 0 6 during stage 10 hrt 10 days srt 15 5 days the hemicellulose content also decreased from 3 7 g l to 2 7 0 1 g l through complex and systematic calculations the removal efficiencies of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and ts were determined to be 78 3 58 8 47 5 and 66 8 respectively table 3 indicating that the amount of lignocellulose degraded in feedstock was in the order of cellulose hemicellulose lignin the degradation efficiencies of the main components in feedstock can rival that of lignocellulosic waste using rumen microorganisms as reported by hu et al 2008 3 3 analysis of the microbial community 3 3 1 species diversity and richness the high rate and stable performance of fw fermentation with cm as additive has a closely relationship with the diversity and richness of microbial community in the dmbr system the shannon index and ace chao 1 estimator are ecological indexes estimating species diversity and richness respectively as shown in table 4 the coverage for bacteria archaea and fungi was more than 0 96 indicating that most sequences were detected that the numerical values of these factors for the bacterial and archaeal sequences and otus were larger than those of fungi indicated that bacterial and archaeal diversity and richness greatly exceeded those of fungi table 4 the number of otus and the ecological indexes for bacteria and archaea of reactor sludge were higher than those of the seed sludge which indicated that the addition of cm to fw digestion could increase the abundance and variety of bacteria and archaea however the reactor sludge had fewer otus and a lower shannon index for fungi than for seed sludge which meant that some of the fungal species faded away during the ad of fw and cm meanwhile the ace and chao 1 estimator were higher for fungi than for seed sludge which indicated that the addition of cm to fw could also increase the abundance of some fungi an explanation for the increase in bacterial archaeal and fungal abundance in the reactor sludge could be that the mixture of fw and cm created complementary substrates which in turn could stimulate bacterial archaeal and fungal growth and therefore enhance degradation and ch4 production the rich and diverse bacteria archaea and fungi in the fw and cm co digestion system after long term operation could thus provide microbiological evidence for the essential reasons of stable and high rate ch4 production achieved in the current study by dmbr operation as well as other related studies by different operation modes el mashad and zhang 2010 li et al 2009 mara√±√≥n et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 using cm as an additive 3 3 2 bacterial community as shown in fig 6 the taxonomy of the otus of seed sludge feedstock and reactor sludge was classified at the genus level and genera with a relative abundance higher than 1 were defined as the dominant genera the dominant bacterial genera in reactor sludge were syntrophomonas 13 32 candidatus cloacamonas 13 27 clostridium iii 4 41 and sedimentibacter 1 99 the members of syntrophomonas as obligately anaerobic and syntrophic bacteria have the ability to oxidize vfas such as butyrate into acetate which usually occurs in syntrophic association with a h2 using methanogen and enriches those h2 using methanogens zhang et al 2017 the relative abundance ra of syntrophomonas in seed sludge and feedstock were 0 03 and 0 01 respectively their existence in the system though not abundant in the start period might have much induced functional microorganism growth and enhanced the digestion process other functional microorganisms such as candidatus cloacamonas clostridium iii and sedimentibacter were not from the seed sludge but from cm although their ra values were very low in the feedstock they also performed important role to enhance the digestion process members of candidatus cloacamonas branching from the spirochaetes were previously found to be hydrogen producing syntrophs that are involved in the oxidation of propionate into acetate and co2 pelletier et al 2008 this reaction is thermodynamically favourable only when the h2 partial pressure remains low and occurs by coupling the propionate oxidizing reaction with the hydrogen utilizing reaction mediated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens li et al 2017b therefore the dominance of candidatus cloacamonas might be attributed to the promoted growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens of methanomassiliicoccus in the dmbr as shown in fig 6 b clostridium iii was a genus of bacteria in the family ruminococcaceae whose members are able to hydrolyse a diverse range of lignocellulosic biomass li et al 2018b sedimentibacter species are amino acid utilizing bacteria that degrade the amino acids and produce acetate propionate ammonia etc as end products imachi et al 2016 ammonia ensures sufficient buffer capacity of ad and maintains a neutral ph thus increasing the stability of ad zhang et al 2017 which is a possible main reason for the high ch4 production in the dmbr obviously using cm as an additive is worth the in situ bioaugmentation in the ad of fw the most abundant bacterial genus in feedstock was lactobacillus which belongs to the lactobacillaceae family the abundance of lactobacillus dropped as the ph increased from 4 0 to 5 0 as reported by tang et al 2017 which is in accord with the lower abundance of lactobacillus in the reactor sludge 0 05 with a ph of 8 39 than in the feedstock 84 39 moreover many genera were washed out from the seed sludge after long term ad e g methanothrix thermogutta and levilinea additionally the ra of unclassified in seed sludge feedstock and reactor sludge was 22 88 1 03 and 52 77 respectively explicitly identifying the species and metabolic pathways of those unclassified bacteria using metagenomic approaches will be beneficial to further explaining the high ch4 production and stability of fw digestion with cm as an additive that was observed in this study 3 3 3 archaeal community fig 6 b shows the methanogenic microbial composition at the genus level the majority of sequence reads were assigned to methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus methanosarcina methanothrix and methanobacterium and the five genera accounted for 70 01 11 45 8 74 2 41 and 1 03 of the total methanogenic microbial composition respectively therefore the total proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium was higher than that of acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix many researchers have indicated that acetoclastic methanogens are more sensitive to ammonium inhibition than hydrogenotrophic methanogens xie et al 2014 yang et al 2019 therefore the acetate utilizing methanogens were inhibited in the presence the high nh4 n concentrations 1880 mg l mentioned above which was consistent with the ras of methanothrix in seed sludge and feedstock of 90 14 and 0 52 respectively moreover methanosarcina is the most metabolically and physiologically versatile methanogen that can convert different substrates such as acetate h2 and methyl containing groups to ch4 kurade et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the enrichment of methanosarcina might have enhanced ch4 production by using various substrates which was in agreement with the results of ch4 production fig 2 similarly the major archaea in the reactor sludge including methanoculleus and methanomassiliicoccus were also not detected in seed sludge indicating that the cm addition enhanced the diversity of the archaeal community during the fw and cm digestion process five archaeal genera i e methanobrevibacter 85 07 methanosphaera 5 73 methanosarcina 2 78 methanimicrococcus 1 7 and methanomassiliicoccus 1 58 were dominant in the feedstock accounting for more than 96 86 of the total archaeal population potential aciduric methanogens such as methanobrevibacter and methanomassiliicoccus were responsible for bio methanation from hemicellulose li et al 2018b these characteristic bacteria and methanogens are worth using for in situ bioaugmentation in the ad of lignocellulosic biomass 3 3 4 fungal community prevalent fungal genera detected in the seed sludge feedstock and reactor sludge are shown in fig 6 c the identified fungi in reactor sludge mainly fell into five genera mucor 56 77 cladosporium 8 32 sugiyamaella 5 43 lentinula 4 36 and penicillium 3 74 the most abundant fungal species in reactor sludge was mucor circinelloides 56 55 m circinelloides can secrete a cmcase and cellulase for degrading crystalline cellulose baba et al 2005 and is one of the dominant fungal species in the feedstock 35 43 cladosporium a lignin and cellulose degrading fungal strain jin et al 2012 secretes lac and eg and is found mostly in feedstocks with a ra of 59 66 sugiyamaella xylanicola 5 41 is a xylan degrading species as reported by morais et al 2013 s xylanicola is able to grow in medium with xylan as sole carbon source and produces extracellular enzymes with xylanolytic activities moreover lentinula and penicillium contain species that degrade lignin and cellulose ohga and royse 2001 sun et al 2015 the saccharomyces genus was washed out in the reactor sludge due to a high ph of 8 0 which is not suitable for its multiplication fungi produce many different lignocellulolytic enzymes fig 4 b that are considerably important for the biodegradation of lignocellulose meanwhile the mycelia of fungi can penetrate cellulose to create pores thus increasing the available surface area for enzymatic attacks and correspondingly increasing the hydrophilicity of cellulose chen et al 2017 hu et al 2008 furthermore fungal groups can produce a large amount of h2 and co2 while decomposing cellulose which is suitable for the metabolism of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the dmbr the association of methanogens and fungi can be further attributed to cellulose degradation and result in the significant acceleration of cellulose degradation chen et al 2017 to develop an in depth understanding of the relationship between bacteria archaea and fungi the main metabolic pathways of the microbial communities were derived from measurements of end product fluxes in combination with reviews of the published literature fig 7 the cellulose hemicellulose and lignin of feedstock were mainly degraded by fungi the genera m circinelloides s xylanicola lentinula and penicillium and bacteria the genus clostridium iii the fermentation products pentose and hexose sugar can be converted to pyruvate and then produced vfas meanwhile the other products h2 and co2 can be utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanoculleus methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium with a high tolerance of ammonium inhibition thus the biodegradation of lignocellulose further improved the ch4 yield of fw digestion with cm as additive on the other hand the protein in dmbr was mainly degraded by the genera sedimentibacter and the produced nh4 n further improved the ad buffer capacity a virtuous cycle was formed between bacteria archaea and fungi in the stable and high rate dmbr reactor therefore using cm as additive is a promising alternative for improving stability and biogas production of fw digestion due to bioaugmentation with bacteria archaea and fungi 4 conclusions a long term stable and high rate anaerobic mesophilic digestion of fw was achieved with cm as an additive in a semi continuous dmbr adding cm to the fw digestion resulted in a better c n balance increased buffer capacity and the stable dm module which were beneficial for the stability of the anaerobic process the average ch4 yield and ch4 production were 250 ml g cod and 2 71 l ch4 l day respectively at an olr of 11 9 g cod l day hrt of 10 days and srt of 15 5 days the degradation rates of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin were 78 3 58 8 and 47 5 respectively as could be verified by the xrd and ftir spectra the improved reaction ratios coenzyme f420 content and lignocellulose degrading enzyme levels were significantly correlated with the high rate performance of fw and cm digestion and the microbial community in dmbr sludge the abundance and number of varieties of bacteria archaea and fungi in the dmbr reactor were determined to be enhanced with cm addition through high throughput sequencing analysis the biodegradation of lignocellulose can further improve the ch4 yield of fw digestion and produce h2 and co2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogens with a high tolerance of ammonium inhibition and ammonium then improves the ad buffer capacity a virtuous cycle was formed in the fw digestion system with cm as an additive that was also responsible for the stable and high rate ch4 production by fw digestion further studies may still be required for optimizing the scheme of cm addition to achieve high rate fw digestion without large quantity of additive
