10500,film mulching has been used widely to improve field productivity in rainfed agricultural ecosystems in semiarid areas of china during 2013 2016 we evaluated the effects of different film mulching methods on soil water water productivity crop yield and economic benefits in a semiarid area of southern ningxia china five treatments were tested i a control method consisting of conventional flat planting without mulching ck ii alternate mulching and bare rows without ridges and planting in mulched rows p iii maize planted in furrows separated by consecutive plastic film mulched ridges s iv maize planted in furrows separated by alternating large and small plastic film mulched ridges d and v maize planted in furrows with large plastic film mulched ridges alternating with flat plastic film mulched spaces r after four years of continuous treatment the results indicated that d and s treatments significantly increased soil water content at depths of 0 200 cm during the early growth stage but the increases in the soil water content were lower later in the maize growth process the grain yield increases were affected by the different hydrothermal conditions in various years on average mulching increased grain yield by 31 33 and biomass accumulation by 22 48 across four seasons film mulching significantly p 0 05 increased water use efficiency and precipitation use efficiency especially in d by 34 56 and 43 09 and s by 35 25 and 42 79 respectively mulching changed the crop water consumption characteristics and resulted in higher crop water productivity due to an improved hydro thermal balance especially during the vegetative 30 90 days and pre reproductive 90 120 days growth stages which may account for yield increase effects in this system in addition the results suggested that the mulching system achieves higher economic returns than ck especially the s treatment 7538 ha 1 representing an average of 29 19 higher than ck the s treatment could serve as a promising adaptive management method for increasing maize productivity to cope with food security and climate change in this semi arid area with limited and erratic precipitation keywords dryland farming area economic benefits film mulching grain yield soil water use 1 introduction in china dryland farming is practiced on approximately one third of the arable land about 40 of which is situated on the loess plateau zhang et al 2018 this dryland farming area is one of the major grain producing regions in china the crop productivity is low and unstable for many years due to the sparse and uneven distribution of the annual precipitation in this region wang et al 2012 gan et al 2013 thus the local farmers in this area are adversely affected by low income and poverty hence the development status of this region should be improved by maximizing the utilization of precipitation reducing water losses by evaporation addressing inefficient rainwater use and synchronizing plant growth with the availability of rainwater many field techniques and management strategies have been developed over the last 30 years to alleviate water deficits and unstable crop productivity in semiarid regions gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in particular film mulching is regarded as an effective and adaptive field management for providing a favorable water and thermal environment for crop growth mo et al 2018 many studies have shown that film mulching can significantly increase the crop yield in semiarid regions mainly because of the increased availability of soil water liu et al 2010 gao et al 2014 adhikari et al 2016 farzi et al 2017 moreover film mulching can significantly improve water use efficiency wue by enhancing crop water consumption characteristics during plant growth ramakrishna et al 2006 demonstrated that mulching greatly increased the transpiration ratio by increasing crop transpiration during the reproductive growth stage which was conducive to the accumulation of dry matter in addition film mulching can effectively promote the movement of water from the deep soil to the topsoil via capillarity as well as via vapor transfer such movement can maintain relatively stable water contents in the topsoil to facilitate a beneficial soil crop water cycle liu et al 2010 however some studies have shown that the greater crop yield obtained under mulching is due to the high consumption of soil water and organic carbon nawaz et al 2016 lee et al 2019 as a consequence the soil quality may be severely degraded after continuous mulching for many years which is not conducive to the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in semiarid regions chakraborty et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 recently the following film mulching techniques have been developed and applied extensively during crop production in semiarid areas 1 flat planting mulching wang et al 2017 2 ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting with half mulching gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 and 3 a recently developed technique involving double ridges and furrows with complete mulching liu et al 2014 mo et al 2018 these techniques tend to increase the grain yield and economic benefit compared with conventional cultivation zhou et al 2009 cuello et al 2015 but they still have the following shortcomings the flat planting mulching technique cannot effectively accumulate rainfall of 10 mm for crop growth use wang et al 2011 the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting with half mulching technique has little or no effect on increasing the crop yield and wue and these parameters may even decrease during rainy or wet years ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the application of double ridges and furrows with complete mulching consumes an excessive amount of soil water from the deep layer under continuous cropping thereby causing soil degradation and reducing the yield in addition the use of large quantities of film incurs high costs and requires large labor inputs as well as causing white pollution due to residual plastics zhou et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 steinmetz et al 2016 thus some other new film mulching method must be developed to satisfy the needs of dry land agriculture for semiarid areas in this study a new film mulching method was created and hypothesized that this new film mulching method may exert economic environmental and agronomic benefits as expected in semiarid area however it is still unclear how the new mulching method would exert its effects compared to existing mulching techniques under local climatic and soil circumstance in the semiarid environment therefore we selected four existing mulching methods including flat mulching ridge and furrow mulching large and small ridges with full mulching and zero mulching together with the new mulching method to test the soil water status water productivity and economic benefits at a typical semiarid rainfed site of northwest china from 2013 to 2016 the objectives were as follows 1 to evaluate the effects of different mulching methods on soil water content water distribution and water consumption 2 to investigate the differences in grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefits under the different mulching methods and 3 to select an optimal mulching method for dryland farming regions of the loess plateau china 2 materials and

ridge furrow rainwater harvesting planting diagrams of each plastic film mulching method are presented in fig 1 maize dafeng 30 was sown at a rate of 75 000 plants ha 1 during middle to late april in 2013 2016 using a hole sowing fertilization diameter 3 cm machine base fertilizer comprising 150 kg n ha 1 and 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 was applied using a hole sowing fertilization machine after planting in addition 150 kg n ha 1 was applied as a topdressing in late june with a fertilization depth of 4 5 cm maize was harvested from the plots in late september or early october during 2013 2016 after harvesting the maize stalks were removed but the film mulch was retained in the same location in each of the plots before clearing the film approximately 30 days before the subsequent sowing operation late march in each experimental year and with maize in the next month mid to late april the methods used in practice were the same during each experimental year 2013 2016 irrigation was not applied in the experimental years pests and weeds were controlled during each crop growth season 2 3 sampling and measurement from 2013 2016 the gravimetric soil water content was measured at intervals of 20 cm to a depth of 200 cm at 30 day intervals during each crop growth season ferraro and ghersa 2007 a hand held auger ø 54 mm was used to collect soil samples from each depth soil samples were collected at three locations per plot for the ridge and furrow treatments r s and d i e in the middle of a ridge and furrow and between two plants in same row for the p treatment one core was sampled between two plants and two from the middle of two rows with one being in the film and the other not in the film for ck two cores were sampled from the middle of the two rows and one from the middle of two plants soil water contents was calculated as the mean value of the three different sampling positions at the time of harvesting during 2013 2016 the bulk density was measured using the cutting rings soil core methodology volume 100 cm3 inner diameter 5 05 cm nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences 1978 based on three random samples collected from each plot the soil was sampled at intervals of 20 cm to a depth of 200 cm the soil samples were dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 c the soil water storage during the growth stages was calculated using eq 1 as described by zhang et al 2017 1 s w i n h i p i b i 10 where s w mm is the average soil moisture h i cm is the thickness of each measured soil layer d i g cm 3 is the soil bulk density of each different soil layer b i is the soil water content of each soil layer n is the number of soil layers and i 20 40 200 the crop et was estimated using the soil water balance equation as follows wei et

evaporation and plant transpiration with transpiration being the larger component of et the groundwater table at the experimental site was located at a depth of approximately 80 m below the surface so upward flow into the roots was not considered in this area the experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions no rainstorms occurred during the experimental period and high ridges surrounded each plot to prevent the occurrence of runoff the local rainfall was generally low and did not cause underground drainage at depths exceeding 200 cm we therefore calculated et using the following simple equation 3 e t p δ s w the plant dry biomass was estimated by randomly selecting three maize plants per plot at intervals of 30 days throughout the growing season the samples were dried to a constant weight at 75 c in an oven the maize was harvested at maturity and 10 ears were randomly selected from the inner rows to determine the yield components i e the kernel number per ear kernel weight per ear and 100 kernel weight all the ears from three representative rows equal to 20 m2 were collected manually the threshed maize seeds were then air dried and the grain yield was calculated at a moisture content of 14 w w the wue and precipitation water use efficiency pue were calculated using eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 w u e y e t 5 p u e y p where w u e kg ha 1 mm 1 is the water use

data obtained from each sampling event were analyzed separately mean values from different treatments were compared using the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 if f tests were significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water content the vertical distribution of the soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil depth in different maize growth stages varied with the amount of rainfall and water consumption during the experimental years fig 2 during the early growth stage 0 30 days the soil water content values for the 0 200 cm depth were higher under all of the mulching treatments than for ck with an average increase of 8 77 during 2013 2016 during days 30 60 as the rainfall increased the soil water contents values were significantly higher p 0 05 under d and s than the other treatments with average increases of 6 81 and 9 12 respectively the most vigorous growth period for maize occurred during days 60 90 when water consumption increased and soil water content decreased for all of the treatments in each year except in 2013 in a particularly wet year i e when rainfall was extremely high 267 3 mm in 2013 and very low 29 0 mm in 2015 r and s significantly increased with regard to soil water contents p 0 05 by 4 37 and 5 17 respectively compared with the average of the other treatments i e d p and ck in the later growth stage days 90 120 soil water content values under the mulching treatments were significantly lower p 0 05 than that with ck in the deep soil layer 60 200 cm during 2013 2014 and 2016 with average decreases of 7 12 6 62 and 5 98 for d p and s respectively soil water content was 4 16 higher with the mulching treatments than ck during 2015 due to the high rainfall 86 1 mm which was significantly higher than that in other years but there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the four film treatments after harvesting 160 days the average soil water content in the 0 100 cm layer was 7 14 higher with mulching than ck for all years except 2016 and it was lower under s than the other mulching treatments with an average decrease of 2 44 in 2016 there was little rainfall to supplement the soil moisture so the soil water contents measurements were all significantly lower under the film mulching treatments than under ck by 12 43 p 0 05 3 2 field water consumption in different growth stages δet similar to soil water content field water consumption was clearly differentially affected by the precipitation and crop growth across the period fig 3 during the early stage 0 30 days the average field water consumption was 25 23 lower under all of the mulching treatments compared with ck for each year compared with p and r the field water consumption under s was 25 15 and 11 66 lower p 0 05 respectively during days 0 30 during days 30 60 the growth of maize was more rapid with mulching than ck thereby increasing the average water consumption by 29 37 such that the average field water consumption was 14 38 higher under d and s compared with p and r during the fast growing period from days 60 90 the field water consumption rates were higher than those during days 0 60 such that the order under the different treatments was d s p r ck the average field water consumption values under d and s were 12 46 p 0 05 and 7 33 higher than those under p and r respectively during days 90 120 the field water consumption decreased gradually and the effects of mulching also diminished the average field water consumption rates under d p and s were 4 41 0 30 and 5 60 higher respectively than that under ck during the filling stage 120 150 days field water consumption decreased dramatically with each treatment but the rates under mulching were all lower than that under ck i e 5 68 and 0 98 lower under d and s respectively 3 3 crop water productivity wp in different growth stages wp increased as the dry matter accumulated during the maize growth stages table 3 in the early growth stage 0 30 and 30 60 days the mulching treatments had significant p 0 05 effects on wp in each year 2013 2016 compared with ck the increases in the average wp were 157 92 93 64 58 86 and 129 45 under d p r and s respectively during days 60 90 in the rapid growth period for maize the wp values differed little among the treatments such that the average wp was only 23 91 higher under the mulching treatments than ck the wp values under d and s were 9 04 and 14 08 higher respectively compared with that under r p 0 05 during days 90 120 the wp values under d and s were 42 67 and 41 13 higher respectively than that under ck p 0 05 grain filling led to the rapid accumulation of dry matter during days 120 150 thereby resulting in high wp values average 188 70 kg ha 1 mm 1 for each year except for 2016 when the order of the treatments was r p ck d s during 2013 2015 the wp values under r and p were 43 31 and 71 08 higher respectively than the average under d and s p 0 05 3 4 biomass accumulation the mulching treatments yielded significantly higher biomass accumulation values p 0 05 compared with ck during the early growth stage 0 60 days fig 4 with average increases of 179 12 105 43 73 67 and 141 27 under d p r and s respectively more than 74 22 of the biomass yield accumulated during the maize growth period from days 60 120 the biomass accumulation values were significantly p 0 05 higher under d and s than the other treatments compared with ck the average accumulated biomass values were 61 68 38 95 23 72 and 56 30 higher under d f r and s respectively the average accumulated biomass in each year at maize crop maturity 150 days followed the order d s p r ck the average accumulated biomass rates were 17 11 and 14 30 higher under d and s respectively compared with the average under the other treatments p 0 05 3 5 grain yield et wue and pue mulching increased grain yields expect under r in 2013 during 2013 2016 fig 5 such that the average yields under the five treatments followed the order d s p r ck the average grain yields under r s d and p were 22 50 38 85 39 11 and 24 86 higher respectively than that under ck p 0 05 the average maize yield under d and s was 12 37 higher than the average under r and p the yield under r is significantly correlated with the amount of rainfall during the growth period i e the yield under r during 2013 was 21 1 lower than the average under s d and p whereas it was significantly higher than that under p in 2014 but not significantly different from the average during 2015 2016 the maize yields in 2013 2016 followed the order 2013 2014 2015 2016 under different photothermal and rainfall conditions the effects of mulching on the yield followed the order 2016 2014 2015 2013 as shown in fig 3 et was closely related to the rainfall each year 2013 2016 in the dry years 2014 and 2016 et did not vary among the mulching treatments but the et values were higher under all of the mulching treatments than ck i e 6 74 and 9 53 higher in 2014 and 2016 respectively in the rainy year 2013 et was 8 30 lower under p than ck and that under p was 15 96 13 22 and 12 26 lower than those under s r and d respectively p 0 05 in the normal rainfall year 2015 the et values were all lower under the mulching treatments than ck average 4 22 lower and that under s was the lowest among the mulching treatments similar to the grain yield the wue and pue values were strongly affected by mulching especially under s and d in the four years such that the average wue values were 42 78 and 43 11 higher under s and d respectively p 0 05 and the average pue values were 35 24 and 35 03 higher table 4 3 6 economic benefit mulching significantly affected economic benefits table 5 the average output values under the different treatments followed the order d r p s ck mulching increased the total income by improving the maize yield the average input values in the four years followed the order d s p r ck where r and p required less film than d and s the net incomes under s r d and p were 29 19 15 41 7 11 and 2 93 higher respectively than that under ck and s yielded the highest net income 7538 ha 1 however the net incomes under the mulching treatments were negatively correlated with the amount of rainfall and there was no significant increase 3 67 lower under r in the rainy year i e 594 1 mm during the growth period in 2013 similarly the output input o i ratios were 22 10 and 5 65 lower under the mulching treatments than ck in 2013 and 2015 respectively when the amounts of rainfall were lower in addition the o i ratio was 9 23 higher under r than ck in 2014 in 2016 the o i ratios under s r and p were 11 28 12 03 and 3 01 higher respectively than that under ck 4 discussion mulching induced water content changes in agricultural soil have been widely reported across the literature in general under water environments with spring droughts the use of film mulching is popular in order to provide a favorable water condition for seedling establishment in spring sown crops in semiarid areas gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in our study film mulching could significantly improve soil water conditions by decreasing ineffective evaporation during the early growth stage which provides a base for successful seedling establishment and canopy development this is crucial for grain yields in dry farming regions where farmers often fail to ensure desirable seedling stands due to limited rainfall in the early spring zhang et al 2017 and mo et al 2018 found that increasing the mulching area further amplified the soil moisture contents advantage in each growth seasons similarly in our study d and s yielded higher soil moisture content values than p and r our results demonstrated that r and s could effectively compensate for the soil water consumed by the furrow and ridge rainwater collection system especially in drought years comparatively although the d treatment employs the furrow and ridge system it typically leads to reduced soil water content due to its high water consumption caused by rapid growth and development of maize at high soil temperatures data not shown moreover we found that mulching treatment is capable of facilitating the roots to utilize soil water from deep layers 60 200 cm that resulted in a water deficit at the maturity stage especially during growing season dry spells furthermore root and shoot biomass growth under the mulching system can also significantly affect soil water content over a growth season mo et al 2017 and the effect was correlated with the amount and distribution of rainfall in different years in our study increased biomass and grain yields fig 5 in the d and s treatments could partially explain their lower measurements of soil water content in deep layers than in the r and p fig 2 especially at the late reproductive stage flowering to maturity previous studies have shown that film mulching can significantly enhancing crop dry matter accumulation by changing crop field water consumption patterns during growth period gan et al 2013 jiang and li 2015 adhikari et al 2016 filipović et al 2016 steinmetz et al 2016 similar results were obtained in our experiments where mulching plots especially the large mulching area treatments d and s significantly reduced et and increased wp during the early growth stage mulching also retained more water in the soil during the low water requirement periods for maize thereby allowing its use during the rapid growth period however film mulching provided a favorable water thermal environment for obtaining a high yield thereby leading to large water consumption especially in the vigorous vegetative growth stage 60 90 days such that the average increase was 26 74 compared with ck mo et al 2018 showed that a full mulching system improved the wue and wp values more than half or non mulching treatments in semiarid areas similarly we found that compared with p and r the d and s significantly increased the wp and wue values in the maize growth stage this is most likely because the d and s treatments providing a favorable thermal condition for maize growth which in turn significantly accelerated the growth process and increased crop transpiration zhang et al 2017 in addition our study also showed that mulching could effectively improving wp during the growth season table 3 especially during the vegetative 30 90 days and pre reproductive 90 120 days growth periods similar to the findings of ali et al 2018 and jia et al 2018 because the mulching film could transform the consumption of soil water from a physical process into a physiological process thereby decrease ineffective consumption and increase effective consumption furthermore in our study soil water deficits were detected in the deep layer under the mulching plots in a drought year 2014 especially under the large mulching area treatments d and s and this water deficiency was compensated by infiltration of the soil water from the upper layer and rainfall during the fallow period thus there was no effect on the crop yield in the following year similar results were obtained in a long term study by li et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to assess the suitability of different planting modes based on the efficient and positive use of water resources in a comprehensive manner we found that the crop yields under mulched plots were significantly greater than in un mulched plot ck during each growth season fig 5 moreover the results also indicated that the yield increase was correlated with the mulching area and the d and s treatments had greater enhancements compared with r and p this was consistent with a previous study wherein a large mulching area led to significant increases in yield shiukhy et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 because a large mulching area usually maximizes water thermal conditions in a mulched system which allows crops to make full use of soil water and nutrients zhang et al 2019 in general crop productivity largely relies on in season rainfall in semiarid regions wei et al 2018 however in our study the yields under the mulching treatments were not positively correlated with the amount of rainfall instead the effects of mulching on the yields decreased as the amount of rainfall increased similar results were also obtained by ren et al 2016 and wu et al 2015 in northwest china who found that yield improvements with mulching were better when less rainfall occurred during the growing season this was because the excessive rainfall usually resulting in a poor solar thermal condition during the crop growth period at this time the soil temperature will replace soil water as the key limiting factor in constraining crop growth furthermore we found that the same mulching treatment had different effects on yield increases in different rainfall years overall the yield variation were lower under d and s compared with p and r this shows that the d and s treatments could stabilize the crop yield due to their effects on crop growth soil water utilization and other processes on the other hand for local farmers harvesting for greater net income is a critical foundation for their adoption of any up to date farming practices our results revealed that the net income under mulching plots were greater than that in un mulched plot ck despite a relatively high input being required in the application of the mulching method moreover the grain yield and output value were considerable reduced by the drought stresses during the maize growing season 2016 but the s treatment also achieved an acceptable yield output and economic benefit table 5 in our study in summary selecting a suitable mulching method for improving crop production and income is very important for local farmers 5 conclusion our results demonstrated that compared with ck film mulching increased the soil water content thereby leading to enhanced field water consumption and wp in each growth stage for maize especially under d and s the maize biomass and dry matter accumulation levels also tended to be higher with film mulching the effects of mulching were more obvious in the drought year than in the years with normal rainfall or wet years moreover mulching clearly increased the maize grain yield wue and the field incomes such that s yielded the highest net income 7538 ha 1 compared with the other treatments our findings suggest that film mulching enhanced the availability of soil water precipitation use and crop productivity especially under s therefore s is an effective strategy for preventing water deficits improving crop productivity and ensuring food security in the loess plateau region of northwest china further research is needed to confirm our conclusions by determining the long term responses of soil water and whether crop productivity is stable declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interests in

10500,film mulching has been used widely to improve field productivity in rainfed agricultural ecosystems in semiarid areas of china during 2013 2016 we evaluated the effects of different film mulching methods on soil water water productivity crop yield and economic benefits in a semiarid area of southern ningxia china five treatments were tested i a control method consisting of conventional flat planting without mulching ck ii alternate mulching and bare rows without ridges and planting in mulched rows p iii maize planted in furrows separated by consecutive plastic film mulched ridges s iv maize planted in furrows separated by alternating large and small plastic film mulched ridges d and v maize planted in furrows with large plastic film mulched ridges alternating with flat plastic film mulched spaces r after four years of continuous treatment the results indicated that d and s treatments significantly increased soil water content at depths of 0 200 cm during the early growth stage but the increases in the soil water content were lower later in the maize growth process the grain yield increases were affected by the different hydrothermal conditions in various years on average mulching increased grain yield by 31 33 and biomass accumulation by 22 48 across four seasons film mulching significantly p 0 05 increased water use efficiency and precipitation use efficiency especially in d by 34 56 and 43 09 and s by 35 25 and 42 79 respectively mulching changed the crop water consumption characteristics and resulted in higher crop water productivity due to an improved hydro thermal balance especially during the vegetative 30 90 days and pre reproductive 90 120 days growth stages which may account for yield increase effects in this system in addition the results suggested that the mulching system achieves higher economic returns than ck especially the s treatment 7538 ha 1 representing an average of 29 19 higher than ck the s treatment could serve as a promising adaptive management method for increasing maize productivity to cope with food security and climate change in this semi arid area with limited and erratic precipitation keywords dryland farming area economic benefits film mulching grain yield soil water use 1 introduction in china dryland farming is practiced on approximately one third of the arable land about 40 of which is situated on the loess plateau zhang et al 2018 this dryland farming area is one of the major grain producing regions in china the crop productivity is low and unstable for many years due to the sparse and uneven distribution of the annual precipitation in this region wang et al 2012 gan et al 2013 thus the local farmers in this area are adversely affected by low income and poverty hence the development status of this region should be improved by maximizing the utilization of precipitation reducing water losses by evaporation addressing inefficient rainwater use and synchronizing plant growth with the availability of rainwater many field techniques and management strategies have been developed over the last 30 years to alleviate water deficits and unstable crop productivity in semiarid regions gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in particular film mulching is regarded as an effective and adaptive field management for providing a favorable water and thermal environment for crop growth mo et al 2018 many studies have shown that film mulching can significantly increase the crop yield in semiarid regions mainly because of the increased availability of soil water liu et al 2010 gao et al 2014 adhikari et al 2016 farzi et al 2017 moreover film mulching can significantly improve water use efficiency wue by enhancing crop water consumption characteristics during plant growth ramakrishna et al 2006 demonstrated that mulching greatly increased the transpiration ratio by increasing crop transpiration during the reproductive growth stage which was conducive to the accumulation of dry matter in addition film mulching can effectively promote the movement of water from the deep soil to the topsoil via capillarity as well as via vapor transfer such movement can maintain relatively stable water contents in the topsoil to facilitate a beneficial soil crop water cycle liu et al 2010 however some studies have shown that the greater crop yield obtained under mulching is due to the high consumption of soil water and organic carbon nawaz et al 2016 lee et al 2019 as a consequence the soil quality may be severely degraded after continuous mulching for many years which is not conducive to the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in semiarid regions chakraborty et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 recently the following film mulching techniques have been developed and applied extensively during crop production in semiarid areas 1 flat planting mulching wang et al 2017 2 ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting with half mulching gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 and 3 a recently developed technique involving double ridges and furrows with complete mulching liu et al 2014 mo et al 2018 these techniques tend to increase the grain yield and economic benefit compared with conventional cultivation zhou et al 2009 cuello et al 2015 but they still have the following shortcomings the flat planting mulching technique cannot effectively accumulate rainfall of 10 mm for crop growth use wang et al 2011 the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting with half mulching technique has little or no effect on increasing the crop yield and wue and these parameters may even decrease during rainy or wet years ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the application of double ridges and furrows with complete mulching consumes an excessive amount of soil water from the deep layer under continuous cropping thereby causing soil degradation and reducing the yield in addition the use of large quantities of film incurs high costs and requires large labor inputs as well as causing white pollution due to residual plastics zhou et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 steinmetz et al 2016 thus some other new film mulching method must be developed to satisfy the needs of dry land agriculture for semiarid areas in this study a new film mulching method was created and hypothesized that this new film mulching method may exert economic environmental and agronomic benefits as expected in semiarid area however it is still unclear how the new mulching method would exert its effects compared to existing mulching techniques under local climatic and soil circumstance in the semiarid environment therefore we selected four existing mulching methods including flat mulching ridge and furrow mulching large and small ridges with full mulching and zero mulching together with the new mulching method to test the soil water status water productivity and economic benefits at a typical semiarid rainfed site of northwest china from 2013 to 2016 the objectives were as follows 1 to evaluate the effects of different mulching methods on soil water content water distribution and water consumption 2 to investigate the differences in grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefits under the different mulching methods and 3 to select an optimal mulching method for dryland farming regions of the loess plateau china 2 materials and

ridge furrow rainwater harvesting planting diagrams of each plastic film mulching method are presented in fig 1 maize dafeng 30 was sown at a rate of 75 000 plants ha 1 during middle to late april in 2013 2016 using a hole sowing fertilization diameter 3 cm machine base fertilizer comprising 150 kg n ha 1 and 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 was applied using a hole sowing fertilization machine after planting in addition 150 kg n ha 1 was applied as a topdressing in late june with a fertilization depth of 4 5 cm maize was harvested from the plots in late september or early october during 2013 2016 after harvesting the maize stalks were removed but the film mulch was retained in the same location in each of the plots before clearing the film approximately 30 days before the subsequent sowing operation late march in each experimental year and with maize in the next month mid to late april the methods used in practice were the same during each experimental year 2013 2016 irrigation was not applied in the experimental years pests and weeds were controlled during each crop growth season 2 3 sampling and measurement from 2013 2016 the gravimetric soil water content was measured at intervals of 20 cm to a depth of 200 cm at 30 day intervals during each crop growth season ferraro and ghersa 2007 a hand held auger ø 54 mm was used to collect soil samples from each depth soil samples were collected at three locations per plot for the ridge and furrow treatments r s and d i e in the middle of a ridge and furrow and between two plants in same row for the p treatment one core was sampled between two plants and two from the middle of two rows with one being in the film and the other not in the film for ck two cores were sampled from the middle of the two rows and one from the middle of two plants soil water contents was calculated as the mean value of the three different sampling positions at the time of harvesting during 2013 2016 the bulk density was measured using the cutting rings soil core methodology volume 100 cm3 inner diameter 5 05 cm nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences 1978 based on three random samples collected from each plot the soil was sampled at intervals of 20 cm to a depth of 200 cm the soil samples were dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 c the soil water storage during the growth stages was calculated using eq 1 as

evaporation and plant transpiration with transpiration being the larger component of et the groundwater table at the experimental site was located at a depth of approximately 80 m below the surface so upward flow into the roots was not considered in this area the experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions no rainstorms occurred during the experimental period and high ridges surrounded each plot to prevent the occurrence of runoff the local rainfall was generally low and did not cause underground drainage at depths exceeding 200 cm we therefore calculated et using the following simple equation 3 e t p δ s w the plant dry biomass was estimated by randomly selecting three maize plants per plot at intervals of 30 days throughout the growing season the samples were dried to a constant

p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water content the vertical distribution of the soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil depth in different maize growth stages varied with the amount of rainfall and water consumption during the experimental years fig 2 during the early growth stage 0 30 days the soil water content values for the 0 200 cm depth were higher under all of the mulching treatments than for ck with an average increase of 8 77 during 2013 2016 during days 30 60 as the rainfall increased the soil water contents values were significantly higher p 0 05 under d and s than the other treatments with average increases of 6 81 and 9 12 respectively the most vigorous growth period for maize occurred during days 60 90 when water consumption increased and soil water content decreased for all of the treatments in each year except in 2013 in a particularly wet year i e when rainfall was extremely high 267 3 mm in 2013 and very low 29 0 mm in 2015 r and s significantly increased with regard to soil water contents p 0 05 by 4 37 and 5 17 respectively compared with the average of the other treatments i e d p and ck in the later growth stage days 90 120 soil water content values under the mulching treatments were significantly lower p 0 05 than that with ck in the deep soil layer 60 200 cm during 2013 2014 and 2016 with average decreases of 7 12 6 62 and 5 98 for d p and s respectively soil water content was 4 16 higher with the mulching treatments than ck during 2015 due to the high rainfall 86 1 mm which was significantly higher than that in other years but there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the four film treatments after harvesting 160 days the average soil water content in the 0 100 cm layer was 7 14 higher with mulching than ck for all years except 2016 and it was lower under s than the other mulching treatments with an average decrease of 2 44 in 2016 there was little rainfall to supplement the soil moisture so the soil water contents measurements were all significantly lower under the film mulching treatments than under ck by 12 43 p 0 05 3 2 field water consumption in different growth stages δet similar to soil water content field water consumption was clearly differentially affected by the precipitation and crop growth across the period fig 3 during the early stage 0 30 days the average field water consumption was 25 23 lower under all of the mulching treatments compared with ck for each year compared with p and r the field water consumption under s was 25 15 and 11 66 lower p 0 05 respectively during days 0 30 during days 30 60 the growth of maize was more rapid with mulching than ck thereby increasing the average water consumption by 29 37 such that the average field water consumption was 14 38 higher under d and s compared with p and r during the fast growing period from days 60 90 the field water consumption rates were higher than those during days 0 60 such that the order under the different treatments was d s p r ck the average field water consumption values under d and s were 12 46 p 0 05 and 7 33 higher than those under p and r respectively during days 90 120 the field water consumption decreased gradually and the effects of mulching also diminished the average field water consumption rates under d p and s were 4 41 0 30 and 5 60 higher respectively than that under ck during the filling stage 120 150 days field water consumption decreased dramatically with each treatment but the rates under mulching were all lower than that under ck i e 5 68 and 0 98 lower under d and s respectively 3 3 crop water productivity wp in different growth stages wp increased as the dry matter accumulated during the maize growth stages table 3 in the early growth stage 0 30 and 30 60 days the mulching treatments had significant p 0 05 effects on wp in each year 2013 2016 compared with ck the increases in the average wp were 157 92 93 64 58 86 and 129 45 under d p r and s respectively during days 60 90 in the rapid growth period for maize the wp values differed little among the treatments such that the average wp was only 23 91 higher under the mulching treatments than ck the wp values under d and s were 9 04 and 14 08 higher respectively compared with that under r p 0 05 during days 90 120 the wp values under d and s were 42 67 and 41 13 higher respectively than that under ck p 0 05 grain filling led to the rapid accumulation of dry matter during days 120 150 thereby resulting in high wp values average 188 70 kg ha 1 mm 1 for each year except for 2016 when the order of the treatments was r p ck d s during 2013 2015 the wp values under r and p were 43 31 and 71 08 higher respectively than the average under d and s p 0 05 3 4 biomass accumulation the mulching treatments yielded significantly higher biomass accumulation values p 0 05 compared with ck during the early growth stage 0 60 days fig 4 with average increases of 179 12 105 43 73 67 and 141 27 under d p r and s respectively more than 74 22 of the biomass yield accumulated during the maize growth period from days 60 120 the biomass accumulation values were significantly p 0 05 higher under d and s than the other treatments compared with ck the average accumulated biomass values were 61 68 38 95 23 72 and 56 30 higher under d f r and s respectively the average accumulated biomass in each year at maize crop maturity 150 days followed the order d s p r ck the average accumulated biomass rates were 17 11 and 14 30 higher under d and s respectively compared with the average under the other treatments p 0 05 3 5 grain yield et wue and pue mulching increased grain yields expect under r in 2013 during 2013 2016 fig 5 such that the average yields under the five treatments followed the order d s p r ck the average grain yields under r s d and p were 22 50 38 85 39 11 and 24 86 higher respectively than that under ck p 0 05 the average maize yield under d and s was 12 37 higher than the average under r and p the yield under r is significantly correlated with the amount of rainfall during the growth period i e the yield under r during 2013 was 21 1 lower than the average under s d and p whereas it was significantly higher than that under p in 2014 but not significantly different from the average during 2015 2016 the maize yields in 2013 2016 followed the order 2013 2014 2015 2016 under different photothermal and rainfall conditions the effects of mulching on the yield followed the order 2016 2014 2015 2013 as shown in fig 3 et was closely related to the rainfall each year 2013 2016 in the dry years 2014 and 2016 et did not vary among the mulching treatments but the et values were higher under all of the mulching treatments than ck i e 6 74 and 9 53 higher in 2014 and 2016 respectively in the rainy year 2013 et was 8 30 lower under p than ck and that under p was 15 96 13 22 and 12 26 lower than those under s r and d respectively p 0 05 in the normal rainfall year 2015 the et values were all lower under the mulching treatments than ck average 4 22 lower and that under s was the lowest among the mulching treatments similar to the grain yield the wue and pue values were strongly affected by mulching especially under s and d in the four years such that the average wue values were 42 78 and 43 11 higher under s and d respectively p 0 05 and the average pue values were 35 24 and 35 03 higher table 4 3 6 economic benefit mulching significantly affected economic benefits table 5 the average output values under the different treatments followed the order d r p s ck mulching increased the total income by improving the maize yield the average input values in the four years followed the order d s p r ck where r and p required less film than d and s the net incomes under s r d and p were 29 19 15 41 7 11 and 2 93 higher respectively than that under ck and s yielded the highest net income 7538 ha 1 however the net incomes under the mulching treatments were negatively correlated with the amount of rainfall and there was no significant increase 3 67 lower under r in the rainy year i e 594 1 mm during the growth period in 2013 similarly the output input o i ratios were 22 10 and 5 65 lower under the mulching treatments than ck in 2013 and 2015 respectively when the amounts of rainfall were lower in addition the o i ratio was 9 23 higher under r than ck in 2014 in 2016 the o i ratios under s r and p were 11 28 12 03 and 3 01 higher respectively than that under ck 4 discussion mulching induced water content changes in agricultural soil have been widely reported across the literature in general under water environments with spring droughts the use of film mulching is popular in order to provide a favorable water condition for seedling establishment in spring sown crops in semiarid areas gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in our study film mulching could significantly improve soil water conditions by decreasing ineffective evaporation during the early growth stage which provides a base for successful seedling establishment and canopy development this is crucial for grain yields in dry farming regions where farmers often fail to ensure desirable seedling stands due to limited rainfall in the early spring zhang et al 2017 and mo et al 2018 found that increasing the mulching area further amplified the soil moisture contents advantage in each growth seasons similarly in our study d and s yielded higher soil moisture content values than p and r our results demonstrated that r and s could effectively compensate for the soil water consumed by the furrow and ridge rainwater collection system especially in drought years comparatively although the d treatment employs the furrow and ridge system it typically leads to reduced soil water content due to its high water consumption caused by rapid growth and development of maize at high soil temperatures data not shown moreover we found that mulching treatment is capable of facilitating the roots to utilize soil water from deep layers 60 200 cm that resulted in a water deficit at the maturity stage especially during growing season dry spells furthermore root and shoot biomass growth under the mulching system can also significantly affect soil water content over a growth season mo et al 2017 and the effect was correlated with the amount and distribution of rainfall in different years in our study increased biomass and grain yields fig 5 in the d and s treatments could partially explain their lower measurements of soil water content in deep layers than in the r and p fig 2 especially at the late reproductive stage flowering to maturity previous studies have shown that film mulching can significantly enhancing crop dry matter accumulation by changing crop field water consumption patterns during growth period gan et al 2013 jiang and li 2015 adhikari et al 2016 filipović et al 2016 steinmetz et al 2016 similar results were obtained in our experiments where mulching plots especially the large mulching area treatments d and s significantly reduced et and increased wp during the early growth stage mulching also retained more water in the soil during the low water requirement periods for maize thereby allowing its use during the rapid growth period however film mulching provided a favorable water thermal environment for obtaining a high yield thereby leading to large water consumption especially in the vigorous vegetative growth stage 60 90 days such that the average increase was 26 74 compared with ck mo et al 2018 showed that a full mulching system improved the wue and wp values more than half or non mulching treatments in semiarid areas similarly we found that compared with p and r the d and s significantly increased the wp and wue values in the maize growth stage this is most likely because the d and s treatments providing a favorable thermal condition for maize growth which in turn significantly accelerated the growth process and increased crop transpiration zhang et al 2017 in addition our study also showed that mulching could effectively improving wp during the growth season table 3 especially during the vegetative 30 90 days and pre reproductive 90 120 days growth periods similar to the findings of ali et al 2018 and jia et al 2018 because the mulching film could transform the consumption of soil water from a physical process into a physiological process thereby decrease ineffective consumption and increase effective consumption furthermore in our study soil water deficits were detected in the deep layer under the mulching plots in a drought year 2014 especially under the large mulching area treatments d and s and this water deficiency was compensated by infiltration of the soil water from the upper layer and rainfall during the fallow period thus there was no effect on the crop yield in the following year similar results were obtained in a long term study by li et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to assess the suitability of different planting modes based on the efficient and positive use of water resources in a comprehensive manner we found that the crop yields under mulched plots were significantly greater than in un mulched plot ck during each growth season fig 5 moreover the results also indicated that the yield increase was correlated with the mulching area and the d and s treatments had greater enhancements compared with r and p this was consistent with a previous study wherein a large mulching area led to significant increases in yield shiukhy et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 because a large mulching area usually maximizes water thermal conditions in a mulched system which allows crops to make full use of soil water and nutrients zhang et al 2019 in general crop productivity largely relies on in season rainfall in semiarid regions wei et al 2018 however in our study the yields under the mulching treatments were not positively correlated with the amount of rainfall instead the effects of mulching on the yields decreased as the amount of rainfall increased similar results were also obtained by ren et al 2016 and wu et al 2015 in northwest china who found that yield improvements with mulching were better when less rainfall occurred during the growing season this was because the excessive rainfall usually resulting in a poor solar thermal condition during the crop growth period at this time the soil temperature will replace soil water as the key limiting factor in constraining crop growth furthermore we found that the same mulching treatment had different effects on yield increases in different rainfall years overall the yield variation were lower under d and s compared with p and r this shows that the d and s treatments could stabilize the crop yield due to their effects on crop growth soil water utilization and other processes on the other hand for local farmers harvesting for greater net income is a critical foundation for their adoption of any up to date farming practices our results revealed that the net income under mulching plots were greater than that in un mulched plot ck despite a relatively high input being required in the application of the mulching method moreover the grain yield and output value were considerable reduced by the drought stresses during the maize growing season 2016 but the s treatment also achieved an acceptable yield output and economic benefit table 5 in our study in summary selecting a suitable mulching method for improving crop production and income is very important for local farmers 5 conclusion our results demonstrated that compared with ck film mulching increased the soil water content thereby leading to enhanced field water consumption and wp in each growth stage for maize especially under d and s the maize biomass and dry matter accumulation levels also tended to be higher with film mulching the effects of mulching were more obvious in the drought year than in the years with normal rainfall or wet years moreover mulching clearly increased the maize grain yield wue and the field incomes such that s yielded the highest net income 7538 ha 1 compared with the other treatments our findings suggest that film mulching enhanced the availability of soil water precipitation use and crop productivity especially under s therefore s is an effective strategy for preventing water deficits improving crop productivity and ensuring food security in the loess plateau region of northwest china further research is needed to confirm our conclusions by determining the long term responses of soil water and whether crop productivity is stable declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interests in

hotter conditions and therefore less water for evapotranspiration moreover there are increasing and competing demands for water from mining environment and domestic applications to improve water use efficiency and irrigation management farmers need to be able to measure and monitor soil volumetric water content θ m3 m 3 during wetting and drying cycles to generate the necessary information about the spatial variation in θ data is required at multiple depths and from various locations however the standard method i e laboratory measured gravimetric moisture is time consuming and labour intensive moreover it involves destructive sampling and requires determination of the soil bulk density ρ gcm 3 brevik and fenton 2004 in addition θ measurements are required daily alternatively field sensors which can be installed a priori have been used to measure and monitor θ for example kodikara et al 2014 and al ain et al 2009 used neutron probes in urban and salt affected areas respectively however chanasyk and naeth 1996 indicated issues related to measuring θ in the near surface and smoothing of θ across texture discontinuities time domain reflectometry tdr or capacitance probes cp can provide depth specific measurements of θ baumhardt et al 2000 moreover domain frequency sensors e g decagon gs3 have also been used however these sensors and data loggers are expensive given multiples are required to measure and monitor θ in topsoil 0 15 m subsurface 0 45 m and subsoil 0 6 m to value add to these sensors time lapse electrical resistivity tomography measurements can be used to extrapolate between their locations moghadas and badorreck 2019 electromagnetic em induction instruments have also been proposed as a source of digital data for soil moisture monitoring this data can be used to value add to the point θ data and extrapolate across at the field scale this is because the soil apparent electrical conductivity eca ms m 1 which is measured from em instruments is influenced by θ owing to the polarity of the water molecule while eca is also related to other soil properties such as clay content mineralogy and salinity if these three are similar across a given field most of the response or changes in eca over time and during a wetting drying cycle can be modelled relative to θ in terms of θ huang et al 2017a 2017b established a calibration between estimates of true electrical conductivity σ ms m 1 derived from inversion of dualem 421 eca and θ at 5 sites along a single uniform loamy sand transect and over a 12 day period to model and monitor water use beneath an overhead irrigated lucerne field in san jacinto southern california a similar 2 d approach was used at 8 sites but across a sprinkler irrigated field near camden in southern sydney nsw australia huang et al 2017a therein an ensemble kalman filter enkf approach was developed in 2 d and subsequently used to monitor and nowcast 3 dimensional θ dynamics on 20 separate days over a period of 40 days on a plot scale a similar approach using 5 sites was used beneath an olive tree to monitor θ in cordoba spain martinez et al 2018 from estimates of σ from a dualem 21 in most research pertaining to em inversion and monitoring of θ single frequency multi coil sensors have been used to estimate σ and related to time varying θ at multiple calibration sites using either a dualem e g huang et al 2017a 2017b or cmd mini explorer moghadas et al 2019 in addition multiple sites have been used to develop a calibration using mostly simple linear or curve linear relationships in this research we seek to determine if eca measured from a em38 in horizontal em38 h or vertical ev38v modes at various heights 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m can be used to value add to limited θ we also determine if a relationship can be established between σ and θ using mathematical i e multiple linear regression mlr random forest rf cubist support vector machine svm and artificial neural networks ann models we also determine and evaluate the number of calibration sites required to make a satisfactory model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study field is in the lower namoi valley of northern new south wales australia fig 1 a it is located at the new south wales department of primary industries australian cotton research institute acri 201 m above sea level 30 11 41 s 149 36 20 e which is 20 km to west of narrabri the experiment was sited at the southern end of experimental field c1 which is used for furrow irrigation to trial various cotton rotation farming systems including but not limited to winter wheat triticum sp and legumes dolichus sp in conjunction with cotton gossypium sp the field run is approximately 200 m long the climate is semi arid with mean annual rainfall of approximately 643 mm and potential evaporation over 1800 mm the rainfall is slightly summer dominant with a mean maximum in january 79 8 mm and minimum in august 37 5 mm temperature varies from a mean maximum in january 35 3 c to a minimum in july 17 0 c stannard and kelly 1977 recognized three major physiographic units near the field including clay plain prior stream and terminal prior stream deposits the clay plain dominates characterised by a grey self mulching vertic clay i e grey vertosols isbell 2002 these surround the acri and are used extensively for irrigated cotton production triantafilis et al 2000 2 2 soil moisture sensors installation and soil samples collection to monitor θ m3 m 3 8 sites located approximately 20 m apart were selected site 1 was located 20 m from the head ditch at the eastern end of the field while site 8 was positioned 20 m from the tail ditch to the west at each site a large pit was excavated decagon gs3 decagon devices inc wa usa sensors were then installed at depths of 0 15 0 45 0 75 and 1 35 m they approximately represent θ in the topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m shallow 0 6 0 9 m and deep subsoil 1 2 1 5 m respectively the reason that this type of sensor was selected is factory calibration for θ is accurate to 0 03 m3 m 3 in mineral soils when the bulk soil ec is 10 ds m 1 this has been examined and confirmed by son et al 2017 in soils with different textures e g silty clay the sensors are capable of measuring not only θ m3 m 3 but also temperature oc and bulk electrical conductivity σ b ms m 1 these three measured data were collected and logged every 5 min using a decagon em50 during the entire duration of the experiment the field was irrigated furrow on 31 january 2018 water was applied from the head ditch in the east and flowed toward the tail ditch under the influence of gravity at the 8 selected sites and two extra points near the head and tail ditch and from within the soil pits soil samples were collected at depths of 0 15 0 45 0 75 and 1 35 m the samples were oven dried 60 c and ground to pass a 2 mm sieve the hydrometer method was used with 5 sodium hexametaphosphate as the dispersing agent to determine the particle size fractions i e clay silt and sand soil salinity ece ds m 1 was estimated from ec1 5 using conversion factor 6 7 for heavy clay soil slavich and petterson 1993 the ph was determined from a 1 5 soil water extract tucker 1974 method was used to determine the cation exchange capacity cec cmol kg 1 using a mechanical leaching device briefly samples were first washed with 60 ethanol to remove any soluble salts followed by extraction with 1 m nh4cl the extracts were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 2 3 em instrumentation and eca data collection soil apparent electrical conductivity eca was collected using a geonics em38 mississauga ontario canada the em38 eca was measured in horizontal em38 h and vertical em38v modes given operating frequency i e 14 5 khz and coil spacing 1 0 m the theoretical depth of exploration is respectively 0 75 em38h0 and 1 5 m em38v0 when the instrument is on the ground mcneill 1990 in this study em38 h and em38v eca was measured at heights of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m we delineate these with subscripts e g 0 2 m height em38h0 2 and em38v0 2 the eca data were collected from the head ditch to the tail ditch and at 10 m spacing in total 19 positions were visited fig 1b the em38 was positioned directly above and in alignment with the bed east west a graduated wooden rod enabled em38 to be positioned at correct height on the day of irrigation the eca were collected before irrigation commenced 0 h later six subsequent eca measurement passes were made during irrigation 1 2 5 4 5 6 7 5 and 9 h irrigation ceased after 9 h from here and every day after irrigation commenced 2 10 days eca data was collected at 9 00 am altogether 17 eca data measurement campaigns were conducted 2 3 1 correction of eca data based on soil temperature and ambient temperature to account for soil temperature variation from one day to the next and to correct eca data to a standard soil temperature i e 25 c corwin and lesch 2005 empirically showed that this could be done by multiplying the measured eca data with a factor t using the following equation 1 f t 0 4470 1 4034 e t 26 815 where t is the soil temperature herein the eca data associated with the different em38 channels and heights of measurement were adjusted to a standard ambient temperature i e 25 c using equation 1 the input soil temperature t for different depths and times were provided from those measured by decagon gs3 sensors simultaneously with θ measurements 2 4 quasi 2d inversion of em38 data the em4soil software package 2018 was used to invert em38 eca and generate electromagnetic conductivity images emci specifically estimates of σ the software operates for eca collected at low induction numbers monteiro santos et al 2010 with an optimal emci arrived at by varying parameters including forward model inversion algorithm and damping factor λ a emci is formulated from minimization of the difference between measured and calculated eca generated from a forward model in forward modelling calculations consider the cumulative function cf model proposed by mcneill 1980 or non linear full solution fs model based on maxwell s equations e g wait 1982 frischknecht 1988 at low induction numbers the cf model is preferred due to their simplicity and speed when eca is acquired over conductive soil i e 100 ms m 1 the full solution fs is preferable inversion modelling is conducted using a one dimensional laterally constrained approach auken et al 2002 where two dimensional smoothness constraints are imposed the inversion algorithms are variations of occam regularization the s2 constrains emci variation around a reference model and consequently produces smoother inversions than s1 also λ can be varied which smooths data with increasing values we aim to determine the optimal emci by adjusting λ as a regularization parameter for the quasi 2d inversion of em38 eca at the ground surface em38h0 and em38v0 or at various heights e g em38h0 2 and em38v0 2 in terms of λ we set it from 0 07 0 3 and at 0 3 increments thereafter to a maximum of 6 0 inversion of eca data collected on each day were generated with a maximum of 20 iterations owing to the large eca we set the initial model of the σ to an average of σ 100 ms m 1 to determine the most suitable parameters the largest coefficient of determination r2 between σ and θ was identified we did this by obtaining σ from the emci on the first survey and on each of the 16 subsequent surveys and correlating these with θ at the corresponding time 2 5 modelling methods five mathematical models were chosen to predict θ the mathematical models were mlr rf cubist svm and ann all the modelling in this study were performed using r software meyer et al 2014 2 5 1 mlr we use a mlr model which is of the form 2 y a b1x1 b2x2 bkxk ε where y is vector of the target property i e θ and where xk represent the kth predictor variable i e em38 eca data in the horizontal em38 h or vertical em38v modes or estimates of σ from em inversion of eca while a is the intercept b the slope and ε is the model s residual to produce a model to predict θ at independent depths we first determine the best mlr which can be developed between em38 eca data in the horizontal em38 h and vertical em38v modes at various heights including at the ground surface em38h0 and em38v0 we also compare mlr of em38 h and em38v at various heights 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m with the ground surface to find the best set of predictors the fixed effects were determined prior to model building and by using backwards elimination until all predictors had a probability of being selected 0 01 2 5 2 rf the rf is an ensemble of unpruned trees whereby each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of training data with prediction made by averaging their output via regression the algorithm for growing a rf of b trees is as follows 1 for b 1 to b 2 draw a bootstrap sample xi of size n from the training data x i e σ from inversion or eca 3 grow a random forest tree tb to the bootstrapped data by recursively repeating the following steps for each terminal node of the tree until the minimum node size nmin is reached lowerroman 4 randomly select m variables i e σ and depth from the p variables i e σ or depth lowerroman 5 pick the best variable split point among the m and lowerroman 6 split the node into two daughter nodes 7 make a prediction at a new location y ˆ i e θ 3 y ˆ x 1 b b 1 b t b x the caret package in r kuhn et al 2017 was used to fit the rf model 2 5 3 cubist the cubist model is capable of first identifying which criteria are useful for partitioning the variables i e σ and depth secondly for each partition it fits a mlr to predict θ this approach is described as a decision tree adams and sterling 1992 with the variables used for partitioning called nodes and the mlr under each partition called leaves in addition the cubist software provides the attribute usage relative importance of each variable in each partition the cubist model was fitted using cubist package in r kuhn et al 2014 2 5 4 svm a svm performs well on problems that are nonlinear sparse and are high dimensional the svm achieve this by using kernel functions to project the data onto a new hyperspace where complex non linear patterns can be simply represented gunn 1998 and williams 2011 svm predictions are calculated using the following function 4 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x j d where f x is the target property i e θ k x i x j of a user defined kernel function where x is the feature vector i e σ from inversion of eca and d is a constant threshold the kernel function used herein is an isotropic gaussian radial basis function 5 k x i x j e x i x j 2 2 γ 2 with the bandwidth parameter γ the α i a n d α i are the weights lagrange multipliers which determine the influence of each point in the model the weights α i a n d α i are obtained from the solution of a quadratic programming optimisation problem platt 1999 and smola and schölkopf 2004 of the form m a x α α 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n α i α i α j α j k x i x j 6 ε i 1 n α i α i i 1 n y i α i α i the constraints are given as follows 7 s u b j e c t t o i 1 n α i α i 0 0 α i α i c f o r i 1 n where ε is the specified non negative contant c is the regularization parameter that defines the trade off between training error and model complexity i e flatness of f x the best parameters c and γ obtained using the training data were 5 and 0 1 respectively in this work we applied the svm from the e1071 and caret packages meyer et al 2014 in r 2 5 5 artificial neural network anns the artificial neural network ann modelling technique was also chosen to fit the relationship between σ inverted from eca and θ this is because it is a data driven approach which simulates features of neural networks that address a range of difficult information processing analysis and modelling problems de smith et al 2007 neural networks achieve this by using hidden units between input and directs them through an activation function as the output the units can be layers or nodes within the layers this allows the hidden units to accomplish nonlinear transformations of the inputs entered in the network depending on their associated weights the hidden units may vary in this study we chose 3 hidden units i e one layer with 3 nodes because fewer units failed to reflect the complex inter relationship and too many units led to over fitting of the ann model the ann was fitted using neuralnet package in r günther and fritsch 2010 in terms of validation k fold cross validation was adopted here this method partitions the training set into k i e 8 sets the learner model trains k times for every model complexity on every occasion it uses one of the sets as the validation set and the training data is the remaining sets after calculating the average error over the k runs the model complexity with the smallest average error will be selected it can return the model with that complexity trained on all the data 2 5 6 validation and evaluating prediction accuracy bias and concordance to compare various models we used a leave one out cross validation specifically we removed a whole site including all depth and times then fitted the different models using the calibration dataset and applied to the point left out given there were 8 sites this was done eight times a number of indices including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean error me were considered with the latter two a measure of prediction accuracy and bias respectively in both cases a smaller number close to zero is an indication of good performance the lin s concordance correlation coefficient is also used herein as a measure of the agreement between measured and predicted θ that is how close predictions falls along a 45 degree line from the origin to the measured data lawrence and lin 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of soil properties along transect fig 2 shows contour plots of soil properties fig 2a shows clay was large increasing from the head 58 toward the tail ditch 67 fig 2b shows silt was uniformly small 11 17 with fig 2c showing sand 18 27 was slightly larger the texture was uniformly heavy clay fig 2d shows ece was slightly saline 2 7 3 3 ds m 1 in the topsoil 0 0 3 m while

6 9 fig 2f shows cec was uniform and between 20 and 26 cmol kg 1 suggesting the soil has moderate shrink swell potential 3 2 summary statistics of eca table 1 shows summary statistics of eca ms m 1 from em38 at various heights i e 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m the em38v0 had the largest mean 103 0 ms m 1 followed by the em38h0 94 7 the mean eca decreased with increasing height the eca was most skewed 0 6 for em38h0 which also had largest 29 coefficient of variation cv with increasing height of eca measurement cv and skewness decreased we attribute these results to the variable moisture content of topsoil specifically prior to irrigation during irrigation and as the soil dried after irrigation ceased 3 3 summary statistics of time lapse θ table 2 shows summary statistics of mean decagon gs3 measured θ m3 m 3 for all sites at various depths e g topsoil 0 15 m and various times the minimum 0 20 m3 m 3 topsoil θ according to gardiner and miller 2004 would be close to permanent wilting point 0 25 m3 m 3 for heavy clay 60 textured soil this was expected given field had not been irrigated for two weeks nevertheless the maximum 0 56 m3 m 3 subsoil θ was large and reflects θ beyond field capacity 0 42 m3 m 3 for heavy clays gardiner and miller 2004 the large coefficient of variation cv of topsoil 27 2 and subsurface 14 41 θ reflects the variable nature of θ at various times before during irrigation and days after irrigation commenced the larger standard deviation sd of topsoil 0 10 and subsurface 0 07 θ compared to the subsurface 0 06 and subsoil 0 06 shows the upper two layers were affected by the wetting and drying cycles despite the variation soil θ was at or near field capacity for most of the experiment 3 4 distribution of measured eca along transect fig 3 shows the em38 eca from ground surface 0 m and at various times fig 3a shows em38h0 and em38v0 before irrigation commenced and excluding the head ditch and tail ditch em38h0 40 ms m 1 was smaller than em38v0 60 ms m 1 fig 3b shows that the em38h0 75 ms m 1 and em38v0 80 ms m 1 increased near the head ditch and as a function of water progressing down the field past site 1 and 1 h after irrigation commenced fig 3c g show a steady increased in eca between 2 5 and 9 h when irrigation ceased fig 3h j show em38h0 75 ms m 1 decreased and was equivalent to em38v0 80 ms m 1 between days 2 4 fig 3k p shows that the em38h0 decreased much more rapidly than the em38v0 between days 5 10 this would be due to the soil drying as a function of the evapotranspiration occurring in the topsoil subsurface and upper subsoil driven by the growing cotton crop fig 3q shows that the em38h0 was smaller than the em38v0 on day 10 but both measurements were not as small as day 0 and prior to irrigation commencing 3 5 distribution of measured θ along transect fig 4 shows measured θ at various times at the 8 sites where the decagon gs3 sensors were installed fig 4a shows that before irrigation commenced 0 h θ was at or near saturation 0 5 m3 m 3 only near the tail ditch site 8 and in the upper 0 75 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m in the topsoil 0 15 m θ was small 0 25 m3 m 3 at the head and tail ditch ends and close to permanent wilting point 0 25 m3 m 3 for a heavy clay soil gardiner and miller 2004 with increasing depth θ increased 0 3 0 35 m3 m 3 and was wetter in the subsoil

topsoil and subsurface wetting to site 4 with deeper subsoil wetting near site 5 and 6 respectively fig 4f 7 5 h and fig 4g 9 h show wetting fronts at site 7 and 8 respectively fig 4h through to fig

between average eca and measured soil properties table 3 shows coefficients of determination r2 between average 0 1 5 m soil properties and em38 eca collected at ground level before irrigation the r2 between em38h0 was significant p 0 05 statistically for sand r2 0 61 and clay 0 55 but not silt 0 45 the r2 between em38h0 and ece 0 07 ph1 5 r2 0 14 and cec 0 33 were small but larger for θ 0 57 the r2 between em38v0 was largest for sand r2 0 61 and clay 0 57 the r2 between em38h0 and θ was statistically significant and slightly larger 0 63 than sand 3 7 coefficient of determination r2 between eca and θ table 4 a shows r2 of four independent mlr relationships between measured θ and em38 h and em38v with respect to topsoil the best r2 was between θ and em38h0 and em38v0 0 76 this was also the case for subsurface 0 85 and deep subsoil 0 75 θ with regards to shallow subsoil θ the r2 was equivalent 0 85 when mlr was developed using both em38 h and em38v at multiple heights of 0 and 0 2 m there was no improvement in r2 when the instrument was raised table 4b shows the mlr at one height and at ground surface the results show r2 were on par with when instrument was on the ground considering largest r2 were achieved with em38h0 and to a lesser extent em38v0 these two eca were the only two considered during inversion 3 8 coefficient of determination r2 between estimated σ and measured θ fig 5 shows coefficient of determination r2 between estimates of true electrical conductivity σ and measured θ at all depths and survey times in estimating σ we only considered em38h0 and em38v0 and using different sets of inversion parameters including forward model i e cf and fs inversion i e s1 and s2 algorithm and different λ values regardless of forward model or inversion algorithm larger r2 between σ and θ were when λ was small 1 2 the cf produced consistently larger r2 compared to fs with s1 and relative to λ this was attributed to eca approximating low induction numbers 100 ms m 1 the largest r2 0 56 was between σ derived from em38h0 and em38v0 and θ using cf forward model s1 inversion algorithm and λ 0 6 given these results we compare and contrast calibration model development between σ and θ using estimates of σ derived from cf forward model s1 inversion algorithms and λ 0 6 using rf cubist svm ann we also develop a mlr between θ with σ and depth 3 9 coefficient of determination r2 between σ and measured soil properties table 5 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between measured soil properties at all depths and estimates of true electrical conductivity σ ms m 1 estimated from em38 eca collected at ground level in horizontal em38h0 and vertical em38v0 modes and all time steps the r2 between σ was small and not statistically significant for sand 0 03 silt 0 05 and clay 0 08 and σ with ece 0 07 ph1 5 r2 0 14 and cec 0 01 the r2 for σ and θ 0 62 was statistically significant p 0 001 the results indicate while eca was influenced by average 0 1 5 m clay sand and θ this was not the case for estimated σ which was influenced by changes in θ 3 10 mlr between eca and θ table 6 a shows the four different mlr equations used to predict θ from eca for different depths and considering only the em38h0 and em38v0 the intercepts a were uniform albeit slightly larger in topsoil 0 273 and subsurface 0 278 compared to upper 0 228 and lower subsoil 0 233 the slope b was larger for em38h0 in topsoil 0 007 and the subsurface 0 003 the opposite was the case for em38v0 these results were consistent with theoretical depth of exploration specifically em38h0 would be expected to relate to topsoil 0 15 m and subsurface 0 45 m θ while em38v0 would be expected to be related to upper 0 75 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m table 6b shows the leave one out cross validation of the use of the mlr equations when used to predict θ from eca for the four different depths and considering only the em38h0 and em38v0 the results show that for all depths the prediction accuracy was small as was the bias for example topsoil prediction of θ was good given rmse 0 04 was less than half of the standard deviation 0 10 of measured θ the me 0 also indicated unbiased prediction the leave one out cross validation show that the r2 values were large e g upper subsoil 0 80 the 1 1 relationship was also large as exemplified by upper subsoil lin s correlation coefficient 0 88 3 11 modelling relationship between eca or σ and θ fig 6 shows measured versus predicted θ summary statistics of various models and considering a leave one out cross validation fig 6a shows four different mlr in table 6a and using em38h0 and em38v0 and from the data shown in table 6b overall measured and predicted θ were in good accord lin s concordance 0 90 with a strong correlation coefficient r2 0 82 with good accuracy rmse 0 03 and unbiased predictions me 0 given rmse was smaller than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ these predictions were satisfactory singh et al 2005 fig 6b shows leave one out cross validation of rf using σ and depth overall there was a good 1 1 fit but lin s concordance 0 81 and r2 were smaller 0 67 nevertheless predictions of θ were unbiased 0 with rmse 0 04 again less than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ fig 6c shows cubist using σ and depth was on parity with combined mlr using eca as indicated by lin s concordance 0 89 and r2 0 79 predictions were also unbiased 0 however rmse 0 05 was a little larger than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ what is evident in fig 6b and c is that measured θ at large 0 45 m3 m 3 and intermediate 0 3 0 4 m3 m 3 values were under and over predicted with respect to under prediction this was the case in the subsurface 0 45 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m over prediction was evident in the lower subsoil we attribute this to rf not performing well in time series analysis particularly when significant trends in increasing and decreasing values nau 2015 exist this was problematic herein because we removed all data at one point during leave one out cross validation since rf predicts an average value during calibration to the points it has not seen before nau 2015 this causes under and over prediction additionally the wetting front differs in the topsoil and subsoil and this causes the difficulty with respect to cubist the problem arises because predictions generated using nearby points therefore it performs poorly when all data at one point is removed during leave one out cross validation kuhn and johnson 2013 fig 6d shows the results when the relationship between θ from σ and depth at all times was developed using svm the lin s concordance 0 91 and the r2 0 83 were larger than any other model fig 6e shows the results when the ann model was employed using σ and depth the 1 1 fit lin s concordance 0 86 for θ was smaller than mlr of eca the r2 was also smaller 0 76 the rmse for the svm 0 04 and ann 0 04 were smaller than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ at all depths in terms of overall ranking the best approach was to invert the em38h0 and em38v0 with σ and depth modelled to θ using svm this was followed by mlr of em38h0 and em38v0 eca and θ however the latter approach does not allow for predictions to be made at depths where measurements in θ were not made given depth specific nature of the calibrations in this respect and in spite of not being as strong in terms of lin s concordance and r2 the use of rf and ann would not be preferred this would also be the case for cubist which was superior to rf based on lin s but prediction accuracy rmse 0 05 was larger than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ fig 6f shows if a simpler mlr model can be developed between θ using σ and depth the summary statistics indicate that measured and predicted θ were in accord lin s concordance 0 84 with a strong correlation coefficient r2 0 73 this approach was a slight improvement on rf but not as good as ann nevertheless accuracy rmse 0 04 was good and smaller than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ in all modelling approaches the predictions were unbiased me 0 00 3 11 1 modelling of θ using various modelling approaches fig 7 a shows predicted θ during irrigation 6 h and using mlr of em38h0 and em38v0 eca fig 7b day 5 and 7c day 11 show predicted θ several days after irrigation commenced the difference between plots of measured θ shown at 6 h fig 4e 5 figure 4 l and 11 fig 4q days and predicted θ was there were twice as many data points i e 19 available given eca was collected at 10 m intervals there was an issue with short scale subsoil predicted θ day 11 that was not reflected in measured θ predicted θ using rf can be seen at 6 h figs 7d e and 10 in fig 7f days while the patterns were consistent with measured θ under prediction was evident in the subsurface 0 45 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m behind wetting front over prediction in advance of wetting front was evident in lower subsoil near the tail ditch similar patterns were evident using cubist fig 7g h and i the predicted θ for ann fig 7m n and o and mlr fig 7p and q of σ and depth were equivalent however the issue with these methods appears to be poor resolution of intermediate values of θ this is particularly the case in the subsurface and subsoil at 6 days and then resolving topsoil and subsurface drying whereby the depth of drying seems to be over predicted 3 11 2 modelling of θ using svm fig 8 shows predicted θ prior to fig 8a during b g and various days post irrigation commencing fig 8h q using svm the advancing wetting front was well resolved and predicted the better resolution was a function of the additional eca and also because em4soil considers neighbouring sites there was a slight issue in the subsoil prediction of θ and at 2 5 fig 8c and 4 5 fig 8d hours behind the wetting front however this appeared to be a function of the em38 eca rather than modelling nevertheless the modelling reflects the wetting and drying phases of the furrow irrigation system the results are also an advance on previous research carried out on a preliminary investigation by zare et al 2020 on this field in that research the lin s concordance 0 84 was slightly smaller than that achieved herein using the svm 0 91 with the most obvious reason being that in the previous research the range in measured θ was smaller 0 21 m3 m 3 compared to that herein 0 36 m3 m 3 this was because of two reasons in the first instance it was because eca was only collected during the wetting phase secondly the θ prior to irrigation was closer to saturation in the subsoil and this made it difficult to resolve the rapidly changing topsoil θ to better model the subtle changes in θ between the topsoil subsurface and subsoil particularly given the fact that the subsoil wetting front advances ahead of the topsoil we suggest the use of a dualem 1hs instrument would be appropriate this is because it has four theoretical depths of measurement from the two coil pairs available specifically 0 5mhcon 0 0 75 m and 1 mhcon 0 1 5 m have equivalent depths of measurement as em38h0 0 0 75 m and em38v0 0 1 5 m however the advantage of the dualem 1hs is the 0 5mpcon 0 0 3 m and 1 mpcon 0 0 5 m eca which allows for better resolution of topsoil and subsurface σ and therefore prediction of θ in the upper and lower subsoil using a light weight and relatively short dualem 1hs would enable the collection of eca data at more locations i e 5 m spacing than what we have undertook here the problem of the stickiness and poor trafficability of the vertosols still needs to be resolved however it was clear from this research that the collection of eca data at multiple heights was not advantageous or of any practical value to improving prediction owing to the highly correlated nature of eca with measured θ regardless of height moreover the approach and the results achieved herein heralds its application to other irrigation systems including travelling or lateral irrigation systems 3 12 modelling of θ using svm and variable calibration sites table 7 shows the summary statistics of results for varying number of sites available to develop a calibration between θ with σ and depth using svm we based the comparison using varying numbers of diminishing calibration sites to predict θ at site 3 when we considered 7 calibration sites we achieved a good calibration r2 0 86 and were able to predict θ very well at the validation site lin s concordance 0 88 equivalent results were achieved when we considered the use of 6 and 5 sites in terms of calibration r2 0 86 with the validation at site 3 producing strong 1 1 relationship between measured and predicted θ lin s concordance 0 89 and 0 88 respectively with decreasing calibration sites the results actually improved slightly in terms of calibration in fact when we only had one site for calibration i e site 5 we achieved the largest correlation r2 0 93 while the validation was the smallest it was still very strong lin s concordance 0 86 4 conclusions the collection of em38 eca data alone or its inversion to produce estimates of true electrical conductivity σ ms m 1 provides useful information for soil moisture monitoring this data can be calibrated against θ m3 m 3 across a furrow irrigated cotton field to predict and monitor θ during a wetting and drying cycle in terms of irrigation management the approach has applications for understanding the spatio temporal aspects of improving timing in irrigation and evaluation of efficiency another potential application is to use the approach to better understand the efficacy of lateral and bank less channel irrigation systems which are increasingly being deployed in australian cotton growing areas we recommend the spacing needs should be reduced to at least 5 m to better account for the variation in θ and to capture the subsoil wetting front which advances much more quickly down the furrow than the topsoil wetting front this will enable less smoothing of predicted θ because em4soil considers neighbouring sites during inversion to better elucidate the topsoil 0 15 m and subsurface 0 45 m θ from subsoil θ 0 75 m we recommend a dualem 1hs instrument this is because more eca would be available from the 1 m pcon and hcon coils which are equivalent to those of the em38 used herein but also the 0 5 m pcon and hcon coils because more eca would be available to better estimate σ in the topsoil and therefore predict θ our experiment also showed that satisfactory results could be achieved across the study transect from any number of calibration sites however owing to the uniform nature of the soil and the time lapse nature of imaging this could be limited to a single calibration point this has practical implications for irrigators and consultants in establishing a calibration between em38 eca and θ in addition and considering the results at day 10 when permanent wilting point was achieved in terms of θ irrigation scheduling could be recommended based on the use of the em38h0 80 ms m 1 and em38v0 100 ms m 1 reached critical measurements the actual inversion approach could also be used across the field to ascertain the uniform nature and efficacy of flood irrigation declaration of competing

10501,understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of soil volumetric water content θ m3 m 3 at field level is required to maximise water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture several commercial sensors are available however they only provide point information to value add to this soil data mathematical models can be used in conjunction with proximal sensed data such as soil apparent electrical conductivity eca ms m 1 or inverted eca σ ms m 1 in this research we determine if eca from an electromagnetic em instrument em38 at various heights 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m or σ estimated from eca can be used to value add to limited θ at four depths i e 0 15 0 45 0 75 and 1 35 m moreover we compare which mathematical i e multiple linear regression mlr random forest rf cubist

inversion water use efficiency 1 introduction vertosols which have large clay content 35 shrink swell properties that exhibit slickensides i e shiny ped surfaces and or lenticular structural aggregates at depth dominate the clay alluvial plains of northern new south wales owing to the cracking nature of the soil vertosols have been developed extensively for irrigated agricultural production in the northern murray darling basin this has mostly been for cotton production however owing to the issue of deep drainage silburn et al 2014 and identification of water use inefficiencies roth et al 2014 in flood irrigation improvements in irrigation management are required this is because climate change forecasts and modelling dai 2013 for south east australia suggest reduced rainfall hotter conditions and therefore less water for evapotranspiration moreover there are increasing and competing demands for water from mining environment and domestic applications to improve water use efficiency and irrigation management farmers need to be able to measure and monitor soil volumetric water content θ m3 m 3 during wetting and drying cycles to generate the necessary information about the spatial variation in θ data is required at multiple depths and from various locations however the standard method i e laboratory measured gravimetric moisture is time consuming and labour intensive moreover it involves destructive sampling and requires determination of the soil bulk density ρ gcm 3 brevik and fenton 2004 in addition θ measurements are required daily alternatively field sensors which can be installed a priori have been used to measure and monitor θ for example kodikara et al 2014 and al ain et al 2009 used neutron probes in urban and salt affected areas respectively however chanasyk and naeth 1996 indicated issues related to measuring θ in the near surface and smoothing of θ across texture discontinuities time domain reflectometry tdr or capacitance probes cp can provide depth specific measurements of θ baumhardt et al 2000 moreover domain frequency sensors e g decagon gs3 have also been used however these sensors and data loggers are expensive given multiples are required to measure and monitor θ in topsoil 0 15 m subsurface 0 45 m and subsoil 0 6 m to value add to these sensors time lapse electrical resistivity tomography measurements can be used to extrapolate between their locations moghadas and badorreck 2019 electromagnetic em induction instruments have also been proposed as a source of digital data for soil moisture monitoring this data can be used to value add to the point θ data and extrapolate across at the field scale this is because the soil apparent electrical conductivity eca ms m 1 which is measured from em instruments is influenced by θ owing to the polarity of the water molecule while eca is also related to other soil properties such as clay content mineralogy and salinity if these three are similar across a given field most of the response or changes in eca over time and during a wetting drying cycle can be modelled relative to θ in terms of θ huang et al 2017a 2017b established a calibration between estimates of true electrical conductivity σ ms m 1 derived from inversion of dualem 421 eca and θ at 5 sites along a single uniform loamy sand transect and over a 12 day period to model and monitor water use beneath an overhead irrigated lucerne field in san jacinto southern california a similar 2 d approach was used at 8 sites but across a sprinkler irrigated field near camden in southern sydney nsw australia huang et al 2017a therein an ensemble kalman filter enkf approach was developed in 2 d and subsequently used to monitor and nowcast 3 dimensional θ dynamics on 20 separate days over a period of 40 days on a plot scale a similar approach using 5 sites was used beneath an olive tree to monitor θ in cordoba spain martinez et al 2018 from estimates of σ from a dualem 21 in most research pertaining to em inversion and monitoring of θ single frequency multi coil sensors have been used to estimate σ and related to time varying θ at multiple calibration sites using either a dualem e g huang et al 2017a 2017b or cmd mini explorer moghadas et al 2019 in addition multiple sites have been used to develop a calibration using mostly simple linear or curve linear relationships in this research we seek to determine if eca measured from a em38 in horizontal em38 h or vertical ev38v modes at various heights 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m can be used to value add to limited θ we also determine if a relationship can be established between σ and θ using mathematical i e multiple linear regression mlr random forest rf cubist support vector machine svm and artificial neural networks ann models we also determine and evaluate the number of calibration sites required to make a satisfactory model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study field is in the lower namoi valley of northern new south wales australia fig 1 a it is located at the new south wales department of primary industries australian cotton research institute acri 201 m above sea level 30 11 41 s 149 36 20 e which is 20 km to west of narrabri the experiment was sited at the southern end of experimental field c1 which is used for furrow irrigation to trial various cotton rotation farming systems including but not limited to winter wheat triticum sp and legumes dolichus sp in conjunction with cotton gossypium sp the field run is approximately 200 m long the climate is semi arid with mean annual rainfall of approximately 643 mm and potential evaporation over 1800 mm the rainfall is slightly summer dominant with a mean maximum in january 79 8 mm and minimum in august 37 5 mm temperature varies from a mean maximum in january 35 3 c to a minimum in july 17 0 c stannard and kelly 1977 recognized three major physiographic units near the field including clay plain prior stream and terminal prior stream deposits the clay plain dominates characterised by a grey self mulching vertic clay i e grey vertosols isbell 2002 these surround the acri and are used extensively for irrigated cotton production triantafilis et al 2000 2 2 soil moisture sensors installation and soil samples collection to monitor θ m3 m 3 8 sites located approximately 20 m apart were selected site 1 was located 20 m from the head ditch at the eastern end of the field while site 8 was positioned 20 m from the tail ditch to the west at each site a large pit was excavated decagon gs3 decagon devices inc wa usa sensors were then installed at depths of 0 15 0 45 0 75 and 1 35 m they approximately represent θ in the topsoil 0 0 3 m subsurface 0 3 0 6 m shallow 0 6 0 9 m and deep subsoil 1 2 1 5 m respectively the reason that this type of sensor was selected is factory calibration for θ is accurate to 0 03 m3 m 3 in mineral soils when the bulk soil ec is 10 ds m 1 this has been examined and confirmed by son et al 2017 in soils with different textures e g silty clay the sensors are capable of measuring not only θ m3 m 3 but also temperature oc and bulk electrical conductivity σ b ms m 1 these three measured data were collected and logged every 5 min using a decagon em50 during the entire duration of the experiment the field was irrigated furrow on 31 january 2018 water was applied from the head ditch in the east and flowed toward the tail ditch under the influence of gravity at the 8 selected sites and two extra points near the head and tail ditch and from within the soil pits soil samples were collected at depths of 0 15 0 45 0 75 and 1 35 m the samples were oven dried 60 c and ground to pass a 2 mm sieve the hydrometer method was used with 5 sodium hexametaphosphate as the dispersing agent to determine the particle size fractions i e clay silt and sand soil salinity ece ds m 1 was estimated from ec1 5 using conversion factor 6 7 for heavy clay soil slavich and petterson 1993 the ph was determined from a 1 5 soil water extract tucker 1974 method was used to determine the cation exchange capacity cec cmol kg 1 using a mechanical leaching device briefly samples were first washed with 60 ethanol to remove any soluble salts followed by extraction with 1 m nh4cl the extracts were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 2 3 em instrumentation and eca data collection soil apparent electrical conductivity eca was collected using a geonics em38 mississauga ontario canada the em38 eca was measured in horizontal em38 h and vertical em38v modes given operating frequency i e 14 5 khz and coil spacing 1 0 m the theoretical depth of exploration is respectively 0 75 em38h0 and 1 5 m em38v0 when the instrument is on the ground mcneill 1990 in this study em38 h and em38v eca was measured at heights of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m we delineate these with subscripts e g 0 2 m height em38h0 2 and em38v0 2 the eca data were collected from the head ditch to the tail ditch and at 10 m spacing in total 19 positions were visited fig 1b the em38 was positioned directly above and in alignment with the bed east west a graduated wooden rod enabled em38 to be positioned at correct height on the day of irrigation the eca were collected before irrigation commenced 0 h later six subsequent eca measurement passes were made during irrigation 1 2 5 4 5 6 7 5 and 9 h irrigation ceased after 9 h from here and every day after irrigation commenced 2 10 days eca data was collected at 9 00 am altogether 17 eca data measurement campaigns were conducted 2 3 1 correction of eca data based on soil temperature and ambient temperature to account for soil temperature variation from one day to the next and to correct eca data to a standard soil temperature i e 25 c corwin and lesch 2005 empirically showed that this could be done by multiplying the measured eca data with a factor t using the following equation 1 f t 0 4470 1 4034 e t 26 815 where t is the soil temperature herein the eca data associated with the different em38 channels and heights of measurement were adjusted to a standard ambient temperature i e 25 c using equation 1 the input soil temperature t for different depths and times were provided from those measured by decagon gs3 sensors simultaneously with θ measurements 2 4 quasi 2d inversion of em38 data the em4soil software package 2018 was used to invert em38 eca and generate electromagnetic conductivity images emci specifically estimates of σ the software operates for eca collected at low induction numbers monteiro santos et al 2010 with an optimal emci arrived at by varying parameters including forward model inversion algorithm and damping factor λ a emci is formulated from minimization of the difference between measured and calculated eca generated from a forward model in forward modelling calculations consider the cumulative function cf model proposed by mcneill 1980 or non linear full solution fs model based on maxwell s equations e g wait 1982 frischknecht 1988 at low induction numbers the cf model is preferred due to their simplicity and speed when eca is acquired over conductive soil i e 100 ms m 1 the full solution fs is preferable inversion modelling is conducted using a one dimensional laterally constrained approach auken et al 2002 where two dimensional smoothness constraints are imposed the inversion algorithms are variations of occam regularization the s2 constrains emci variation around a reference model and consequently produces smoother inversions than s1 also λ can be varied which smooths data with increasing values we aim to determine the optimal emci by adjusting λ as a regularization parameter for the quasi 2d inversion of em38 eca at the ground surface em38h0 and em38v0 or at various heights e g em38h0 2 and em38v0 2 in terms of λ we set it from 0 07 0 3 and at 0 3 increments thereafter to a maximum of 6 0 inversion of eca data collected on each day were generated with a maximum of 20 iterations owing to the large eca we set the initial model of the σ to an average of σ 100 ms m 1 to determine the most suitable parameters the largest coefficient of determination r2 between σ and θ was identified we did this by obtaining σ from the emci on the first survey and on each of the 16 subsequent surveys and correlating these with θ at the corresponding time 2 5 modelling methods five mathematical models were chosen to predict θ the mathematical models were mlr rf cubist svm and ann all the modelling in this study were performed using r software meyer et al 2014 2 5 1 mlr we use a mlr model which is of the form 2 y a b1x1 b2x2 bkxk ε where y is vector of the target property i e θ and where xk represent the kth predictor variable i e em38 eca data in the horizontal em38 h or vertical em38v modes or estimates of σ from em inversion of eca while a is the intercept b the slope and ε is the model s residual to produce a model to predict θ at independent depths we first determine the best mlr which can be developed between em38 eca data in the horizontal em38 h and vertical em38v modes at various heights including at the ground surface em38h0 and em38v0 we also compare mlr of em38 h and em38v at various heights 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m with the ground surface to find the best set of predictors the fixed effects were determined prior to model building and by using backwards elimination until all predictors had a probability of being selected 0 01 2 5 2 rf the rf is an ensemble of unpruned trees whereby each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of training data with prediction made by averaging their output via regression the algorithm for growing a rf of b trees is as follows 1 for b 1 to b 2 draw a bootstrap sample xi of size n from the training data x i e σ from inversion or eca 3 grow a random forest tree tb to the bootstrapped data by recursively repeating the following steps for each terminal node of the tree until the minimum node size nmin is reached lowerroman 4 randomly select m variables i e σ and depth from the p variables i e σ or depth lowerroman 5 pick the best variable split point among the m and lowerroman 6 split the node into two daughter nodes 7 make a prediction at a new location y ˆ i e θ 3 y ˆ x 1 b b 1 b t b x the caret package in r kuhn et al 2017 was used to fit the rf model 2 5 3 cubist the cubist model is capable of first identifying which criteria are useful for partitioning the variables i e σ and depth secondly for each partition it fits a mlr to predict θ this approach is described as a decision tree adams and sterling 1992 with the variables used for partitioning called nodes and the mlr under each partition called leaves in addition the cubist software provides the attribute usage relative importance of each variable in each partition the cubist model was fitted using cubist package in r kuhn et al 2014 2 5 4 svm a svm performs well on problems that are nonlinear sparse and are high dimensional the svm achieve this by using kernel functions to project the data onto a new hyperspace where complex non linear patterns can be simply represented gunn 1998 and williams 2011 svm predictions are calculated using the following function 4 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x j d where f x is the target property i e θ k x i x j of a user defined kernel function where x is the feature vector i e σ from inversion of eca and d is a constant threshold the kernel function used herein is an isotropic gaussian radial basis function 5 k x i x j e x i x j 2 2 γ 2 with the bandwidth parameter γ the α i a n d α i are the weights lagrange multipliers which determine the influence of each point in the model the weights α i a n d α i are obtained from the solution of a quadratic programming optimisation problem platt 1999 and smola and schölkopf 2004 of the form m a x α α 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n α i α i α j α j k x i x j 6 ε i 1 n α i α i i 1 n y i α i α i the constraints are given as follows 7 s u b j e c t t o i 1 n α i α i 0 0 α i α i c f o r i 1 n where ε is the specified non negative contant c is the regularization parameter that defines the trade off between training error and model complexity i e flatness of f x the best parameters c and γ obtained using the training data were 5 and 0 1 respectively in this work we applied the svm from the e1071 and caret packages meyer et al 2014 in r 2 5 5 artificial neural network anns the artificial neural network ann modelling technique was also chosen to fit the relationship between σ inverted from eca and θ this is because it is a data driven approach which simulates features of neural networks that address a range of difficult information processing analysis and modelling problems de smith et al 2007 neural networks achieve this by using hidden units between input and directs them through an activation function as the output the units can be layers or nodes within the layers this allows the hidden units to accomplish nonlinear transformations of the inputs entered in the network depending on their associated weights the hidden units may vary in this study we chose 3 hidden units i e one layer with 3 nodes because fewer units failed to reflect the complex inter relationship and too many units led to over fitting of the ann model the ann was fitted using neuralnet package in r günther and fritsch 2010 in terms of validation k fold cross validation was adopted here this method partitions the training set into k i e 8 sets the learner model trains k times for every model complexity on every occasion it uses one of the sets as the validation set and the training data is the remaining sets after calculating the average error over the k runs the model complexity with the smallest average error will be selected it can return the model with that complexity trained on all the data 2 5 6 validation and evaluating prediction accuracy bias and concordance to compare various models we used a leave one out cross validation specifically we removed a whole site including all depth and times then fitted the different models using the calibration dataset and applied to the point left out given there were 8 sites this was done eight times a number of indices including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean error me were considered with the latter two a measure of prediction accuracy and bias respectively in both cases a smaller number close to zero is an indication of good performance the lin s concordance correlation coefficient is also used herein as a measure of the agreement between measured and predicted θ that is how close predictions falls along a 45 degree line from the origin to the measured data lawrence and lin 1989 3 results and

6 9 fig 2f shows cec was uniform and between 20 and 26 cmol kg 1 suggesting the soil has moderate shrink swell potential 3 2 summary statistics of eca table 1 shows summary statistics of eca ms m 1 from em38 at various heights i e 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 m the em38v0 had the largest mean 103 0 ms m 1 followed by the em38h0 94 7 the mean eca decreased with increasing height the eca was most skewed 0 6 for em38h0 which also had largest 29 coefficient of variation cv with increasing height of eca measurement cv and skewness decreased we attribute these results to the variable moisture content of topsoil specifically prior to irrigation during irrigation and as the soil dried after irrigation ceased 3 3 summary statistics of time lapse θ table 2 shows summary statistics of mean decagon gs3 measured θ m3 m 3 for all sites at various depths e g topsoil 0 15 m and various times the minimum 0 20 m3 m 3 topsoil θ according to gardiner and miller 2004 would be close to permanent wilting point 0 25 m3 m 3 for heavy clay 60 textured soil this was expected given field had not been irrigated for two weeks nevertheless the maximum 0 56 m3 m 3 subsoil θ was large and reflects θ beyond field capacity 0 42 m3 m 3 for heavy clays gardiner and miller 2004 the large coefficient of variation cv of topsoil 27 2 and subsurface 14 41 θ reflects the variable nature of θ at various times before during irrigation and days after irrigation commenced the larger standard deviation sd of topsoil 0 10 and subsurface 0 07 θ compared to the subsurface 0 06 and subsoil 0 06 shows the upper two layers were affected by the wetting and drying cycles despite the variation soil θ was at or near field capacity for most of the experiment 3 4 distribution of measured eca along transect fig 3 shows the em38 eca from ground surface 0 m and at various times fig 3a shows em38h0 and em38v0 before irrigation commenced and excluding the head ditch and tail ditch em38h0 40 ms m 1 was smaller than em38v0 60 ms m 1 fig 3b shows that the em38h0 75 ms m 1 and em38v0 80 ms m 1 increased near the head ditch and as a function of water progressing down the field past site 1 and 1 h after irrigation commenced fig 3c g show a steady increased in eca between 2 5 and 9 h when irrigation ceased fig 3h j show em38h0 75 ms m 1 decreased and was equivalent to em38v0 80 ms m 1 between days 2 4 fig 3k p shows that the em38h0 decreased much more rapidly than the em38v0 between days 5 10 this would be due to the soil drying as a function of the evapotranspiration occurring in the topsoil subsurface and upper subsoil driven by the growing cotton crop fig 3q shows that the em38h0 was smaller than the em38v0 on day 10 but both measurements were not as small as day 0 and prior to irrigation commencing 3 5 distribution of measured θ along transect fig 4 shows measured θ at various times at the 8 sites where the decagon gs3 sensors were installed fig 4a shows that before irrigation commenced 0 h θ was at or near saturation 0 5 m3 m 3 only near the tail ditch site 8 and in the upper 0 75 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m in the topsoil 0 15 m θ was small 0 25 m3 m 3 at the head and tail ditch ends and close to permanent wilting point 0 25 m3 m 3 for a heavy clay soil gardiner and miller 2004 with increasing depth θ increased 0 3 0 35 m3 m 3 and was wetter in the subsoil

topsoil and subsurface wetting to site 4 with deeper subsoil wetting near site 5 and 6 respectively fig 4f 7 5 h and fig 4g 9 h show wetting fronts at site 7 and 8 respectively fig 4h through to fig

between average eca and measured soil properties table 3 shows coefficients of determination r2 between average 0 1 5 m soil properties and em38 eca collected at ground level before irrigation the r2 between em38h0 was significant p 0 05 statistically for sand r2 0 61 and clay 0 55 but not silt 0 45 the r2 between em38h0 and ece 0 07 ph1 5 r2 0 14 and cec 0 33 were small but larger for θ 0 57 the r2 between em38v0 was largest for sand r2 0 61 and clay 0 57 the r2 between em38h0 and θ was statistically significant and slightly larger 0 63 than sand 3 7 coefficient of determination r2 between eca and θ table 4 a shows r2 of four independent mlr relationships between measured θ and em38 h and em38v with respect to topsoil the best r2 was between θ and em38h0 and em38v0 0 76 this was also the case for subsurface 0 85 and deep subsoil 0 75 θ with regards to shallow subsoil θ the r2 was equivalent 0 85 when mlr was developed using both em38 h and em38v at multiple heights of 0 and 0 2 m there was no improvement in r2 when the instrument was raised table 4b shows the mlr at one height and at ground surface the results show r2 were on par with when instrument was on the ground considering largest r2 were achieved with em38h0 and to a lesser extent em38v0 these two eca were the only two considered during inversion 3 8 coefficient of determination r2 between estimated σ and measured θ fig 5 shows coefficient of determination r2 between estimates of true electrical conductivity σ and measured θ at all depths and survey times in estimating σ we only considered em38h0 and em38v0 and using different sets of inversion parameters including forward model i e cf and fs inversion i e s1 and s2 algorithm and different λ values regardless of forward model or inversion algorithm larger r2 between σ and θ were when λ was small 1 2 the cf produced consistently larger r2 compared to fs with s1 and relative to λ this was attributed to eca approximating low induction numbers 100 ms m 1 the largest r2 0 56 was between σ derived from em38h0 and em38v0 and θ using cf forward model s1 inversion algorithm and λ 0 6 given these results we compare and contrast calibration model development between σ and θ using estimates of σ derived from cf forward model s1 inversion algorithms and λ 0 6 using rf cubist svm ann we also develop a mlr between θ with σ and depth 3 9 coefficient of determination r2 between σ and measured soil properties table 5 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between measured soil properties at all depths and estimates of true electrical conductivity σ ms m 1 estimated from em38 eca collected at ground level in horizontal em38h0 and vertical em38v0 modes and all time steps the r2 between σ was small and not statistically significant for sand 0 03 silt 0 05 and clay 0 08 and σ with ece 0 07 ph1 5 r2 0 14 and cec 0 01 the r2 for σ and θ 0 62 was statistically significant p 0 001 the results indicate while eca was influenced by average 0 1 5 m clay sand and θ this was not the case for estimated σ which was influenced by changes in θ 3 10 mlr between eca and θ table 6 a shows the four different mlr equations used to predict θ from eca for different depths and considering only the em38h0 and em38v0 the intercepts a were uniform albeit slightly larger in topsoil 0 273 and subsurface 0 278 compared to upper 0 228 and lower subsoil 0 233 the slope b was larger for em38h0 in topsoil 0 007 and the subsurface 0 003 the opposite was the case for em38v0 these results were consistent with theoretical depth of exploration specifically em38h0 would be expected to relate to topsoil 0 15 m and subsurface 0 45 m θ while em38v0 would be expected to be related to upper 0 75 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m table 6b shows the leave one out cross validation of the use of the mlr equations when used to predict θ from eca for the four different depths and considering only the em38h0 and em38v0 the results show that for all depths the prediction accuracy was small as was the bias for example topsoil prediction of θ was good given rmse 0 04 was less than half of the standard deviation 0 10 of measured θ the me 0 also indicated unbiased prediction the leave one out cross validation show that the r2 values were large e g upper subsoil 0 80 the 1 1 relationship was also large as exemplified by upper subsoil lin s correlation coefficient 0 88 3 11 modelling relationship between eca or σ and θ fig 6 shows measured versus predicted θ summary statistics of various models and considering a leave one out cross validation fig 6a shows four different mlr in table 6a and using em38h0 and em38v0 and from the data shown in table 6b overall measured and predicted θ were in good accord lin s concordance 0 90 with a strong correlation coefficient r2 0 82 with good accuracy rmse 0 03 and unbiased predictions me 0 given rmse was smaller than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ these predictions were satisfactory singh et al 2005 fig 6b shows leave one out cross validation of rf using σ and depth overall there was a good 1 1 fit but lin s concordance 0 81 and r2 were smaller 0 67 nevertheless predictions of θ were unbiased 0 with rmse 0 04 again less than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ fig 6c shows cubist using σ and depth was on parity with combined mlr using eca as indicated by lin s concordance 0 89 and r2 0 79 predictions were also unbiased 0 however rmse 0 05 was a little larger than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ what is evident in fig 6b and c is that measured θ at large 0 45 m3 m 3 and intermediate 0 3 0 4 m3 m 3 values were under and over predicted with respect to under prediction this was the case in the subsurface 0 45 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m over prediction was evident in the lower subsoil we attribute this to rf not performing well in time series analysis particularly when significant trends in increasing and decreasing values nau 2015 exist this was problematic herein because we removed all data at one point during leave one out cross validation since rf predicts an average value during calibration to the points it has not seen before nau 2015 this causes under and over prediction additionally the wetting front differs in the topsoil and subsoil and this causes the difficulty with respect to cubist the problem arises because predictions generated using nearby points therefore it performs poorly when all data at one point is removed during leave one out cross validation kuhn and johnson 2013 fig 6d shows the results when the relationship between θ from σ and depth at all times was developed using svm the lin s concordance 0 91 and the r2 0 83 were larger than any other model fig 6e shows the results when the ann model was employed using σ and depth the 1 1 fit lin s concordance 0 86 for θ was smaller than mlr of eca the r2 was also smaller 0 76 the rmse for the svm 0 04 and ann 0 04 were smaller than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ at all depths in terms of overall ranking the best approach was to invert the em38h0 and em38v0 with σ and depth modelled to θ using svm this was followed by mlr of em38h0 and em38v0 eca and θ however the latter approach does not allow for predictions to be made at depths where measurements in θ were not made given depth specific nature of the calibrations in this respect and in spite of not being as strong in terms of lin s concordance and r2 the use of rf and ann would not be preferred this would also be the case for cubist which was superior to rf based on lin s but prediction accuracy rmse 0 05 was larger than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ fig 6f shows if a simpler mlr model can be developed between θ using σ and depth the summary statistics indicate that measured and predicted θ were in accord lin s concordance 0 84 with a strong correlation coefficient r2 0 73 this approach was a slight improvement on rf but not as good as ann nevertheless accuracy rmse 0 04 was good and smaller than half the standard deviation 0 045 of measured θ in all modelling approaches the predictions were unbiased me 0 00 3 11 1 modelling of θ using various modelling approaches fig 7 a shows predicted θ during irrigation 6 h and using mlr of em38h0 and em38v0 eca fig 7b day 5 and 7c day 11 show predicted θ several days after irrigation commenced the difference between plots of measured θ shown at 6 h fig 4e 5 figure 4 l and 11 fig 4q days and predicted θ was there were twice as many data points i e 19 available given eca was collected at 10 m intervals there was an issue with short scale subsoil predicted θ day 11 that was not reflected in measured θ predicted θ using rf can be seen at 6 h figs 7d e and 10 in fig 7f days while the patterns were consistent with measured θ under prediction was evident in the subsurface 0 45 m and lower subsoil 1 35 m behind wetting front over prediction in advance of wetting front was evident in lower subsoil near the tail ditch similar patterns were evident using cubist fig 7g h and i the predicted θ for ann fig 7m n and o and mlr fig 7p and q of σ and depth were equivalent however the issue with these methods appears to be poor resolution of intermediate values of θ this is particularly the case in the subsurface and subsoil at 6 days and then resolving topsoil and subsurface drying whereby the depth of drying seems to be over predicted 3 11 2 modelling of θ using svm fig 8 shows predicted θ prior to fig 8a during b g and various days post irrigation commencing fig 8h q using svm the advancing wetting front was well resolved and predicted the better resolution was a function of the additional eca and also because em4soil considers neighbouring sites there was a slight issue in the subsoil prediction of θ and at 2 5 fig 8c and 4 5 fig 8d hours behind the wetting front however this appeared to be a function of the em38 eca rather than modelling nevertheless the modelling reflects the wetting and drying phases of the furrow irrigation system the results are also an advance on previous research carried out on a preliminary investigation by zare et al 2020 on this field in that research the lin s concordance 0 84 was slightly smaller than that achieved herein using the svm 0 91 with the most obvious reason being that in the previous research the range in measured θ was smaller 0 21 m3 m 3 compared to that herein 0 36 m3 m 3 this was because of two reasons in the first instance it was because eca was only collected during the wetting phase secondly the θ prior to irrigation was closer to saturation in the subsoil and this made it difficult to resolve the rapidly changing topsoil θ to better model the subtle changes in θ between the topsoil subsurface and subsoil particularly given the fact that the subsoil wetting front advances ahead of the topsoil we suggest the use of a dualem 1hs instrument would be appropriate this is because it has four theoretical depths of measurement from the two coil pairs available specifically 0 5mhcon 0 0 75 m and 1 mhcon 0 1 5 m have equivalent depths of measurement as em38h0 0 0 75 m and em38v0 0 1 5 m however the advantage of the dualem 1hs is the 0 5mpcon 0 0 3 m and 1 mpcon 0 0 5 m eca which allows for better resolution of topsoil and subsurface σ and therefore prediction of θ in the upper and lower subsoil using a light weight and relatively short dualem 1hs would enable the collection of eca data at more locations i e 5 m spacing than what we have undertook here the problem of the stickiness and poor trafficability of the vertosols still needs to be resolved however it was clear from this research that the collection of eca data at multiple heights was not advantageous or of any practical value to improving prediction owing to the highly correlated nature of eca with measured θ regardless of height moreover the approach and the results achieved herein heralds its application to other irrigation systems including travelling or lateral irrigation systems 3 12 modelling of θ using svm and variable calibration sites table 7 shows the summary statistics of results for varying number of sites available to develop a calibration between θ with σ and depth using svm we based the comparison using varying numbers of diminishing calibration sites to predict θ at site 3 when we considered 7 calibration sites we achieved a good calibration r2 0 86 and were able to predict θ very well at the validation site lin s concordance 0 88 equivalent results were achieved when we considered the use of 6 and 5 sites in terms of calibration r2 0 86 with the validation at site 3 producing strong 1 1 relationship between measured and predicted θ lin s concordance 0 89 and 0 88 respectively with decreasing calibration sites the results actually improved slightly in terms of calibration in fact when we only had one site for calibration i e site 5 we achieved the largest correlation r2 0 93 while the validation was the smallest it was still very strong lin s concordance 0 86 4 conclusions the collection of em38 eca data alone or its inversion to produce estimates of true electrical conductivity σ ms m 1 provides useful information for soil moisture monitoring this data can be calibrated against θ m3 m 3 across a furrow irrigated cotton field to predict and monitor θ during a wetting and drying cycle in terms of irrigation management the approach has applications for understanding the spatio temporal aspects of improving timing in irrigation and evaluation of efficiency another potential application is to use the approach to better understand the efficacy of lateral and bank less channel irrigation systems which are increasingly being deployed in australian cotton growing areas we recommend the spacing needs should be reduced to at least 5 m to better account for the variation in θ and to capture the subsoil wetting front which advances much more quickly down the furrow than the topsoil wetting front this will enable less smoothing of predicted θ because em4soil considers neighbouring sites during inversion to better elucidate the topsoil 0 15 m and subsurface 0 45 m θ from subsoil θ 0 75 m we recommend a dualem 1hs instrument this is because more eca would be available from the 1 m pcon and hcon coils which are equivalent to those of the em38 used herein but also the 0 5 m pcon and hcon coils because more eca would be available to better estimate σ in the topsoil and therefore predict θ our experiment also showed that satisfactory results could be achieved across the study transect from any number of calibration sites however owing to the uniform nature of the soil and the time lapse nature of imaging this could be limited to a single calibration point this has practical implications for irrigators and consultants in establishing a calibration between em38 eca and θ in addition and considering the results at day 10 when permanent wilting point was achieved in terms of θ irrigation scheduling could be recommended based on the use of the em38h0 80 ms m 1 and em38v0 100 ms m 1 reached critical measurements the actual inversion approach could also be used across the field to ascertain the uniform nature and efficacy of flood irrigation declaration of competing

10502,lezíria grande is an important agricultural area in portugal prone to waterlogging and salinity problems due to the influence of estuarine tides on groundwater dynamics simple non invasive practical approaches are need for monitoring soil salinity in the region and preventing further degradation of soil resources the objective of this study was to develop regression models for soil salinity assessment in lezíria grande based on the relationship between multi year crop reflectance data derived from sentinel 2 multispectral imagery and rootzone salinity nine vegetation indices vi computed from the annual averages of the spectral bands were tested between 2017 and 2019 the multi year maximum from each pixel was then used for correlating the vi with the ground truth dataset this dataset was composed of average values of the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece mean measured in 80 sampling sites 0 1 5 m depth located in four agricultural fields representative of the salinity gradient in the region the canopy response salinity index crsi which uses the blue 490 nm green 560 nm red 665 nm and infrared 842 nm bands provided the strongest correlation with measured data r 0 787 regression models further considered vegetation cover and soil type as explanatory variables with predictions resulting in a coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 and a root mean square error rmse varying from 1 63 to 3 26 ds m 1 the use of remote sensing data for soil salinity assessment showed to be an interesting option to consider in future soil monitoring programs nevertheless more detailed covariates are needed for improving salinity assessment models at the regional scale keywords canopy response salinity index soil environmental covariates multi year maximum multiple regression analysis rootzone salinity 1 introduction soil salinization is a major abiotic constraint affecting food production particularly in arid semi arid and sub humid regions rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2009 minhas et al 2020 in these water scarce regions salts tend to accumulate in the soil profile due to high evaporative demand increasing the osmotic stress that affects soil water availability and root water uptake while also potentially promoting the development of ion toxicities and imbalances in plants as a result crop growth transpiration rates and yields are reduced when soil salinity reaches a certain tolerance threshold with higher levels ultimately leading to crop failure maas and hoffman 1977 in addition high sodium saturation of the soil exchange complex may further affect soil water relationships and structural stability which will result in the dispersion of soil colloids that alter the movement of water and air reducing soil infiltration favoring water stagnation and potentially causing anoxic conditions in the rootzone minhas et al 2020 the best available estimates suggest that about 412 million ha are affected by salinity and 618 million ha by sodicity either due to natural causes rock weathering sea water and accession of salt in marine sediments and atmospheric deposition or human induced processes poor irrigation water management and the overexploitation of saline groundwater resources fao 2015 yet these estimates are known to be based on expert judgment from individual countries or regions rather than on quantitative measurements on the extent of soil salinity and sodicity lobell et al 2007 scudiero et al 2014a therefore over the last few decades the scientific community has invested considerable time and resources in the development of rapid non invasive and cost effective methods for large scale assessment of the spatial and temporal distribution of salt affected areas allbed and kumar 2013 corwin and scudiero 2019 corwin 2020 several remote sensing technologies have been developed with early works focusing on salinity assessment at or near the soil surface based on the different reflectance properties of salt crusts when compared with non salt affected soils allbed and kumar 2013 however the fact that in agricultural soils salts tend to accumulate deeper in the rootzone rather than at the soil surface has been shifting the paradigm of research and remote sensing applications with crop yields lobell et al 2007 scudiero et al 2014b and crop health status lobell et al 2010 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 scudiero et al 2014a 2015 being now increasingly used as a proxy for rootzone salinity several vegetation indices exist for large scale assessment of multiple crop characteristics e g leaf area index biomass and stresses e g water nutrient plagues and diseases using satellite spectral bands as input mulla 2013 crop canopy reflectance has also shown to be a good indicator for saline stress conditions increasing in the visible range and decreasing in the near infrared corwin and scudiero 2019 but only when considering the integrals of vegetation indices derived over a crop growing season zhang et al 2015 or when vegetation indices were computed from multi year spectral data lobell et al 2010 wu et al 2014 scudiero et al 2014a 2015 in the former approach zhang et al 2015 assumed that vegetation indices could provide information on crop physiology with the seasonally integrated response of these indices representing the sum or accumulation of seasonal photosynthetic activity expressed as biomass those authors were able to test their methodology using ground data from the yellow river delta in the dongying district china stating nevertheless that inter annual data could potentially strengthen the capability of phenological metrics for salinity assessment the latter approach assumed soil salinity as a steady state condition with multi year canopy reflectance data allowing to distinguish between these types of stressors and others more transient in time such as droughts plagues and diseases and mismanagement related to irrigation or fertilization lobell et al 2010 wu et al 2014 scudiero et al 2014a lobell et al 2010 first tested this approach using the enhanced vegetation index evi and 7 year spectral data in the red river valley of north dakota and minnesota usa later wu et al 2014 used different vegetation indices derived from a 4 year dataset in mesopotamia iraq also scudiero et al 2014a 2015 2016b developed the canopy response salinity index crsi using 7 year reflectance data for salinity assessment in california s western san joaquin valley usa recently whitney et al 2018 showed the benefits of using multi year data when compared with time series integrals of vegetation indices not only vegetation indices computed from multi year data provided stronger correlations with soil salinity measurements those authors also found them easier to interpret hence the aim of this study was to use multi year crop reflectance data for salinity assessment in lezíria grande portugal lezíria grande is an important agricultural area located just outside lisbon the area is prone to waterlogging and soil salinity problems due to its proximity to the tagus river estuary and the influence of estuarine tides on groundwater hence the simple possibility of assessment of those problems through remote sensing merits investigation to improve management of local water and soil resources as well as the sustainability of agriculture practices scudiero et al 2016a and whitney et al 2018 refer to soil salinity assessment via multi year crop reflectance data as being a relatively recent approach needing further validation over different regions environments and agricultural practices according to those authors the following issues should be considered in new applications i the selection of the vegetation index seems to be region specific with the quality of reflectance information changing according to spatial location because of atmospheric disturbance and other factors affecting satellite multispectral measurements pettorelli et al 2005 hadjimitsis et al 2010 ii the size of multi years datasets has also varied between studies with lobell et al 2010 considering seven years but whitney et al 2018 solely needing two years data to obtain the strongest correlations with soil salinity data iii information from vegetation indices should not be used alone in salinity assessment models with soil type land use and meteorological data often being used as additional environmental covariates lobell et al 2010 scudiero et al 2014a 2015 zhang et al 2015 and iv previous applications made use of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis national aeronautics and space administration agency usa at 250 m resolution lobell et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 whitney et al 2018 or landsat 7 satellite sensor national aeronautics and space administration agency usa at 30 m resolution scudiero et al 2014a 2015 2016b which showed to be too coarse for adequately portraying short scale variability of landscape e g agricultural fields crops management despite returning strong correlations with soil salinity the sentinel 2 satellite sensor european space agency european union which offers cost free multispectral imagery from 10 to 60 m resolution could likely constitute here a viable alternative for better describing soil salinity variability and landscape heterogeneity at the regional scale the specific objectives of this study are i to identify the vegetation index that correlates stronger with soil salinity in lezíria grande portugal using multi year datasets of sentinel 2 multispectral imagery ii to identify the environmental covariates that further correlate with soil salinity and iii to develop regression models for rootzone salinity assessment in the region results of this study can no doubly contribute to further improve land management in the region and cope with soil salinity 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at lezíria grande de vila franca de xira 39 957 n 8 924 w 1 2 m a s l located approximately 25 km northeast of lisbon portugal fig 1 between january 2017 and december 2019 the area is a small peninsula 13 000 ha limited to the west by the tagus river and to the east by the sorraia river both rivers are subjected to tidal movement with the shallow saline groundwater arising from estuarine tides inducing waterlogging and soil salinization problems especially in the southern part alvim and martins 1988 as a result soils are classified in the northern part as fluvisols and in the south as solonchaks iuss working group wrb 2014 the soil texture in the region is relatively homogeneous varying from fine to very fine texture classes the climate is temperate with hot and dry summers the mean annual rainfall is 716 mm period from 1971 to 2000 occurring mainly between october and may and with a mean monthly maximum of 127 6 mm in november and a mean monthly minimum of 2 mm in july the mean annual temperature is 16 7 c varying between a mean monthly maximum of 28 8 c in august and a mean monthly minimum of 6 7 c in january and february lezíria grande is equipped with irrigation and drainage infrastructures for supporting intensive agriculture production systems namely tomato solanum lycopersicum l rice oryza sativa l and maize zea mays l tomato and maize are grown mostly in the north while rice fields are located mostly in the south a significant part of the southern area is also left fallow and used for pasturing fig 2 irrigation water is diverted from the tagus river upstream lezíria grande in an area requiring close monitoring to prevent salt intrusion irrigation water is usually of good quality presenting an electrical conductivity eciw below 0 5 ds m 1 and is delivered to crops through drip sprinkler or surface systems nevertheless some secondary salinization has been observed in the region due to irrigation and fertigation malpractices santos et al 2005 2 2 satellite data the sentinel 2 mission is composed of two twin satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b launched in june 2015 and march 2017 respectively the constellation offers a revisiting time of 5 days under the same viewing angle with a swath of 290 km ten spectral bands were used in this study table 1 all sentinel 2 scenes having less than 10 cloud cover were first downloaded from the copernicus open access hub copernicus 2020 atmospheric correction of the downloaded scenes was then performed using the sen2cor software esa 2020 which is a processor for sentinel 2 level 2a product generation and formatting performing the atmospheric terrain and cirrus correction of top of atmosphere level 1c input data and creating bottom of atmosphere corrected reflectance images a total of 163 composite scenes were available for the study period table 2 on a yearly basis sentinel 2 bands were averaged and vegetation indices were computed the multi year maximum in each pixel was then obtained as proposed in wu et al 2014 and scudiero et al 2014 and correlated to soil salinity data the multi year average was also considered as a predictor of soil salinity following lobell et al 2010 however results were inferior to those found with the multi year maxima and for that reason they will no longer be addressed the vegetation indices evaluated in this study are listed in table 3 and were selected from past remote sensing applications the crsi developed by scudiero et al 2014a 2015 showed the best fit to soil salinity amongst other vegetation indices tested in the western san joaquin valley of california usa the evi huete et al 2002 was the index that best performed in the reference works of lobell et al 2010 and zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2014 developed the generalized difference vegetation index gdvi for salinity assessment in mesopotamia iraq this vegetation index included a power value x that ranged between 1 and 4 when x 1 the gdvi equaled the well known normalized difference vegetation index ndvi also considered in this study rouse et al 1973 when x 2 wu et al 2014 found the gdvi to better correlate with the leaf area index adopting it in their study when x 3 or x 4 those authors referred that the gdvi was insensitive to densely vegetated areas being only relevant for sparsely vegetated areas in this study the different formulations of the gdvi were considered with subscripts in gdvi2 gdvi3 and gdvi4 denoting the power value used in the equation the green atmospherically resistant vegetation index gari was formulated to enhance the sensing of green vegetation to soil and climate stressors gitelson et al 1996 the normalized difference salinity index ndsi is another popular vegetation index for salinity assessment being tested for example in punjab pakistan khan et al 2005 likewise the salinity index si developed by aldakheel et al 2005 is also amongst the various formulations found in the literature for salinity assessment finally wang et al 2019 developed the normalized difference index ndi and the three band index tbi for monitoring soil salinity in the ebinur lake region northwestern china all vegetation indices were computed using 10 m resolution bands except the last two ndi and tbi which formulation required the use of 20 m bands like in wang et al 2019 the crsi and ndsi were modified using the spectral offer provided by the sentinel 2 sensor in the range of the red and infrared to determine whether stronger correlations with soil salinity data could be obtained the modified vegetation indices were also computed using 20 m resolution bands table 4 2 3 ground truth dataset the ground truth dataset used in this study was collected in four agricultural fields fig 2 representative of the salinity gradient observed in lezíria grande in the north south orientation alvim and martins 1988 the selection of these fields had the involvement of

drip system delivering an average of 6700 m3 ha 1 y 1 fields b and c were cultivated with maize irrigated with center pivots applying an average of 3600 and 7100 m3 ha 1 y 1 respectively field d was under fallow with the surface covered by natural weed soils in fields a and b were classified as fluvisols while soils in fields c and d were classified as solonchaks panagos et al 2012 the major land uses in the region were thus considered for soil sampling except for rice soil samples were collected at 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m depth in 2017 and 2018 sampling was carried out as described in farzamian et al 2019 and paz et al 2020 i e along two transects with seven to ten sampling sites each spaced 20 m apart and about 10 m from the adjacent transect in 2019 sampling followed a more random scheme a total of 400 samples from 80 locations were collected fig 2 table 5 the soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution ph cation exchange capacity cec and electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece the particle size distribution was obtained using the pipette method for particles of diameter 2 μm clay c and 20 2 μm silt si and by sieving for

correlation with vegetation indices the ground truth dataset was thus composed of 80 ece mean values from sampling sites located in four agricultural fields fig 2 table 5 it was assumed that these ece mean values were representative of the corresponding sentinel 2 pixels based on farzamian et al 2019 who obtained relatively homogeneous soil apparent electrical conductivity eca readings in each field these readings were taken every 1 m along 10 transects with 100 m long and spaced 1 m apart with a em38 instrument geonics ltd mississauga canada during 2017 and 2018 2 4 soil environmental covariates soil weather and vegetation data were added to regression models to better describe the spatial temporal variability of soil salinity in lezíria grande soil data included the soil particle

included the soil type provided by the european soil database map at 1 1 000 000 resolution panagos et al 2012 a dummy variable soil was introduced into the regression analysis with the value of zero

equation allen et al 1998 complemented weather inputs to regression models finally vegetation data included an indicator whether the site was cultivated or under fallow similarly to scudiero et al 2015 another dummy variable veg was introduced into the regression analysis with the value of zero representing cultivated sites and the value of one indicating areas under long term fallow 2 5 correlation and regression analyses the pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to quantify the correlation between multi year maxima of vegetation indices listed in tables 3 and 4 and ground truth salinity data ece mean as follows fisher 1941 1 r i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n m i m 2 0 5 where oi and mi are respectively the ece mean and the vegetation index multi year maximum at sampling site i o and m are the respective mean values and n is the number of sampling sites regression analysis first considered the vegetation index with the strongest correlation to ece mean as the single predictor variable to soil salinity this constituted the simplest possible predictive model which was used as a reference to assess the contribution of additional soil environmental covariates to salinity regression models the soil environmental covariates listed in section 2 4 cmean simean fsmean csmean tmean tmax tmin eto veg soil were then added to the multiple regression analysis with arguments selected by stepwise regression the prediction ability of the multiple regression models was analyzed using a stratified k fold cross validation technique due to the limited number of available data in this method the dataset was randomly divided 10 times into training 90 of the data and validation 10 of the data subsets each subset contained approximately the same percentage of samples of each field site as the complete dataset 26 2 from field a 26 2 from field b 28 8 from field c and 18 8 from field d this approach was deemed to be superior to the common leave one out cross validation loocv technique by assessing the predictive capabilities of the regression models over a larger number of samples eight samples per test instead of just one in the loocv however it did not assure the spatial independence between the training and validation subsets as done in scudiero et al 2015 which would only be possible with a greater number of sampled fields for each validation test the performance of regression models was assessed using different goodness of fit tests which included the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse and the percent bias pbias of the prediction respectively given by 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n

mccabe 1999 positive or negative pbias values refer to the occurrence of under or over estimation bias respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil salinity measurements fig 3 presents the average of ece values measured at different depths in four monitored fields in lezíria grande from 2017 to 2019 in field a measured ece values averaged 1 11 ds m 1 range from 0 35 to 2 15 ds m 1 at the soil surface 0 0 3 m decreasing with depth as a result the ground truth ece mean dataset in this field presented similarly low values averaging 0 80 ds m 1 and ranging from 0 46 to 1 12 ds m 1 these values were perfectly below the crop tolerance salinity threshold value ece threshold reported by maas and hoffman 1977 for tomato 0 9 2 5 ds m 1 hardly affecting crop development and yields in field b measured ece values were similarly low at the soil surface 0 0 3 m averaging 1 16 ds m 1 and ranging from 0 55 to 2 09 ds m 1 however higher salinity levels were noticed at the bottom layers with the 0 3 0 6 m layer already occasionally showing higher ece values from 0 87 to 3 05 ds m 1 than the ece threshold for maize 1 7 ds m 1 as a result the ground truth ece mean dataset in this field reflected the higher salinity conditions of this field showing an average of 1 91 ds m 1 and range from 1 06 to 2 91 ds m 1 in field c measured ece values further reflected the salinity gradient in lezíria grande being much higher than in the previous fields average measured values at the soil surface 0 0 3 m reached 3 12 ds m 1 range from 1 43 to 4 30 ds m 1 with deeper layers going up to 8 25 ds m 1 range from 2 30 to 16 53 ds m 1 the ground truth ece mean dataset in this field was thus always above the ece threshold for maize with the average reaching 5 30 ds m 1 range from 2 23 to 9 54 ds m 1 finally field d registered the highest salinity levels with the ground truth ece mean dataset presenting an average value of 14 91 ds m 1 range from 11 70 to 22 40 ds m 1 nevertheless salinity levels in the top layer 0 0 3 m were comparatively smaller average of 3 53 ds m 1 varying from 1 0 8 31 ds m 1 which helps to explain vegetation growth natural weeds in this field 3 2 selection of vegetation indices fig 4 presents the scatterplots of the relations between vegetation indices and ground truth ece mean data while table 7 lists the respective correlation coefficients the crsi returned the strongest correlation with soil salinity data r 0 787 with values decreasing with the increase of ece mean similar good results were obtained with crsi2 r 0 767 however the coarser resolution 20 m of the spectral bands used to compute crsi2 ended up showing no real benefit in substituting the nir band 842 nm 10 m resolution used in the original crsi by the nirn 865 nm while other vegetation indices showed also interesting correlation values with salinity data only the crsi and gari r 0 664 were able to adequately portray the influence of soil salinity on crop development as shown in fig 4 only these two indices showed a decrease of crop reflectance data with the increase of soil salinity in sampling sites located in field b and especially field c i e the field where measured ece mean values more frequently overcame the ece threshold for maize section 3 1 scudiero et al 2014a also showed a stronger correlation between these two vegetation indices and salinity data for their region all other vegetation indices were unable to account for the effect of soil salinity on maize development in this field with vegetation indices maxima simply not responding to the increase of the ece mean these vegetation indices were thus not good indicators of the effect of soil salinity on crop development in lezíria grande surprisingly the evi r 0 463 used in lobell et al 2010 and zhang et al 2015 was amongst the indices with the poorest performance the use of this vegetation index with a higher resolution 10 m than the one originally tested by those authors 250 m may help explain such underperformance also the gdvi r 0 610 developed by wu et al 2014 failed to describe the effect of salinity on crop development less surprisingly was the performance of the ndi r 0 315 and tbi r 0 141 developed by wang et al 2019 as these empirical indices were only tested in bare soils or with low vegetation cover when selecting the best vegetation index the capability to describe the effect of soil salinity on crop health status revealed to be as important as the level of correlation with ground truth ece mean data in this sense the performance of the crsi in this study confirmed scudiero s et al 2014a 2015 good results and outperformed gari the crsi was thus adopted as a covariate in the models developed for soil salinity assessment in lezíria grande nevertheless it should be noted that the crsi variation was not always related to soil salinity as observed in fields a and b when the ece mean values were below the salinity threshold limits of local crops 3 3 soil salinity models table 8 presents results of the multiple stepwise regression analysis between ece mean and soil environmental factors in lezíria grande all regression coefficients were established by averaging the respective values obtained in the analysis of ten random training datasets model 1 constituted the simplest predictive model for the region based solely on the linear relationship of the crsi to soil salinity for this model the mean values of the analysis of variance returned a sum of squares due to regression ssr of 1260 78 standard deviation σ 95 27 a sum of squares due to error sse of 771 81 σ 27 21 a f value of 114 24 σ 6 23 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations the stratified k fold cross validation analysis produced then a value of the r2 of 0 63 σ 0 11 showing that model 1 could already explain a substantial part of the variability of the observed data fig 5 however the error of the estimate was relatively high resulting in a rmse value of 3 26 ds m 1 σ 1 24 ds m 1 while the pbias was 2 04 σ 26 91 indicating some overestimation of the measured data model 2 included the crsi and vegetation cover veg 0 for cultivated areas and veg 1 for areas under long term fallow as explanatory variables for this model the mean ssr was 1672 31 σ 108 53 the sse was 360 28 σ 19 82 the f value was 160 39 σ 10 86 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations the cross validation analysis resulted in a value of r2 of 0 82 σ 0 11 a value of rmse of 2 26 ds m 1 σ 0 62 ds m 1 and a pbias of 0 35 σ 10 08 model 3 included the crsi and soil type soil 0 for fluvisols and soil 1 for solonchaks as independent variables for this model the mean ssr reached 1609 89 σ 92 39 the sse was 422 70 σ 29 52 the f value was 131 62 σ 5 25 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations the cross validation analysis resulted in similar r2 0 83 σ 0 06 and rmse 2 25 ds m 1 σ 0 84 ds m 1 values as in model 2 however the negative pbias 5 83 σ 13 02 showed some underestimation of the measured data fig 5 the inclusion of vegetation cover in the multiple regression analysis was thus able to improve model predictions increasing the r2 value from 0 63 to 0 82 while the rmse value decreased from 3 26 to 2 26 ds m 1 similarly the inclusion of vegetation cover in lobell et al 2010 was able to improve salinity predictions raising the r2 value from 0 26 to 0 53 and decreasing the rmse value from 0 77 to 0 61 ds m 1 scudiero et al 2015 further confirmed such tendency with their regression model based solely on the linear relationship of the crsi to ground truth salinity returning a r2 value of 0 564 which increased to 0 601 with the inclusion of crop information on the other hand wu et al 2014 and whitney et al 2018 did not consider vegetation cover as an explanatory variable in their regression analysis opting instead for splitting the studied area into vegetated and fallow zones before conducting the research it should be noted that the r2 value in this study showed to be very sensitive to the clustering of data into extremes resulting from the inclusion of vegetation cover as a covariate fig 5 for that reason the r2 value in table 8 was higher than those cited above regarding soil information only scudiero et al 2015 provided a statistical relation between soil salinity and soil texture classes from the u s soil survey geographic database which nevertheless returned worse predictions than when using solely the csri as an independent variable in the regression analysis finally model 4 combined the two previous models including the crsi vegetation cover and soil type as explanatory variables in this model the ssr reached 1859 94 σ 103 82 the sse summed 103 82 σ 17 20 the f ratio was 245 80 σ 17 95 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations model 4 was able to explain most of the variability of the observed data with the r2 value reaching 0 91 σ 0 04 the error of the estimate was the lowest of all models rmse 1 63 ds m 1 σ 0 70 ds m 1 the pbias was also close to zero indicating no over or underestimation of measured data fig 5 the remaining covariates cmean simean fsmean csmean tmean tmax tmin and eto were excluded from the multiple stepwise regression analysis for not including enough spatial variation in the studied region for the weather variables this came with no surprise as the climate in the region was relatively homogeneous with data extracted from two relatively close meteorological station however environmental factors that govern the evaporative demand surface air temperature solar radiation humidity wind speed are known to also affect salt content closely adhering to the roots thus under low evapotranspiration demand crops may show higher tolerance to bulk soil salinity minhas et al 2020 likewise the salt concentration factor ece eciw is known to increase with increased water retention and decreased rainwater infiltration the further reduction in the dilution factor given by the ratio between soil water content at saturation θs and at field capacity θfc leads then to reduced crop salinity tolerance limits in clayed soils such as those in lezíria grande minhas et al 2020 hence the relations between climate variables soil texture and soil salinity are well established future applications need to better account for the spatial variability of these covariates in lezíria grande in order to improve existing salinity assessment models 3 4 regional scale assessment fig 6 shows results of the implementation of the salinity assessment regression models at the regional scale ece mean estimates were divided according to the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 classification for agriculture soil salinities 0 2 ds m 1 non saline 2 4 ds m 1 slightly saline 4 8 ds m 1 moderately saline 8 16 ds m 1 strongly saline 16 ds m 1 extremely saline soil salinity maps were produced at 10 m resolution in line with sentinel 2 imagery thus allowing an assessment of within field variability fig 6 further shows the variance of the estimates resulting from the analysis of ten random training datasets these maps serve here only to assess the limitations of regression models produced and should not be used for land management the implementation of model 1 at the regional scale fig 6a confirmed that the use of the crsi as single explanatory variable was insufficient for accurately portraying the north south salinity gradient in lezíria grande with saline fallow areas located in the south ending up classified in the lower salinity classes due to the multi year reflectance maxima of local vegetation scudiero et al 2016 had already adverted for such limitation when halophytes salt tolerant plants were present in the studied region considering that natural vegetation in lezíria grande grows mainly during autumn and winter when soil water availability is higher due to rainfall limiting sentinel 2 data and the analysis of the relationship between the crsi and soil salinity to the spring summer season may eventually minimize this problem at some extent without much affecting the correlation between the two variables in this study this would lower the r value from 0 787 to 0 755 model 2 implemented at the regional scale was more successful in representing the salinity gradient in lezíria grande fig 6c but produced an abrupt contrast between cultivated and fallow areas this artificial contrast is also noticed in fig 5 as such the model was found to be too simplistic for not representing saline areas in cultivated sites in this sense model 3 fig 6e showed to produce more realistic results by being able to smooth differences along the referred gradient with higher salinity classes agreeing mostly with areas where soils were classified as solonchaks model results were also affected by the presence of halophytes in the south where some fields were classified as slightly saline to moderately saline despite the salinity levels in those locations likely approaching those in field d finally model 4 fig 6f also produced abrupt differences in areas corresponding to the transition between fallow cultivated areas and fluvisols solonchaks further reducing the heterogeneity of the landscape as soil salinity classes were mostly clustered according to vegetation cover and soil type better covariates are thus needed for improving salinity assessment models in the region future applications should consider more detailed maps than the 1 1 000 000 european soil database map used in this study namely digital maps of soil properties developed from data available in the portuguese soil information system ramos et al 2017 the variance of model estimates fig 6b d and f determined higher uncertainty values mostly in rice fields stressing one of the main limitations of this study despite being classified as a sensitive crop to soil salinity maas and hoffman 1977 minhas et al 2020 rice fields dominate most of the cultivated areas in the southern part of lezíria grande where soils are classified as solonchak this is only possible through adequate management with flooding used for regulating surface air temperatures and minimizing temperature stress on crop growth also leaching salts away from the rootzone and preventing the osmotic stress of plants as a result crop reflectance properties in these areas are likely less affected by soil salinity challenging the assessment of soil salinity through remote sensing in this study no ground truth salinity data was collected in rice fields to confirm this hypothesis nonetheless this information is critical for future applications and for developing more accurate soil salinity assessment models 4 conclusions the lezíria grande region is an important agricultural area in southern portugal where farmers need to cope with soil salinity due to the climate conditions and the influence of estuarine tides on groundwater dynamics a salinity gradient can be observed in the region in the north south orientation with areas in the southern part left fallow due to high salinity levels in the remaining areas crops are grown depending on their tolerance to soil salinity or through specific management practices that allow their growth in salt affected areas four simple non invasive regression models were developed in this study for salinity assessment in lezíria grande the regression models were based on the relationship between multi year maxima of vegetation indices computed from sentinel 2 multispectral imagery and rootzone salinity 0 1 5 m depth several vegetation indices were evaluated but only the canopy response salinity index crsi and the green atmospherically resistant vegetation index gari were able to reasonably describe the effect of soil salinity on crop health status from these the crsi provided the strongest correlation r 0 787 with ground truth salinity data measured in 80 sampling sites located in four representative fields from 2017 to 2019 regression models further included vegetation cover and soil type as additional explanatory variables with model predictions producing a coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 and a root mean square error rmse varying from 1 63 to 3 26 ds m 1 however despite the relatively good predictive results the implementation of these models at the regional scale was far from satisfactory with soil information producing more realistic models of the salinity gradient in the region this highlights the need for a more detailed representation of soil mapping units in the region and for improving information related to the spatial distribution of soil properties which now is too coarse also the relation between rice reflectance properties and soil salinity needs to be accounted for in future applications this may prove to be a challenging task considering that rice management practices such as flooding aimed at protecting plants from low surface air temperatures also minimize the effect of the salinity stress on crop development nevertheless the use of remote sensing data for salinity assessment in lezíria grande showed to be an interesting option to consider in future soil monitoring programs soil salinity maps can be easily developed from cost free high resolution sentinel 2 multispectral imagery data at regular time periods e g five years providing an additional tool

10502,lezíria grande is an important agricultural area in portugal prone to waterlogging and salinity problems due to the influence of estuarine tides on groundwater dynamics simple non invasive practical approaches are need for monitoring soil salinity in the region and preventing further degradation of soil resources the objective of this study was to develop regression models for soil salinity assessment in lezíria grande based on the relationship between multi year crop reflectance data derived from sentinel 2 multispectral imagery and rootzone salinity nine vegetation indices vi computed from the annual averages of the spectral bands were tested between 2017 and 2019 the multi year maximum from each pixel was then used for correlating the vi with the ground truth dataset this dataset was composed of average values of the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece mean measured in 80 sampling sites 0 1 5 m depth located in four agricultural fields representative of the salinity gradient in the region the canopy response salinity index crsi which uses the blue 490 nm green 560 nm red 665 nm and infrared 842 nm bands provided the strongest correlation with measured data r 0 787 regression models further considered vegetation cover and soil type as explanatory variables with predictions resulting in a coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 and a root mean square error rmse varying from 1 63 to 3 26 ds m 1 the use of remote sensing data for soil salinity assessment showed to be an interesting option to consider in future soil monitoring programs nevertheless more detailed covariates are needed for improving salinity assessment models at the regional scale keywords canopy response salinity index soil environmental covariates multi year maximum multiple regression analysis rootzone salinity 1 introduction soil salinization is a major abiotic constraint affecting food production particularly in arid semi arid and sub humid regions rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2009 minhas et al 2020 in these water scarce regions salts tend to accumulate in the soil profile due to high evaporative demand increasing the osmotic stress that affects soil water availability and root water uptake while also potentially promoting the development of ion toxicities and imbalances in plants as a result crop growth transpiration rates and yields are reduced when soil salinity reaches a certain tolerance threshold with higher levels ultimately leading to crop failure maas and hoffman 1977 in addition high sodium saturation of the soil exchange complex may further affect soil water relationships and structural stability which will result in the dispersion of soil colloids that alter the movement of water and air reducing soil infiltration favoring water stagnation and potentially causing anoxic conditions in the rootzone minhas et al 2020 the best available estimates suggest that about 412 million ha are affected by salinity and 618 million ha by sodicity either due to natural causes rock weathering sea water and accession of salt in marine sediments and atmospheric deposition or human induced processes poor irrigation water management and the overexploitation of saline groundwater resources fao 2015 yet these estimates are known to be based on expert judgment from individual countries or regions rather than on quantitative measurements on the extent of soil salinity and sodicity lobell et al 2007 scudiero et al 2014a therefore over the last few decades the scientific community has invested considerable time and resources in the development of rapid non invasive and cost effective methods for large scale assessment of the spatial and temporal distribution of salt affected areas allbed and kumar 2013 corwin and scudiero 2019 corwin 2020 several remote sensing technologies have been developed with early works focusing on salinity assessment at or near the soil surface based on the different reflectance properties of salt crusts when compared with non salt affected soils allbed and kumar 2013 however the fact that in agricultural soils salts tend to accumulate deeper in the rootzone rather than at the soil surface has been shifting the paradigm of research and remote sensing applications with crop yields lobell et al 2007 scudiero et al 2014b and crop health status lobell et al 2010 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 scudiero et al 2014a 2015 being now increasingly used as a proxy for rootzone salinity several vegetation indices exist for large scale assessment of multiple crop characteristics e g leaf area index biomass and stresses e g water nutrient plagues and diseases using satellite spectral bands as input mulla 2013 crop canopy reflectance has also shown to be a good indicator for saline stress conditions increasing in the visible range and decreasing in the near infrared corwin and scudiero 2019 but only when considering the integrals of vegetation indices derived over a crop growing season zhang et al 2015 or when vegetation indices were computed from multi year spectral data lobell et al 2010 wu et al 2014 scudiero et al 2014a 2015 in the former approach zhang et al 2015 assumed that vegetation indices could provide information on crop physiology with the seasonally integrated response of these indices representing the sum or accumulation of seasonal photosynthetic activity expressed as biomass those authors were able to test their methodology using ground data from the yellow river delta in the dongying district china stating nevertheless that inter annual data could potentially strengthen the capability of phenological metrics for salinity assessment the latter approach assumed soil salinity as a steady state condition with multi year canopy reflectance data allowing to distinguish between these types of stressors and others more transient in time such as droughts plagues and diseases and mismanagement related to irrigation or fertilization lobell et al 2010 wu et al 2014 scudiero et al 2014a lobell et al 2010 first tested this approach using the enhanced vegetation index evi and 7 year spectral data in the red river valley of north dakota and minnesota usa later wu et al 2014 used different vegetation indices derived from a 4 year dataset in mesopotamia iraq also scudiero et al 2014a 2015 2016b developed the canopy response salinity index crsi using 7 year reflectance data for salinity assessment in california s western san joaquin valley usa recently whitney et al 2018 showed the benefits of using multi year data when compared with time series integrals of vegetation indices not only vegetation indices computed from multi year data provided stronger correlations with soil salinity measurements those authors also found them easier to interpret hence the aim of this study was to use multi year crop reflectance data for salinity assessment in lezíria grande portugal lezíria grande is an important agricultural area located just outside lisbon the area is prone to waterlogging and soil salinity problems due to its proximity to the tagus river estuary and the influence of estuarine tides on groundwater hence the simple possibility of assessment of those problems through remote sensing merits investigation to improve management of local water and soil resources as well as the sustainability of agriculture practices scudiero et al 2016a and whitney et al 2018 refer to soil salinity assessment via multi year crop reflectance data as being a relatively recent approach needing further validation over different regions environments and agricultural practices according to those authors the following issues should be considered in new applications i the selection of the vegetation index seems to be region specific with the quality of reflectance information changing according to spatial location because of atmospheric disturbance and other factors affecting satellite multispectral measurements pettorelli et al 2005 hadjimitsis et al 2010 ii the size of multi years datasets has also varied between studies with lobell et al 2010 considering seven years but whitney et al 2018 solely needing two years data to obtain the strongest correlations with soil salinity data iii information from vegetation indices should not be used alone in salinity assessment models with soil type land use and meteorological data often being used as additional environmental covariates lobell et al 2010 scudiero et al 2014a 2015 zhang et al 2015 and iv previous applications made use of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis national aeronautics and space administration agency usa at 250 m resolution lobell et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 whitney et al 2018 or landsat 7 satellite sensor national aeronautics and space administration agency usa at 30 m resolution scudiero et al 2014a 2015 2016b which showed to be too coarse for adequately portraying short scale variability of landscape e g agricultural fields crops management despite returning strong correlations with soil salinity the sentinel 2 satellite sensor european space agency european union which offers cost free multispectral imagery from 10 to 60 m resolution could likely constitute here a viable alternative for better describing soil salinity variability and landscape heterogeneity at the regional scale the specific objectives of this study are i to identify the vegetation index that correlates stronger with soil salinity in lezíria grande portugal using multi year datasets of sentinel 2 multispectral imagery ii to identify the environmental covariates that further correlate with soil salinity and iii to develop regression models for rootzone salinity assessment in the region results of this study can no doubly contribute to further improve land management in the region and cope with soil salinity 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at lezíria grande de vila franca de xira 39 957 n 8 924 w 1 2 m a s l located approximately 25 km northeast of lisbon portugal fig 1 between january 2017 and december 2019 the area is a small peninsula 13 000 ha limited to the west by the tagus river and to the east by the sorraia river both rivers are subjected to tidal movement with the shallow saline groundwater arising from estuarine tides inducing waterlogging and soil salinization problems especially in the southern part alvim and martins 1988 as a result soils are classified in the northern part as fluvisols and in the south as solonchaks iuss working group wrb 2014 the soil texture in the region is relatively homogeneous varying from fine to very fine texture classes the climate is temperate with hot and dry summers the mean annual rainfall is 716 mm period from 1971 to 2000 occurring mainly between october and may and with a mean monthly maximum of 127 6 mm in november and a mean monthly minimum of 2 mm in july the mean annual temperature is 16 7 c varying between a mean monthly maximum of 28 8 c in august and a mean monthly minimum of 6 7 c in january and february lezíria grande is equipped with irrigation and drainage infrastructures for supporting intensive agriculture production systems namely tomato solanum lycopersicum l rice oryza sativa l and maize zea mays l tomato and maize are grown mostly in the north while rice fields are located mostly in the south a significant part of the southern area is also left fallow and used for pasturing fig 2 irrigation water is diverted from the tagus river upstream lezíria grande in an area requiring close monitoring to prevent salt intrusion irrigation water is usually of good quality presenting an electrical conductivity eciw below 0 5 ds m 1 and is delivered to crops through drip sprinkler or surface systems nevertheless some secondary salinization has been observed in the region due to irrigation and fertigation malpractices santos et al 2005 2 2 satellite data the sentinel 2 mission is composed of two twin satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b launched in june 2015 and march 2017 respectively the constellation offers a revisiting time of 5 days under the same viewing angle with a swath of 290 km ten spectral bands were used in this study table 1 all sentinel 2 scenes having less than 10 cloud cover were first downloaded from the copernicus open access hub copernicus 2020 atmospheric correction of the downloaded scenes was then performed using the sen2cor software esa 2020 which is a processor for sentinel 2 level 2a product generation and formatting performing the atmospheric terrain and cirrus correction of top of atmosphere level 1c input data and creating bottom of atmosphere corrected reflectance images a total of 163 composite scenes were available for the study period table 2 on a yearly basis sentinel 2 bands were averaged and vegetation indices were computed the multi year maximum in each pixel was then obtained as proposed in wu et al 2014 and scudiero et al 2014 and correlated to soil salinity data the multi year average was also considered as a predictor of soil salinity following lobell et al 2010 however results were inferior to those found with the multi year maxima and for that reason they will no longer be addressed the vegetation indices evaluated in this study are listed in table 3 and were selected from past remote sensing applications the crsi developed by scudiero et al 2014a 2015 showed the best fit to soil salinity amongst other vegetation indices tested in the western san joaquin valley of california usa the evi huete et al 2002 was the index that best performed in the reference works of lobell et al 2010 and zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2014 developed the generalized difference vegetation index gdvi for salinity assessment in mesopotamia iraq this vegetation index included a power value x that ranged between 1 and 4 when x 1 the gdvi equaled the well known normalized difference vegetation index ndvi also considered in this study rouse et al 1973 when x 2 wu et al 2014 found the gdvi to better correlate with the leaf area index adopting it in their study when x 3 or x 4 those authors referred that the gdvi was insensitive to densely vegetated areas being only relevant for sparsely vegetated areas in this study the different formulations of the gdvi were considered with subscripts in gdvi2 gdvi3 and gdvi4 denoting the power value used in the equation the green atmospherically resistant vegetation index gari was formulated to enhance the sensing of green vegetation to soil and climate stressors gitelson et al 1996 the normalized difference salinity index ndsi is another popular vegetation index for salinity assessment being tested for example in punjab pakistan khan et al 2005 likewise the salinity index si developed by aldakheel et al 2005 is also amongst the various formulations found in the literature for salinity assessment finally wang et al 2019 developed the normalized difference index ndi and the three band index tbi for monitoring soil salinity in the ebinur lake region northwestern china all vegetation indices were computed using 10 m resolution bands except the last two ndi and tbi which formulation required the use of 20 m bands like in wang et al 2019 the crsi and ndsi were modified using the spectral offer provided by the sentinel 2 sensor in the range of the red and infrared to determine whether stronger correlations with soil salinity data could be obtained the modified vegetation indices were also computed using 20 m resolution bands table 4 2 3 ground truth dataset the ground truth dataset used in this study was collected in four agricultural fields fig 2 representative of the salinity gradient observed in lezíria grande in the north south orientation alvim and martins 1988 the selection of these fields had the involvement of the local stakeholder associação de beneficiários da lezíria grande de vila franca de xira ablgvfx but was restricted to a limited budget field a was cultivated with tomato which was irrigated with a drip system delivering an average of 6700 m3 ha 1 y 1 fields b and c were cultivated with maize irrigated with center pivots applying an average of 3600 and 7100 m3 ha 1 y 1 respectively field d was under fallow with the surface covered by natural weed soils in fields a and b were classified as fluvisols while soils in fields c and d were classified as solonchaks panagos et al 2012 the major land uses in the region were thus considered for soil sampling except for rice soil samples were collected at 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m depth in 2017 and 2018 sampling was carried out as described in farzamian et al 2019 and paz et al 2020 i e along two transects with seven to ten sampling sites each spaced 20 m apart and about 10 m from the adjacent transect in 2019 sampling followed a more random scheme a total of 400 samples from 80 locations were collected fig 2 table 5 the soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution ph cation exchange capacity cec and electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece the particle size distribution was obtained using the pipette method for particles of diameter 2 μm clay c and 20 2 μm silt si and by sieving for particles 200 20 μm fine sand fs and 200 2000 μm coarse sand cs these textural classes follow the portuguese classification system gomes and silva 1962 and they are based on the international soil science society isss particle limits atterberg scale ph was measured on a suspension of soil and distilled water 1 5 wt of soil volume of solution using a potentiometer cec was determined using the bascomb 1964 method in which the exchangeable cations are extracted with a bacl2 solution buffered at ph 8 1 ece was measured with a conductivity meter in the extract collected with suction filters from the soil saturation paste following the procedures in u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 at each sampling location the ece values measured in five monitored layers were then averaged ece mean for correlation with vegetation indices the ground truth dataset was thus composed of 80 ece mean values from sampling sites located in four agricultural fields fig 2 table 5 it was assumed that these ece mean values were representative of the corresponding sentinel 2 pixels based on farzamian et al 2019 who obtained relatively homogeneous soil apparent electrical conductivity eca readings in each field these readings were taken every 1 m along 10 transects with 100 m long and spaced 1 m apart with a em38 instrument geonics ltd mississauga canada during 2017 and 2018 2 4 soil environmental covariates soil weather and vegetation data were added to regression models to better describe the spatial temporal variability of soil salinity in lezíria grande soil data included the soil particle size distribution measured in each sampling site table 6 with data from five layers being averaged into a unique value per site cmean simean fsmean csmean as done for the ece mean soil data further included the soil type provided by the european soil database map at 1 1 000 000 resolution panagos et al 2012 a dummy variable soil was introduced into the regression analysis with the value of zero representing fluvisols and the value of one referring to solonchaks weather data included the annual mean tmean maximum tmax and minimum tmin surface air temperature as well as the annual rainfall rain measured in two local meteorological stations figueirinha 38 999 n 8 978 w and terra velha 38 957 n 8 910 w the annual reference evapotranspiration rate eto computed with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 complemented weather inputs to regression models finally vegetation data included an indicator whether the site was cultivated or under fallow similarly to scudiero et al 2015 another dummy variable veg was introduced into the regression analysis with the value of zero representing cultivated sites and the value of one indicating areas under long term fallow 2 5 correlation and regression analyses the pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to quantify the correlation between multi year maxima of vegetation indices listed in tables 3 and 4 and ground truth salinity data ece mean as follows fisher 1941 1 r i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n m i m 2 0 5 where oi and mi are respectively the ece mean and the vegetation index multi year maximum at sampling site i o and m are the respective mean values and n is the number of sampling sites regression analysis first considered the vegetation index with the strongest correlation to ece mean as the single predictor variable to soil salinity this constituted the simplest possible predictive model which was used as a reference to assess the contribution of additional soil environmental covariates to salinity regression models the soil environmental covariates listed in section 2 4 cmean simean fsmean csmean tmean tmax tmin eto veg soil were then added to the multiple regression analysis with arguments selected by stepwise regression the prediction ability of the multiple regression models was analyzed using a stratified k fold cross validation technique due to the limited number of available data in this method the dataset was randomly divided 10 times into training 90 of the data and validation 10 of the data subsets each subset contained approximately the same percentage of samples of each field site as the complete dataset 26 2 from field a 26 2 from field b 28 8 from field c and 18 8 from field d this approach was deemed to be superior to the common leave one out cross validation loocv technique by assessing the predictive capabilities of the regression models over a larger number of samples eight samples per test instead of just one in the loocv however it did not assure the spatial independence between the training and validation subsets as done in scudiero et al 2015 which would only be possible with a greater number of sampled fields for each validation test the performance of regression models was assessed using different goodness of fit tests which included the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse and the percent bias pbias of the prediction respectively given by 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n

respective mean value r2 values close to 1 indicated that the model explains well the variance of observations rmse nrmse and pbias values close to zero indicate accurate model predictions legates and mccabe 1999 positive or negative pbias values refer to the occurrence of under or over estimation bias respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil salinity measurements fig 3 presents the average of ece values measured at different depths in four monitored fields in lezíria grande from 2017 to 2019 in field a measured ece values averaged 1 11 ds m 1 range from 0 35 to 2 15 ds m 1 at the soil surface 0 0 3 m decreasing with depth as a result the ground truth ece mean dataset in this field presented similarly low values averaging 0 80 ds m 1 and ranging from 0 46 to 1 12 ds m 1 these values were perfectly below the crop tolerance salinity threshold value ece threshold reported by maas and hoffman 1977 for tomato 0 9 2 5 ds m 1 hardly affecting crop development and yields in field b measured ece values were similarly low at the soil surface 0 0 3 m averaging 1 16 ds m 1 and ranging from 0 55 to 2 09 ds m 1 however higher salinity levels were noticed at the bottom layers with the 0 3 0 6 m layer already occasionally showing higher ece values from 0 87 to 3 05 ds m 1 than the ece threshold for maize 1 7 ds m 1 as a result the ground truth ece mean dataset in this field reflected the higher salinity conditions of this field showing an average of 1 91 ds m 1 and range from 1 06 to 2 91 ds m 1 in field c measured ece values further reflected the salinity gradient in lezíria grande being much higher than in the previous fields average measured values at the soil surface 0 0 3 m reached 3 12 ds m 1 range from 1 43 to 4 30 ds m 1 with deeper layers going up to 8 25 ds m 1 range from 2 30 to 16 53 ds m 1 the ground truth ece mean dataset in this field was thus always above the ece threshold for maize with the average reaching 5 30 ds m 1 range from 2 23 to 9 54 ds m 1 finally field d registered the highest salinity levels with the ground truth ece mean dataset presenting an average value of 14 91 ds m 1 range from 11 70 to 22 40 ds m 1 nevertheless salinity levels in the top layer 0 0 3 m were comparatively smaller average of 3 53 ds m 1 varying from 1 0 8 31 ds m 1 which helps to explain vegetation growth natural weeds in this field 3 2 selection of vegetation indices fig 4 presents the scatterplots of the relations between vegetation indices and ground truth ece mean data while table 7 lists the respective correlation coefficients the crsi returned the strongest correlation with soil salinity data r 0 787 with values decreasing with the increase of ece mean similar good results were obtained with crsi2 r 0 767 however the coarser resolution 20 m of the spectral bands used to compute crsi2 ended up showing no real benefit in substituting the nir band 842 nm 10 m resolution used in the original crsi by the nirn 865 nm while other vegetation indices showed also interesting correlation values with salinity data only the crsi and gari r 0 664 were able to adequately portray the influence of soil salinity on crop development as shown in fig 4 only these two indices showed a decrease of crop reflectance data with the increase of soil salinity in sampling sites located in field b and especially field c i e the field where measured ece mean values more frequently overcame the ece threshold for maize section 3 1 scudiero et al 2014a also showed a stronger correlation between these two vegetation indices and salinity data for their region all other vegetation indices were unable to account for the effect of soil salinity on maize development in this field with vegetation indices maxima simply not responding to the increase of the ece mean these vegetation indices were thus not good indicators of the effect of soil salinity on crop development in lezíria grande surprisingly the evi r 0 463 used in lobell et al 2010 and zhang et al 2015 was amongst the indices with the poorest performance the use of this vegetation index with a higher resolution 10 m than the one originally tested by those authors 250 m may help explain such underperformance also the gdvi r 0 610 developed by wu et al 2014 failed to describe the effect of salinity on crop development less surprisingly was the performance of the ndi r 0 315 and tbi r 0 141 developed by wang et al 2019 as these empirical indices were only tested in bare soils or with low vegetation cover when selecting the best vegetation index the capability to describe the effect of soil salinity on crop health status revealed to be as important as the level of correlation with ground truth ece mean data in this sense the performance of the crsi in this study confirmed scudiero s et al 2014a 2015 good results and outperformed gari the crsi was thus adopted as a covariate in the models developed for soil salinity assessment in lezíria grande nevertheless it should be noted that the crsi variation was not always related to soil salinity as observed in fields a and b when the ece mean values were below the salinity threshold limits of local crops 3 3 soil salinity models table 8 presents results of the multiple stepwise regression analysis between ece mean and soil environmental factors in lezíria grande all regression coefficients were established by averaging the respective values obtained in the analysis of ten random training datasets model 1 constituted the simplest predictive model for the region based solely on the linear relationship of the crsi to soil salinity for this model the mean values of the analysis of variance returned a sum of squares due to regression ssr of 1260 78 standard deviation σ 95 27 a sum of squares due to error sse of 771 81 σ 27 21 a f value of 114 24 σ 6 23 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations the stratified k fold cross validation analysis produced then a value of the r2 of 0 63 σ 0 11 showing that model 1 could already explain a substantial part of the variability of the observed data fig 5 however the error of the estimate was relatively high resulting in a rmse value of 3 26 ds m 1 σ 1 24 ds m 1 while the pbias was 2 04 σ 26 91 indicating some overestimation of the measured data model 2 included the crsi and vegetation cover veg 0 for cultivated areas and veg 1 for areas under long term fallow as explanatory variables for this model the mean ssr was 1672 31 σ 108 53 the sse was 360 28 σ 19 82 the f value was 160 39 σ 10 86 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations the cross validation analysis resulted in a value of r2 of 0 82 σ 0 11 a value of rmse of 2 26 ds m 1 σ 0 62 ds m 1 and a pbias of 0 35 σ 10 08 model 3 included the crsi and soil type soil 0 for fluvisols and soil 1 for solonchaks as independent variables for this model the mean ssr reached 1609 89 σ 92 39 the sse was 422 70 σ 29 52 the f value was 131 62 σ 5 25 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations the cross validation analysis resulted in similar r2 0 83 σ 0 06 and rmse 2 25 ds m 1 σ 0 84 ds m 1 values as in model 2 however the negative pbias 5 83 σ 13 02 showed some underestimation of the measured data fig 5 the inclusion of vegetation cover in the multiple regression analysis was thus able to improve model predictions increasing the r2 value from 0 63 to 0 82 while the rmse value decreased from 3 26 to 2 26 ds m 1 similarly the inclusion of vegetation cover in lobell et al 2010 was able to improve salinity predictions raising the r2 value from 0 26 to 0 53 and decreasing the rmse value from 0 77 to 0 61 ds m 1 scudiero et al 2015 further confirmed such tendency with their regression model based solely on the linear relationship of the crsi to ground truth salinity returning a r2 value of 0 564 which increased to 0 601 with the inclusion of crop information on the other hand wu et al 2014 and whitney et al 2018 did not consider vegetation cover as an explanatory variable in their regression analysis opting instead for splitting the studied area into vegetated and fallow zones before conducting the research it should be noted that the r2 value in this study showed to be very sensitive to the clustering of data into extremes resulting from the inclusion of vegetation cover as a covariate fig 5 for that reason the r2 value in table 8 was higher than those cited above regarding soil information only scudiero et al 2015 provided a statistical relation between soil salinity and soil texture classes from the u s soil survey geographic database which nevertheless returned worse predictions than when using solely the csri as an independent variable in the regression analysis finally model 4 combined the two previous models including the crsi vegetation cover and soil type as explanatory variables in this model the ssr reached 1859 94 σ 103 82 the sse summed 103 82 σ 17 20 the f ratio was 245 80 σ 17 95 and p 0 0001 for n 72 observations model 4 was able to explain most of the variability of the observed data with the r2 value reaching 0 91 σ 0 04 the error of the estimate was the lowest of all models rmse 1 63 ds m 1 σ 0 70 ds m 1 the pbias was also close to zero indicating no over or underestimation of measured data fig 5 the remaining covariates cmean simean fsmean csmean tmean tmax tmin and eto were excluded from the multiple stepwise regression analysis for not including enough spatial variation in the studied region for the weather variables this came with no surprise as the climate in the region was relatively homogeneous with data extracted from two relatively close meteorological station however environmental factors that govern the evaporative demand surface air temperature solar radiation humidity wind speed are known to also affect salt content closely adhering to the roots thus under low evapotranspiration demand crops may show higher tolerance to bulk soil salinity minhas et al 2020 likewise the salt concentration factor ece eciw is known to increase with increased water retention and decreased rainwater infiltration the further reduction in the dilution factor given by the ratio between soil water content at saturation θs and at field capacity θfc leads then to reduced crop salinity tolerance limits in clayed soils such as those in lezíria grande minhas et al 2020 hence the relations between climate variables soil texture and soil salinity are well established future applications need to better account for the spatial variability of these covariates in lezíria grande in order to improve existing salinity assessment models 3 4 regional scale assessment fig 6 shows results of the implementation of the salinity assessment regression models at the regional scale ece mean estimates were divided according to the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 classification for agriculture soil salinities 0 2 ds m 1 non saline 2 4 ds m 1 slightly saline 4 8 ds m 1 moderately saline 8 16 ds m 1 strongly saline 16 ds m 1 extremely saline soil salinity maps were produced at 10 m resolution in line with sentinel 2 imagery thus allowing an assessment of within field variability fig 6 further shows the variance of the estimates resulting from the analysis of ten random training datasets these maps serve here only to assess the limitations of regression models produced and should not be used for land management the implementation of model 1 at the regional scale fig 6a confirmed that the use of the crsi as single explanatory variable was insufficient for accurately portraying the north south salinity gradient in lezíria grande with saline fallow areas located in the south ending up classified in the lower salinity classes due to the multi year reflectance maxima of local vegetation scudiero et al 2016 had already adverted for such limitation when halophytes salt tolerant plants were present in the studied region considering that natural vegetation in lezíria grande grows mainly during autumn and winter when soil water availability is higher due to rainfall limiting sentinel 2 data and the analysis of the relationship between the crsi and soil salinity to the spring summer season may eventually minimize this problem at some extent without much affecting the correlation between the two variables in this study this would lower the r value from 0 787 to 0 755 model 2 implemented at the regional scale was more successful in representing the salinity gradient in lezíria grande fig 6c but produced an abrupt contrast between cultivated and fallow areas this artificial contrast is also noticed in fig 5 as such the model was found to be too simplistic for not representing saline areas in cultivated sites in this sense model 3 fig 6e showed to produce more realistic results by being able to smooth differences along the referred gradient with higher salinity classes agreeing mostly with areas where soils were classified as solonchaks model results were also affected by the presence of halophytes in the south where some fields were classified as slightly saline to moderately saline despite the salinity levels in those locations likely approaching those in field d finally model 4 fig 6f also produced abrupt differences in areas corresponding to the transition between fallow cultivated areas and fluvisols solonchaks further reducing the heterogeneity of the landscape as soil salinity classes were mostly clustered according to vegetation cover and soil type better covariates are thus needed for improving salinity assessment models in the region future applications should consider more detailed maps than the 1 1 000 000 european soil database map used in this study namely digital maps of soil properties developed from data available in the portuguese soil information system ramos et al 2017 the variance of model estimates fig 6b d and f determined higher uncertainty values mostly in rice fields stressing one of the main limitations of this study despite being classified as a sensitive crop to soil salinity maas and hoffman 1977 minhas et al 2020 rice fields dominate most of the cultivated areas in the southern part of lezíria grande where soils are classified as solonchak this is only possible through adequate management with flooding used for regulating surface air temperatures and minimizing temperature stress on crop growth also leaching salts away from the rootzone and preventing the osmotic stress of plants as a result crop reflectance properties in these areas are likely less affected by soil salinity challenging the assessment of soil salinity through remote sensing in this study no ground truth salinity data was collected in rice fields to confirm this hypothesis nonetheless this information is critical for future applications and for developing more accurate soil salinity assessment models 4 conclusions the lezíria grande region is an important agricultural area in southern portugal where farmers need to cope with soil salinity due to the climate conditions and the influence of estuarine tides on groundwater dynamics a salinity gradient can be observed in the region in the north south orientation with areas in the southern part left fallow due to high salinity levels in the remaining areas crops are grown depending on their tolerance to soil salinity or through specific management practices that allow their growth in salt affected areas four simple non invasive regression models were developed in this study for salinity assessment in lezíria grande the regression models were based on the relationship between multi year maxima of vegetation indices computed from sentinel 2 multispectral imagery and rootzone salinity 0 1 5 m depth several vegetation indices were evaluated but only the canopy response salinity index crsi and the green atmospherically resistant vegetation index gari were able to reasonably describe the effect of soil salinity on crop health status from these the crsi provided the strongest correlation r 0 787 with ground truth salinity data measured in 80 sampling sites located in four representative fields from 2017 to 2019 regression models further included vegetation cover and soil type as additional explanatory variables with model predictions producing a coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 and a root mean square error rmse varying from 1 63 to 3 26 ds m 1 however despite the relatively good predictive results the implementation of these models at the regional scale was far from satisfactory with soil information producing more realistic models of the salinity gradient in the region this highlights the need for a more detailed representation of soil mapping units in the region and for improving information related to the spatial distribution of soil properties which now is too coarse also the relation between rice reflectance properties and soil salinity needs to be accounted for in future applications this may prove to be a challenging task considering that rice management practices such as flooding aimed at protecting plants from low surface air temperatures also minimize the effect of the salinity stress on crop development nevertheless the use of remote sensing data for salinity assessment in lezíria grande showed to be an interesting option to consider in future soil monitoring programs soil salinity maps can be easily developed from cost free high resolution sentinel 2 multispectral imagery data at regular time periods e g five years providing an additional tool

10503,wastewater has high potential for reuse in agriculture to reduce the water scarcity problems for increasing food and environmental security avoiding direct pollution of rivers canals surface water conserving water and nutrients etc the study revealed that the water availability increased significantly during both the rainy season and summer in the open wells as well as the new bore wells sunk in the study area the area cultivated increased by 24 65 per cent along with change in cropping pattern changing over from coarse cereals namely sorghum and pearl millet to commercial crops such as coconut and fodder grass as inter crops beside fodder sorghum in the study area in the current period as a result of use of treated wastewater for irrigation the livestock activity also moved towards more cattle in place of small animals such as sheep and goats the land value per hectare remained higher at rs 19 76 lakhs in treated wastewater irrigated farms compared to that of the control farms at rs 6 42 lakhs the employment generation through crop activities in the treated wastewater irrigated farms were higher by 129 79 per cent compared to control farms the treated wastewater irrigated farms could save farm yard manure and n and p nutrients by 5 02 tons 270 22 kg and 31 04 kg respectively the net income per hectare increased by 9 32 per cent and 1 42 per cent respectively compared to the pre industry period and the net income in control farms even while the ph ec and salt load remained at permissible levels in soil the salt loads were found moving towards upper permissible limit or exceeding limits in the case of ground water the positive externalities while require government to bring in policy making paper mills to treat effluent and provide for irrigation the negative externalities when read with who stipulations and also on the basis of past studies to go for suitable crops which are seasonal or annual with safe transfer factors regarding heavy metals from soil ground water to plant parts or fiber crops which are not directly consumed by humans keywords bio physical socio economic analysis treated wastewater externality impact assessment 1 introduction water is the most abundant natural resource in the world the earth surface is covered 70 per cent by water and out of this the saline sea water is 97 per cent but the potable or drinking water is about 13 per cent of the residual which is 0 40 per cent of all the world water and the remaining is held either as ice and atmosphere jaber et al 1997 according to fao 2012 data however 30 40 per cent of the world s food comes from irrigated land comprising only 17 per cent of the total cultivated land in future water availability for agriculture will be threatened by the increasing domestic and industrial demand and use of water for irrigation in 45 countries accounting for 83 per cent of the world s population in 1995 is forecast to increase by 22 per cent between 1995 and 2025 the primary competing uses of water is typically agriculture followed by industry domestic recreational and more recently environmental preservation proper distribution of water among these sectors requires planning and management sustainability of water resources and an equitable distribution of available water drive much of this planning mccarl et al 1999 orr and colby 2004 loehman and becker 2006 finding sustainable solutions for water stressed regions is an important focus of water resources planners and policy makers for sustainable water management to occur the allocation of water must be socially fair for both current and future populations mccarl et al 1999 orr and colby 2004 loehman and becker 2006 in addition planners are forced to consider alternative sources of water that might be economically and effectively used to promote further development with the population growing at a higher rate the need for increased food production is inevitable whenever good quality water is scarce water of marginal quality or low quality will have the potential to be considered for use in agriculture use of treated wastewater in agriculture therefore could be an important consideration when its disposal is properly planned the quality of treated effluent will then become very important in terms of its performance to groundwater soil and plant for irrigation the quality of effluent will depend on crops to be irrigated the soil conditions and the system of effluent distribution adopted besides the output quality of crops grown the most appropriate wastewater treatment to be applied before effluent use in agriculture is the appropriate process which will produce an effluent meeting the recommended microbiological and chemical quality guidelines both at low cost and with minimal operational and maintenance requirements arar 1988 in arid regions where there has traditionally been scarcity of water wastewater reuse technology has been successfully implemented

environmental benefits from reduced discharge of saline wastewater into natural water bodies increased agricultural productivity and reduced climatic risks the negative externalities would include potential groundwater pollution and increase in soil salinity if used for irrigation and potential unknown ill effects on human health if used for potable uses bahri 1999 reported that about 30 43 per cent of the treated wastewater is used for agricultural and landscape irrigation in tunisia reusing wastewater for irrigation is viewed as a way to increase water resources provide supplemental nutrients and protect coastal areas water resources and sensitive receiving bodies reclaimed water was used on 8000 ha to irrigate industrial and fodder crops cereals vineyards citrus and other fruit trees regulations allow the use of secondary treated effluent on all crops except vegetables whether eaten raw or cooked regional agricultural departments supervise the water reuse decree enforcement and collect charge golf courses are also irrigated with treated effluent while industrial use and groundwater recharge opportunities are further investigated kihila 2014 explained that treated wastewater irrigation can mitigate water scarcity save disposal costs reduce pumping energy cost and thus minimize carbon emissions to the environment under these circumstances the present study was taken up with the following objectives namely 1 identifying the externalities of use of treated wastewater from paper plants in agriculture 2 to assess the impact of treated wastewater use in the agriculture in terms of biophysical socio economic and environmental factors and 3 to suggest policies for use of treated wastewater in agriculture compatible with environmental requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection the data relating to the year 2015 16 were collected for the research during november december 2017 following a multistage random sampling technique among the various industrial sectors pulp and paper industry is the third largest water consuming industrial sector in india apart from thermal power plants and engineering industries table 1 paper and pulp industry however is categorized as one of the most polluting industries due to discharge of huge volumes of high colored and toxic wastewater effluent in the environment causing pollution of land soil air and water martin 1998 hence it is chosen for the study tamil nadu news print limited tnpl was purposively selected for the present study in the first stage since it has the largest paper production capacity at a single location in india and this is the only mill that provides the treated wastewater for irrigation to farms in nearby farming villages in tamil nadu state all the five villages using treated wastewater from tnpl for irrigation were considered in stage ii the third stage was selection of the sample farmers in this stage the number of farmers to be selected was based on the probability proportion to size from among the five villeges the sample size n of household units in the study area is determined by applying the following formula arkin and colton 1950 n n z 2 p 1 p n d 2 z 2 p 1 p where n sample size n total number of households 638 z confidence level at 95 level z 1 96 p estimated population proportion 0 5 this maximizes the sample size d error limit of 5 0 05 application of the above sampling formula with the values specified which in fact maximizes the sample size yielded a total required sample of 240 a total of 240 farmers were hence selected for the present study this consisted of i sample farmers irrigating their farms with treated wastewater 120 farmers and ii farmers operating control farms 120 farmers the sample distribution is presented in table 2 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 descriptive analytical descriptive statistics namely the mean and percentage analyses besides frequency analysis were used to examine the impacts using treated wastewater for irrigation in sample farms 2 2 2 responses priority index rpi in the quantification of constraints expressed by the farmers using treated wastewater in agriculture the responses priority index rpi was constructed as a product of proportion of responses pr and priority estimate pe where pr for the ith constraint gives the ratio of number of responses for a particular constraint to the total responses as per equation rao 2011 r p i i j 1 k f i j x k 1 j i 1 1 j 1 k f i j 0 r p i 5 where rpii response priority index for ith constraint fij number of responses for the jth priority of the ith constraint i 1 2 l j 1 2 3 k j 1 k f i j total number of responses for the ith constraint k number of priorities 1 strongly agree 2 agree 3 moderate 4 disagree and5 strongly disagree x k 1 j scores for the jth priority i 1 1 j 1 k f i j total number of responses to all constraints here larger the rpi higher would be the importance for that constraint in the present study the following five constraints were identified 1 increased soil salinity 2 contamination of groundwater 3 reduced water quality 4 occurrence of skin diseases and 5 reduced air quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact assessment of use of treated wastewater in the sample farms both positive and negative externalities accompanied the use of treated wastewater from paper plant in the agriculture activities in the following three dimensions namely bio physical socio economic and technology 3 1 1 positive externalities identified 3 1 1 1 bio physical impact 1 prevented discharge of saline wastewater into the river cauvery system 2 reduced irrigation water scarcity 3 assured irrigation water availability to farms in the vicinity 4 increased vegetative cover area 5 increased cropping area 6 increased livestock population 3 1 1 2 socio economic impact 1 increase in land value 2 increase in employment opportunities 3 increased farming income 4 increased cropping income 5 increased livestock s income 3 1 1 3 technological impact 1 reduction in manure and fertilizer use 3 1 2 negative externalities identified 3 1 2 1 bio physical impact 1 increased soil salinity change in soil quality 2 groundwater pollution change in groundwater quality 3 1 2 2 socio economic impact 1 human health problems 3 2 positive impacts of treated wastewater irrigation 3 2 1 bio physical impact 3 2 1 1 surface water availability the critical data in terms of water use by the paper plant and wastewater generation appendix a revealed that 27 089 kilo liter kl of wastewater is released every day and it amounted to 1 97 21 315 k l annually out of which 98 87 485 k l is made available for irrigation during the year to cover 672 06 ha in the five villages located closer to the industry otherwise these villages were totally rain fed prior to commissioning of the industry farmers use this treated wastewater exclusively for perennial crops coconut and cumbu napier grass the treated wastewater irrigation cycle is presented in appendix b the waste water irrigation flow starts from paper industry moves to irrigate the fields then return from the irrigated fields back to paper industry the rainwater also moves from irrigated fields to industry 3 2 1 2 change in groundwater level the flow of treated wastewater had increased the groundwater level in the study area the results are presented in table 3 the total number of open wells and bore wells owned by the sample farms using treated wastewater increased from 13 to 82 and from zero to 25 respectively the average depth water level from surface of open well in the sample farms using treated wastewater improved to 25 feet as compared to the pre industry period of sample farms 32 33 feet the average total depth of bore well in the sample farm using treated wastewater was 170 27 feet during the current period and there was no bore well sunk during the pre industry period 3 2 1 3 change in the groundwater level during seasons water levels of open wells and bore wells presented in table 4 changed according to the season in summer season the water level of open well was 19 feet from the land surface area in the sample farms using treated wastewater whereas in the pre industry period it was 37 73 feet during the rainy season it increased in the current period further by 1 30 feet to 17 70 feet whereas in the pre industry period it remained at 22 46 feet in the treated wastewater irrigated farms in the rainy season the sample farms were using only treated wastewater surface flow for irrigation this also added to the higher water table however in summer the farmers used both treated wastewater and supplemented groundwater for irrigation pushing down the water level as compared to the rainy season 3 2 1 4 change in vegetative cover topographical view of the vegetative cover in sample farms using treated wastewater during 1993 94 and 2015 16 showed a vast change it could be observed from the fig 1 that during the year 1993 farming was scanty as agriculture was entirely based on monsoon whereas in 2015 16 the fig 2 displayed would show that more area was brought under cultivation green cover after starting the use of treated wastewater for irrigation fig 3 would reveal that the area where control farms are located which entirely depended on monsoon did not show much vegetative cover during 2015 16 3 2 1 5 increase in cropping area and change in cropping pattern in the sample farms it could be observed from table 5 that the mean cultivated area in the sample farms using treated wastewater was relatively higher 1 77 ha during the post industry period compared to the pre industry period 1 42 ha and that of control farms 1 08 ha the major crop cultivated in the post industry period in the sample farms using treated wastewater were coconut with 1 01 ha 57 06 per cent fodder sorghum with 0 34 ha 19 21 per cent and cumbu napier grass with 0 42 ha 23 73 per cent the major crops raised in the pre industry period in these sample farms were sorghum with 0 91 ha 64 08 per cent and pearl millet with 0 51 ha 35 92 per cent the major crops raised in the current period in the control farms were sorghum with 0 49 ha 45 37 per cent followed by finger millet with 0 33 ha 30 56 per cent and pearl millet with 0 26 ha 24 07 per cent hence the shift from millets exclusively to a combination of the high water consuming commercial oil bearing tree coconut fodder sorghum and cumbu napier grass to support livestock was clearly visible 3 2 1 6 change in livestock position in the sample farms the details of livestock position of sample farms are furnished in table 6 the average number of livestock remained more or less same in both the pre industry period and the post industry wastewater irrigated period in the sample farms at 3 38 and 3 35 however the composition of the types of livestock differed in the pre industry period while goat and sheep dominated with 40 83 per cent followed by poultry with 36 39 per cent in the post industry period when farms were irrigated with treated wastewater the share of cattle dominated with 44 18 per cent followed by poultry with 33 43 per cent and buffaloes with 15 52 per cent the goat and sheep accounted for only 6 87 per cent during pre industry period both cattle and buffaloes accounted for only 22 78 per cent together the share of different types of livestock in control farms resembled mostly the pre industry period farms currently receiving irrigation 3 2 2 socio economic impact 3 2 2 1 impact on land value difference in value of land it could be observed from table 7 that the mean price of agricultural land in the sample farms using treated wastewater was substantially higher rs 19 76 lakhs compared to the control farms rs 6 42 lakhs 3 2 2 2 change in employment status of sample farms figures in the parentheses indicate percentage to total number of respondents n 120 the details of employment status of sample farms presented table 8 would reveal that the man days in crop activities in sample farms irrigated by treated wastewater was substantially higher at 108 man days per farm per year during the post industry period compared to that of pre industry period with 47 man days whereas in the control farms the employment in crop activities was still lower at 31 man days per year the employment pattern would reveal that while in the pre industry period agriculture remained as the primary source of employment in all sample households 100 per cent in the sample farms irrigated by treated wastewater during the post industry period it declined to 78 33 per cent while employment in tnpl as primary occupation accounted for 18 33 per cent in these farms employment in government organizations and banks accounted for 3 34 per cent in control farms while 60 00 per cent of heads of sample households had agriculture as primary occupation 38 33 per cent had employment in tnpl as primary occupation whereas 1 67 per cent had other areas as primary occupation 3 2 2 3 change in the income in the sample farms rs ha 3 2 2 3 1 change in the crop income in the sample farms rs ha the change in the crop income in the sample farms presented in table 9 would reveal that the average net income in sample farms using treated wastewater was high at rs 1 33 017 85 compared to the pre industry period rs 11 338 93 and that of the control farms rs 1 859 60 in the sample farms using treated wastewater the additional income gained was rs 1 21 678 92 and rs 1 31 158 25 while compared to pre industry period and that of control farms thus the economic advantage of using treated wastewater for irrigation is clearly established 3 2 2 3 2 change in livestock income in the sample farms rs ha the details of income from livestock presented table 10 would reveal that the net income from livestock in the wastewater irrigated farms was substantially higher at rs 45 901 26 compared to that of the pre industry period with rs 13 899 05 whereas in the control farms the net income was still lower at rs 12 924 69 thus clearly establishing the advantage of the farms receiving treated wastewater for irrigation 3 2 3 technological impact 3 2 3 1 reduction in manure and fertilizer use it could be seen from the table 11 that the inputs utilized per year per hectare of coconut orchard happened to be 6 92 tons of fym and 342 kg of fertilizer nutrients however the study by vinodhini and deshmukh 2017 using normal source of irrigation water revealed that the quantity of manure and fertilizer nutrients applied in coconut orchard were 11 94 tons and 481 66 kg respectively which happened to be much higher as compared to the sample farms considered in the same year it implied that the sample farmers using treated wastewater for irrigation could save 5 02 tons of fym and 139 12 kg of fertilizer nutrients per hectare per year the cost of fym and fertilizer nutrients worked out to rs 3 460 00 and rs 7 694 52 per hectare per year respectively for the sample farms using treated wastewater for irrigation however the study by vinodhini and deshmukh 2017 using normal source of irrigation water revealed that the cost of manure and fertilizer nutrients applied in coconut orchard were rs 5 970 00 and rs 9 693 00 per hectare per year respectively which happened to be much higher as compared to the present study it implied that the sample farmers using treated wastewater for irrigation could save rs 2 510 worth of fym and rs 1 998 48 worth of fertilizer nutrients per hectare per year which would indicate the saving in cost of cultivation and production 3 3 negative externalities 3 3 1 bio physical impact 3 3 1 1 change in soil quality soil quality in the sample farms was analysed and results presented in table 12 it could be seen from the table that the average ph level of soil in both category sample farms using treated wastewater 7 89 and control farms 7 48 were neutral the average electrical conductivity was lower than fao specified level and remained at 0 30 in the sample farms using treated wastewater and 0 09 in control farms this would clearly establish that the salt load remained low compared to fao standards the chloride levels were also lower at 20 82 and 35 00 in the treated wastewater irrigated farms and the control farms respectively therefore it could be safely inferred that wastewater irrigation did not affect the soil quality there was no water quality and soil quality data available for pre industrial period in the study area so we focused only post industrial period comparing with the control farms in the study area 3 3 1 2 change in groundwater quality groundwater quality of open well and bore well was analysed and the results presented in table 13 it could be seen from the table that the average ph level of water in open well and bore well in sample farms using treated wastewater stood at 7 07 and 7 14 respectively according to fao standards the ph of the groundwater in the range of 6 5 8 4 is termed neutral the average electrical conductivity was high in both the open well and bore well water in sample farms using treated wastewater which would clearly establish the higher salt load the average level of sodium was in the permissible range but sodium presence was towards the upper limit of the range the average chloride presence ranged beyond the upper limit by a very high margin in both the open well and bore well water this would indicate the potential for toxicity to certain crops and occurrence of permeability problems in the long run 3 4 opinion of the sample farmers on the impact of use of treated wastewater in agriculture general opinion of the sample farmers on the impact of using treated wastewater on agricultural was obtained and the results presented in table 14 it could be noticed from the table that 97 50 per cent of the sample respondents reported using of treated wastewater in agriculture had a positive impact and would help in bringing additional area under crops 94 17 per cent reported it helped to alter the cropping pattern 90 83 per cent opined that income among farmers increased 84 17 per cent stated water availability increased 77 50 per cent indicated extended crop season 73 33 per cent reported increase of cropping intensity 73 33 per cent observed increase in on farm employment 58 33 per cent indicated reduction in fresh water extraction and use 53 33 per cent reported increase in fodder availability and only 23 33 per cent felt it helped in conserving the environment thus the farmers had greater perception about the improvements in agro economic situation rather than the environment degradation 3 5 constraints expressed by the sample farmers on treated wastewater use in agriculture the ranks would indicate the farmers preference on problems in using treated wastewater for irrigation the results of the analysis are given in table 15 the response priority index indicated that the contamination of groundwater was given utmost priority by the farmers and ranked it first with a mean score of 0 86 followed by increase in the soil salinity 0 80 reduced water quality 0 75 occurrence of skin diseases like skin rashes 0 69 and reduced air quality 0 46 in that order the results indicate overall the need for either reducing these parameters or taking alternative options including crop choices irrigation methods and input use particularly fertilizers 4 conclusion and policy implication in view of the irrigation benefits that would increase crop and livestock activity employment at farms significant increases in income among others the treated wastewater from the paper industry may be used to augment irrigation water availability the tnpl with a production capacity of 0 245 million tons of paper per annum would provide 9 88 million kilo liter of treated wastewater per year this water would be able to irrigate 672 06 ha of coconut in the surrounding villages which were rainfed previously moreover the responsibility of treating the wastewater rests with the industry hence no expenditure to the farmers this would show that india having 750 functioning paper mills with a total capacity of 14 69 million tons of paper fao stat 2016 would release an estimated 592 40 million kilo liter of treated wastewater per annum as computed based on the availability stated by tnpl i it will be sufficient to irrigate an estimated 40 296 39 ha of coconut which requires irrigation all through the year ii in the case of growing alternate crops that use less quantity of water per hectare of the crop the treated wastewater of 592 40 million kilo liter based on the crop requirement can irrigate between 0 46 lakh hectare to 0 85 lakh hectare of cotton or 1 19 lakh to 1 69 lakh hectare of peas or 0 74 lakh to 1 19 lakh hectare of maize or 1 19 lakh to 1 98 lakh hectare of bean or 1 98 lakh to 2 37 lakh hectare of industrial hemp which are suited crops and taking into account the upper and lower limit therefore the government can make a policy decision to direct the mills established or to be established to provide the treated wastewater for irrigation the examination of guidelines for use of treated wastewater in agriculture by who 1989 and work by pereira et al 2002 and shelef 1991 however indicated crops choices are to be made based on reuse conditions and also the exposed group of people such as workers nearby public and consumers these also indicate presence of chemical pollutants such as heavy metals etc in the industrial discharge that are toxic to humans plants and aquatic biota in the long term the toxic material may buildup in the soil and after many years of irrigation the levels of these metals may reach a stage where plants may take such pollutants at toxic concentrations to humans similar situations may arise in the case of salinity study by puschenreiter et al 2005 as quoted from kloke et al 1984 and machelett et al 1993 would show that the relative accumulation of heavy metals in the edible parts happened to be very low in the case of crops such as bean peas melon tomato pepper and drupe fruit and low for maize cauliflower etc the transfer factors computed as the ratio of total concentration in plant to total concentration in soil of heavy metals such as cd cu ni and pb were also found to be relatively lower for radish onion maize cob and tomato the industrial crops suggested for cultivation on metals contaminated soils yanchev et al 2000 and angelova et al 2004a 2004b included fibre plants such as flax cotton and hemp the present study also showed increasing chemical load particularly in the ground water therefore government may bring in policies to encourage use of treated wastewater for irrigation of seasonal or annual crops instead of perennial crops that have low transfer factors with regard to heavy metals accumulation or industry crops such as fibres which are not directly consumed by people

10503,wastewater has high potential for reuse in agriculture to reduce the water scarcity problems for increasing food and environmental security avoiding direct pollution of rivers canals surface water conserving water and nutrients etc the study revealed that the water availability increased significantly during both the rainy season and summer in the open wells as well as the new bore wells sunk in the study area the area cultivated increased by 24 65 per cent along with change in cropping pattern changing over from coarse cereals namely sorghum and pearl millet to commercial crops such as coconut and fodder grass as inter crops beside fodder sorghum in the study area in the current period as a result of use of treated wastewater for irrigation the livestock activity also moved towards more cattle in place of small animals such as sheep and goats the land value per hectare remained higher at rs 19 76 lakhs in treated wastewater irrigated farms compared to that of the control farms at rs 6 42 lakhs the employment generation through crop activities in the treated wastewater irrigated farms were higher by 129 79 per cent compared to control farms the treated wastewater irrigated farms could save farm yard manure and n and p nutrients by 5 02 tons 270 22 kg and 31 04 kg respectively the net income per hectare increased by 9 32 per cent and 1 42 per cent respectively compared to the pre industry period and the net income in control farms even while the ph ec and salt load remained at permissible levels in soil the salt loads were found moving towards upper permissible limit or exceeding limits in the case of ground water the positive externalities while require government to bring in policy making paper mills to treat effluent and provide for irrigation the negative externalities when read with who stipulations and also on the basis of past studies to go for suitable crops which are seasonal or annual with safe transfer factors regarding heavy metals from soil ground water to plant parts or fiber crops which are not directly consumed by humans keywords bio physical socio economic analysis treated wastewater externality impact assessment 1 introduction water is the most abundant natural resource in the world the earth surface is covered 70 per cent by water and out of this the saline sea water is 97 per cent but the potable or drinking water is about 13 per cent of the residual which is 0 40 per cent of all the world water and the remaining is held either as ice and atmosphere jaber et al 1997 according to fao 2012 data however 30 40 per cent of the world s food comes from irrigated land comprising only 17 per cent of the total cultivated land in future water availability for agriculture will be threatened by the increasing domestic and industrial demand and use of water for irrigation in 45 countries accounting for 83 per cent of the world s population in 1995 is forecast to increase by 22 per cent between 1995 and 2025 the primary competing uses of water is typically agriculture followed by industry domestic recreational and more recently environmental preservation proper distribution of water among these sectors requires planning and management sustainability of water resources and an equitable distribution of available water drive much of this planning mccarl et al 1999 orr and colby 2004 loehman and becker 2006 finding sustainable solutions for water stressed regions is an important focus of water resources planners and policy makers for sustainable water management to occur the allocation of water must be socially fair for both current and future populations mccarl et al 1999 orr and colby 2004 loehman and becker 2006 in addition planners are forced to consider alternative sources of water that might be economically and effectively used to promote further development with the population growing at a higher rate the need for increased food production is inevitable whenever good quality water is scarce water of marginal quality or low quality will have the potential to be considered for use in agriculture use of treated wastewater in agriculture therefore could be an important consideration when its disposal is properly planned the quality of treated effluent will then become very important in terms of its performance to groundwater soil and plant for irrigation the quality of effluent will depend on crops to be irrigated the soil conditions and the system of effluent distribution adopted besides the output quality of crops grown the most appropriate wastewater treatment to be applied before effluent use in agriculture is the appropriate process which will produce an effluent meeting the recommended microbiological and chemical quality guidelines both at low cost and with minimal operational and maintenance requirements arar 1988 in arid regions where there has traditionally been scarcity of water wastewater reuse technology has been successfully implemented namely in jordan al jayyousi 2003 2004 israel friedler and hadari 2006 brenner et al 2000 spain march et al 2004 australia john 1996 bingley 1996 diana et al 1996 dillon 2000 and some parts of south africa marilyn 2006 reuse of wastewater reduces pollution load in rivers and underground besides soil and also offers a reliable water supply throughout the year fao 2012 treated wastewater has high potential for reuse in agriculture an opportunity for increasing food and environmental security avoiding direct pollution of rivers canals surface water conserving water and nutrients thereby reducing the need for chemical fertilizer and disposing of municipal and industrial wastewater in a low cost sanitary way among different sources of treated wastewater industrial treated wastewater reuse is one of the momentous components of water reuse in agriculture as the source content are known and treatment is done by the industry urkiaga 2006 stated that the different socio environmental and economical benefits resulting from water conservation and reuse included a agriculture benefits such as i value of a secure drought proof supply of reclaimed water ii increased farm production and iii value of reclaimed water nutrients i e savings in fertilizer applications and pesticides b urban water supply benefits such as i savings in the capital cost of diversion structures drought storage transfer systems and water treatment and ii savings in distribution operation and maintenance costs including pumping energy and treatment chemicals c urban wastewater benefits such as i savings in discharge pump stations and pipelines ii savings in treatment and nutrient removal costs required for discharge to sensitive waters and iii savings in operation and maintenance costs heat recovery chemicals d environmental water quality benefits such as i reduction in freshwater diversions more river flow for downstream users better downstream water quality ii reduction in pollutant discharges iii better downstream water quality reduced environmental impact and improved river aesthetics reduced impacts on fisheries and aquatic life improved public health for downstream users lower water treatment costs for downstream users improved recreational values of waterways iv reduction of the potential salinity intrusion risk in groundwater aquifers v improvement of the ecosystem and increase of the fauna and flora species due to the creation of new recreational zones parks gardens and green areas and vi improvement of the quality of the seawater and beaches e increase in the tourist activity due to the good quality of the seawater and beaches and quantity of golf courses sport fields swimming pools recreational zones etc f decrease in raw materials reagents and water or heat consumption due to water recycling in the industry decrease in the environmental penalties that these industries should pay for the wastewater discharge g increase of the quality of life of the population due to i the increase of recreational zones parks gardens sport fields golf courses etc ii the improvement of the sanitary and health quality of the water decrease of the diseases related to the water iii the improvement of the environment iv the decrease or restrain in the water price due to the non needed water diversion infrastructures and v the increase of the employment due to the creation of new jobs direct and indirectly related with water reuse besides there will also be new employments related with the increase of the tourist or agricultural activity in the zone maintenance of new green areas parks gardens and recreational zones and operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants water engineering companies suppliers of systems equipment and chemicals for wastewater treatment and water reuse mekala et al 2007 2008 argued that there would be both positive and negative externalities associated with wastewater recycling the positive externality would be environmental benefits from reduced discharge of saline wastewater into natural water bodies increased agricultural productivity and reduced climatic risks the negative externalities would include potential groundwater pollution and increase in soil salinity if used for irrigation and potential unknown ill effects on human health if used for potable uses bahri 1999 reported that about 30 43 per cent of the treated wastewater is used for agricultural and landscape irrigation in tunisia reusing wastewater for irrigation is viewed as a way to increase water resources provide supplemental nutrients and protect coastal areas water resources and sensitive receiving bodies reclaimed water was used on 8000 ha to irrigate industrial and fodder crops cereals vineyards citrus and other fruit trees regulations allow the use of secondary treated effluent on all crops except vegetables whether eaten raw or cooked regional agricultural departments supervise the water reuse decree enforcement and collect charge golf courses are also irrigated with treated effluent while industrial use and groundwater recharge opportunities are further investigated kihila 2014 explained that treated wastewater irrigation can mitigate water scarcity save disposal costs reduce pumping energy cost and thus minimize carbon emissions to the environment under these circumstances the present study was taken up with the following objectives namely 1 identifying the externalities of use of treated wastewater from paper plants in agriculture 2 to assess the impact of treated wastewater use in the agriculture in terms of biophysical socio economic and environmental factors and 3 to suggest policies for use of treated wastewater in agriculture compatible with environmental requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection the data relating to the year 2015 16 were collected for the research during november december 2017 following a multistage random sampling technique among the various industrial sectors pulp and paper industry is the third largest water consuming industrial sector in india apart from thermal power plants and engineering industries table 1 paper and pulp industry however is categorized as one of the most polluting industries due to discharge of huge volumes of high colored and toxic wastewater effluent in the environment causing pollution of land soil air and water martin 1998 hence it is chosen for the study tamil nadu news print limited tnpl was purposively selected for the present study in the first stage since it has the largest paper production capacity at a single location in india and this is the only mill that provides the treated wastewater for irrigation to farms in nearby farming villages in tamil nadu state all the five villages using treated wastewater from tnpl for irrigation were considered in stage ii the third stage was selection of the sample farmers in this stage the number of farmers to be selected was based on the probability proportion to size from among the five villeges the sample size n of household units in the study area is determined by applying the following formula arkin and colton 1950 n n z 2 p 1 p n d 2 z 2 p 1 p where n sample size n total number of households 638 z confidence level at 95 level z 1 96 p estimated population proportion 0 5 this maximizes the sample size d error limit of 5 0 05 application of the above sampling formula with the values specified which in fact maximizes the sample size yielded a total required sample of 240 a total of 240 farmers were hence selected for the present study this consisted of i sample farmers irrigating their farms with treated wastewater 120 farmers and ii farmers operating control farms 120 farmers the sample distribution is presented in table 2 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 descriptive analytical descriptive statistics namely the mean and percentage analyses besides frequency analysis were used to examine the impacts using treated wastewater for irrigation in sample farms 2 2 2 responses priority index rpi in the quantification of constraints expressed by the farmers using treated wastewater in agriculture the responses priority index rpi was constructed as a product of proportion of responses pr and priority estimate pe where pr for the ith constraint gives the ratio of number of responses for a particular constraint to the total responses as per equation rao 2011 r p i i j 1 k f i j x k 1 j i 1 1 j 1 k f i j 0 r p i 5 where rpii response priority index for ith constraint fij number of responses for the jth priority of the ith constraint i 1 2 l j 1 2 3 k j 1 k f i j total number of responses for the ith constraint k number of priorities 1 strongly agree 2 agree 3 moderate 4 disagree and5 strongly disagree x k 1 j scores for the jth priority i 1 1 j 1 k f i j total number of responses to all constraints here larger the rpi higher would be the importance for that constraint in the present study the following five constraints were identified 1 increased soil salinity 2 contamination of groundwater 3 reduced water quality 4 occurrence of skin diseases and 5 reduced air quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact assessment of use of treated wastewater in the sample farms both positive and negative externalities accompanied the use of treated wastewater from paper plant in the agriculture activities in the following three dimensions namely bio physical socio economic and technology 3 1 1 positive externalities identified 3 1 1 1 bio physical impact 1 prevented discharge of saline wastewater into the river cauvery system 2 reduced irrigation water scarcity 3 assured irrigation water availability to farms in the vicinity 4 increased vegetative cover area 5 increased cropping area 6 increased livestock population 3 1 1 2 socio economic impact 1 increase in land value 2 increase in employment opportunities 3 increased farming income 4 increased cropping income 5 increased livestock s income 3 1 1 3 technological impact 1 reduction in manure and fertilizer use 3 1 2 negative externalities identified 3 1 2 1 bio physical impact 1 increased soil salinity change in soil quality 2 groundwater pollution change in groundwater quality 3 1 2 2 socio economic impact 1 human health problems 3 2 positive impacts of treated wastewater irrigation 3 2 1 bio physical impact 3 2 1 1 surface water availability the critical data in terms of water use by the paper plant and wastewater generation appendix a revealed that 27 089 kilo liter kl of wastewater is released every day and it amounted to 1 97 21 315 k l annually out of which 98 87 485 k l is made available for irrigation during the year to cover 672 06 ha in the five villages located closer to the industry otherwise these villages were totally rain fed prior to commissioning of the industry farmers use this treated wastewater exclusively for perennial crops coconut and cumbu napier grass the treated wastewater irrigation cycle is presented in appendix b the waste water irrigation flow starts from paper industry moves to irrigate the fields then return from the irrigated fields back to paper industry the rainwater also moves from irrigated fields to industry 3 2 1 2 change in groundwater level the flow of treated wastewater had increased the groundwater level in the study area the results are presented in table 3 the total number of open wells and bore wells owned by the sample farms using treated wastewater increased from 13 to 82 and from zero to 25 respectively the average depth water level from surface of open well in the sample farms using treated wastewater improved to 25 feet as compared to the pre industry period of sample farms 32 33 feet the average total depth of bore well in the sample farm using treated wastewater was 170 27 feet during the current period and there was no bore well sunk during the pre industry period 3 2 1 3 change in the groundwater level during seasons water levels of open wells and bore wells presented in table 4 changed according to the season in summer season the water level of open well was 19 feet from the land surface area in the sample farms using treated wastewater whereas in the pre industry period it was 37 73 feet during the rainy season it increased in the current period further by 1 30 feet to 17 70 feet whereas in the pre industry period it remained at 22 46 feet in the treated wastewater irrigated farms in the rainy season the sample farms were using only treated wastewater surface flow for irrigation this also added to the higher water table however in summer the farmers used both treated wastewater and supplemented groundwater for irrigation pushing down the water level as compared to the rainy season 3 2 1 4 change in vegetative cover topographical view of the vegetative cover in sample farms using treated wastewater during 1993 94 and 2015 16 showed a vast change it could be observed from the fig 1 that during the year 1993 farming was scanty as agriculture was entirely based on monsoon whereas in 2015 16 the fig 2 displayed would show that more area was brought under cultivation green cover after starting the use of treated wastewater for irrigation fig 3 would reveal that the area where control farms are located which entirely depended on monsoon did not show much vegetative cover during 2015 16 3 2 1 5 increase in cropping area and change in cropping pattern in the sample farms it could be observed from table 5 that the mean cultivated area in the sample farms using treated wastewater was relatively higher 1 77 ha during the post industry period compared to the pre industry period 1 42 ha and that of control farms 1 08 ha the major crop cultivated in the post industry period in the sample farms using treated wastewater were coconut with 1 01 ha 57 06 per cent fodder sorghum with 0 34 ha 19 21 per cent and cumbu napier grass with 0 42 ha 23 73 per cent the major crops raised in the pre industry period in these sample farms were sorghum with 0 91 ha 64 08 per cent and pearl millet with 0 51 ha 35 92 per cent the major crops raised in the current period in the control farms were sorghum with 0 49 ha 45 37 per cent followed by finger millet with 0 33 ha 30 56 per cent and pearl millet with 0 26 ha 24 07 per cent hence the shift from millets exclusively to a combination of the high water consuming commercial oil bearing tree coconut fodder sorghum and cumbu napier grass to support livestock was clearly visible 3 2 1 6 change in livestock position in the sample farms the details of livestock position of sample farms are furnished in table 6 the average number of livestock remained more or less same in both the pre industry period and the post industry wastewater irrigated period in the sample farms at 3 38 and 3 35 however the composition of the types of livestock differed in the pre industry period while goat and sheep dominated with 40 83 per cent followed by poultry with 36 39 per cent in the post industry period when farms were irrigated with treated wastewater the share of cattle dominated with 44 18 per cent followed by poultry with 33 43 per cent and buffaloes with 15 52 per cent the goat and sheep accounted for only 6 87 per cent during pre industry period both cattle and buffaloes accounted for only 22 78 per cent together the share of different types of livestock in control farms resembled mostly the pre industry period farms currently receiving irrigation 3 2 2 socio economic impact 3 2 2 1 impact on land value difference in value of land it could be observed from table 7 that the mean price of agricultural land in the sample farms using treated wastewater was substantially higher rs 19 76 lakhs compared to the control farms rs 6 42 lakhs 3 2 2 2 change in employment status of sample farms figures in the parentheses indicate percentage to total number of respondents n 120 the details of employment status of sample farms presented table 8 would reveal that the man days in crop activities in sample farms irrigated by treated wastewater was substantially higher at 108 man days per farm per year during the post industry period compared to that of pre industry period with 47 man days whereas in the control farms the employment in crop activities was still lower at 31 man days per year the employment pattern would reveal that while in the pre industry period agriculture remained as the primary source of employment in all sample households 100 per cent in the sample farms irrigated by treated wastewater during the post industry period it declined to 78 33 per cent while employment in tnpl as primary occupation accounted for 18 33 per cent in these farms employment in government organizations and banks accounted for 3 34 per cent in control farms while 60 00 per cent of heads of sample households had agriculture as primary occupation 38 33 per cent had employment in tnpl as primary occupation whereas 1 67 per cent had other areas as primary occupation 3 2 2 3 change in the income in the sample farms rs ha 3 2 2 3 1 change in the crop income in the sample farms rs ha the change in the crop income in the sample farms presented in table 9 would reveal that the average net income in sample farms using treated wastewater was high at rs 1 33 017 85 compared to the pre industry period rs 11 338 93 and that of the control farms rs 1 859 60 in the sample farms using treated wastewater the additional income gained was rs 1 21 678 92 and rs 1 31 158 25 while compared to pre industry period and that of control farms thus the economic advantage of using treated wastewater for irrigation is clearly established 3 2 2 3 2 change in livestock income in the sample farms rs ha the details of income from livestock presented table 10 would reveal that the net income from livestock in the wastewater irrigated farms was substantially higher at rs 45 901 26 compared to that of the pre industry period with rs 13 899 05 whereas in the control farms the net income was still lower at rs 12 924 69 thus clearly establishing the advantage of the farms receiving treated wastewater for irrigation 3 2 3 technological impact 3 2 3 1 reduction in manure and fertilizer use it could be seen from the table 11 that the inputs utilized per year per hectare of coconut orchard happened to be 6 92 tons of fym and 342 kg of fertilizer nutrients however the study by vinodhini and deshmukh 2017 using normal source of irrigation water revealed that the quantity of manure and fertilizer nutrients applied in coconut orchard were 11 94 tons and 481 66 kg respectively which happened to be much higher as compared to the sample farms considered in the same year it implied that the sample farmers using treated wastewater for irrigation could save 5 02 tons of fym and 139 12 kg of fertilizer nutrients per hectare per year the cost of fym and fertilizer nutrients worked out to rs 3 460 00 and rs 7 694 52 per hectare per year respectively for the sample farms using treated wastewater for irrigation however the study by vinodhini and deshmukh 2017 using normal source of irrigation water revealed that the cost of manure and fertilizer nutrients applied in coconut orchard were rs 5 970 00 and rs 9 693 00 per hectare per year respectively which happened to be much higher as compared to the present study it implied that the sample farmers using treated wastewater for irrigation could save rs 2 510 worth of fym and rs 1 998 48 worth of fertilizer nutrients per hectare per year which would indicate the saving in cost of cultivation and production 3 3 negative externalities 3 3 1 bio physical impact 3 3 1 1 change in soil quality soil quality in the sample farms was analysed and results presented in table 12 it could be seen from the table that the average ph level of soil in both category sample farms using treated wastewater 7 89 and control farms 7 48 were neutral the average electrical conductivity was lower than fao specified level and remained at 0 30 in the sample farms using treated wastewater and 0 09 in control farms this would clearly establish that the salt load remained low compared to fao standards the chloride levels were also lower at 20 82 and 35 00 in the treated wastewater irrigated farms and the control farms respectively therefore it could be safely inferred that wastewater irrigation did not affect the soil quality there was no water quality and soil quality data available for pre industrial period in the study area so we focused only post industrial period comparing with the control farms in the study area 3 3 1 2 change in groundwater quality groundwater quality of open well and bore well was analysed and the results presented in table 13 it could be seen from the table that the average ph level of water in open well and bore well in sample farms using treated wastewater stood at 7 07 and 7 14 respectively according to fao standards the ph of the groundwater in the range of 6 5 8 4 is termed neutral the average electrical conductivity was high in both the open well and bore well water in sample farms using treated wastewater which would clearly establish the higher salt load the average level of sodium was in the permissible range but sodium presence was towards the upper limit of the range the average chloride presence ranged beyond the upper limit by a very high margin in both the open well and bore well water this would indicate the potential for toxicity to certain crops and occurrence of permeability problems in the long run 3 4 opinion of the sample farmers on the impact of use of treated wastewater in agriculture general opinion of the sample farmers on the impact of using treated wastewater on agricultural was obtained and the results presented in table 14 it could be noticed from the table that 97 50 per cent of the sample respondents reported using of treated wastewater in agriculture had a positive impact and would help in bringing additional area under crops 94 17 per cent reported it helped to alter the cropping pattern 90 83 per cent opined that income among farmers increased 84 17 per cent stated water availability increased 77 50 per cent indicated extended crop season 73 33 per cent reported increase of cropping intensity 73 33 per cent observed increase in on farm employment 58 33 per cent indicated reduction in fresh water extraction and use 53 33 per cent reported increase in fodder availability and only 23 33 per cent felt it helped in conserving the environment thus the farmers had greater perception about the improvements in agro economic situation rather than the environment degradation 3 5 constraints expressed by the sample farmers on treated wastewater use in agriculture the ranks would indicate the farmers preference on problems in using treated wastewater for irrigation the results of the analysis are given in table 15 the response priority index indicated that the contamination of groundwater was given utmost priority by the farmers and ranked it first with a mean score of 0 86 followed by increase in the soil salinity 0 80 reduced water quality 0 75 occurrence of skin diseases like skin rashes 0 69 and reduced air quality 0 46 in that order the results indicate overall the need for either reducing these parameters or taking alternative options including crop choices irrigation methods and input use particularly fertilizers 4 conclusion and policy implication in view of the irrigation benefits that would increase crop and livestock activity employment at farms significant increases in income among others the treated wastewater from the paper industry may be used to augment irrigation water availability the tnpl with a production capacity of 0 245 million tons of paper per annum would provide 9 88 million kilo liter of treated wastewater per year this water would be able to irrigate 672 06 ha of coconut in the surrounding villages which were rainfed previously moreover the responsibility of treating the wastewater rests with the industry hence no expenditure to the farmers this would show that india having 750 functioning paper mills with a total capacity of 14 69 million tons of paper fao stat 2016 would release an estimated 592 40 million kilo liter of treated wastewater per annum as computed based on the availability stated by tnpl i it will be sufficient to irrigate an estimated 40 296 39 ha of coconut which requires irrigation all through the year ii in the case of growing alternate crops that use less quantity of water per hectare of the crop the treated wastewater of 592 40 million kilo liter based on the crop requirement can irrigate between 0 46 lakh hectare to 0 85 lakh hectare of cotton or 1 19 lakh to 1 69 lakh hectare of peas or 0 74 lakh to 1 19 lakh hectare of maize or 1 19 lakh to 1 98 lakh hectare of bean or 1 98 lakh to 2 37 lakh hectare of industrial hemp which are suited crops and taking into account the upper and lower limit therefore the government can make a policy decision to direct the mills established or to be established to provide the treated wastewater for irrigation the examination of guidelines for use of treated wastewater in agriculture by who 1989 and work by pereira et al 2002 and shelef 1991 however indicated crops choices are to be made based on reuse conditions and also the exposed group of people such as workers nearby public and consumers these also indicate presence of chemical pollutants such as heavy metals etc in the industrial discharge that are toxic to humans plants and aquatic biota in the long term the toxic material may buildup in the soil and after many years of irrigation the levels of these metals may reach a stage where plants may take such pollutants at toxic concentrations to humans similar situations may arise in the case of salinity study by puschenreiter et al 2005 as quoted from kloke et al 1984 and machelett et al 1993 would show that the relative accumulation of heavy metals in the edible parts happened to be very low in the case of crops such as bean peas melon tomato pepper and drupe fruit and low for maize cauliflower etc the transfer factors computed as the ratio of total concentration in plant to total concentration in soil of heavy metals such as cd cu ni and pb were also found to be relatively lower for radish onion maize cob and tomato the industrial crops suggested for cultivation on metals contaminated soils yanchev et al 2000 and angelova et al 2004a 2004b included fibre plants such as flax cotton and hemp the present study also showed increasing chemical load particularly in the ground water therefore government may bring in policies to encourage use of treated wastewater for irrigation of seasonal or annual crops instead of perennial crops that have low transfer factors with regard to heavy metals accumulation or industry crops such as fibres which are not directly consumed by people

10504,water saving technologies are important for sustainable agriculture and forestry recent research indicates that the plant itself may alternate between several natural water sources to survive drought therefore a key issue is how to establish the boundaries of hydrological conditions important for non stressed tree growth the smart decision might be to ask the plant itself sap flow represents a suitable language to such a talk it gives long term automatic records of plant responses to environmental changes in this work we illustrate how root sap flow can be used to provide information on the thresholds for two sources of tree root water uptake superficial soil water and groundwater with this knowledge a threshold diagram can be constructed which is species and site specific such a diagram may help managers of rain fed plantations to follow the current hydrological conditions and apply irrigation as a preventive treatment to avoid growth loss and tree mortality keywords shallow and deep roots heat field deformation water sources threshold diagrams 1 introduction irrigation water is a very cost efficient part of farmer budget beyond future perspectives of water availability for irrigation needs are critical thus irrigation should be smart water should be used at its minimum level for plant needs additionally it is also useful to prevent excess of irrigated water that can be harmful for plants different irrigation technologies were introduced during the last decades to allow saving irrigated water costa et al 2007 stewart et al 2011 hess and knox 2013 galindo et al 2018 jovanovic and stikic 2018 while maintaining trees in a comfortable water status still questionable is how to establish that minimum amount of water to apply the smart decision might be to ask the plant itself roberts 2007 underlined that physiological techniques might be used to assess when plants require water preliminary studies on sap flow showed that they may provide evidence for improving water saving without harming the plant for instance they may provide information on the environmental variables to be monitored and on how to improve irrigation scheduling nadezhdina 2000 this would allow producers to know the hydrological variables to be controlled in each specific situation and when to apply irrigation to avoid loss of productivity or tree mortality new knowledge was raised from sap flow research on the alternation of sources for water uptake wu by different types of roots under some circumstances it was found that actual transpiration may follow the potential atmospheric evaporative demand even when the superficial soil is very dry due to lack scarcity of precipitation david et al 2013 2016 this means that water might not be a limitation for tree transpiration when trees are using groundwater besides superficial soil water and roots have access to this additional pool of water david et al 2013 in a study carried out in central portugal with quercus suber trees under shallow groundwater table conditions groundwater was shown to contribute more than 70 to tree transpiration during the seasonal summer drought pinto et al 2014 the importance of groundwater table gwt access was also reported for p tomentosa plantations xi et al 2017 these authors report that the depth of 3 m is the critical threshold of gwt for p tomentosa plantations growing under rain fed conditions and shallow gwt this could be connected with maximum rooting depth reaching 2 7 m in poplar tomentosa plantation growing under such conditions di et al 2018 reverse sap flow rsf in roots is known to be a good indicator of plant hydraulic redistribution hr between different soil layers sources when soil moisture heterogeneity exists burgess et al 1998 2001 nadezhdina et al 2010 it is easy to detect negative flows and indicates soil drying around a monitored root after a certain threshold of drying this root may no longer be able to effectively contribute to refill tree internal reserves depleted during intensive daytime transpiration however even after reverse root sap flow occurrence plants may be able to cope with drought using different water sources e g groundwater lignotuber and performing hr david et al 2016 nadezhdina et al 2015 the measurement of root sap flow in stem and different root types may be useful to understand and evaluate this process the critical issue is to determine the moment when water is limited in all pools of possible water uptake in this work we aim to illustrate how to monitor this critical moment for the plants through the measurement of sap flow in stem and in roots of different types exemplified in a large q suber tree we also aim to provide information on the thresholds of the main sources for tree water uptake soil and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description sample tree the experimental site companhia das lezirias located in central portugal 38 50 n 8 49 w 15 m above sea level is a savannah type quercus suber woodland the climate is mediterranean with hot dry summers and wet cold winters average annual 1951 1980 rainfall and open water evaporation are 708 mm and 1347 mm respectively rainfall mainly occurs from autumn to early spring mean daily temperature is 15 6 c ranging from maximum of 22 c in august to a minimum of 9 9 c in january 1951 1980 soil is a deep haplic arenosol with high permeability and low water retention capacity a shallow water table stands over a thick clay layer located at approximately 9 m depth this study concentrates on an intensively monitored 60 year old tree with a mean height diameter at breast height and crown projected area of 12 1 m 0 57 m and 172 3 m2 respectively age dimensions and water status of neighbouring trees of the stand are similar to those of the sampled tree tree leaf area index on a crown projected area basis is 5 1 m2 m 2 estimated by destructive sampling at completion of the study david et al 2012 2 2 meteorological measurements solar radiation pyranometer cm6b kipp and zonen delft the netherlands was measured at the top of a 16 m high scaffold tower rainfall tipping

30 min intervals campbell scientific shepshed uk values provided by the probe were manually calibrated every week floating device 2 4 sap flow measurements the heat field deformation hfd method was used to intensively measure sap flow in stem and roots of the monitored q suber tree from june 2007 to september 2008 this method is based on the analysis of temperature gradients measured by two pairs of differential thermocouples changing due to moving sap around a linear heater radially inserted in a tree stem or root more details on the method are given in nadezhdina et al 1998 and nadezhdina 2012 2018 two types of sensors dendronet brno czech rep were installed single point sensors were used for sap flow measurement in five small superficial roots with diameter ranging from 1 6 to 5 cm a multi point sensor was used to measure sap flow in a large lateral root diameter 10 8 cm hereafter named as big root sensors were installed at a distance of 1 6 2 9 m from tree base in all roots sensors installed close to stem will have a low probability to have a sinker between sensor and the stem will behave as deep roots and we will not measure hydraulic lift hl but as the distance between sensor position and stem base increases the probability of having sinkers between them i e sensor and stem also increases in those circumstances sensors will behave as shallow connected roots and will be able to record hl nadezhdina et al 2006 the aforementioned procedure for sensor installation was done to allow the separation between shallow and deep roots and to increase the possibility to measure hl during drought sap flow in stem was measured by multi point hfd sensors in four azimuths stem sap flow was calculated as an average considering radial and circumferential variability data were recorded in campbell cr10x loggers campbell scientific shepshed uk detailed overview of sensor identification and positioning in stem and roots is shown in table 1 3 results 3 1 meteorological and hydrological conditions at the observed site during the wet season the topsoil was wet but soil moisture decreased drastically in summer fig 1 a groundwater was within the access of tree deep roots during the study period and tree transpiration followed the pattern of solar radiation even during the dry period fig 1c soil moisture responded immediately to rainfall whereas the recharge of groundwater had a big lag behind the occurrence of rainfall fig 1a b the decline of the gwt was not only due to water uptake by vegetation but also to drainage to the nearby streamlines it is groundwater drainage that sustains low flows in those water courses 3 2 identification of root type according to sap flow records a large root big root was taken as a proxy of the deepest root since the probability of having sinkers connected to it was the highest when a relationship between this big root and the other five small lateral roots was established we found that sap flow in two of them was linearly correlated to sap flow in the big root fig 2 a this indicates that these roots also had access to a deep water source and hence they were marked as deep roots sap flow variation was higher in the two small deep roots than in the big root fig 2a as they did not always reach gwt as the big root did sap flow in the other three small lateral roots had no relation to sap flow in the big root fig 2b the lack of a relationship fig 2b strongly indicates that these roots were shallow roots without sinkers depending only on moisture of the superficial soil beyond sap flow in these two root types shallow and deep connected was periodically oppositely directed when sap flow was negative in the shallow roots it was highly positive in the big root and deep roots and vice versa 3 3 contribution of different root types to stem transpiration maximum daily stem sap flow was maintained high during the hot and dry summers presumably by deep roots whereas wu by shallow roots rapidly decreased with drought fig 3 sap flow in shallow roots increased quickly after rains and remained high even when stem sap flow gradually decreased in autumn due to the decreasing evaporation demand sap flow in shallow roots was much more variable during the growing season than in deeper roots these roots represent the main source for tree wu during the summer drought 3 4 negative night flow in shallow roots as a predictor of hydrological thresholds during drought deep roots supported high flows in stem and also provided water by hl to shallow roots in dry superficial soil that is why reverse night flow in shallow roots is important for the characterization of tree behaviour in the dry period to better understand root functioning during summer we related the changes in the two main water sources swc fig 4 a and gwt fig 4b to night time rsf in shallow roots and sap flow in the big root the deepest one with the increase in drought the amplitude of night time negative sap flow in shallow roots also increased fig 4a indicating higher driving forces of drying soil lower pressure water potentials and probably increasing resistances to lift water to overcome increasing gravitational forces and decreasing number of deep roots able to reach gwt for almost the whole range of swc sap flow in the big root was above zero indicating the ability to compensate the limited water uptake from the drying superficial soil by deep water uptake during this period a low variation of night positive flow was observed in deep roots however when swc approached 0 015 m3 m 3 sap flow in the big root became close to zero a similar situation was observed when negative sap flow in shallow roots was compared to gwt fig 4b sap flow in the deepest root big root only started to approach zero around 4 m depth this is not probably due to increasing gravitational potential which has to be compensated by increasing sucking forces of drying superficial soil but because this root probably started to be disconnected from gwt 3 5 threshold diagram when the boundaries of hydrological conditions are combined with the dynamics of both hydrological variables the threshold diagram td for the specific oak tree growing at the lezirias site is represented in fig 5 in the tds constructed for the two years of observations 2007 2008 the three main climatic hydrological phases are presented summer drought rain break and winter recharge the tds show for example that there were no critical conditions for q suber in both years but in 2008 they were rather close to critical in both years although gwt was lower than 4 m this was not yet critical for trees because rain breaks were in time the circle in fig 5b indicates the period in 2008 when we stopped measuring sap flow after the small autumn rains swc increased for a while but after it decreased again there were 2 3 days in october which were close to critical but significant rains 58 mm occurred and a green safe area for the trees was reached again 3 6 threshold diagram for a critical scenario and preventive measures to avoid tree growth loss and mortality as seen before fig 5 tds for the observed years show that there were no critical conditions for tree growth during the study period in order to demonstrate td relevance for severe conditions endangering tree growth and mortality we modeled a hypothetical td where both water sources decreased drastically into the pink stress zone for that we used data of swc and gwt for the dry period of both years when reverse sap flow in shallow roots was recorded fig 6 a very strong correlation between both water sources was found which was used for construction of the hypothetical td fig 7 due to a delayed rain break trees would clearly be in the critical pink zone if nothing is done trend 1 in fig 7 with a decrease in growth and possible mortality the only way to overcome these limitations during this critical period would be through irrigation trying to keep trees in the safe green zone trend 2 in fig 7 4 discussion the present study was carried out in a 60 year old q suber tree under mediterranean climate conditions wet season in autumn winter and early spring and dry hot summer fig 1 under a deep haplic arenosol overlying a shallow water table in this type of climate trees are prone to suffer some degree of water stress or even mortality under severe conditions during the dry and hot season the studied tree was intensively equipped with hfd sensors to monitor sap flow in stem and roots due to the complexity and cost of the hfd method as well to the intensive experimental measuring design only one tree was monitored by this methodology however the representativeness of the water status and tree transpiration of the studied tree was checked against data measured in neighbouring ones a linear regression through the origin between predawn leaf water potential of the studied tree and the average of ten surrounding ones had a slope

granier 1985 had a slope of 1 11 and an r2 of 0 71 18 months daily values pinto et al 2014 additionally the lithology and hydrogeology of the site is spatially homogeneous fig 2 and our previous studies nadezhdina et al 2008 2010 david et al 2013 show that the hfd method with sensors installed in roots is successful in separating between shallow and deep connected roots during the experimental period 2007 2008 the studied tree was able to survive the seasonal summer drought without stress accessing both water sources soil water sw and groundwater gw the soil water reservoir is however much smaller than that of groundwater during the seasonal drought deep roots were able to access and uptake groundwater fig 3 maintaining tree transpiration highly coupled to incoming solar radiation fig 1 both water pools mutually append each other providing conditions for tree survival and growth during drought this has been already shown for the studied site in one of our previous papers david et al 2013 though through a quite different data analysis procedure similar patterns of water use are common in many other forest ecosystems around the world whenever groundwater is

gou and miller 2014 gou and miller 2014 found that only a small portion of deep roots representing 15 of the total root bulk of blue oak may uptake groundwater contributing to over 80 of tree transpiration during the dry summer in california usa mcelrone et al 2004 suggest that high levels of groundwater uptake can be explained by minimal flow resistance of deep roots due to their anatomical structure david et al 2013 reported a top down decrease of root mean vessel diameter in the studied q suber tree differently from what was reported by mcelrone et al 2004 for other species however vessel area per unit of sampled xylem area was higher in sinker roots and in very deep fine root filaments in q suber suggesting that these deep roots are mainly oriented towards the transport of water deep roots are not only the main support of transpiration during daytime in summer but perform hl transferring deep water to shallow roots in the dry soil at night through a novel data analyses presented in this work we found that reverse night sap flow in shallow roots and zero flow in deep roots is a good identifier of the boundaries of hydrological conditions for the two water uptake pools available at the site fig 4 for non stressful conditions shows that zero flow in the deep roots and corresponding negative flows in shallow roots may characterize the hydrological thresholds for the study site lezírias probably around 0 015 m3 m 3 for swc and ca 4 m for gwt upon these critical thresholds for the two pools of water another novel approach tds fig 5 was developed to illustrate and characterize the hydrological conditions for tree development at the studied site the tds show that there were no critical conditions for q suber growth in both years 2007 2008 although in 2008 they were rather close to critical fig 5 however if in further years the usual autumn decrease of gwt is not compensated by an increase in swc after rain break trees might suffer water stress pink zone of the threshold diagram impairing tree growth first and causing mortality if conditions become more severe fig 7 the td approach can be easily applied to sites where these hydrological variables are measured 5 conclusions this study shows that the hfd method through the measurement of sap flow in roots and stems is an efficient tool to characterize the critical hydrological thresholds for different pools of tree water uptake in the studied case trees had access to two water pools soil water and groundwater reverse night sap flow in shallow roots and night sap flow in deep roots approaching zero were found to be a good indicator of both hydrological thresholds when these thresholds are surpassed trees may undergo loss of growth or even mortality in

10504,water saving technologies are important for sustainable agriculture and forestry recent research indicates that the plant itself may alternate between several natural water sources to survive drought therefore a key issue is how to establish the boundaries of hydrological conditions important for non stressed tree growth the smart decision might be to ask the plant itself sap flow represents a suitable language to such a talk it gives long term automatic records of plant responses to environmental changes in this work we illustrate how root sap flow can be used to provide information on the thresholds for two sources of tree root water uptake superficial soil water and groundwater with this knowledge a threshold diagram can be constructed which is species and site specific such a diagram may help managers of rain fed plantations to follow the current hydrological conditions and apply irrigation as a preventive treatment to avoid growth loss and tree mortality keywords shallow and deep roots heat field deformation water sources threshold diagrams 1 introduction irrigation water is a very cost efficient part of farmer budget beyond future perspectives of water availability for irrigation needs are critical thus irrigation should be smart water should be used at its minimum level for plant needs additionally it is also useful to prevent excess of irrigated water that can be harmful for plants different irrigation technologies were introduced during the last decades to allow saving irrigated water costa et al 2007 stewart et al 2011 hess and knox 2013 galindo et al 2018 jovanovic and stikic 2018 while maintaining trees in a comfortable water status still questionable is how to establish that minimum amount of water to apply the smart decision might be to ask the plant itself roberts 2007 underlined that physiological techniques might be used to assess when plants require water preliminary studies on sap flow showed that they may provide evidence for improving water saving without harming the plant for instance they may provide information on the environmental variables to be monitored and on how to improve irrigation scheduling nadezhdina 2000 this would allow producers to know the hydrological variables to be controlled in each specific situation and when to apply irrigation to avoid loss of productivity or tree mortality new knowledge was raised from sap flow research on the alternation of sources for water uptake wu by different types of roots under some circumstances it was found that actual transpiration may follow the potential atmospheric evaporative demand even when the superficial soil is very dry due to lack scarcity of precipitation david et al 2013 2016 this means that water might not be a limitation for tree transpiration when trees are using groundwater besides superficial soil water and roots have access to this additional pool of water david et al 2013 in a study carried out in central portugal with quercus suber trees under shallow groundwater table conditions groundwater was shown to contribute more than 70 to tree transpiration during the seasonal summer drought pinto et al 2014 the importance of groundwater table gwt access was also reported for p tomentosa plantations xi et al 2017 these authors report that the depth of 3 m is the critical threshold of gwt for p tomentosa plantations growing under rain fed conditions and shallow gwt this could be connected with maximum rooting depth reaching 2 7 m in poplar tomentosa plantation growing under such conditions di et al 2018 reverse sap flow rsf in roots is known to be a good indicator of plant hydraulic redistribution hr between different soil layers sources when soil moisture heterogeneity exists burgess et al 1998 2001 nadezhdina et al 2010 it is easy to detect negative flows and indicates soil drying around a monitored root after a certain threshold of drying this root may no longer be able to effectively contribute to refill tree internal reserves depleted during intensive daytime transpiration however even after reverse root sap flow occurrence plants may be able to cope with drought using different water sources e g groundwater lignotuber and performing hr david et al 2016 nadezhdina et al 2015 the measurement of root sap flow in stem and different root types may be useful to understand and evaluate this process the critical issue is to determine the moment when water is limited in all pools of possible water uptake in this work we aim to illustrate how to monitor this critical moment for the plants through the measurement of sap flow in stem and in roots of different types exemplified in a large q suber tree we also aim to provide information on the thresholds of the main sources for tree water uptake soil and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description sample tree the experimental site companhia das lezirias located in central portugal 38 50 n 8 49 w 15 m above sea level is a savannah type quercus suber woodland the climate is mediterranean with hot dry summers and wet cold winters average annual 1951 1980 rainfall and open water evaporation are 708 mm and 1347 mm respectively rainfall mainly occurs from autumn to early spring mean daily temperature is 15 6 c ranging from maximum of 22 c in august to a minimum of 9 9 c in january 1951 1980 soil is a deep haplic arenosol with high permeability and low water retention capacity a shallow water table stands over a thick clay layer located at approximately 9 m depth this study concentrates on an intensively monitored 60 year old tree with a mean height diameter at breast height and crown projected area of 12 1 m 0 57 m and 172 3 m2 respectively age dimensions and water status of neighbouring trees of the stand are similar to those of the sampled tree tree leaf area index on a crown projected area basis is 5 1 m2 m 2 estimated by destructive sampling at completion of the study david et al 2012 2 2 meteorological measurements solar radiation pyranometer cm6b kipp and zonen delft the netherlands was measured at the top of a 16 m high scaffold tower rainfall tipping

30 min intervals campbell scientific shepshed uk values provided by the probe were manually calibrated every week floating device 2 4 sap flow measurements the heat field deformation hfd method was used to intensively measure sap flow in stem and roots of the monitored q suber tree from june 2007 to september 2008 this method is based on the analysis of temperature gradients measured by two pairs of differential thermocouples changing due to moving sap around a linear heater radially inserted in a tree stem or root more details on the method are given in nadezhdina et al 1998 and nadezhdina 2012 2018 two types of sensors dendronet brno czech rep were installed single point sensors were used for sap flow measurement in five small superficial roots with diameter ranging from 1 6 to 5 cm a multi point sensor was used to measure sap flow in a large lateral root diameter 10 8 cm hereafter named as big root sensors were installed at a distance of 1 6 2 9 m from tree base in all roots sensors installed close to stem will have a low probability to have a sinker between sensor and the stem will behave as deep roots and we will not measure hydraulic lift hl but as the distance between sensor position and stem base increases the probability of having sinkers between them i e sensor and stem also increases in those circumstances sensors will behave as shallow connected roots and will be able to record hl nadezhdina et al 2006 the aforementioned procedure for sensor installation was done to allow the separation between shallow and deep roots and to increase the possibility to measure hl during drought sap flow in stem was measured by multi point hfd sensors in four azimuths stem sap flow was calculated as an average considering radial and circumferential variability data were recorded in campbell cr10x loggers campbell scientific shepshed uk detailed overview of sensor identification and positioning in stem and roots is shown in table 1 3 results 3 1 meteorological and hydrological conditions at the observed site during the wet season the topsoil was wet but soil moisture decreased drastically in summer fig 1 a groundwater was within the access of tree deep roots during the study period and tree transpiration followed the pattern of solar radiation even during the dry period fig 1c soil moisture responded immediately to rainfall whereas the recharge of groundwater had a big lag behind the occurrence of rainfall fig 1a b the decline of the gwt was not only due to water uptake by vegetation but also to drainage to the nearby streamlines it is groundwater drainage that sustains low flows in those water courses 3 2 identification of root type according to sap flow records a large root big root was taken as a proxy of the deepest root since the probability of having sinkers connected to it was the highest when a relationship between this big root and the other five small lateral roots was established we found that sap flow in two of them was linearly correlated to sap flow in the big root fig 2 a this indicates that these roots also had access to a deep water source and hence they were marked as deep roots sap flow variation was higher in the two small deep roots than in the big root fig 2a as they did not always reach gwt as the big root did sap flow in the other three small lateral roots had no relation to sap flow in the big root fig 2b the lack of a relationship fig 2b strongly indicates that these roots were shallow roots without sinkers depending only on moisture of the superficial soil beyond sap flow in these two root types shallow and deep connected was periodically oppositely directed when sap flow was negative in the shallow roots it was highly positive in the big root and deep roots and vice versa 3 3 contribution of different root types to stem transpiration maximum daily stem sap flow was maintained high during the hot and dry summers presumably by deep roots whereas wu by shallow roots rapidly decreased with drought fig 3 sap flow in shallow roots increased quickly after rains and remained high even when stem sap flow gradually decreased in autumn due to the decreasing evaporation demand sap flow in shallow roots was much more variable during the growing season than in deeper roots these roots represent the main source for tree wu during the summer drought 3 4 negative night flow in shallow roots as a predictor of hydrological thresholds during drought deep roots supported high flows in stem and also provided water by hl to shallow roots in dry superficial soil that is why reverse night flow in shallow roots is important for the characterization of tree behaviour in the dry period to better understand root functioning during summer we related the changes in the two main water sources swc fig 4 a and gwt fig 4b to night time rsf in shallow roots and sap flow in the big root the deepest one with the increase in drought the amplitude of night time negative sap flow in shallow roots also increased fig 4a indicating higher driving forces of drying soil lower pressure water potentials and probably increasing resistances to lift water to overcome increasing gravitational forces and decreasing number of deep roots able to reach gwt for almost the whole range of swc sap flow in the big root was above zero indicating the ability to compensate the limited water uptake from the drying superficial soil by deep water uptake during this period a low variation of night positive flow was observed in deep roots however when swc approached 0 015 m3 m 3 sap flow in the big root became close to zero a similar situation was observed when negative sap flow in shallow roots was compared to gwt fig 4b sap flow in the deepest root big root only started to approach zero around 4 m depth this is not probably due to increasing gravitational potential which has to be compensated by increasing sucking forces of drying superficial soil but because this root probably started to be disconnected from gwt 3 5 threshold diagram when the boundaries of hydrological conditions are combined with the dynamics of both hydrological variables the threshold diagram td for the specific oak tree growing at the lezirias site is represented in fig 5 in the tds constructed for the two years of observations 2007 2008 the three main climatic hydrological phases are presented summer drought rain break and winter recharge the tds show for example that there were no critical conditions for q suber in both years but in 2008 they were rather close to critical in both years although gwt was lower than 4 m this was not yet critical for trees because rain breaks were in time the circle in fig 5b indicates the period in 2008 when we stopped measuring sap flow after the small autumn rains swc increased for a while but after it decreased again there were 2 3 days in october which were close to critical but significant rains 58 mm occurred and a green safe area for the trees was reached again 3 6 threshold diagram for a critical scenario and preventive measures to avoid tree growth loss and mortality as seen before fig 5 tds for the observed years show that there were no critical conditions for tree growth during the study period in order to demonstrate td relevance for severe conditions endangering tree growth and mortality we modeled a hypothetical td where both water sources decreased drastically into the pink stress zone for that we used data of swc and gwt for the dry period of both years when reverse sap flow in shallow roots was recorded fig 6 a very strong correlation between both water sources was found which was used for construction of the hypothetical td fig 7 due to a delayed rain break trees would clearly be in the critical pink zone if nothing is done trend 1 in fig 7 with a decrease in growth and possible mortality the only way to overcome these limitations during this critical period would be through irrigation trying to keep trees in the safe green zone trend 2 in fig 7 4 discussion the present study was carried out in a 60 year old q suber tree under mediterranean climate conditions wet season in autumn winter and early spring and dry hot summer fig 1 under a deep haplic arenosol overlying a shallow water table in this type of climate trees are prone to suffer some degree of water stress or even mortality under severe conditions during the dry and hot season the studied tree was intensively equipped with hfd sensors to monitor sap flow in stem and roots due to the complexity and cost of the hfd method as well to the intensive experimental measuring design only one tree was monitored by this methodology however the representativeness of the water status and tree transpiration of the studied tree was checked against data measured in neighbouring ones a linear regression through the origin between predawn leaf water potential of the studied tree and the average of ten surrounding ones had a slope of 1 08 and an r2 of 0 94 21 months monthly measurements david et al 2013 a similar regression between transpiration of the sampled tree hfd method and the average of 4 surrounding ones td method
