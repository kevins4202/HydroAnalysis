1225,the main purpose of this work is to present a new analytical solution to study the transient matrix diffusion problem in fractured rocks the solution is based on a dual continuum model dcm and accounts for a zero order source term in the matrix the new solution can therefore be applied to describe transport of naturally occurring elements in rock minerals such as those generated by radioactive decay i e helium also presented in this paper is a conceptual model to estimate the dcm parameters from properties of an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm thus allowing to incorporate transport calculations within a secondary continuum i e matrix in ecpm models for practical applications the new analytical solution is implemented in a fortran module that can be readily coupled to a multi component transport solver i e darcytools this allows darcytools to apply the dcm as a subgrid model and thus carry out simultaneous matrix diffusion and transport calculations in a bedrock with or without including the source term since due to the apparent difference in transport time scales in fracture and matrix simulation results can be sensitive to the grid size and time step taken by the solver a comparison study is carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical results in a two dimensional fracture matrix system implementation of the dcm is also verified by comparing the darcytools predicted results with exact solutions for this purpose a new semi analytical solution is also derived in the laplace domain to calculate a solute breakthrough curve in the fracture excellent agreement in results is found for the two solutes considered namely a non reactive tracer and helium generated as alpha particles by radioactive decay in the matrix furthermore the dcm is incorporated in a large scale three dimensional transport model to describe concentration distribution of the given solutes in a fractured bedrock the results suggest that the dcm implementation can effectively capture the impact of mass exchange between fractures and rock matrix in the bedrock keywords dual continuum model matrix diffusion analytical solution darcytools helium transport simulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction given the growing interest for disposal of radioactive waste in underground repositories several transport models have been developed over the recent decades among them analytical models have gained much attention as they can provide insights into the governing physical processes and are computationally efficient over large time scales often required for performance assessments of such repositories in the literature a large number of analytical models have been developed for a simple case of a fracture surrounded by a porous rock matrix i e an idealization of the basic building blocks of fractured bedrocks sudicky and frind 1982 haggerty and gorelick 1995 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 liu et al 2017 these models that span a wide range in terms of complexity have been developed to improve our understanding of underlying processes that govern the solute exchange between flowing water in the fracture and rock matrix some of them although limited to a simplified geometry have also been implemented in large scale models based on the continuous porous medium cpm in darcytools svensson 2001 svensson et al 2010 the discrete fracture network dfn in connectflow amec 2013 and the channel network cn in chan3d gylling et al 1999 representation of the fractured bedrocks the knowledge gained from the previous transport modelling efforts can also be applied to model release and transport of dissolved gases in fractured granitic bedrock specially in case of helium this is of interest for safety assessment of radioactive waste repositories in granitic rock formations helium is continuously produced through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in granitic bedrocks ballentine and burnard 2002 kipfer et al 2002 helium can then diffuse into the flowing groundwater in fractures and since it does not react or sorb strongly it is carried freely throughout the fracture network additionally helium is a stable nuclide so it can travel long distances over long periods of time helium concentration data can therefore provide valuable information about groundwater travel times in the host bedrock bethke et al 1999 bethke and johnson 2008 trinchero et al 2019 furthermore transport simulations in safety assessment studies are performed on time scales often up to millions of years and span distances of many tens of kilometers skb 2011 these large time and spatial scales cannot be attained in laboratory scale experiments however helium groundwater data obtained from boreholes are deemed to carry information over much longer times and distances and therefore can be used to assess the performance of the employed simulation tools such borehole measurements are available for many sites all over the world including for the forsmark and laxemar sites in sweden hallbeck and pedersen 2008 hallbeck and pedersen 2008 and for the olkiluoto site in finland pitkänen and partamies 2007 to model helium transport in fractured rocks trinchero et al 2019 proposed an analytical solution to find helium transfer rate from a rock matrix block to a fracture at steady state condition the solution was thereafter used to estimate helium concentration and groundwater age in the given fracture media nevertheless the steady state approximation proposed by trinchero et al 2019 can accurately predict the transfer rate only if diffusion transport in the matrix is fast such that concentration profile in the matrix can adjust rapidly in response to changes in the fracture concentration however given that matrix diffusion is generally a slow process compared to advection in fractures the steady state assumption may therefore be inappropriate when the concentration field is evolving rapidly to address this problem the present work is set out to extend the model developed by trinchero et al 2019 to consider the transient release and transport of helium in fractured rocks although the transient model can be solved numerically an analytical solution is more desirable as it offers the highest accuracy and small computational efforts two decisive factors for suitability of an approach for application in large scale models with this goal in mind a new analytical solution is derived based on a dual continuum model dcm and a simplified representation of the fracture network the analytical formulation allows the solution to be be easily implemented in different programming languages and alternative numerical transport solvers in this study the solution is implemented in fortan and embedded as an external module in darcytools where it is applied as a subgrid model svensson et al 2010 this enables darcytools to also account for the helium generation term in the matrix furthermore a conceptual model is proposed to estimate the dcm parameters from properties of an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm the coupled transport equations in fracture and matrix can then be solved using a two step sequential approach in darcytools svensson et al 2010 to build confidence in this implementation the simulation results are validated against exact solutions in a two dimensional 2d model for two given solutes namely a non reactive tracer and helium that is generated as alpha particles by radioactive decay in the matrix additionally a new semi analytical solution is derived in the laplace domain to calculate the helium breakthrough curve in the fracture matrix system furthermore two illustrative simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation for large scale three dimensional 3d applications one contribution of this paper is therefore to present a new analytical solution for the matrix diffusion equation that accounts for a zero order source term in the rock matrix a new semi analytical solution is also proposed in the laplace domain to find helium breakthrough curve in the adjacent fracture the second contribution is to propose a formulation to estimate the dcm parameters from ecpm properties the third contribution of this paper is to develop an integrated module so that the dcm can be readily implemented in darcytools this is a new featurefor the code the fourth contribution is to demonstrate the applicability of the dcm and darcytools in describing the helium release and transport in fractured bedrocks the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the next section the proposed model is presented along with the mathematical formulation of the problem the derivation of the new solution is then detailed followed by the solution implementations in darcytools and a discussion on the dependency of the numerical solution on the computational time step and mesh size in section 3 two verification cases are studied to compare darcytools predicted results with analytical solutions in section 4 transports of a non reactive tracer and helium are simulated in a large scale three dimensional fractured bedrock using the new implementation the paper ends with concluding remarks in section 5 2 helium transport model 2 1 model formulation groundwater in fractured bedrocks mainly flows in conductive parts of fractures i e channels the channels may intersect and thus form a connected network of transport pathways throughout the bedrock as illustrated in fig 1 in contrast the rock matrix surrounding the fractures is typically much less permeable and transport is generally dominated by molecular diffusion for the purpose of this study this complex structure is simplified and modelled as a symmetric system of discrete parallel fractures where the fracture matrix system repeats itself fig 2 shows a conceptual picture of the dual continuum model dcm and fracture matrix system used in this study the groundwater flows through a fracture with the aperture of 2 δ f m the flow velocity v m y is considered to be uniform through the fracture and complete mixing is assumed across the aperture transport along the fracture is controlled by advection and longitudinal dispersion and solute can diffuse directly to from the flowing water from to the adjacent rock matrix a zero order source term f mol m w 3 y is also incorporated in the transport model to account for generation of the given solute in the matrix given the above considerations transport of a long lived nonsorbing nuclide can be described by eqs 1 and 2 the reader may note that due to the geometrical symmetry it is only needed to study one block of the fracture matrix system 1 c f t v c f x d l 2 c f x 2 ϕ d p δ f c m z z 0 0 x l 2 c m t d p 2 c m z 2 f 0 z the axes x and z denote the coordinates along the fracture and its adjacent rock matrix respectively in the above equations c mol m w 3 is the solution concentration ϕ is the rock matrix porosity and d p m2 y is the pore diffusion coefficient in the matrix the subscripts m f and w refer to the matrix fracture and water respectively in the above formulation hydrodynamic dispersion d l m2 y is defined as 3 d l α l v d w where α l m is the longitudinal dispersivity and d w m2 y is the diffusion coefficient in water initial conditions of the coupled equations eqs 1 and 2 are assumed to be 4a c f x 0 0 4b c m x z 0 c m 0 and the following concentration conditions are imposed at the system boundaries 5a c f 0 t 0 5b c m x 0 t c f x t 5c c m z x δ m t 0 where δ m m is the available matrix depth for diffusion which typically represents the average fracture half spacing in the bedrock the term on the right hand side of eq 1 describes the diffusive flux at the fracture matrix interface because complete mixing is assumed across the fracture aperture solute transport in the fracture and matrix is coupled through eq 5b which describes the continuity of the concentration at the interface eq 5c shows a no flux boundary condition at z δ m in the matrix the no flux condition is motivated assuming a symmetric concentration profile in the neighboring matrix block in which transport occurs simultaneously it should be noted that in this study we primarily aim to find the transient solution to the transport equation in the matrix eq 2 this allows one to calculate the solute exchange rate between the matrix secondary continuum and fracture primary continuum the transport equation in the fracture eq 1 can then be solved by applying proper boundary conditions in a numerical solver i e darcytools svensson et al 2010 given the above initial and boundary conditions and provided that c f can be assumed constant during a time step taken by the solver dt t t 0 eq 2 can be solved by the method of separation of variables to give 6 c m x z t p x z n 0 β n sin nz exp n 2 d p t t 0 where p x z denotes the steady state solution defined as 7 p x z c f x fz 2 d p 2 δ m z β is the fourier sine coefficient 8 β n x t 2 δ m 0 δ m c m 0 p x z sin nz dz n is the summation index and n is defined as 9 n 2 n 1 π 2 δ m hence the mass flux rate at the fracture matrix interface can be calculated as 10 ϕ d p c m z z 0 t ϕ d p f δ m d p n 0 β n t n exp n 2 d p t t 0 for practical applications the above formulation is implemented as an embedded module in darcytools this implementation allows one to apply the dcm as a subgrid model and run it together with the darcytools numerical solver migal svensson et al 2010 this is further discussed in the following section the reader may note that the transfer rate gradually increases with time but the growth eventually slows down as the steady state is reached the steady state flux eq 11 was used in a previous study trinchero et al 2019 to solve the transient helium transport equation in the fracture this was done by employing an iterative solver implemented in pflotran lichtner et al 2015 11 ϕ d p c m z z 0 ϕ f δ m the advantage of this steady state approximation is that it decouples the transport equations in the fracture and matrix and thus speed up the numerical calculation however even though the steady state formulation can be used in a numerical scheme to find the steady state solution of eq 1 it is not well suited to predict the transient behaviour of the concentration profile in the matrix in fact eq 11 often overestimates the mass flux at the fracture matrix interface this can also be inferred by comparing the slopes of the steady state solution solid line and the transient solutions dashed lines in fig 3 2 2 implementation in darcytools darcytools property of skb the swedish nuclear fuel and waste management company is a computer code for simulation of flow and transport in fractured and porous media it has been widely used in projects dealing with different aspects of performances assessment of radioactive waste repositories in sweden vidstrand et al 2014 darcytools solver relies on a finite volume method that allows for a flexible discretization of the computational domain svensson et al 2010 a fractured bedrock in this domain can be represented by a pre defined discrete fracture network dfn whose properties are then mapped onto the control volumes i e cells this results in an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm with upscaled properties that are homogeneous within each cell svensson 2001 svensson 2001 in this upscaling process isolated fractures that are not in contact with any other fracture can be discarded since they do not contribute to flow transport or dispersion svensson et al 2010 intersecting fractures however depending on their conductivities and geometrical distributions can form cells with high permeability mobile cells and cells with poor permeability immobile cells ferry 2020b the immobile cells have a low permeability and are not expected to provide advective flow paths for solutes fws 0 therefore their contribution to the mass exchange between flowing water and rock matrix is deemed to be negligible and so it is not considered in this modelling study i e immobile cells are removed within a mobile cell however flowing water can come into contact with the gouge material and stagnant water zones and thus exchanges mass more importantly species can enter into diffuse out of the pores of the adjacent rock matrix by molecular diffusion and be withdrawn from discharged into the flowing water the extent of the mass transfer is largely influenced by the contact surface between the flowing water and matrix i e the flow wetted surface fws to describe the diffusive mass exchange in mobile cells the dcm developed in this study is intended to be implemented as a subgrid model thus the rock matrix diffusion would be treated as subgrid process while mobile cells are represented as grid properties for this purpose the following key assumption should be made each mobile cell in the computational domain can be described by an equivalent system of parallel fractures similar to what is shown in fig 2 with equal specific flow wetted surface vfws and kinematic porosity f to those in the given mobile cell given the conceptual model and its parameters shown in fig 2 the above assumption translates to 12 f δ f δ f δ m 13 vfws fws c v c 1 δ m where fws c and v c are the flow wetted surface and bulk volume of the cell respectively the vfws and f are calculated in darcytools for each grid cell hence the model parameters in each grid cell can be estimated as 14 δ f δ m 1 f 1 f δ m 15 δ m 1 vfws the above formulation is applied in the dcm module to estimate the model parameters from the properties of a mobile cell in darcytools it may be noted that if the grid cell properties rely on an underlying stochastic dfn model as in this study then the resulting upscaled properties are also stochastic it is also worth noting that in an immobile cell where vfws 0 eqs 14 and 15 reduce to 16 lim vfws 0 δ m and 17 lim vfws 0 f 0 eq 17 suggests that immobile cells are not expected to contain pores to allow water to flow or form stagnant water zones furthermore since fws c is very small in an immobile cell as indicated in eq 16 immobile cells are not expected to exchange solute with the flowing water these issues make immobile cells irrelevant for this study therefore they are not considered in the implementation of dcm in darcytools i e they are removed from the computational domain the reader may note that a built in subgrid model called frame is also available in darcytools to describe solute transport between mobile and immobile zones ferry 2020a svensson et al 2010 the frame model uses the multi rate diffusion model haggerty and gorelick 1995 and fractal scaling laws to formulate a subgrid model however despite its effective formulation the model does not account for any generation term in the immobile zones this naturally limits the frame application to cases where rock matrix only acts as a storage volume for the solute i e sink term furthermore the model does not provide any information on the distribution of solute concentration within the matrix contrary to frame the dcm developed in this study accounts for a zero order source term in the matrix the model can thus be used in both scenarios where matrix acts as a source or storage volume furthermore the model can provide additional information on the spatial distribution of concentration within the matrix this will facilitate future implementation of chemical reaction calculations in the matrix zone 2 3 solution dependency on the time step and mesh size in darcytools implementation of matrix diffusion calculation follows a two step sequential approach in which for each mobile cells advection dispersion equation in the primary continuum fracture and diffusion equations in the secondary continuum matrix are solved separately and sequentially at any given time increment as shown in fig 4 calculation process in darcytools is initiated by loading the grid cell properties from which the model parameters are estimated thereafter the dcm module and darcytools solver are called sequentially at each time step t k to calculate the mass flux rate between fracture and matrix given by eq 18 18 q t k ϕ d p c m z z 0 t k ϕ d p f δ m d p n 0 β n t k n exp n 2 d p t k t k 1 the integral equation for β n t k eq 8 can also be solved and reformulated in a recursive form to give 19 β n t k β n t k 1 exp n 2 d p t k 1 t k 2 if k 1 2 f δ m d p n 3 if k 1 thanks to the analytical formulation cost of the diffusion calculation in the matrix by dcm module is negligible compared to the cost of solving the transport equations in the fracture by the darcytools solver nevertheless it should be emphasized that eqs 18 and 19 are obtained under the assumption that solute concentration in the fracture c f x remains constant during the numerical time step taken by the solver dt k t k t k 1 i e quasi steady state assumption however c f x will varry due to advection and mass transfer to dissipation and from generation the matrix therefore to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results the time step and grid size employed by the darcytools solver should be set appropriately so that the computational time step dt k would be smaller than the characteristic times of advection τ a and generation dissipation τ r in each mobile cell to exemplify this issue helium transport simulation results are studied in the fracture matrix system shown in fig 2 the mobile cells are explicitly modelled by discretizing the fracture into a uniform grid of size dl 1 10 3 m whereas the effect of matrix diffusion is included as subgrid effects this is illustrated in fig 5 where matrix blocks are attached to the mobile cells to form the secondary continuum the damköhler number eq 20 can be used to identify the fastest mechanism in this system 20 da τ a τ r nevertheless in order to find the damköhler number in the mobile cells it is necessary to have information on the solute concentration along the fracture c f x for helium this information is provided in trinchero et al 2019 and is expressed as 21 c f x τ a x l δ f δ m f ϕ x l exp pe exp x l 1 pe pe hence the damköhler number in a mobile cell with size dl can be obtained as a function of the peclet number pe in the fracture to give 22 da c x τ a x dl τ r x τ a x dl δ f δ m f ϕ c f x dl l x l exp pe exp x l 1 pe pe using the transport properties listed in table 1 the damköhler number is calculated as a function of fracture length and for a range of peclet numbers 0 1 pe 100 and is plotted in fig 6 it can be seen that except for very small peclet numbers the damköhler number in a mobile cell with size dl 1 10 3 m remains below unity indicating that helium concentration build up in a mobile cell is generally a slower process compared to advection it can therefore be assumed that in the system studied above with pe 2 5 the helium concentration in each mobile cell is constant during the time step given dt k τ a in fact the error can be quite large if a wrong choice is made for the darcytools solver time step dt k to demonstrate this the above model is solved in darcytools by increasing the solver time stepping size table 2 shows the relative error in estimating the diffusive mass flux from the rock matrix to a mobile cell and how it grows by increasing the time step the fluxes are calculated at year 100 and the error is calculated with respect to a reference flux that is estimated with the smallest time step considered in this example i e 2 0 10 3 s note that the characteristic time of advection τ a for a mobile cell in this example is 1 0 10 5 s the results suggest that the estimated error can be up to 42 when the time step is 50 times larger than τ a 3 solution verification in this section two small scale cases are studied to evaluate implementation of the dcm module by comparing darcytools predicted results with exact analytical solutions the first case is a transport problem in the fracture matrix system shown in fig 2 the water velocity in the fracture is assumed constant and hydrodynamic dispersion is ignored the fracture is embedded in an infinite δ m and homogeneous porous rock where no generation occurs f 0 a tracer is continuously injected at the inlet to the fracture where it will be advected tracer particles can also diffuse into the rock matrix and move away from the flowing water in the absence of hydrodynamic dispersion and generation terms the coupled mass balance equations given in eqs 1 and 2 can be solved analytically to give the tracer concentration at the fracture outlet i e the tracer breakthrough curve btc in terms of water residence time t w flow wetted surface fws and flow rate q the solution by moreno et al 1997 reads 23 e 0 if t t w erfc fws 2 q d e ϕ t t w 0 5 if t t w for comparison the above system is also simulated in darcytools using the new dcm module parameters and properties used in this test case are listed in table 1 fig 7 shows the tracer btc for an instantaneous step change at the fracture inlet the crosses indicate the darcytools predicted results the full line indicates the exact analytical solution and the dashed line indicates the tracer concentration when matrix diffusion is ignored a slight numerical dispersion can be observed at the rising limb of the btcs nevertheless the results indicate that darcytools can well predict the tracer concentration both at the rising limb and the tailed part of the curves the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse in this case is calculated to be 0 985 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the reader may note that the observed tailing in the absence of other dispersive mechanisms is a likely consequence of matrix diffusion that slows down the tracer particles transport at different levels and thus gives rise to the spread in their travel times grisak and pickens 1980 tsang 1995 therefore having observed a good agreement at the tail the results suggest a successful implementation of the matrix diffusion via the dcm module in the second case transport and generation of helium is simulated in the fracture matrix system described above a similar darcytools model is used nevertheless the latter case differs from the tracer model in that a helium is constantly generated in the rock matrix and b a zero concentration boundary condition is imposed at the fracture inlet fresh water therefore enters the fracture from the inlet boundary and helium diffuses into the water flowing in the fracture considering the initial and boundary conditions given in eqs 4 and 5 a new analytical solution to this problem is derived in the laplace domain the solution in its general formulation includes the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion and reads see appendix a for a complete list of parameters 24 c f s α 1 exp κ t α 2 exp κ t ω f where c f s is the laplace transformed concentration in the fracture the de hoog algorithm is then used to numerically invert eq 24 back to the time domain and find the helium breakthrough curve the algorithm is well described in de hoog et al 1982 and briefly reviewed by boupha et al 2004 fig 8 shows the darcytools predicted result and the analytical solution eq 24 in the time domain it can be seen that prediction of darcytools model agrees well with the analytically calculated btc at all the modelled instants nse 0 99 furthermore to evaluate the relative accuracy of the quasi steady state approximation eq 11 the darcytools predicted result based on this approximation is also plotted in fig 8 the results indicate that the quasi steady state approximation overestimates the helium concentration in the fracture during the transient phase yet the two results coincide at steady state it should also be noted that in the model studied above δ f and δ m are assumed to be constant however in large scale models heterogeneity in the cell properties arises due to the stochastic nature of the underlying dfn therefore further effort as discussed earlier in section 2 2 is needed to estimate the average matrix block size and fracture aperture from the ecpm properties this process is demonstrated in the following section by simulating helium transport in a large scale three dimensional domain 4 transport in a large scale model in this section the dcm module and darcytools are used to simulate solute transport in a large scale fractured bedrock where all simulations are performed on a desktop computer the hydraulic properties of the domain is based on a model for the shallow part of the hydraulic rock domain at the laxemar site in sweden vidstrand et al 2010 four predefined fracture sets are combined to form the complete fracture network in the bedrock the fracture sets are generated in darcytools svensson and follin 2010 following the same fracture specifications used by trinchero et al 2019 the modelled domain volume is 1024 1024 128 m3 which is discretised into a uniform grid with cell sizes δ x δ y 4 m and δ z 2 m the fracture network properties are then geometrically upscaled on the grid to create a porous medium with equivalent properties hence the dcm parameters are estimated following the formulations presented in section 2 2 the upscaling method in darcytools is documented in ferry 2020b to mimic the underground water flow field near the surface fixed pressure boundary conditions are applied to two narrow regions on the bedrock surface the boundary regions extend 10 m and 1024 m in the x and y directions respectively and induce a pressure difference of δ p 1 10 3 pa between the inlet x 0 and outlet x 1024 boundaries the remaining boundaries of the domain are subject to a no flux boundary condition the transport model is set up to include two solutes namely a non reactive tracer and helium the conservative tracer is constantly injected at the inlet boundary region with a unity concentration see fig 9 two scenarios are considered to study the retarding effect of matrix diffusion on the tracer transport in the first scenario the effect of matrix diffusion is ignored in other words it is assumed that the tracer does not interact with the surrounding rock matrix and is transported solely by the flowing water in the second scenario however the dcm module is activated this allows the tracer to penetrate into the pores of the secondary continuum matrix by diffusive transport and be withdrawn from the water that carries it in primary continua fractures in the mobile cells it should be emphasized that each mobile cell has different properties this results in variable diffusion mass flux rates between the flowing water and different matrix blocks the results corresponding to the two transport scenarios are shown in fig 9 it should be emphasized that since immobile cells are much less permeable and therefore are expected to have negligible impact on concentration profile in the domain they have been removed from the figure and only mobile cells are shown for comparison purposes snapshots of the tracer concentration are shown at three simulation times namely 5 50 and 10 000 years it can be seen that when matrix diffusion is ignored tracer infiltrates through the conductive elements in the domain i e fractures in mobile cells and it is carried away by flowing water toward the outlet boundary in the second scenario however tracer transport along the the fractures is largely retarded by matrix diffusion and tracer plume does not extend very far from the inlet boundary after 50 years in fact due to the large dispersion it takes nearly 10 000 years before the plum reaches the outlet boundary transport of helium is also modeled in the same fractured bedrock domain described above the model accounts for flow of water in fractures in the mobile cells as well as continuous generation of helium in the adjacent matrix blocks the bulk generation rate of he in the matrix g r f ϕ is assumed to be g r 1 24 10 10 mol m rock 3 year neretnieks 2013 in this model fresh water infiltrates through the inlet boundary and thus carries the discharged helium from the matrix toward the outlet boundary therefore it is expected that helium concentration builds up downstream along the flow direction this is illustrated in fig 10 where calculated helium concentration field after 10 000 years is shown for comparison helium concentration data at four observation points are sampled over time the points are defined with the coordinates given in table 3 and are labelled as upstream south us upstream north un downstream south ds and downstream north dn the resulted breakthrough curves after 10 000 years are shown in fig 11 furthermore the above simulation is repeated but now assuming that the quasi steady state approximation holds in other words it is assumed that helium mass flux rate is fixed and equal to the value obtained from eq 11 the 2d model results fig 8 suggest that helium concentrations should gradually increase until they reach steady state values nevertheless the time needed to reach steady state is different at different observation points due to their varying distances from the inlet boundary and their transport properties in fact the steady state value is directly proportional to groundwater travel time from the inlet boundary and is inversely proportional to flow porosity at a observation point trinchero et al 2019 after 10 000 years only the upstream north un point seems to reach the steady state condition this can be understood by comparing the two breakthrough curves at this point it can also be seen that the steady state approximation results in a higher mass flux between the conductive fractures and matrix blocks which is reflected by larger concentrations of helium in the flowing groundwater this is a clear indication that the quasi steady state approximation cannot accurately describe the transport of he during the transient phase alternatively the dcm model proposed in this paper can be used to predict the he concentration during the transport time the reader may note that ideally site specific helium data are required to ensure correct implementation of the dcm module in a large scale fractured bedrock yet that information is unfortunately not reported for the shallow part of the laxemar site nevertheless the numerical analyses and test results presented in sections 2 3 and 3 indicates that the dcm model is implemented correctly and is applicable to both large and small scale problems furthermore a similar large scale system has been solved independently in a recent paper by trinchero et al 2022 their model relies on a dual continuum disconnected matrix model lichtner 2000 that is implemented in pflotran and is solved using a supercomputer their reported results for helium concentration at the given observation points are in very close agreement with our simulation results this is another indication that the dcm model is implemented correctly in darcytools 5 conclusion in this contribution a new analytical solution is presented for the matrix diffusion problem based on the dual continuum model dcm the solution is derived at the scale of a single fracture rock matrix system and can be used to study the transient behaviour of naturally occurring elements i e helium in fractured bedrocks the proposed solution is then implemented as an embedded module in darcytools this enables the code to carry out matrix diffusion calculation together with the multi component transport calculations in fractures in the mobile cells since darcytools relies on a continuous porous medium model a conceptual model is also presented to obtain the dcm parameters from properties of the ecpm the key underlying assumption is that each mobile cell in the domain can be represented by a system of parallel fractures with equivalent specific flow wetted surface and kinematic porosity the new implementation is verified by comparing darcytools simulation results with analytical solutions available for the 2d fracture matrix system excellent agreement in results is found for the two cases considered additionally the dcm module is applied in a 3d model to simulate transport of naturally occurring helium and a non reactive tracer in a large scale fractured bedrock the results indicate that the new dcm can effectively describe the solute exchange between the rock matrix and the flowing water whether the matrix act as a source or sink in terms of computational efficiency the cost of the diffusion calculation is negligible compared to the cost of transport calculation in a fracture in a mobile cell nevertheless to ensure high accuracy in the numerical results sufficiently small time step should be taken by the darcytools solver so that the quasi steady state assumption holds under the time step this issue is not unique to our approach and appears due to the different transport time scales in the fracture advection and dispersion and rock matrix molecular diffusion which makes the numerical solution sensitive to the step size fortunately to overcome this obstacle darcytools and the adopted two step method allow for an effective parallelisation that can significantly decrease the computation time it is also worth noting that the proposed model is relatively simple and only accounts for a zero order reaction yet it suffices for simulation of naturally occurring tracers and should be considered as the starting point for the development of more complex models with e g chemical reactions sorption decay chains and several

1225,the main purpose of this work is to present a new analytical solution to study the transient matrix diffusion problem in fractured rocks the solution is based on a dual continuum model dcm and accounts for a zero order source term in the matrix the new solution can therefore be applied to describe transport of naturally occurring elements in rock minerals such as those generated by radioactive decay i e helium also presented in this paper is a conceptual model to estimate the dcm parameters from properties of an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm thus allowing to incorporate transport calculations within a secondary continuum i e matrix in ecpm models for practical applications the new analytical solution is implemented in a fortran module that can be readily coupled to a multi component transport solver i e darcytools this allows darcytools to apply the dcm as a subgrid model and thus carry out simultaneous matrix diffusion and transport calculations in a bedrock with or without including the source term since due to the apparent difference in transport time scales in fracture and matrix simulation results can be sensitive to the grid size and time step taken by the solver a comparison study is carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical results in a two dimensional fracture matrix system implementation of the dcm is also verified by comparing the darcytools predicted results with exact solutions for this purpose a new semi analytical solution is also derived in the laplace domain to calculate a solute breakthrough curve in the fracture excellent agreement in results is found for the two solutes considered namely a non reactive tracer and helium generated as alpha particles by radioactive decay in the matrix furthermore the dcm is incorporated in a large scale three dimensional transport model to describe concentration distribution of the given solutes in a fractured bedrock the results suggest that the dcm implementation can effectively capture the impact of mass exchange between fractures and rock matrix in the bedrock keywords dual continuum model matrix diffusion analytical solution darcytools helium transport simulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction given the growing interest for disposal of radioactive waste in underground repositories several transport models have been developed over the recent decades among them analytical models have gained much attention as they can provide insights into the governing physical processes and are computationally efficient over large time scales often required for performance assessments of such repositories in the literature a large number of analytical models have been developed for a simple case of a fracture surrounded by a porous rock matrix i e an idealization of the basic building blocks of fractured bedrocks sudicky and frind 1982 haggerty and gorelick 1995 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 liu et al 2017 these models that span a wide range in terms of complexity have been developed to improve our understanding of underlying processes that govern the solute exchange between flowing water in the fracture and rock matrix some of them although limited to a simplified geometry have also been implemented in large scale models based on the continuous porous medium cpm in darcytools svensson 2001 svensson et al 2010 the discrete fracture network dfn in connectflow amec 2013 and the channel network cn in chan3d gylling et al 1999 representation of the fractured bedrocks the knowledge gained from the previous transport modelling efforts can also be applied to model release and transport of dissolved gases in fractured granitic bedrock specially in case of helium this is of interest for safety assessment of radioactive waste repositories in granitic rock formations helium is continuously produced through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in granitic bedrocks ballentine and burnard 2002 kipfer et al 2002 helium can then diffuse into the flowing groundwater in fractures and since it does not react or sorb strongly it is carried freely throughout the fracture network additionally helium is a stable nuclide so it can travel long distances over long periods of time helium concentration data can therefore provide valuable information about groundwater travel times in the host bedrock bethke et al 1999 bethke and johnson 2008 trinchero et al 2019 furthermore transport simulations in safety assessment studies are performed on time scales often up to millions of years and span distances of many tens of kilometers skb 2011 these large time and spatial scales cannot be attained in laboratory scale experiments however helium groundwater data obtained from boreholes are deemed to carry information over much longer times and distances and therefore can be used to assess the performance of the employed simulation tools such borehole measurements are available for many sites all over the world including for the forsmark and laxemar sites in sweden hallbeck and pedersen 2008 hallbeck and pedersen 2008 and for the olkiluoto site in finland pitkänen and partamies 2007 to model helium transport in fractured rocks trinchero et al 2019 proposed an analytical solution to find helium transfer rate from a rock matrix block to a fracture at steady state condition the solution was thereafter used to estimate helium concentration and groundwater age in the given fracture media nevertheless the steady state approximation proposed by trinchero et al 2019 can accurately predict the transfer rate only if diffusion transport in the matrix is fast such that concentration profile in the matrix can adjust rapidly in response to changes in the fracture concentration however given that matrix diffusion is generally a slow process compared to advection in fractures the steady state assumption may therefore be inappropriate when the concentration field is evolving rapidly to address this problem the present work is set out to extend the model developed by trinchero et al 2019 to consider the transient release and transport of helium in fractured rocks although the transient model can be solved numerically an analytical solution is more desirable as it offers the highest accuracy and small computational efforts two decisive factors for suitability of an approach for application in large scale models with this goal in mind a new analytical solution is derived based on a dual continuum model dcm and a simplified representation of the fracture network the analytical formulation allows the solution to be be easily implemented in different programming languages and alternative numerical transport solvers in this study the solution is implemented in fortan and embedded as an external module in darcytools where it is applied as a subgrid model svensson et al 2010 this enables darcytools to also account for the helium generation term in the matrix furthermore a conceptual model is proposed to estimate the dcm parameters from properties of an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm the coupled transport equations in fracture and matrix can then be solved using a two step sequential approach in darcytools svensson et al 2010 to build confidence in this implementation the simulation results are validated against exact solutions in a two dimensional 2d model for two given solutes namely a non reactive tracer and helium that is generated as alpha particles by radioactive decay in the matrix additionally a new semi analytical solution is derived in the laplace domain to calculate the helium breakthrough curve in the fracture matrix system furthermore two illustrative simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation for large scale three dimensional 3d applications one contribution of this paper is therefore to present a new analytical solution for the matrix diffusion equation that accounts for a zero order source term in the rock matrix a new semi analytical solution is also proposed in the laplace domain to find helium breakthrough curve in the adjacent fracture the second contribution is to propose a formulation to estimate the dcm parameters from ecpm properties the third contribution of this paper is to develop an integrated module so that the dcm can be readily implemented in darcytools this is a new featurefor the code the fourth contribution is to demonstrate the applicability of the dcm and darcytools in describing the helium release and transport in fractured bedrocks the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the next section the proposed model is presented along with the mathematical formulation of the problem the derivation of the new solution is then detailed followed by the solution implementations in darcytools and a discussion on the dependency of the numerical solution on the computational time step and mesh size in section 3 two verification cases are studied to compare darcytools predicted results with analytical solutions in section 4 transports of a non reactive tracer and helium are simulated in a large scale three dimensional fractured bedrock using the new implementation the paper ends with concluding remarks in section 5 2 helium transport model 2 1 model formulation groundwater in fractured bedrocks mainly flows in conductive parts of fractures i e channels the channels may intersect and thus form a connected network of transport pathways throughout the bedrock as illustrated in fig 1 in contrast the rock matrix surrounding the fractures is typically much less permeable and transport is generally dominated by molecular diffusion for the purpose of this study this complex structure is simplified and modelled as a symmetric system of discrete parallel fractures where the fracture matrix system repeats itself fig 2 shows a conceptual picture of the dual continuum model dcm and fracture matrix system used in this study the groundwater flows through a fracture with the aperture of 2 δ f m the flow velocity v m y is considered to be uniform through the fracture and complete mixing is assumed across the aperture transport along the fracture is controlled by advection and longitudinal dispersion and solute can diffuse directly to from the flowing water from to the adjacent rock matrix a zero order source term f mol m w 3 y is also incorporated in the transport model to account for generation of the given solute in the matrix given the above considerations transport of a long lived nonsorbing nuclide can be described by eqs 1 and 2 the reader may note that due to the geometrical symmetry it is only needed to study one block of the fracture matrix system 1 c f t v c f x d l 2 c f x 2 ϕ d p δ f c m z z 0 0 x l 2 c m t d p 2 c m z 2 f 0 z the axes x and z denote the coordinates along the fracture and its adjacent rock matrix respectively in the above equations c mol m w 3 is the solution concentration ϕ is the rock matrix porosity and d p m2 y is the pore diffusion coefficient in the matrix the subscripts m f and w refer to the matrix fracture and water respectively in the above formulation hydrodynamic dispersion d l m2 y is defined as 3 d l α l v d w where α l m is the longitudinal dispersivity and d w m2 y is the diffusion coefficient in water initial conditions of the coupled equations eqs 1 and 2 are assumed to be 4a c f x 0 0 4b c m x z 0 c m 0 and the following concentration conditions are imposed at the system boundaries 5a c f 0 t 0 5b c m x 0 t c f x t 5c c m z x δ m t 0 where δ m m is the available matrix depth for diffusion which typically represents the average fracture half spacing in the bedrock the term on the right hand side of eq 1 describes the diffusive flux at the fracture matrix interface because complete mixing is assumed across the fracture aperture solute transport in the fracture and matrix is coupled through eq 5b which describes the continuity of the concentration at the interface eq 5c shows a no flux boundary condition at z δ m in the matrix the no flux condition is motivated assuming a symmetric concentration profile in the neighboring matrix block in which transport occurs simultaneously it should be noted that in this study we primarily aim to find the transient solution to the transport equation in the matrix eq 2 this allows one to calculate the solute exchange rate between the matrix secondary continuum and fracture primary continuum the transport equation in the fracture eq 1 can then be solved by applying proper boundary conditions in a numerical solver i e darcytools svensson et al 2010 given the above initial and boundary conditions and provided that c f can be assumed constant during a time step taken by the solver dt t t 0 eq 2 can be solved by the method of separation of variables to give 6 c m x z t p x z n 0 β n sin nz exp n 2 d p t t 0 where p x z denotes the steady state solution defined as 7 p x z c f x fz 2 d p 2 δ m z β is the fourier sine coefficient 8 β n x t 2 δ m 0 δ m c m 0 p x z sin nz dz n is the summation index and n is defined as 9 n 2 n 1 π 2 δ m hence the mass flux rate at the fracture matrix interface can be calculated as 10 ϕ d p c m z z 0 t ϕ d p f δ m d p n 0 β n t n exp n 2 d p t t 0 for practical applications the above formulation is implemented as an embedded module in darcytools this implementation allows one to apply the dcm as a subgrid model and run it together with the darcytools numerical solver migal svensson et al 2010 this is further discussed in the following section the reader may note that the transfer rate gradually increases with time but the growth eventually slows down as the steady state is reached the steady state flux eq 11 was used in a previous study trinchero et al 2019 to solve the transient helium transport equation in the fracture this was done by employing an iterative solver implemented in pflotran lichtner et al 2015 11 ϕ d p c m z z 0 ϕ f δ m the advantage of this steady state approximation is that it decouples the transport equations in the fracture and matrix and thus speed up the numerical calculation however even though the steady state formulation can be used in a numerical scheme to find the steady state solution of eq 1 it is not well suited to predict the transient behaviour of the concentration profile in the matrix in fact eq 11 often overestimates the mass flux at the fracture matrix interface this can also be inferred by comparing the slopes of the steady state solution solid line and the transient solutions dashed lines in fig 3 2 2 implementation in darcytools darcytools property of skb the swedish nuclear fuel and waste management company is a computer code for simulation of flow and transport in fractured and porous media it has been widely used in projects dealing with different aspects of performances assessment of radioactive waste repositories in sweden vidstrand et al 2014 darcytools solver relies on a finite volume method that allows for a flexible discretization of the computational domain svensson et al 2010 a fractured bedrock in this domain can be represented by a pre defined discrete fracture network dfn whose properties are then mapped onto the control volumes i e cells this results in an equivalent continuous porous medium ecpm with upscaled properties that are homogeneous within each cell svensson 2001 svensson 2001 in this upscaling process isolated fractures that are not in contact with any other fracture can be discarded since they do not contribute to flow transport or dispersion svensson et al 2010 intersecting fractures however depending on their conductivities and geometrical distributions can form cells with high permeability mobile cells and cells with poor permeability immobile cells ferry 2020b the immobile cells have a low permeability and are not expected to provide advective flow paths for solutes fws 0 therefore their contribution to the mass exchange between flowing water and rock matrix is deemed to be negligible and so it is not considered in this modelling study i e immobile cells are removed within a mobile cell however flowing water can come into contact with the gouge material and stagnant water zones and thus exchanges mass more importantly species can enter into diffuse out of the pores of the adjacent rock matrix by molecular diffusion and be withdrawn from discharged into the flowing water the extent of the mass transfer is largely influenced by the contact surface between the flowing water and matrix i e the flow wetted surface fws to describe the diffusive mass exchange in mobile cells the dcm developed in this study is intended to be implemented as a subgrid model thus the rock matrix diffusion would be treated as subgrid process while mobile cells are represented as grid properties for this purpose the following key assumption should be made each mobile cell in the computational domain can be described by an equivalent system of parallel fractures similar to what is shown in fig 2 with equal specific flow wetted surface vfws and kinematic porosity f to those in the given mobile cell given the conceptual model and its parameters shown in fig 2 the above assumption translates to 12 f δ f δ f δ m 13 vfws fws c v c 1 δ m where fws c and v c are the flow wetted surface and bulk volume of the cell respectively the vfws and f are calculated in darcytools for each grid cell hence the model parameters in each grid cell can be estimated as 14 δ f δ m 1 f 1 f δ m 15 δ m 1 vfws the above formulation is applied in the dcm module to estimate the model parameters from the properties of a mobile cell in darcytools it may be noted that if the grid cell properties rely on an underlying stochastic dfn model as in this study then the resulting upscaled properties are also stochastic it is also worth noting that in an immobile cell where vfws 0 eqs 14 and 15 reduce to 16 lim vfws 0 δ m and 17 lim vfws 0 f 0 eq 17 suggests that immobile cells are not expected to contain pores to allow water to flow or form stagnant water zones furthermore since fws c is very small in an immobile cell as indicated in eq 16 immobile cells are not expected to exchange solute with the flowing water these issues make immobile cells irrelevant for this study therefore they are not considered in the implementation of dcm in darcytools i e they are removed from the computational domain the reader may note that a built in subgrid model called frame is also available in darcytools to describe solute transport between mobile and immobile zones ferry 2020a svensson et al 2010 the frame model uses the multi rate diffusion model haggerty and gorelick 1995 and fractal scaling laws to formulate a subgrid model however despite its effective formulation the model does not account for any generation term in the immobile zones this naturally limits the frame application to cases where rock matrix only acts as a storage volume for the solute i e sink term furthermore the model does not provide any information on the distribution of solute concentration within the matrix contrary to frame the dcm developed in this study accounts for a zero order source term in the matrix the model can thus be used in both scenarios where matrix acts as a source or storage volume furthermore the model can provide additional information on the spatial distribution of concentration within the matrix this will facilitate future implementation of chemical reaction calculations in the matrix zone 2 3 solution dependency on the time step and mesh size in darcytools implementation of matrix diffusion calculation follows a two step sequential approach in which for each mobile cells advection dispersion equation in the primary continuum fracture and diffusion equations in the secondary continuum matrix are solved separately and sequentially at any given time increment as shown in fig 4 calculation process in darcytools is initiated by loading the grid cell properties from which the model parameters are estimated thereafter the dcm module and darcytools solver are called sequentially at each time step t k to calculate the mass flux rate between fracture and matrix given by eq 18 18 q t k ϕ d p c m z z 0 t k ϕ d p f δ m d p n 0 β n t k n exp n 2 d p t k t k 1 the integral equation for β n t k eq 8 can also be solved and reformulated in a recursive form to give 19 β n t k β n t k 1 exp n 2 d p t k 1 t k 2 if k 1 2 f δ m d p n 3 if k 1 thanks to the analytical formulation cost of the diffusion calculation in the matrix by dcm module is negligible compared to the cost of solving the transport equations in the fracture by the darcytools solver nevertheless it should be emphasized that eqs 18 and 19 are obtained under the assumption that solute concentration in the fracture c f x remains constant during the numerical time step taken by the solver dt k t k t k 1 i e quasi steady state assumption however c f x will varry due to advection and mass transfer to dissipation and from generation the matrix therefore to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results the time step and grid size employed by the darcytools solver should be set appropriately so that the computational time step dt k would be smaller than the characteristic times of advection τ a and generation dissipation τ r in each mobile cell to exemplify this issue helium transport simulation results are studied in the fracture matrix system shown in fig 2 the mobile cells are explicitly modelled by discretizing the fracture into a uniform grid of size dl 1 10 3 m whereas the effect of matrix diffusion is included as subgrid effects this is illustrated in fig 5 where matrix blocks are attached to the mobile cells to form the secondary continuum the damköhler number eq 20 can be used to identify the fastest mechanism in this system 20 da τ a τ r nevertheless in order to find the damköhler number in the mobile cells it is necessary to have information on the solute concentration along the fracture c f x for helium this information is provided in trinchero et al 2019 and is expressed as 21 c f x τ a x l δ f δ m f ϕ x l exp pe exp x l 1 pe pe hence the damköhler number in a mobile cell with size dl can be obtained as a function of the peclet number pe in the fracture to give 22 da c x τ a x dl τ r x τ a x dl δ f δ m f ϕ c f x dl l x l exp pe exp x l 1 pe pe using the transport properties listed in table 1 the damköhler number is calculated as a function of fracture length and for a range of peclet numbers 0 1 pe 100 and is plotted in fig 6 it can be seen that except for very small peclet numbers the damköhler number in a mobile cell with size dl 1 10 3 m remains below unity indicating that helium concentration build up in a mobile cell is generally a slower process compared to advection it can therefore be assumed that in the system studied above with pe 2 5 the helium concentration in each mobile cell is constant during the time step given dt k τ a in fact the error can be quite large if a wrong choice is made for the darcytools solver time step dt k to demonstrate this the above model is solved in darcytools by increasing the solver time stepping size table 2 shows the relative error in estimating the diffusive mass flux from the rock matrix to a mobile cell and how it grows by increasing the time step the fluxes are calculated at year 100 and the error is calculated with respect to a reference flux that is estimated with the smallest time step considered in this example i e 2 0 10 3 s note that the characteristic time of advection τ a for a mobile cell in this example is 1 0 10 5 s the results suggest that the estimated error can be up to 42 when the time step is 50 times larger than τ a 3 solution verification in this section two small scale cases are studied to evaluate implementation of the dcm module by comparing darcytools predicted results with exact analytical solutions the first case is a transport problem in the fracture matrix system shown in fig 2 the water velocity in the fracture is assumed constant and hydrodynamic dispersion is ignored the fracture is embedded in an infinite δ m and homogeneous porous rock where no generation occurs f 0 a tracer is continuously injected at the inlet to the fracture where it will be advected tracer particles can also diffuse into the rock matrix and move away from the flowing water in the absence of hydrodynamic dispersion and generation terms the coupled mass balance equations given in eqs 1 and 2 can be solved analytically to give the tracer concentration at the fracture outlet i e the tracer breakthrough curve btc in terms of water residence time t w flow wetted surface fws and flow rate q the solution by moreno et al 1997 reads 23 e 0 if t t w erfc fws 2 q d e ϕ t t w 0 5 if t t w for comparison the above system is also simulated in darcytools using the new dcm module parameters and properties used in this test case are listed in table 1 fig 7 shows the tracer btc for an instantaneous step change at the fracture inlet the crosses indicate the darcytools predicted results the full line indicates the exact analytical solution and the dashed line indicates the tracer concentration when matrix diffusion is ignored a slight numerical dispersion can be observed at the rising limb of the btcs nevertheless the results indicate that darcytools can well predict the tracer concentration both at the rising limb and the tailed part of the curves the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse in this case is calculated to be 0 985 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the reader may note that the observed tailing in the absence of other dispersive mechanisms is a likely consequence of matrix diffusion that slows down the tracer particles transport at different levels and thus gives rise to the spread in their travel times grisak and pickens 1980 tsang 1995 therefore having observed a good agreement at the tail the results suggest a successful implementation of the matrix diffusion via the dcm module in the second case transport and generation of helium is simulated in the fracture matrix system described above a similar darcytools model is used nevertheless the latter case differs from the tracer model in that a helium is constantly generated in the rock matrix and b a zero concentration boundary condition is imposed at the fracture inlet fresh water therefore enters the fracture from the inlet boundary and helium diffuses into the water flowing in the fracture considering the initial and boundary conditions given in eqs 4 and 5 a new analytical solution to this problem is derived in the laplace domain the solution in its general formulation includes the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion and reads see appendix a for a complete list of parameters 24 c f s α 1 exp κ t α 2 exp κ t ω f where c f s is the laplace transformed concentration in the fracture the de hoog algorithm is then used to numerically invert eq 24 back to the time domain and find the helium breakthrough curve the algorithm is well described in de hoog et al 1982 and briefly reviewed by boupha et al 2004 fig 8 shows the darcytools predicted result and the analytical solution eq 24 in the time domain it can be seen that prediction of darcytools model agrees well with the analytically calculated btc at all the modelled instants nse 0 99 furthermore to evaluate the relative accuracy of the quasi steady state approximation eq 11 the darcytools predicted result based on this approximation is also plotted in fig 8 the results indicate that the quasi steady state approximation overestimates the helium concentration in the fracture during the transient phase yet the two results coincide at steady state it should also be noted that in the model studied above δ f and δ m are assumed to be constant however in large scale models heterogeneity in the cell properties arises due to the stochastic nature of the underlying dfn therefore further effort as discussed earlier in section 2 2 is needed to estimate the average matrix block size and fracture aperture from the ecpm properties this process is demonstrated in the following section by simulating helium transport in a large scale three dimensional domain 4 transport in a large scale model in this section the dcm module and darcytools are used to simulate solute transport in a large scale fractured bedrock where all simulations are performed on a desktop computer the hydraulic properties of the domain is based on a model for the shallow part of the hydraulic rock domain at the laxemar site in sweden vidstrand et al 2010 four predefined fracture sets are combined to form the complete fracture network in the bedrock the fracture sets are generated in darcytools svensson and follin 2010 following the same fracture specifications used by trinchero et al 2019 the modelled domain volume is 1024 1024 128 m3 which is discretised into a uniform grid with cell sizes δ x δ y 4 m and δ z 2 m the fracture network properties are then geometrically upscaled on the grid to create a porous medium with equivalent properties hence the dcm parameters are estimated following the formulations presented in section 2 2 the upscaling method in darcytools is documented in ferry 2020b to mimic the underground water flow field near the surface fixed pressure boundary conditions are applied to two narrow regions on the bedrock surface the boundary regions extend 10 m and 1024 m in the x and y directions respectively and induce a pressure difference of δ p 1 10 3 pa between the inlet x 0 and outlet x 1024 boundaries the remaining boundaries of the domain are subject to a no flux boundary condition the transport model is set up to include two solutes namely a non reactive tracer and helium the conservative tracer is constantly injected at the inlet boundary region with a unity concentration see fig 9 two scenarios are considered to study the retarding effect of matrix diffusion on the tracer transport in the first scenario the effect of matrix diffusion is ignored in other words it is assumed that the tracer does not interact with the surrounding rock matrix and is transported solely by the flowing water in the second scenario however the dcm module is activated this allows the tracer to penetrate into the pores of the secondary continuum matrix by diffusive transport and be withdrawn from the water that carries it in primary continua fractures in the mobile cells it should be emphasized that each mobile cell has different properties this results in variable diffusion mass flux rates between the flowing water and different matrix blocks the results corresponding to the two transport scenarios are shown in fig 9 it should be emphasized that since immobile cells are much less permeable and therefore are expected to have negligible impact on concentration profile in the domain they have been removed from the figure and only mobile cells are shown for comparison purposes snapshots of the tracer concentration are shown at three simulation times namely 5 50 and 10 000 years it can be seen that when matrix diffusion is ignored tracer infiltrates through the conductive elements in the domain i e fractures in mobile cells and it is carried away by flowing water toward the outlet boundary in the second scenario however tracer transport along the the fractures is largely retarded by matrix diffusion and tracer plume does not extend very far from the inlet boundary after 50 years in fact due to the large dispersion it takes nearly 10 000 years before the plum reaches the outlet boundary transport of helium is also modeled in the same fractured bedrock domain described above the model accounts for flow of water in fractures in the mobile cells as well as continuous generation of helium in the adjacent matrix blocks the bulk generation rate of he in the matrix g r f ϕ is assumed to be g r 1 24 10 10 mol m rock 3 year neretnieks 2013 in this model fresh water infiltrates through the inlet boundary and thus carries the discharged helium from the matrix toward the outlet boundary therefore it is expected that helium concentration builds up downstream along the flow direction this is illustrated in fig 10 where calculated helium concentration field after 10 000 years is shown for comparison helium concentration data at four observation points are sampled over time the points are defined with the coordinates given in table 3 and are labelled as upstream south us upstream north un downstream south ds and downstream north dn the resulted breakthrough curves after 10 000 years are shown in fig 11 furthermore the above simulation is repeated but now assuming that the quasi steady state approximation holds in other words it is assumed that helium mass flux rate is fixed and equal to the value obtained from eq 11 the 2d model results fig 8 suggest that helium concentrations should gradually increase until they reach steady state values nevertheless the time needed to reach steady state is different at different observation points due to their varying distances from the inlet boundary and their transport properties in fact the steady state value is directly proportional to groundwater travel time from the inlet boundary and is inversely proportional to flow porosity at a observation point trinchero et al 2019 after 10 000 years only the upstream north un point seems to reach the steady state condition this can be understood by comparing the two breakthrough curves at this point it can also be seen that the steady state approximation results in a higher mass flux between the conductive fractures and matrix blocks which is reflected by larger concentrations of helium in the flowing groundwater this is a clear indication that the quasi steady state approximation cannot accurately describe the transport of he during the transient phase alternatively the dcm model proposed in this paper can be used to predict the he concentration during the transport time the reader may note that ideally site specific helium data are required to ensure correct implementation of the dcm module in a large scale fractured bedrock yet that information is unfortunately not reported for the shallow part of the laxemar site nevertheless the numerical analyses and test results presented in sections 2 3 and 3 indicates that the dcm model is implemented correctly and is applicable to both large and small scale problems furthermore a similar large scale system has been solved independently in a recent paper by trinchero et al 2022 their model relies on a dual continuum disconnected matrix model lichtner 2000 that is implemented in pflotran and is solved using a supercomputer their reported results for helium concentration at the given observation points are in very close agreement with our simulation results this is another indication that the dcm model is implemented correctly in darcytools 5 conclusion in this contribution a new analytical solution is presented for the matrix diffusion problem based on the dual continuum model dcm the solution is derived at the scale of a single fracture rock matrix system and can be used to study the transient behaviour of naturally occurring elements i e helium in fractured bedrocks the proposed solution is then implemented as an embedded module in darcytools this enables the code to carry out matrix diffusion calculation together with the multi component transport calculations in fractures in the mobile cells since darcytools relies on a continuous porous medium model a conceptual model is also presented to obtain the dcm parameters from properties of the ecpm the key underlying assumption is that each mobile cell in the domain can be represented by a system of parallel fractures with equivalent specific flow wetted surface and kinematic porosity the new implementation is verified by comparing darcytools simulation results with analytical solutions available for the 2d fracture matrix system excellent agreement in results is found for the two cases considered additionally the dcm module is applied in a 3d model to simulate transport of naturally occurring helium and a non reactive tracer in a large scale fractured bedrock the results indicate that the new dcm can effectively describe the solute exchange between the rock matrix and the flowing water whether the matrix act as a source or sink in terms of computational efficiency the cost of the diffusion calculation is negligible compared to the cost of transport calculation in a fracture in a mobile cell nevertheless to ensure high accuracy in the numerical results sufficiently small time step should be taken by the darcytools solver so that the quasi steady state assumption holds under the time step this issue is not unique to our approach and appears due to the different transport time scales in the fracture advection and dispersion and rock matrix molecular diffusion which makes the numerical solution sensitive to the step size fortunately to overcome this obstacle darcytools and the adopted two step method allow for an effective parallelisation that can significantly decrease the computation time it is also worth noting that the proposed model is relatively simple and only accounts for a zero order reaction yet it suffices for simulation of naturally occurring tracers and should be considered as the starting point for the development of more complex models with e g chemical reactions sorption decay chains and several

1226,nanoremediation is a new groundwater remediation technology in which nanoparticles nps are injected into the sub surface to promote in situ degradation of aquifer contaminants although nanoremediation is an effective process to eliminate contaminants in situ its success relies on sufficiently mobile nps that can reach the contaminated zones and remain there to facilitate chemical

the porous media beryani et al 2020 bianco et al 2017 since this interaction is a micro scale process occurring within the pore space of aquifers x ray micro ct technique can provide new insights into the dynamics of the nanoremediation process to our knowledge the only studies published on this subject pak et al 2020 the previous work of co authors of this work and schiefler et al 2022 while pak et al 2020 discuss the main pore scale mechanisms that contribute to nanoremediation at the pore scale gas formation and flow direct degradation at interface their study does not discuss the mobility of nzvi nanoparticles within porous media which is a well known challenge faced in field application of nanoremediation schiefler et al 2022 is the first work focused on np transport studied at the pore scale using micro ct imaging schiefler et al 2022 shows that non destructive micro ct imaging can provide novel insights into nzvi mobility and entrapment within porous media and discuss the key pore scale mechanisms contributing to the particle entrapment straining and ripening building on the findings of this recently published study our work focuses on applying a different approach i e pore network modelling to study the effect of nzvi injection on i pore space geometry ii pore space connectivity iii storage capacity porosity and iv flow properties permeability of sandy porous media in practice np mobility in porous media is also controlled by the stability of np suspension that can result in particle aggregation and deposition within pores mondino et al 2020 pak et al 2018 tiraferri et al 2017 which is another challenge in field application of nanoremediation fig 1 shows the main pore scale mechanisms that control np transport and retention within porous media 2 materials and methods we performed experiments to investigate the impact of grain size and composition on nzvi mobility and retention in groundwater systems these experiments allowed us to investigate the change in the structural and the geometric properties of sandy porous media as a result of np injection we studied four columns packed with fine sand coarse sand carbonate and mix sand comprising sand and carbonate grains fig 2 shows example x ray micro ct slices for these four columns these images were captured after the nzvi injection was completed so the nzvi phase is also visible in these slices the columns were initially water saturated subsequently the nzvi suspension was injected followed by a post water flush to remove the mobile nanoparticles 3d volumetric images were captured at this point using x ray micro ct technique all tomographic data presented here are at 4 52 μm resolution obtaining 3d images allows 3d visualisation as well as quantification of the different phases present within the sample the image analysis and simulation were carried out using the freely available software imagej and the commercially available software avizo 2 1 image processing and analysis workflow the image analysis flowchart is shown in fig 3 image processing includes noise filtering segmentation and analysis to study the transport and mobility of nzvi in the different samples we calculated the flow properties porosity and permeability to compare the structural and geometric properties of the samples before and after nzvi injection fig 3 shows that image acquisition and reconstruction steps were followed by image filtering using the non local means filter buades et al 2005 to remove the measurement noise while maintaining the image sharpness by preserving the phase boundaries 2 2 segmentation image segmentation involves the process of assigning identifying and isolating pixels or voxels in an image with labels sharing similar characteristic martínez martínez et al 2007 image segmentation enables the different phases i e pores sand grains and nzvi within the image to be identified the literature reports several segmentation techniques however none is known to provide a solution for all images kaestner et al 2008 therefore a successful segmentation is achieved through application of several different techniques and comparison of the results against what is expected or known from the sample here image segmentation allowed the identification of the pores grains and nzvi phases within the volumes under study the simplest segmentation technique i e thresholding worked reasonably well for some of the images and phases si appendix fig s1 and fig s2 other phases nzvi needed more advanced segmentation for this trainable weka segmentation algorithm implemented in imagej and watershed segmentation in avizo were used 2 2 1 trainable weka segmentation tws the trainable weka segmentation tws is a machine learning tool implemented in imagej arganda carreras et al 2017 here the tws was used particularly to segment the nzvi phase the segmentation was successful for all the phases using the tws technique fig 4 shows the outcome of tws for the four samples studied in this work the segmented images of each phase were then studied using the label analysis algorithms within avizo particle analyser in imagej offers a similar possibility label analysis identifies the individual objects within each phase each object is a connected cluster of voxels dillencourt et al 1992 labelling was used to identify and quantitatively analyse connected objects in each image this included measurement of their shape size elongation specific surface area porosity and saturation of each phase etc 3d image visualisation volume rendering of phases was performed in avizo 2 3 pore network model extraction in this study the objective of extracting pnms is to i carry out numerical simulation of fluid flow single phase on the segmented pore space connected part and ii quantify the geometric parameters of the network elements pores and pore throats before and after nzvi injection to extract pnms the first step is to generate the skeleton of the pore space one voxel thick that shows how the network is connected this skeleton is produced using a thinning process by eroding the pore phase starting from the pore grain interface this is also known as skeletonization which involves calculating the shortest distance between the void space and the background fouard et al 2004 using the skeleton the pore space can be separated into pores and pore throats here the pores are spherical in shape the pore throats are straight cylindrical channels pore space connectivity is measured through a parameter known as coordination number the unconnected pore space consists of isolated cluster of pores that in fact may be connected to the pore system but through pore throats smaller than the image resolution and hence appear as disconnected this is a known limitation of imaging techniques such as the one used in this work there is a trade off between the sample size and the image resolution meaning that a better image resolution is achievable for smaller samples at the time of writing this paper with the existing x ray μct imaging instruments image resolution of a few μm is achieved for samples of a few mm size see the following review paper for a more comprehensive discussion on x ray μct imaging limitations wildenschild and sheppard 2013 while a few μm resolution is sufficient to resolve pore space clogging and its impact on flow properties such as permeability of the porous media the individual nanoparticles are not resolved using these images therefore a pore by pore study of nanoparticle movements through the pore space in 3d is not yet possible additionally potential deposition of nanoparticles on the sand grain surfaces can go undetected unless they form layers with thicknesses approaching the image resolution this limitation can potentially be overcome through investigating sand grains using sem or tem after the μct imaging is done and the column is taken apart this however is a destructive technique which will only be useful to confirm nzvi deposition on the grains without considering the pore system they were forming in the sand column the absolute permeability of the rock is calculated based on the segmented pore phase connected portion using the pnm module in avizo table 1 shows the dimensions of the images used in this study 3 result and discussion in this section we present and discuss the pnms extracted from the four columns under study we compare their characteristics including shape factor size distribution and coordination number we also present the porosity permeability and tortuosity data extracted from the images under study for the presented distributions the mean value is shown in brackets 3 1 grain and pore size distributions the grain size distributions for the samples under study are presented in fig 5a the coarse sand displays grains with a larger size peak grain size of 321 μm compared to the fine sand peak grain size of 201 μm both the coarse and carbonate sand columns have grain sizes ranging between 100 μm to 550 μm the mixed sample presents grain sizes ranging from 100 μm to 400 μm the fine and mixed samples have narrow grain size distributions the difference in grain size and therefore pore size distributions is reflected in the difference in the porosity for these samples fine coarse carbonate and mixed sand columns have porosities of 33 39 49 and 35 respectively having the highest porosity as shown in fig 5b the carbonate sample also has the largest average pore radius of 121 38 μm in contrast fine sand displays the lowest porosity as well as the smallest average pore radius of 25 85 μm the fine sand mixed sand and the carbonate have a unimodal pore size distribution with a long tail towards larger pore sizes coarse sand has a bimodal distribution with the location of their peaks at slightly higher pore sizes the average pore radius of coarse sand and mixed sand samples are between 31 50 μm and 28 57 μm 3 2 specific surface area ssa ssa is the surface that is available per volume of sand for nzvi to attach defined as a g v g where ag is the surface area of sand μm2 and vg is the volume of sand μm3 ssa is 5 78 5 59 10 67 8 35 μm 1 for fine sand coarse sand carbonate and mixed sand respectively fine and coarse sand have similar ssa whereas the mixed sand is larger due to the presence of heterogeneous grains 3 3 pore shape the pore shapes within the carbonate sample are distinctly different from the pores within the fine and coarse sand columns the sand particles are angular while the carbonate grains are rounded objects angular grains can fit together more closely resulting in a better packed sample the carbonate grains used here were obtained from the ketton limestone which is an oolitic limestone from the uk as shown in fig 4 the grains voids form close to spherical shapes as a result the intergranular pores formed in the carbonate column takes a close to star shape analysis of the images show that the column packed with the carbonate grains presents the largest surface per volume this is an important parameter for nzvi particle attachment and retention in pnm studies the pore shape is commonly evaluated using a parameter known as the shape factor which is defined as g a v an et al 2016 where a is the pore area μm2 v is the pore volume μm3 the pore shape factor distribution for the four columns under study is presented in fig 6a as expected this figure shows the carbonate column has highest g values while the fine sand shows the smallest g values the plot also shows g for perfect spheres of radius r in the red curve g 3 r for spheres majority of the pores are irregular in shape as expected for real porous media von bargen and waff 1986 the distribution of the pore shape factors for the four different samples is shown in the fig 6b deviation from spherical shape g 1 suggests pores are angular angular pores provide a more suitable environment for entrapment of nzvi clusters compared to spherical pores the average pore shape factor is highest in carbonate 0 78 1 μm and lowest in fine sand 0 35 1 μm the carbonate also shows a wider range of pore shape factors while we show the pores and pore throats are angular using the real images it should be noted that for simplicity we use a pnm approach that extracts spherical pores and cylindrical pore throats 3 4 analysis of saturation values of the different phases and volume rendering visual inspection using 3d renderings of the different samples and quantitative analysis provides an excellent means to understand the nzvi retention within the samples and allows phase quantification fig 7 shows the 3d rendering for the grains and nzvi phases table 2 presents the percentage of each column occupied by the grains pores and nzvi phases after np injection as seen the nzvi saturation in the pore space shows the highest amount in the column packed with the fine sand 38 3 there is 10 difference between the amount of entrapped nzvi in the fine and coarse sand columns this shows the significant impact of the pore size distribution on particle trapping carbonate sample has trapped the least amount of nzvi 25 65 and agrees with its larger grain size and pore size there are two main differences between the sand and the carbonate grains used in this study i mineralogy of the grains ii grain shape and angularity the former has direct impact on the surface charge of the grains zeta potential and can contribute to particle solid interactions the latter can impact the mechanical filtration of particles through creation of angular pore systems with pore corners and constricted spaces promoting particle entrapment 3 5 pore network modelling pnm through extracting pore networks we studied key morphological parameters of the different porous media the pore size distribution pore throat size distribution and individual pore geometries these parameters are important for revealing the nzvi transport properties in the pore space of the different samples 3d representation of the pore network model extracted from the four samples are shown in fig 8 above the pore space is illustrated as a lattice of pores shown as spheres connected by pore throats shown as cylinders the size of pore or pore throat indicates the inscribed radius table 3 presents the quantitative analysis of these pnms the mixed sand has the highest number of pores 1603 and carbonate has the smallest pore count 1481 the table also reports the statistics for the pnm generated for the pore phase after the nzvi injection pores and throat counts increase after nzvi injection in all the samples this is because nzvi deposition has altered the pore space in a way that some pores or pore throats are split in more than one pore or pore throat with smaller sizes fig 4 the analysis also shows a reduction in the pore sizes and pore throat sizes figs 9 and 10 b e this alteration affects the structure and the pore geometries the significant increase in the number of pores and throats shows the marked change in the pore system for these columns as a result of nzvi injection the pore topology refers to the way the pores are interconnected pore topology parameters such as the coordination number were studied as can be seen from table 3 carbonate sample has the smallest pore and throat count but has a slightly higher coordination number compared to the other samples 3 5 1 pore size distribution studying pore size distributions provides valuable insights into the structure of porous media fig 9 shows the effect of nzvi injection on the pore size distribution for the four samples studied pore size distributions are shown to be impacted by the np injection in all samples the analysis shows a slight shift in the size distribution towards the left smaller sizes after nzvi injection if we consider the average pore size for the presented distributions the reduction rate is 59 in fine sand 34 in coarse sand 70 in carbonate and 31 in mixed sand the carbonate sample shows the highest reduction as some of the larger pores within this sample are either split in several pores or are completely clogged because of nzvi injection 3 5 2 pore throat size distribution the pore throats serve as the connection between the pores and plays a vital role in the connectivity of the porous media pore throats are the narrows parts of the network that restrict the flow and can give rise to particle entrapment here quantitative analysis of the pore throat geometry before and after the nzvi injection is presented fig 10a shows the pore throat size distribution and fig 10 b e shows the effect of nzvi injection on the pore throat size in the samples studied the pore throat sizes display a unimodal distribution for all samples with a long tail towards larger throat sizes the mean pore throat radius of carbonate 23 09 μm is the largest and the mean for the fine sand 11 56 μm is the smallest the coarse and the mixed porous sand display mean pore throat size of 18 36 μm and 14 25 μm respectively nzvi injection has resulted in reduction of the pore throat sizes leading to the pore throat distributions moving to the left the reduction in the average throat sizes range from 24 to 41 due to closure of the larger throats 41 in fine sand 38 in coarse sand 25 in carbonate and 24 in mixed sand 3 5 3 throat channel length distribution figure 11a below presents the throat channel length distribution and fig 11b shows the effect of nzvi injection on the throat channel length this describes the trapping mechanism by telling us about the longest path within the sample through which the nzvi will pass the throat channel length distribution in fine sand coarse sand and mixed sand shows a unimodal distribution and their distribution is nearly symmetric carbonate shows a bimodal distribution with a larger average throat channel length distribution of 92 91 μm fine sand has an average throat channel length distribution of 47 92 μm with the largest peak at reduced throat channel length coarse sand 84 57 μm and mixed sand 82 85 μm has similar average throat channel length distribution the peak of the mixed sand is slightly higher than that of coarse sand at the throat channel length range around 70 μm to 80 μm fig 11b shows the effect of nzvi injection on all the samples the throat channel length is seen to be moving towards the left in all the samples after nzvi injection also the peak of the throat channel length moves towards reduced throat channel length with a higher probability in fine coarse and mixed sand 3 5 4 coordination number distribution the coordination number has proven to impact transport properties liu et al 2022 fig 12a bellow shows the coordination number distribution for all the samples the effect of nzvi injection on the coordination number is shown in fig 12 b e fig 12a shows that the coordination number distribution in all the samples follows a unimodal distribution with the tail towards larger coordination number fig 12a shows that the fine sand has the best connectivity with the highest average coordination number of 10 coarse sand carbonate and mixed sand have similar coordination number of 6 82 6 15 and 5 62 respectively the better connectivity in fine sand provides more pathways to flow fig 12b shows that nzvi injection has reduced the coordination number in all samples fine sand shows a reduction of approximately 44 coarse sand 36 carbonate 71 and mixed sand 63 respectively compared to their initial coordination numbers the nzvi injection has created a great number of isolated pores in carbonate and mixed sand 3 6 evaluation of flow properties our analysis shows that permeability reduces as a result of the nzvi injection in the four columns under study see table 4 carbonate has the highest initial permeability due to its larger pore throat sizes the carbonate has fewer pore throats 7820 which are longer and wider it is noted that the pnms display a similar pore counts for all four samples permeability reduction is highest for the fine sand 98 94 and smallest in coarse sand 73 89 this reduction is also seen with the highest reduction of its pore throat radius of 41 in fine sand this shows the importance of the pore throat radius on the permeability of the porous media permeability reduction is more pronounced in fine sand sample with its smaller grain sizes the fine sample has retained the highest amount of nzvi although we observe a difference in permeability reduction for all the samples the porosity reduction was similar for all the tested porous media the nzvi injection does not cause a significant change in tortuosity reduction in porosity and permeability with increase in tortuosity changes the pore geometry this shows that there are fewer junctions in the large conduits of the carbonate sample this analysis shows that the fine sand has short and narrow throats joining its pores it is seen that the larger pores are connected to more throats and the longer throats have a wider distribution in all the samples si appendix fig s3 4 summary and conclusions this paper presents a pore scale imaging study aiming to quantitatively analyse the mobility and retention of nzvi nanoparticles within columns packed with grains of different sizes and compositions we use x ray μ ct imaging to study the nzvi distribution within these four columns before and after the injection of nzvi non destructively we present the outcome of our analysis focusing on the flow properties porosity and permeability as well as geometrical and topological pore scale properties pore geometry and connectivity our 3d images show the extent and nature of the pore space clogging due to nzvi deposition and its effects on the pore size pore throat size pore throat length and coordination number we conclude that nzvi transport in porous media is impacted by the mineral composition of the grains as well as the size and geometry of the pore space the following conclusions can be extracted from this study pore scale imaging using x ray μ ct can be successfully applied to study nzvi mobility and entrapment in sandy porous media this study highlights the suitability of μct imaging for visualising and quantification of nzvi clogging at the pore scale analysis of x ray μct images allowed to gain insight into the effect of grain composition and size on the transport of np the amount and distribution of nzvi deposited controls the permeability loss in porous media the measured porosity and permeability reduce significantly in all the columns although the carbonate has a larger surface area per unit volume of pores available for nzvi attachment this has not resulted in an increase in the total nzvi retention within the carbonate column this suggests that nzvi retention is predominantly contorted by pore structure rather than the mineralogy of the grains all the pore scale geometrical and topological properties studied here i e pore and pore throat sizes pore throat length coordination number are shown to be significantly reduced by the nzvi retention within the columns under study the column porosity reduces in the range of 35 to 37 while permeabilities reduce in the range of 73 to 99 the permeability reduction is more significant for the fine sand 99 compared to the coarse sand 74 in contrast tortuosity does not show a significant increase 1 to 4 fine sand has entrapped the highest number of nps 38 future work should focus on performing 4d 3d time experiments in which a sequence of images is captured during the nzvi injection in porous media a similar study to the work published by pak et al 2020 which uses 4d imaging to study the use of nzvi

et al 2020 discuss the main pore scale mechanisms that contribute to nanoremediation at the pore scale gas formation and flow direct degradation at interface their study does not discuss the mobility of nzvi nanoparticles within porous media which is a well known challenge faced in field application of nanoremediation schiefler et al 2022 is the first work focused on np transport studied at the pore scale using micro ct imaging schiefler et al 2022 shows that non destructive micro ct imaging can provide novel insights into nzvi mobility and entrapment within porous media and discuss the key pore scale mechanisms contributing to the particle entrapment straining and ripening building on the findings of this recently published study our work focuses on applying a different approach i e pore network modelling to study the effect of nzvi injection on i pore space geometry ii pore space connectivity iii storage capacity porosity and iv flow properties permeability of sandy porous media in practice np mobility in porous media is also controlled by the stability of np suspension that can result in particle aggregation and deposition within pores mondino et al 2020 pak et al 2018 tiraferri et al 2017 which is another challenge in field application of nanoremediation fig 1 shows the main pore scale mechanisms that control np transport and retention within porous media 2 materials and methods we performed experiments to investigate the impact of grain size and composition on nzvi mobility and retention in groundwater systems these experiments allowed us to investigate the change in the structural and the geometric properties of sandy porous media as a result of np injection we studied four columns packed with fine sand coarse sand carbonate and mix sand comprising sand and carbonate grains fig 2 shows example x ray micro ct slices for these four columns these images were captured after the nzvi injection was completed so the nzvi phase is also visible in these slices the columns were initially water saturated subsequently the nzvi suspension was injected followed by a post water flush to remove the mobile nanoparticles 3d volumetric images were captured at this point using x ray micro ct technique all tomographic data presented here are at 4 52 μm resolution obtaining 3d images allows 3d visualisation as well as quantification of the different phases present within the sample the image analysis and simulation were carried out using the freely available software imagej and the commercially available software avizo 2 1 image processing and analysis workflow the image analysis flowchart is shown in fig 3 image processing includes noise filtering segmentation and analysis to study the transport and mobility of nzvi in the different samples we calculated the flow properties porosity and permeability to compare the structural and geometric properties of the samples before and after nzvi injection fig 3 shows that image acquisition and reconstruction steps were followed by image filtering using the non local means filter buades et al 2005 to remove the measurement noise while maintaining the image sharpness by preserving the phase boundaries 2 2 segmentation image segmentation involves the process of assigning identifying and isolating pixels or voxels in an image with labels sharing similar characteristic martínez martínez et al 2007 image segmentation enables the different phases i e pores sand grains and nzvi within the image to be identified the literature reports several segmentation techniques however none is known to provide a solution for all images kaestner et al 2008 therefore a successful segmentation is achieved through application of several different techniques and comparison of the results against what is expected or known from the sample here image segmentation allowed the identification of the pores grains and nzvi phases within the volumes under study the simplest segmentation technique i e thresholding worked reasonably well for some of the images and phases si appendix fig s1 and fig s2 other phases nzvi needed more advanced segmentation for this trainable weka segmentation algorithm implemented in imagej and watershed segmentation in avizo were used 2 2 1 trainable weka segmentation tws the trainable weka segmentation tws is a machine learning tool implemented in imagej arganda carreras et al 2017 here the tws was used particularly to segment the nzvi phase the segmentation was successful for all the phases using the tws technique fig 4 shows the outcome of tws for the four samples studied in this work the segmented images of each phase were then studied using the label analysis algorithms within avizo particle analyser in imagej offers a similar possibility label analysis identifies the individual objects within each phase each object is a connected cluster of voxels dillencourt et al 1992 labelling was used to identify and quantitatively analyse connected objects in each image this included measurement of their shape size elongation specific surface area porosity and saturation of each phase etc 3d image visualisation volume rendering of phases was performed in avizo 2 3 pore network model extraction in this study the objective of extracting pnms is to i carry out numerical simulation of fluid flow single phase on the segmented pore space connected part and ii quantify the geometric parameters of the network elements pores and pore throats before and after nzvi injection to extract pnms the first step is to generate the skeleton of the pore space one voxel thick that shows how the network is connected this skeleton is produced using a thinning process by eroding the pore phase starting from the pore grain interface this is also known as skeletonization which involves calculating the shortest distance between the void space and the background fouard et al 2004 using the skeleton the pore space can be separated into pores and pore throats here the pores are spherical in shape the pore throats are straight cylindrical channels pore space connectivity is measured through a parameter known as coordination number the unconnected pore space consists of isolated cluster of pores that in fact may be connected to the pore system but through pore throats smaller than the image resolution and hence appear as disconnected this is a known limitation of imaging techniques such as the one used in this work there is a trade off between the sample size and the image resolution meaning that a better image resolution is achievable for smaller samples at the time of writing this paper with the existing x ray μct imaging instruments image resolution of a few μm is achieved for samples of a few mm size see the following review paper for a more comprehensive discussion on x ray μct imaging limitations wildenschild and sheppard 2013 while a few μm resolution is sufficient to resolve pore space clogging and its impact on flow properties such as permeability of the porous media the individual nanoparticles are not resolved using these images therefore a pore by pore study of nanoparticle movements through the pore space in 3d is not yet possible additionally potential deposition of nanoparticles on the sand grain surfaces can go undetected unless they form layers with thicknesses approaching the image resolution this limitation can potentially be overcome through investigating sand grains using sem or tem after the μct imaging is done and the column is taken apart this however is a destructive technique which will only be useful to confirm nzvi deposition on the grains without considering the pore system they were forming in the sand column the absolute permeability of the rock is calculated based on the segmented pore phase connected portion using the pnm module in avizo table 1 shows the dimensions of the images used in this study 3 result and discussion in this section we present and discuss the pnms extracted from the four columns under study we compare their characteristics including shape factor size distribution and coordination number we also present the porosity permeability and tortuosity data extracted from the images under study for the presented distributions the mean value is shown in brackets 3 1 grain and pore size distributions the grain size distributions for the samples under study are presented in fig 5a the coarse sand displays grains with a larger size peak grain size of 321 μm compared to the fine sand peak grain size of 201 μm both the coarse and carbonate sand columns have grain sizes ranging between 100 μm to 550 μm the mixed sample presents grain sizes ranging from 100 μm to 400 μm the fine and mixed samples have narrow grain size distributions the difference in grain size and therefore pore size distributions is reflected in the difference in the porosity for these samples fine coarse carbonate and mixed sand columns have porosities of 33 39 49 and 35 respectively having the highest porosity as shown in fig 5b the carbonate sample also has the largest average pore radius of 121 38 μm in contrast fine sand displays the lowest porosity as well as the smallest average pore radius of 25 85 μm the fine sand mixed sand and the carbonate have a unimodal pore size distribution with a long tail towards larger pore sizes coarse sand has a bimodal distribution with the location of their peaks at slightly higher pore sizes the average pore radius of coarse sand and mixed sand samples are between 31 50 μm and 28 57 μm 3 2 specific surface area ssa ssa is the surface that is available per volume of sand for nzvi to attach defined as a g v g where ag is the surface area of sand μm2 and vg is the volume of sand μm3 ssa is 5 78 5 59 10 67 8 35 μm 1 for fine sand coarse sand carbonate and mixed sand respectively fine and coarse sand have similar ssa whereas the mixed sand is larger due to the presence of heterogeneous grains 3 3 pore shape the pore shapes within the carbonate sample are distinctly different from the pores within the fine and coarse sand columns the sand particles are angular while the carbonate grains are rounded objects angular grains can fit together more closely resulting in a better packed sample the carbonate grains used here were obtained from the ketton limestone which is an oolitic limestone from the uk as shown in fig 4 the grains voids form close to spherical shapes as a result the intergranular pores formed in the carbonate column takes a close to star shape analysis of the images show that the column packed with the carbonate grains presents the largest surface per volume this is an important parameter for nzvi particle attachment and retention in pnm studies the pore shape is commonly evaluated using a parameter known as the shape factor which is defined as g a v an et al 2016 where a is the pore area μm2 v is the pore volume μm3 the pore shape factor distribution for the four columns under study is presented in fig 6a as expected this figure shows the carbonate column has highest g values while the fine sand shows the smallest g values the plot also shows g for perfect spheres of radius r in the red curve g 3 r for spheres majority of the pores are irregular in shape as expected for real porous media von bargen and waff 1986 the distribution of the pore shape factors for the four different samples is shown in the fig 6b deviation from spherical shape g 1 suggests pores are angular angular pores provide a more suitable environment for entrapment of nzvi clusters compared to spherical pores the average pore shape factor is highest in carbonate 0 78 1 μm and lowest in fine sand 0 35 1 μm the carbonate also shows a wider range of pore shape factors while we show the pores and pore throats are angular using the real images it should be noted that for simplicity we use a pnm approach that extracts spherical pores and cylindrical pore throats 3 4 analysis of saturation values of the different phases and volume rendering visual inspection using 3d renderings of the different samples and quantitative analysis provides an excellent means to understand the nzvi retention within the samples and allows phase quantification fig 7 shows the 3d rendering for the grains and nzvi phases table 2 presents the percentage of each column occupied by the grains pores and nzvi phases after np injection as seen the nzvi saturation in the pore space shows the highest amount in the column packed with the fine sand 38 3 there is 10 difference between the amount of entrapped nzvi in the fine and coarse sand columns this shows the significant impact of the pore size distribution on particle trapping carbonate sample has trapped the least amount of nzvi 25 65 and agrees with its larger grain size and pore size there are two main differences between the sand and the carbonate grains used in this study i mineralogy of the grains ii grain shape and angularity the former has direct impact on the surface charge of the grains zeta potential and can contribute to particle solid interactions the latter can impact the mechanical filtration of particles through creation of angular pore systems with pore corners and constricted spaces promoting particle entrapment 3 5 pore network modelling pnm through extracting pore networks we studied key morphological parameters of the different porous media the pore size distribution pore throat size distribution and individual pore geometries these parameters are important for revealing the nzvi transport properties in the pore space of the different samples 3d representation of the pore network model extracted from the four samples are shown in fig 8 above the pore space is illustrated as a lattice of pores shown as spheres connected by pore throats shown as cylinders the size of pore or pore throat indicates the inscribed radius table 3 presents the quantitative analysis of these pnms the mixed sand has the highest number of pores 1603 and carbonate has the smallest pore count 1481 the table also reports the statistics for the pnm generated for the pore phase after the nzvi injection pores and throat counts increase after nzvi injection in all the samples this is because nzvi deposition has altered the pore space in a way that some pores or pore throats are split in more than one pore or pore throat with smaller sizes fig 4 the analysis also shows a reduction in the pore sizes and pore throat sizes figs 9 and 10 b e this alteration affects the structure and the pore geometries the significant increase in the number of pores and throats shows the marked change in the pore system for these columns as a result of nzvi injection the pore topology refers to the way the pores are interconnected pore topology parameters such as the coordination number were studied as can be seen from table 3 carbonate sample has the smallest pore and throat count but has a slightly higher coordination number compared to the other samples 3 5 1 pore size distribution studying pore size distributions provides valuable insights into the structure of porous media fig 9 shows the effect of nzvi injection on the pore size distribution for the four samples studied pore size distributions are shown to be impacted by the np injection in all samples the analysis shows a slight shift in the size distribution towards the left smaller sizes after nzvi injection if we consider the average pore size for the presented distributions the reduction rate is 59 in fine sand 34 in coarse sand 70 in carbonate and 31 in mixed sand the carbonate sample shows the highest reduction as some of the larger pores within this sample are either split in several pores or are completely clogged because of nzvi injection 3 5 2 pore throat size distribution the pore throats serve as the connection between the pores and plays a vital role in the connectivity of the porous media pore throats are the narrows parts of the network that restrict the flow and can give rise to particle entrapment here quantitative analysis of the pore throat geometry before and after the nzvi injection is presented fig 10a shows the pore throat size distribution and fig 10 b e shows the effect of nzvi injection on the pore throat size in the samples studied the pore throat sizes display a unimodal distribution for all samples with a long tail towards larger throat sizes the mean pore throat radius of carbonate 23 09 μm is the largest and the mean for the fine sand 11 56 μm is the smallest the coarse and the mixed porous sand display mean pore throat size of 18 36 μm and 14 25 μm respectively nzvi injection has resulted in reduction of the pore throat sizes leading to the pore throat distributions moving to the left the reduction in the average throat sizes range from 24 to 41 due to closure of the larger throats 41 in fine sand 38 in coarse sand 25 in carbonate and 24 in mixed sand 3 5 3 throat channel length distribution figure 11a below presents the throat channel length distribution and fig 11b shows the effect of nzvi injection on the throat channel length this describes the trapping mechanism by telling us about the longest path within the sample through which the nzvi will pass the throat channel length distribution in fine sand coarse sand and mixed sand shows a unimodal distribution and their distribution is nearly symmetric carbonate shows a bimodal distribution with a larger average throat channel length distribution of 92 91 μm fine sand has an average throat channel length distribution of 47 92 μm with the largest peak at reduced throat channel length coarse sand 84 57 μm and mixed sand 82 85 μm has similar average throat channel length distribution the peak of the mixed sand is slightly higher than that of coarse sand at the throat channel length range around 70 μm to 80 μm fig 11b shows the effect of nzvi injection on all the samples the throat channel length is seen to be moving towards the left in all the samples after nzvi injection also the peak of the throat channel length moves towards reduced throat channel length with a higher probability in fine coarse and mixed sand 3 5 4 coordination number distribution the coordination number has proven to impact transport properties liu et al 2022 fig 12a bellow shows the coordination number distribution for all the samples the effect of nzvi injection on the coordination number is shown in fig 12 b e fig 12a shows that the coordination number distribution in all the samples follows a unimodal distribution with the tail towards larger coordination number fig 12a shows that the fine sand has the best connectivity with the highest average coordination number of 10 coarse sand carbonate and mixed sand have similar coordination number of 6 82 6 15 and 5 62 respectively the better connectivity in fine sand provides more pathways to flow fig 12b shows that nzvi injection has reduced the coordination number in all samples fine sand shows a reduction of approximately 44 coarse sand 36 carbonate 71 and mixed sand 63 respectively compared to their initial coordination numbers the nzvi injection has created a great number of isolated pores in carbonate and mixed sand 3 6 evaluation of flow properties our analysis shows that permeability reduces as a result of the nzvi injection in the four columns under study see table 4 carbonate has the highest initial permeability due to its larger pore throat sizes the carbonate has fewer pore throats 7820 which are longer and wider it is noted that the pnms display a similar pore counts for all four samples permeability reduction is highest for the fine sand 98 94 and smallest in coarse sand 73 89 this reduction is also seen with the highest reduction of its pore throat radius of 41 in fine sand this shows the importance of the pore throat radius on the permeability of the porous media permeability reduction is more pronounced in fine sand sample with its smaller grain sizes the fine sample has retained the highest amount of nzvi although we observe a difference in permeability reduction for all the samples the porosity reduction was similar for all the tested porous media the nzvi injection does not cause a significant change in tortuosity reduction in porosity and permeability with increase in tortuosity changes the pore geometry this shows that there are fewer junctions in the large conduits of the carbonate sample this analysis shows that the fine sand has short and narrow throats joining its pores it is seen that the larger pores are connected to more throats and the longer throats have a wider distribution in all the samples si appendix fig s3 4 summary and conclusions this paper presents a pore scale imaging study aiming to quantitatively analyse the mobility and retention of nzvi nanoparticles within columns packed with grains of different sizes and compositions we use x ray μ ct imaging to study the nzvi distribution within these four columns before and after the injection of nzvi non destructively we present the outcome of our analysis focusing on the flow properties porosity and permeability as well as geometrical and topological pore scale properties pore geometry and connectivity our 3d images show the extent and nature of the pore space clogging due to nzvi deposition and its effects on the pore size pore throat size pore throat length and coordination number we conclude that nzvi transport in porous media is impacted by the mineral composition of the grains as well as the size and geometry of the pore space the following conclusions can be extracted from this study pore scale imaging using x ray μ ct can be successfully applied to study nzvi mobility and entrapment in sandy porous media this study highlights the suitability of μct imaging for visualising and quantification of nzvi clogging at the pore scale analysis of x ray μct images allowed to gain insight into the effect of grain composition and size on the transport of np the amount and distribution of nzvi deposited controls the permeability loss in porous media the measured porosity and permeability reduce significantly in all the columns although the carbonate has a larger surface area per unit volume of pores available for nzvi attachment this has not resulted in an increase in the total nzvi retention within the carbonate column this suggests that nzvi retention is predominantly contorted by pore structure rather than the mineralogy of the grains all the pore scale geometrical and topological properties studied here i e pore and pore throat sizes pore throat length coordination number are shown to be significantly reduced by the nzvi retention within the columns under study the column porosity reduces in the range of 35 to 37 while permeabilities reduce in the range of 73 to 99 the permeability reduction is more significant for the fine sand 99 compared to the coarse sand 74 in contrast tortuosity does not show a significant increase 1 to 4 fine sand has entrapped the highest number of nps 38 future work should focus on performing 4d 3d time experiments in which a sequence of images is captured during the nzvi injection in porous media a similar study to the work published by pak et al 2020 which uses 4d imaging to study the use of nzvi

1227,people living in the great rift valley in east africa suffer from fluorosis resulting from their consumption of groundwater this paper shows that geogenic fluoride contamination in a natural water system has changed in the last two decades in the mt meru slope area of northern tanzania based on water quality dating of the residence time and stable isotopes of groundwater the results demonstrate that 1 the average recharge altitude of groundwater with a high geogenic fluoride concentration is estimated to range from 1900 m to 3000 m on the southern slope of mt meru and the fluoride concentration tends to increase with an increase in the recharge altitude 2 the fluoride concentration increases with increasing groundwater residence time for groundwater with a residence time of 20 years or longer suggesting that water rock interaction processes weathering dissolution and ion exchange which depend on the contact time between the volcanic aquifer and groundwater have predominated for approximately 20 years or longer and 3 the mixing of aerobic young water and old groundwater has been active for approximately 20 years and the fluoride concentration is increasing in some shallower well waters the mixing of fluoride contaminated groundwater with aerobic water infiltrating the aquifer through pumping groundwater in the last two decades may increase the spread of groundwater contaminated with fluoride due to increased water demand caused by rapid population growth and urbanization industrial growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture keywords fluoride contamination groundwater dating mixing oxygen isotopes mt meru great rift valley east africa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fluoride is one of the most

stadlin et al 2017 kut et al 2016 tanzanian people living in the grv have actively utilized groundwater since the 1960s because of a shortage of surface water which dries up during the dry season as a result they suffer from both dental and skeletal fluorosis the level of fluoride in the groundwater in the grv which averages 4 5 mg l exceeds the upper limit 1 5 mg l prescribed by the who kaseva 2006 kitalika et al 2018 kut et al 2016 mbabaye et al 2018 vuhahula et al 2009 tanzanian national and local governments and communities in villages supply drinking and cooking water to people mainly via groundwater from wells the mt meru watershed mmw and the mt kilimanjaro watershed mkw are the most important headwater areas of the pangani river basin in the northeastern part of tanzania and the shortage of groundwater and its contamination with fluoride are the most serious issues that threaten the water resources in this basin factors affecting the concentration of fluoride in groundwater in africa are complex and the concentration varies depending on local aquifer conditions malago et al 2017 chacha et al 2018a who reported on groundwater age data obtained by application of the radioisotope 14c dating technique and the recharge mechanism of the arusha aquifer northern tanzania concluded that the presence of modern groundwater suggests that shallow aquifers are actively recharged and respond positively to seasonal variations mckenzie et al 2010 reported on the dating of hydrogeologic systems in the kilimanjaro area based on a hydrogeochemical survey that included tritium values these authors concluded that there is a mixture of old groundwater and young surface water in groundwater in the mkw however dating using tritium or 14c is not sufficiently precise to evaluate variations in groundwater residence time in mountain slope areas lugodisha et al 2020 also reported that there is a mixture of old groundwater and young local recharge water in groundwater based on the application of oxygen and hydrogen isotope tracers in the southwestern part of the mmw fig 2 however their research was limited to ngaramtoni small watershed in the mmw did not cover the themi river watershed including the arusha city the capital of arusha region and did not address dating of groundwater mbabaye et al 2018 reported that the fluoride concentration in well water increases exponentially as the depth of the well decreases for wells with a depth of 5 m to 100 m in the eastern part of the mmw meru district in the arusha region malago et al 2017 noted that no study has reported the long term trend of fluoride concentration in water over time in east african regions such as tanzania no previous research has reported on the geogenic release of fluoride into groundwater and its dependence on the length of the contact time between minerals in an aquifer and groundwater based on high precision dating this study aims to demonstrate the effect of groundwater residence time on geogenic fluoride release into a natural groundwater system in an important headwater area in the grv based on high precision dating using sulfur hexafluoride sf6 in groundwater especially groundwater in the southern slope area of mt meru supplying drinking water to arusha city which has a particularly high rate of population growth will be highlighted 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and water sampling the study area is mainly located in the mmw figs 1 4 the geology of which is dominated by volcanic rocks and alluvial sediments chacha et al 2018a as a result of the alkaline volcanism that is widespread throughout the east african rift valley system mbabaye et al 2018 the topography of mt meru is dominated by the volcanic cone of this mountain whose slopes cover most of the area mt meru which is considered to be an active alkaline volcano dormant stratovolcano is composed of ash layers and lava flows i e basaltic to phonolitic and nephelinitic tuff pumice pyroclastic and agglomerate consisting of sand and volcanic rock fragments fig 4 chacha et al 2018a ghiglieri et al 2010 makoba and muzuka 2019 nanyaro et al 1984 vye brown et al 2014 therefore the main aquifer systems are hosted by volcanogenic rock formations ghiglieri et al 2010 reported that lithostratigraphic formations can be grouped into two main hydrogeological units volcanic and sedimentary units the properties of these units normally change toward increasing as related to porosity or permeability relation to recharging etc with time due to weathering subsequent erosion and re deposition chacha et al 2018a makoba and muzuka 2019 nesbitt and young 1984 the groundwaters in volcanic and sedimentary units are dominated by fracture flow and porous media flow respectively fig 4b in the study area the aquifers would be generally classified as phreatic but be confined against some fracture flow since pyroclastics with nephelinitic to phonolitic lavas upstream of the themi nduruma and tengeru rivers figs 4 are generally fractured being the main recharge area both shallow and deep groundwaters flow as fracture flow through the fractures ghiglieri et al 2010 lahars flowing southeast covering most of the tengeru and maji ya chai river watersheds and being fractured and porous are composed of volcanoclastic sediments forming a good aquifer ghiglieri et al 2010 the information from borehole bh1 fig 4a suggests that these formations are permeable enough makoba and muzuka 2019 the groundwater flow will exhibit properties of both fracture flow and porous media flow the mantling ash and alluvial and lacustrine sediments covering most of the themi and nduruma river watersheds fig 4a were reported to be aquifers with low transmissivity due to high clay content ghiglieri et al 2010 makoba and muzuka 2019 ngaramtoni area is covered by mantling ash and pyroclastic with nephelinitic to phonolitic lavas because of the limited stratigraphic and groundwater information in this study area the data on aquifer thickness were not available from the depth of deep wells controlled by the government the thickness of the aquifers is estimated to be over 250 m at the slope area in mmw table 3 and fig 4b since mt meru stratovolcano has a stratified structure in which lava and pyroclastic materials are piled up the groundwater is supposed to flow via lava and pyroclastic layers in the direction along the slope some researchers e g fujimoto et al 2016 frisbee et al 2017 plummer et al 2001 somers and mckenzie 2020 reported the contribution of groundwater to stream flow and or lake the groundwater circulation systems and the mixing of flow paths in high mountain environments in volcanic terrains deep groundwater moves through thick lava and pyroclastic flows the pyroclastic flows atop mt meru will work hydrologically similarly because of the lack of deep geological data and hydraulic potential profile in this area it is difficult to draw groundwater circulation systems shallow and deep groundwater flow paths and possible mixing lines of deep and shallow groundwater however mixing will likely occur in the groundwater discharge areas where the mountain slope changes from a steep slope to a gentle slope in which deep and shallow groundwater flow paths converge therefore it is critical to capture a resume of the groundwater flow system and the groundwater mixing from geochemical data the study area has a tropical climate with dry and wet seasons and the rainfall pattern is bimodal with a short rainy season in november and december and a long rainy season between march may or june july to september is the dry season the mean annual precipitation in the period 1988 2017 is approximately 764 mm at the arusha meteorological station mmw elevation 1372 m approximately 797 mm at the moshi meteorological station mkw elevation 813 m and approximately 506 mm at the kilimanjaro meteorological station mkw elevation 891 m tanzania meteorological agency fig 1 the arusha and moshi monthly average temperatures 1988 2017 vary between 14 8 c and 26 1 c and between 18 4 c and 29 9 c respectively tanzania meteorological agency the arusha and moshi mean annual relative humidity 1988 2017 varies between 66 and 78 and between 57 and 69 respectively tanzania meteorological agency in mmw the river system and wadi are well developed but many rivers dry up during the dry season in contrast a temporary river network and small ponds appear and lowlands and rivers are temporarily flooded especially at the foot of mt meru where the slope of the mountain becomes gentle during the rainy season therefore the groundwater level also decreases in the dry season and rises in the rainy season some shallower wells dry up in the dry season the groundwater well and spring water and river water samples were collected during three separate surveys aiming for the beginning of the rainy season march the end of the rainy season may and the dry season september figs 1 3 tables 1 6 samples were mainly collected from wells themi river watershed that supply drinking water to arusha city the capital of the arusha region where the population is booming and from wells around arusha city and for comparison from wells around moshi city the capital of kilimanjaro region many wells were shallower than 50 m from the surface in rural

and household purposes and supplied by the local governments local communities and villages fig 1 some water was obtained from private wells these data of re sampled and re measured samples are presented in the figures and tables without omission the depth d of wells pumping up groundwater was about 5 to 270 m from the surface tables 1 3 and 5 and fig 5c and most of the wells whose depth d is deeper than 20 m were pumped through a screen near the bottom of the well and the groundwater levels could not be measured because the pit was a closed system in the shallow wells d 20 m wells with a long open hole were rare data for d was obtained in 37 of 56 wells in this survey 2 2 methods 2 2 1 chemical analysis the ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do content and temperature t of the groundwater samples were measured in the field using portable instruments sc82 yokogawa electric co japan d 25 horiba ltd japan the alkalinity was measured in the laboratory on the day of water sampling by titration against 0 02 n or 0 05 n hcl using a mixture of bromocresol green and methyl red bcg mr as the indicator ph 4 8 groundwater samples were flushed through a nylon tube connected to the outlet of the pumping well or inserted into the spring water and were collected after sufficient purging when the monitored ec ph do orp and temperature values were stable approximately 5 to 10 min samples for the determination of chemical composition stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios and 87sr 86sr analyses were filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter and collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles 87sr 86sr isotopic analyses were not carried out for rock samples the groundwater samples for sf6 dating were collected unfiltered and without exposure to air in 500 ml glass bottles as recommended in the international atomic energy agency iaea guidebook busenberg et al 2006 sf6 was measured by purge and trap gas chromatography with an electron capture detector ecd shimadzu japan after pre concentration by cryogenic methods busenberg and plummer 2000 nakaya et al 2015 2018 the 230 to 280 ml for measurement of the 500 ml sample collected in the field was sucked into the bubbler and was degassed by bubbling with ultrapure nitrogen gas 99 99995 and sf6 gas degassed was adsorbed on the adsorbent at 75 c and pre concentrated sf6 gas was sent to ecd after desorption at 95 c a calibration curve was created from six calibration points using standard gas of 5 10 and 15 ppt by sampling 1 ml or 5 ml the detection limit of the sf6 concentrations in groundwater was approximately 0 1 fg kg 0 01 fmol l the major anions including fluoride and the major cations were determined in the laboratory by non suppressed ion chromatography with ic c4 and ic a3 columns shimadzu japan with a detection limit of 0 1 mg l a calibration curve was created from five to six calibration points using standard solutions from 0 1 to 50 mg l for each anion or each cation a calibration curve was created for fluoride detection from the standard solutions of 0 1 0 3 1 3 10 and 30 mg l samples with concentrations higher than the range of the standard curve were diluted with deionized water and analyzed the discrepancy in the ion balance for all samples was 4 83 average 2 02 as the dissolution of fluorite is mostly determined by the solubility

standard deviations n 5 the obtained ratios were normalized to the value of srm 987 87sr 86sr 0 71025 2 2 2 determination of groundwater residence time from sf6 dating tracer by piston flow and exponential mixing models and characteristics of sf6 dating tracer the residence time of the groundwater was determined from the piston flow model pfm and exponential mixing model emm leibundgut et al 2009 using sf6 gas dating busenberg and plummer 2000 based on atmospheric time records of sf6 gas supplementary fig s1a first sf6 in groundwater was converted to atmospheric concentration by henry s law using the recharge temperature and recharge altitude wanninkhof et al 1991 busenberg and plummer 1992 2000 nakaya et al 2018 because henry s constant depends on temperature and pressure elevation in this study the recharge temperature was set to the present average atmospheric temperature at the recharge altitude the elevations were set to the recharge altitudes the recharge altitude was estimated as in section 3 3 1 for all groundwater samples the dating tracer for instance sf6 concentration in the sampled groundwater c t is given by the following convolution integral leibundgut et al 2009 1 c t 0 c i t τ g τ dτ where ci t is the temporal variation of the measured tracer input concentration at time t τ is transit time and g τ is the transit time distribution function g τ are in pfm 2 g τ δ τ t in emm 3 g τ 1 t exp τ t where t is the mean travel time of groundwater that is groundwater residence time grt in this study the relationship between t and sf6 concentration converted to atmospheric concentration is shown in supplementary fig s1b for the cases of pfm and emm for groundwater sampled in 2018 error in grt due to measurement error of sf6 in water is 0 5 years in the case of piston flow the hydraulic head of the new groundwater recharge can induce movement of the old groundwater without mixing when groundwater is sampled along a simple flow path from a well screened in a specific interval by well pumping the grt can be calculated by pfm in this study most wells were well screened in a specific interval the grt in the piston flow model was specifically calculated as the difference between the sampling time and the recharge time measured by applying the converted sf6 concentration in groundwater to the atmospheric concentration record of sf6 for the southern hemisphere atmosphere supplementary fig s1a in which sf6 has been increasing monotonically since 1960 in the case of exponential mixing all of the individual groundwater flow paths are thoroughly mixed when groundwater is sampled along all flow paths from a well with a long open hole by well pumping the groundwater residence time can be calculated by emm in this study a well with a long open hole was rare and limited to shallow wells d 20 m in private houses here the difference between travel time and residence time is referred to e g botter et al 2010 2011 ginn 1999 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 nakaya et al 2018 the grt measured in this paper can be regarded as the exposure time of chemical reaction between recharge and discharge points along a groundwater flow path as defined by ginn 1999 because chemical reactions occur everywhere in the aquifer during groundwater flow nakaya et al 2011 2018 the residence time in this study is also linked to travel times i e the time taken for a particle to move through the control volume from infiltration of the water into the saturated zone of the aquifer to the discharge point in a well or spring botter et al 2011 therefore in flow models for the sf6 dating tracer used in this study grt determined by sf6 equals mean travel time from the viewpoint of chemical reactions during groundwater flows the residence time can be expressed as the response time in water rock interactions botter et al 2010 when the groundwater is in equilibrium with the atmosphere the age based on sf6 dating is zero the air component in the unsaturated zone is the equivalent of the atmospheric component therefore the residence time of water moving through the unsaturated zone cannot be measured when old groundwater with low sf6 concentration comes into contact with the atmosphere or mixes with young water such as rainwater river water and other surface water with high sf6 concentration it becomes rejuvenated and its apparent grt is shortened as a characteristic of sf6 dating tracer therefore even though rejuvenated groundwater has a long travel time and a long response time in water rock interactions botter et al 2010 the apparent grt is estimated to be short due to the contact between groundwater and the atmosphere in other words the sf6 dating tracer has the potential that mixing contact events between groundwater and the rejuvenating unsaturated zone component generated by the wet season in the process of groundwater flow can be detected 2 2 3 estimation method of the recharge altitude of natural water sources using stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in meteoric precipitation are depleted in heavy isotopes 18o and 2h with increasing elevation dansgaard 1964 especially in mountainous areas the stable isotopic ratios of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δd indicate a negative correlation with elevation being called the isotopic altitude effect ambach et al 1968 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 using this isotopic altitude effect the mean recharge altitude of the natural water sources rivers springs wells and reservoirs sampled in the field can be estimated e g poage and chamberlain 2001 yamanaka and yamada 2017 the changes of δ18o with elevation isotopic lapse rate were reported to be for example 0 194 100 m for a global mean bowen 2010 0 21 100 m for the sierra nevada ca ingraham and taylor 1991 0 34 100 m for the andes chile moser et al 1972 0 28 100 m for swiss alps siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 0 14 100 m for central himalaya bahadur 1976 0 10 100 m for mt kilimanjaro tanzania mckenzie et al 2010 0 17 100 m for mt cameroon cameroon fontes and olivry 1976 0 25 100 m for central japan waseda and nakai 1983 nakaya et al 2015 0 28 100 m for osaka basin japan nakaya et al 2009 and 0 28 100 m for most regions of the world poage and chamberlain 2001 there are no data on the isotopic altitude effect of mt meru since mt kilimanjaro 5895 m a s l and mt meru 4566 m a s l are very close a distance of about 70 km to each other both watersheds should show the same isotopic altitude effect therefore applying the isotopic altitude effect relationship between δ18o and altitude for mt kilimanjaro mckenzie et al 2010 to the δ18o of the natural water sources in the mt meru watershed the mean recharge altitudes were estimated in this study 3 results 3 1 water chemistry of fluoride contaminated water this section presents the results of analyses conducted on well spring and river water samples collected in 2018 and 2019 see tables 1 6 and associated figures and clarifies the factors that influence fluoride contamination in the groundwater in the area between arusha in the mmw and moshi in the mkw the fluoride concentration changes markedly at the boundary between the mmw and mkw fig 1 the average fluoride concentration in the water was 0 5 mg l in the mkw samples compared with 5 3 mg l in the mmw samples indicating a higher risk of exposure to fluoride contamination in the mmw water most groundwater and river water samples in the mmw were of the na hco3 type fig 5a tables 1 6 with fluoride concentrations ranging from high 1 5 mg l to extremely high 31 mg l figs 5b and 2 excluding 212 mg l in small momela lake fig 6a in maji ya chai river watershed the extremely high concentration range of fluoride detected and in ngaramtoni and themi river watersheds a high concentration range of fluoride was detected the depth of the well d from the surface becomes shallower toward the east and is shallower than 50 m east of the tengeru river fig 5c namely ngaramtoni area and themi river nduruma river and malala river are the watersheds where deep groundwater flow systems dominate in other words they may be areas where groundwater cannot be obtained unless a well is dug deeply since the elevation of mt meru increases toward the west in particular there are many deep wells in the ngaramtoni area implying that the groundwater level is low especially in the dry season however in the themi river watershed groundwater is also pumped from shallow wells as well as deep wells consisting of both shallow and deep groundwater systems tengeru and maji ya chai rivers will be the watershed where shallow groundwater flow systems dominate and the maji ya chai river watershed likely represents something similar to a high mountain pyroclastic talus slope watershed small and big momela lakes altitude 1400 m upstream of the maji ya chai river contain abnormally high concentrations of fluoride maji ya chai river watershed would be susceptible to upstream lakes influence via lahars in the shallow groundwater flow system e g nanyaro et al 1984 figs 4a and 5c the abnormally high fluoride concentration in surface water especially in small momela lake is due to the evaporative concentration of leachate containing fluoride from mt meru this na hco3 type water with a high fluoride concentration implies that the groundwater had slow flow or a long flow path in areas where interactions occurred between the water and host rocks that are relatively rich in carbon dioxide and fluoride such as the nephelinites and phonolites on mt meru ghiglieri et al 2010 nanyaro et al 1984 the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the mmw increased linearly as the sodium concentration increased and the surface water from small momela lake engare nanyuki river flowing into kenya and headwaters of the maji ya chai river system followed this trend figs 1 2 and 6a the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the mkw also increased linearly with increasing sodium concentration but the slope was gentler than that observed in the mmw fig 6a the correlation between the fluoride and sodium concentrations suggests that the solubility of fluorine increases due to the alkalization of groundwater in alkaline volcanic rocks as shown in fig 3 and tables 2 and 4 samples no 9 table 2 and no 41 table 4 from the same sampling locality from a shallow well d 7 35 m but with different sampling times and no 38 table 4 i e the three groundwater samples 9 41 and 38 of the mkw collected from an agricultural area were of the high nacl type with na and cl molar ratios of 1 1 suggesting that their fluoride originated from anthropogenic or geothermal sources in samples nos 11 and 53 river water in the mmw fig 2 collected from the same sampling locality but at different times sodium and fluoride increased by about 30 in the dry season september compared with in the long rainy season may the 87sr 86sr ratio of the water samples from the mmw and mkw ranged from 0 7037 to 0 7047 suggesting that the volcanic rocks in both watersheds were formed from the same type of magma fig 6b as the carbonatite of the ol doinyo lengai active volcano 87sr 86sr ratio 0 7040 0 7045 bell and tilton 2001 in the grv the opposing relationships between the fluoride concentration and the 87sr 86sr ratio in the mmw and mkw may reflect different sources of fluoride leaching from the geological substrate the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the 87sr 86sr ratio in the themi river watershed indicates that the water can be divided into at least two groups named w and e fig 6b group w is well water distributed on the western side of the themi river watershed while group e is that distributed on the eastern side fig 2 3 2 fluoride release into groundwater in ca na hco3 type groundwater it is well known that sodium increases and calcium decreases with progressive cation exchange reactions due to the smaller exchange coefficient of na ca in the adsorption desorption reaction e g appelo and postma 1999 fig 7a shows that fluoride increased with increasing na na ca values except in the mkw in association with alkalinization via cation exchange the fluoride concentration increases with increasing ph because of anion exchange with the hydroxide ion that has a similar ionic radius as the fluoride ion as an increase in the grt promotes na ca cation exchange f oh exchange to form f enriched water will more likely occur in older and alkaline solutions than in younger and no alkaline solutions fig 7b shows the relationship between the fluoride concentration and ph the fluoride concentration was higher under alkaline ph in the themi river and nduruma river watersheds enhancing the f oh exchange process in these two watersheds the fluoride concentration appears to be divided into two areas at a ph in the vicinity of 7 one with fluoride concentrations higher than approximately 4 mg l and the other with lower concentrations of fluoride encircled regions fig 7b fig 8 shows the relationships between f and ca2 and the saturation index for fluorite sifluorite in all water samples the fluoride concentration was low at high calcium levels fig 8a and the fluoride did not reach saturation for fluorite caf2 at a fluoride concentration of 10 mg l fig 8b as described above fluoride release into the natural water of the mmw is controlled by the progression of na ca cation exchange ph f oh exchange and a decrease in calcium base exchange however these water rock interactions may strongly depend on the grt and the groundwater flow path length gfpl to obtain the grt and gfpl of natural water the recharge altitude of groundwater and river water sources needs to be estimated in general the recharge altitude is the average elevation of the zone where rainwater recharges the watershed including groundwater aquifers we describe the estimation of recharge altitude in the next section 3 3 the relationship between the recharge altitude of natural water sources and the fluoride concentration 3 3 1 estimation of the recharge altitude of natural water sources using stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios δ18o and δd measured from rain and snow shallow groundwater and glacial melt in the mkw by mckenzie et al 2010 were used to estimate the mean recharge altitude of natural water sources wells springs and rivers of the study area fig 9a shows the relationship between δ18o and δd for groundwater spring river lake and rainwater in the mmw and mkw while the isotopic ratios of natural water in the mmw and mkw were distributed reasonably close to the global meteoric water line gmwl when δ18o was more depleted than 3 4 the plots with less depleted δ18o were distributed along a line with a much gentler slope this is caused by the mixing of local meteoric water with water from lakes and or rivers with high evaporation rates in the maji ya chai river watershed figs 1 4 therefore we hypothesize that the isotopic altitude effect of natural water with δ18o 3 4 in the mmw was the same as that in the mkw lugodisha et al 2020 the isotopic altitude effect hest m 1196 754 2δ18o in the mkw was determined from the regression line with a coefficient of determination r2 0 768 of the linear relationship between the sampling altitude and the δ18o of the shallow groundwater and glacial melt at altitudes higher than 1500 m a s l δ18o 3 4 fig 9b mckenzie et al 2010 as shallow groundwater and glacial melt can provide a proxy estimation of this effect mark and mckenzie 2007 based on the above hypothesis this relationship also applies to the mmw to determine the estimated recharge altitude hest of sample water 3 3 2 the relationship between the fluoride concentration and recharge altitude of natural water sources fig 10a and b show the relationships between the fluoride concentration and the 87sr 86sr ratio versus the recharge altitude which was estimated using the isotopic altitude effect of δ18o described above fig 9b mckenzie et al 2010 the fluoride concentration increased and the 87sr 86sr ratio decreased with increasing recharge altitude in the mmw fig 10a can be understood as follows as the recharge altitude increases the groundwater flow path and residence time from the recharge area to the discharge point tend to be longer indicating longer contact time between water and rock this will promote more leaching of fluoride by chemical weathering along groundwater flow paths fig 10b also shows two groups of water which are the same groups w and e distinguished by the relationship between the fluoride concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio in the themi river watershed fig 6b the two groups have different water flow paths from high to low altitudes as described in section 3 1 because there was a large difference in the 87sr 86sr ratio in water originating from high altitudes although these wells in the themi river watershed are located at approximately 1310 m to 1500 m a s l tables 1 3 and 5 the average recharge altitude was estimated to range from 1900 m to 2800 m based on the isotopic altitude effect fig 9b after all the two groups w and e in the themi river watershed are not significantly different other than the stratigraphic differences volcanic ash and pyroclastic layers are distributed around the recharge area above 1900 m a s l ghiglieri et al 2010 makoba and muzuka 2019 figs 2 and 4 and a volcanic ash cone is present in the crater of mt meru chacha et al 2018a vye brown et al 2014 thus based on the relationships shown in figs 10a and 2 the high groundwater fluoride contamination would be caused by leaching along the groundwater flow path starting from the volcanic ash and or pyroclastic layers e g bosshard stadlin et al 2017 makoba and muzuka 2019 nuccio 2016 moreover considering the relationship between the 87sr 86sr ratio and the recharge altitude fig 10b the groundwater flow path for group e runs through various strata indicating various 87sr 86sr values of 0 7041 0 7046 while the groundwater flow path for group w runs through almost a single stratum indicating an 87sr 86sr value of 0 70444 figs 1 4 3 4 the distribution of the grt according to the value of high precision sf6 age data t6a in tables 2 4 and 6 and table 8 most groundwater was estimated to have a residence time determined by pfm between two and forty years except for four samples that were at least 50 years old because sf6 gas is not detected with our sf6 dating system with a measurement limit of 50 years and because sf6 in the atmosphere is practically undetectable before 1960 fig s1a tables 8 and 9 show the grts determined by pfm and emm and parameters related to grt by watershed the supplementary fig s2 shows the relationship between grts by pfm and emm for collected groundwater samples both are in a monotonic curve relationship and when grt exceeds 10 years grt by emm is longer than pfm and the gap between the two widens especially when grt exceeds 20 years tables 8 and 9 show the grts determined by pfm and emm and parameters related to grt by watershed the supplementary fig s2 shows the relationship between grts by pfm and emm for collected groundwater samples both are in a monotonic curve relationship and when grt exceeds 10 years grt by emm is longer than pfm and the gap between the two widens especially when grt exceeds 20 years as described in section 2 1 most of the wells were pumped through a screen near the bottom of the well in this case as described in section 2 2 2 pfm is better than emm for estimating mean grt below the results are therefore organized using the grt determined by the pfm when water with high sf6 concentration young groundwater and water with low sf6 concentration old groundwater are mixed the sf6 concentration of mixed water depends on its mixing ratio in this study the apparent grt of the mixed groundwater was estimated by using pfm from the sf6 concentration of the mixed groundwater however regarding the relationships between grt and other parameters the trends were the same for both pfm and emm because both grts are in a monotonic curve relationship supplementary fig s2 as described in section 2 1 most of the wells were pumped through a screen near the bottom of the well in this case as described in section 2 2 2 pfm is better than emm for estimating mean grt below the results are therefore organized using the grt determined by the pfm when water with high sf6 concentration young groundwater and water with low sf6 concentration old groundwater are mixed the sf6 concentration of mixed water depends on its mixing ratio in this study the apparent grt of the mixed groundwater was estimated by using pfm from the sf6 concentration of the mixed groundwater however regarding the relationships between grt and other parameters the trends were the same for both pfm and emm because both grts are in a monotonic curve relationship supplementary fig s2 table 9 shows the range of grts by pfm and emm divided by watershed and the grt at each range of well depth d in the south of mt meru the grt tends to be longer in the west watersheds and shorter in the east watersheds this trend may be related to the distribution of well depth because many wells on the west side are deeper than 50 m while many wells on the east side are shallower than 50 m in mmw fig 5c although the grt tends to increase as the well is deeper in nduruma river watershed the trend is not clear in themi ngaramtoni malala tengel and maji ya chai river watersheds and mkw table 9 the samples recollected in the field at different times and remeasured can be compared for seasonal differences in grt in table 8 the sample numbers are shown by dividing the sampling periods the sample nos 1 14 were at the end of the rainy season may 2018 nos 15 57 were at the end of the dry season sep 2018 and nos 58 76 were at the beginning of the rainy season march 2019 for pairs 1 and 45 9 and 41 and 12 and 50 which are shallow wells or springs the grt tends to decrease significantly from the rainy season to the dry season while for pairs 7 and 36 8 and 42 and 14 and 49 which are deep wells the grt tends to increase slightly from the rainy season to the dry season when the groundwater level drops significantly from the rainy season to the dry season in this study area water that is in contact with the atmosphere or atmosphere easily tends to infiltrate into groundwater e g darling et al 2012 the trend will be even stronger in pumping wells therefore in that case rejuvenation of the age of well water can occur based on sf6 dating as described in 2 2 2 on the other hand there could be various reasons for the aging of wells during the dry season 3 5 the relationship between the grt and groundwater fluoride contamination as described in section 3 3 2 the high groundwater fluoride contamination would be caused by leaching along the groundwater flow path fluoride concentration will be strongly influenced by groundwater flow path length gfpl and grt gfpl and grt should also be correlated for a small watershed the difference hest h between the estimated recharge altitude hest and the sampling altitude h is a strong measure of gfpl and the deeper the well the longer the gfpl will be fig 11a b and c show the relationships between the hest h the well depth the grt determined from pfm and fluoride concentration respectively the hest h tends to become longer as the well depth d increases focusing on the themi river watershed where there is a lot of data for d and hest h is over 450 m even at shallow wells d 20 m fig 8a longer hest h leads to longer grt in groups with grt longer than 20 years of themi river watershed and in mkw fig 11b this correlation represents a normal physical relationship however in themi river watershed when the grt is shorter than 20 years the shorter the grt the longer the hest h tends to be suggesting that something unusual is happening to groundwater flows in ngaramtoni small watershed the relationship between hest h and grt is unclear fluoride concentration increases as hest h become longer in themi river nduruma river malala river and ngaramtoni watersheds fig 11c however in themi river watershed both plots have a somewhat large scatter in ngaramtoni watershed the relationship between fluoride concentration and hest h is divided into two groups the ratio of fluoride concentration to hest h the slope on the graph of fig 11c suggesting the degree of fluoride dissolution along the groundwater flow path is watershed dependent fig 11d e and f show the relationships between the fluoride concentration and the grt determined from pfm and do 0 06 9 99 mg l considering the complex behavior of grt in the themi river watershed the results for the groundwater samples collected from the themi river watershed are grouped into three symbols circles filled with red and blue and blue plus symbols the circles filled with red indicate groundwater groups with grt longer than 20 years the circles filled with blue indicate groundwater groups with grt shorter than 20 years and do larger than 3 4 mg l and those with blue plus symbols indicate groups other than the groups of circles filled with red and blue in the themi river watershed in the groundwater samples collected from the nduruma river watershed the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt fig 11d while the fluoride concentration fluctuated in the range of 1 5 3 5 mg l regardless of the do content except for samples with a do content of 0 07 0 09 mg l fig 11e in the themi river watershed the trend of the fluoride concentration against the grt and do content changed at a grt of about 20 years fig 11d and at a do of 3 4 mg l fig 11e the trend of do content decreasing with increasing grt also changed somewhat at a grt of about 20 years fig 11f the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt and decreasing do content for the older water samples circles filled with red in fig 11d and e and it increased with decreasing residence time and increasing do content with a correlation coefficient r 0 940 for the younger water samples circles filled with blue in fig 11d and e in the ngaramtoni small watershed in the mmw the fluoride concentration was not linearly related to the grt fig 11d while the fluoride concentration increased with increasing do content r 0 781 fig 11e however no clear and linear relationship was found between do content and grt in the ngaramtoni watershed fig 11f these results suggest that the infiltration of recent aerobic groundwater into an aquifer is another factor that can affect the fluoride concentration in addition to fluoride dissolution associated with alkalinization these mechanisms are discussed in the following section 4 discussion as shown in fig 12 groundwater samples from the themi river watershed circles filled with red or blue were categorized into groups a and b which exhibited different relationships between the fluoride and do contents residence time and recharge altitude the main difference between groups a and b is that they have a grt older than or younger than 18 20 years fig 12a table 7 1 here older younger and mixed groundwaters are described as groups a b and ab group a groundwater samples were older than 18 years and the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt chemical weathering i e mineral decomposition and dissolution and the resulting ion exchange in aquifers due to a long grt predominated in group a fig 12a since fluoride leaching progressed under low do conditions fig 12a b and c group b groundwater samples were younger than those of group a and the fluoride concentration increased with decreasing grt group b also had higher fluoride concentrations in the water samples with higher do concentrations and the relationship between do and grt fig 12b indicated that the do content was high higher than 3 4 mg l in the last two decades the do content decreased with increasing grt during these decades likely due to microbial activity and chemical weathering in the aquifer therefore in the last two decades fluoride leaching has probably been promoted by the active infiltration of aerobic water fig 12c this mechanism may be explained by fluoride leaching from weathering reaction from fluoride bearing minerals in oxic recharge water e g chae et al 2006 singh and mukherjee 2014 however for groundwater samples no 18 22 23 and 24 outside of groups a and b the mechanism of fluoride leaching into groundwater is complex to simplify the explanation here the older and younger endmembers of group a are represented by et1 and et2 respectively and et3 represents an endmember of groundwater that rejuvenates old water group a by entraining the atmosphere as described below table 7 2 the group b results can be explained by mixing with et2 and et3 as endmembers fig 12a and c similarly groundwater samples no 22 23 and 24 outside groups a and b group ab can be explained by mixing group a and b samples with et1 et2 and et3 as endmembers tables 7 1 and 7 2 as the youngest groundwater samples of et3 indicated a high fluoride concentration 5 6 5 mg l high recharge altitude 2600 2800 m a s l in fig 12d and high do content 10 mg l it is natural that their grt decreased and that their fluoride concentration was diluted due to the mixing of the atmospheric low fluoride concentrations in young water and high fluoride concentrations 6 5 mg l in old groundwater group a the reason for this is that the current atmosphere contains a large amount of oxygen and sf6 gas aging tracer in this study and the old groundwater should have a higher fluoride concentration than that of et3 the mechanism of rejuvenation related to grt is also described in section 2 2 2 the situation in which well water like et3 is formed is considered as follows since the et3 groundwater with high fluoride 5 6 5 mgf l has a do of 10 mg l in the range that is in contact with the atmosphere the groundwater is in an oxidizing condition for example when the groundwater level drops significantly from the rainy season to the dry season due to overpumping of the aquifer and seasonal fluctuation in water table elevation the atmosphere with high sf6 should be entrained into groundwater with surface water in water pumping in some deep wells e g darling et al 2012 the atmospheric component is the equivalent of the unsaturated zone component in this situation the age of old groundwater with high fluoride rejuvenates based on sf6 dating tracer resulting in groundwater like et3 some springs in mountain slope areas also can rejuvenate based on sf6 dating tracer due to seasonal fluctuations in groundwater table elevation e g darling et al 2012 mosquera et al 2020 groundwater samples from the nduruma river watershed blue squares can also be explained by mixing with en1 en2 en3 and en4 as endmembers table 7 2 where en1 represents the oldest groundwater with the highest fluoride in the nduruma river watershed en2 represents rainwater with no fluoride and a high do content of approximately 10 mg l en3 represents a high recharge altitude fig 12d a high do content would occur through the same process as that observed for et3 and en4 represents the focus connecting the three endmembers en1 en2 and en3 fig 12a and c as described in section 3 3 considering the relationship of the 87sr 86sr ratio versus the recharge altitude fig 12d the groundwater flow path for samples in groups a and b runs through various strata indicating variable 87sr 86sr values 0 7042 0 7046 according to the geological map and section in fig 4a and b makoba and muzuka 2019 the recharge zone 1900 2800 m elevation fig 12d for the samples in the themi river watershed figs 1 and 2 are in a pyroclastic layer with nephelinitic to phonolitic lava and a generally fractured formation constituting the potential aquifer in the mmw ghiglieri et al 2010 the groundwater for the samples in the themi river watershed flows through mantling ash and reddish brown soil layers via the pyroclastic layer with nephelinitic to phonolitic lava figs 1 4 and 12d in general volcanic ash is vulnerable to weathering because the specific surface area of the particles in volcanic ash is large as this ash consists of fine particles and because volcanic ash is vitreous and metastable suggesting that the mantling ash layer upstream of the reddish brown soil layer may play an important role in fluoride leaching in the mt meru slope area there are reports that old groundwater is mixed with young water in the mmw and mkw lugodisha et al 2020 mckenzie et al 2010 lugodisha et al 2020 also suggested that the low altitude groundwater in the ngaramtoni and arusha areas figs 1 4 originates from high altitude and local recharge sources with negligible fluoride contents on the southwestern slopes of mt meru in this study the relationships of the fluoride concentration versus grt do and recharge altitude in the themi river watershed fig 12 represent the mixing of aerobic groundwater et3 which is formed by the mixing of the atmospheric young water with a low fluoride concentration and the old groundwater of group a thus the mixing of aerobic groundwater and old groundwater group a has been active for approximately the last 20 years this mixing phenomenon is caused by pumping and groundwater equivalent to et3 can therefore occur everywhere in the watershed around the wells in areas of over pumping although the apparent grt of mixed groundwater is determined by pfm from the sf6 concentration it will be between the piston flow model age and the exponential mixing model leibundgut et al 2009 age the difference in the grt determined from the pfm and emm was 1 1 1 1 years average and standard deviation for grt

and 13b were influenced by geology or mixing with higher na and low f groundwater mbabaye et al 2018 reported that the fluoride concentration in well water increased exponentially from approximately 2 mg l to 32 mg l as the depth of the well decreased for 41 wells with depths of 5 m to 100 m in the southeastern part of the mmw meru district in the arusha region the fluoride concentration often increased sharply at a well depth shallower than 20 m from approximately 5 mg l to 32 mg l these authors also suggested that deep wells i e 50 m contain aquifer water with a low fluoride concentration fig 14 shows the distribution of fluoride concentration in groundwater grouped by well depth d and groundwater residence time grt in mmw in wells shallower than 50 m and wells deeper than 100 m more than half of the wells show fluoride concentrations above 4 mg l therefore fluoride concentration in deep wells i e 50 m is not necessarily low in mmw wells shallower than 50 m often have high fluoride concentrations exceeding 9 mg l strongly reflecting the influence of the maji ya chai river watershed which has extremely high fluoride contamination in wells shallower than 50 m figs 5b c and 11a in addition the grt of most wells is shorter than 10 years in maji ya chai river watershed fig 11a and b and in mmw 75 of wells with grt longer than 20 years show fluoride in the very high concentration range the relationship between the fluoride concentration and well depth between 10 m and 200 m from the surface fig 5b and c is shown divided into groups a b and ab table 7 1 for groundwater in the themi river watershed in fig 13c in group a the fluoride concentration in well water tended to increase as the depth of the well increased this occurred because the deeper the well the longer the grt figs 13c and 12 and the longer the contact time between rock and water in this study thus the fluoride concentration in well water naturally increases as the depth of the well increases however in the groundwater group b and the groundwater group ab mixed with group a and group b for this watershed the fluoride concentration in well water tended to increase as the depth of the well decreased the relationships for the groundwater group b and ab in the themi river watershedagreet with those for the meru district in the arusha region mbabaye et al 2018 in contrast to those observed for group a the relationship between the measured fluoride concentration and wells with a depth of 5 m to 100 m in the meru district in the arusha region mbabaye et al 2018 can be explained by the same formation process of the groundwater group b and the group ab mixed with group a and group b therefore the increased mixing of aerobic groundwater and old groundwater group a in the last 20 years has increased the fluoride concentration compared to groundwater group a without mixing in some shallower wells 100 m depth as indicated by the upward arrow in fig 13c and conversely the fluoride concentration of groundwaters has been diluted in some deeper wells 100 m depth as indicated by the downward arrow in fig 13c the population in arusha national bureau of statistics tanzania 2019 https www citypopulation de en tanzania admin 02arusha the capital city of the arusha region figs 1 and 2 increased drastically over a 25 year period from 102 540 in 1988 to 416 442 in 2012 this has resulted in a large increase in water demand which has resulted in the lowering of groundwater levels due to the over pumping of well water especially during the dry season the arusha urban water supply and sewerage authority auwsa reported that the present well yield is much lower than the initial well yield for all deep wells drilled by the government from 1968 to 1992 arusha urban water supply and sanitation authority 2019 http www auwsa go tz en services category water sources chacha et al 2018a pointed out that previous studies reported a decrease in borehole yields and subsequently a decline in groundwater levels in this area and attributed this to rapid urbanization industrial growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture that has escalated the water demand thus the well water that is managed by the government and transported to the arusha city area is beginning to be depleted chacha et al 2018b also reported that the continuous abstraction of groundwater from arusha aquifers in northern tanzania has resulted in a decline in water as the well water level drops toward the level of the screen for pumping well water the wells in the shallower aquifers will draw in old groundwater with high fluoride levels and the wells in the deeper aquifers will draw in younger groundwater with low fluoride levels as a result of this mixing process with young aerobic water the fluoride concentration of shallower wells will increase therefore the increase in water demand due to population growth will result in higher fluoride concentrations in the groundwater the leaching mechanism of fluoride in the groundwater around arusha can occur in any heavily populated urban area in the grv 5 conclusions this study focused on recent geogenic fluoride release exceeding the world health organization s upper limit for groundwater used for drinking purposes in relation to the water cycle on the southern slope of mt meru in the great rift valley east africa the following conclusions were drawn 1 the average recharge altitude of groundwater with a high geogenic fluoride concentration is estimated to range from 1900 m to 3000 m on the southern slope of mt meru and the fluoride concentration in wells tends to increase with an increase in the recharge altitude 2 the results demonstrate that the mixing of aerobic young water and old groundwater has been active for approximately the last 20 years and the fluoride concentration is increasing in some shallower wells 3 two trends denoted a and b separated by a residence time of about 20 years describe the relationship between the groundwater residence time grt and fluoride concentration in trend a grt longer than approximately 20 years the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt while in group b grt shorter than approximately 20 years the fluoride concentration increased with increasing dissolved oxygen do 4 in trend a group a mostly representing deeper water a longer contact time between the groundwater and the volcanic aquifer increased the fluoride concentration and fluoride leaching due to water rock interactions weathering dissolution and ion exchange depending on the groundwater residence time 5 in trend b mixing aerobic high fluoride rejuvenated groundwater by infiltration with water in the unsaturated zone and surface water as well as old groundwater by pumping changed the fluoride concentration in some wells in the most recent 20 years 6 groundwaters formed by mixing groups a and b are also increasing fluoride levels in shallow wells the relationship between the grt and fluoride concentration suggests that a rapid increase in the demand for well water due to population growth and urbanization has accelerated the recharge of surface water as well as water with a high do content and promoted fluoride contamination through the mixing of well water further studies should include investigating anthropogenic effects on

1227,people living in the great rift valley in east africa suffer from fluorosis resulting from their consumption of groundwater this paper shows that geogenic fluoride contamination in a natural water system has changed in the last two decades in the mt meru slope area of northern tanzania based on water quality dating of the residence time and stable isotopes of groundwater the results demonstrate that 1 the average recharge altitude of groundwater with a high geogenic fluoride concentration is estimated to range from 1900 m to 3000 m on the southern slope of mt meru and the fluoride concentration tends to increase with an increase in the recharge altitude 2 the fluoride concentration increases with increasing groundwater residence time for groundwater with a residence time of 20 years or longer suggesting that water rock interaction processes weathering dissolution and ion exchange which depend on the contact time between the volcanic aquifer and groundwater have predominated for approximately 20 years or longer and 3 the mixing of aerobic young water and old groundwater has been active for approximately 20 years and the fluoride concentration is increasing in some shallower well waters the mixing of fluoride contaminated groundwater with aerobic water infiltrating the aquifer through pumping groundwater in the last two decades may increase the spread of groundwater contaminated with fluoride due to increased water demand caused by rapid population growth and urbanization industrial growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture keywords fluoride

africa groundwater with a very high level of fluoride concentration has been found in a part of the great rift valley grv africa extending from the jordan valley down through sudan ethiopia uganda and kenya to tanzania ali et al 2016 in the grv in east africa fig 1 fluoride contamination occurs widely in natural water systems and is associated with alkaline volcanic rocks and ash e g bosshard stadlin et al 2017 kut et al 2016 tanzanian people living in the grv have actively utilized groundwater since the 1960s because of a shortage of surface water which dries up during the dry season as a result they suffer from both dental and skeletal fluorosis the level of fluoride in the groundwater in the grv which averages 4 5 mg l exceeds the upper limit 1 5 mg l prescribed by the who kaseva 2006 kitalika et al 2018 kut et al 2016 mbabaye et al 2018 vuhahula et al 2009 tanzanian national and local governments and communities in villages supply drinking and cooking water to people mainly via groundwater from wells the mt meru watershed mmw and the mt kilimanjaro watershed mkw are the most important headwater areas of the pangani river basin in the northeastern part of tanzania and the shortage of groundwater and its contamination with fluoride are the most serious issues that threaten the water resources in this basin factors affecting the concentration of fluoride in groundwater in africa are complex and the concentration varies depending on local aquifer conditions malago et al 2017 chacha et al 2018a who reported on groundwater age data obtained by application of the radioisotope 14c dating technique and the recharge mechanism of the arusha aquifer northern tanzania concluded that the presence of modern groundwater suggests that shallow aquifers are actively recharged and respond positively to seasonal variations mckenzie et al 2010 reported on the dating of hydrogeologic systems in the kilimanjaro area based on a hydrogeochemical survey that included tritium values these authors concluded that there is a mixture of old groundwater and young surface water in groundwater in the mkw however dating using tritium or 14c is not sufficiently precise to evaluate variations in groundwater residence time in mountain slope areas lugodisha et al 2020 also reported that there is a mixture of old groundwater and young local recharge water in groundwater based on the application of oxygen and hydrogen isotope tracers in the southwestern part of the mmw fig 2 however their research was limited to ngaramtoni small watershed in the mmw did not cover the themi river watershed including the arusha city the capital of arusha region and did not address dating of groundwater mbabaye et al 2018 reported that the fluoride concentration in well water increases exponentially as the depth of the well decreases for wells with a depth of 5 m to 100 m in the eastern part of the mmw meru district in the arusha region malago et al 2017 noted that no study has reported the long term trend of fluoride concentration in water over time in east african regions such as tanzania no previous research has reported on the geogenic release of fluoride into groundwater and its dependence on the length of the contact time between minerals in an aquifer and groundwater based on high precision dating this study aims to demonstrate the effect of groundwater residence time on geogenic fluoride release into a natural groundwater system in an important headwater area in the grv based on high precision dating using sulfur hexafluoride sf6 in groundwater especially groundwater in the southern slope area of mt meru supplying drinking water to arusha city which has a particularly high rate of population growth will be highlighted 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and water sampling the study area is mainly located in the mmw figs 1 4 the geology of which is dominated by volcanic rocks and alluvial sediments chacha et al 2018a as a result of the alkaline volcanism that is widespread throughout the east african rift valley system mbabaye et al 2018 the topography of mt meru is dominated by the volcanic cone of this mountain whose slopes cover most of the area mt meru which is considered to be an active alkaline volcano dormant stratovolcano is composed of ash layers and lava flows i e basaltic to phonolitic and nephelinitic tuff pumice pyroclastic and agglomerate consisting of sand and volcanic rock fragments fig 4 chacha et al 2018a ghiglieri et al 2010 makoba and muzuka 2019 nanyaro et al 1984 vye brown et al 2014 therefore the main aquifer systems are hosted by volcanogenic rock formations ghiglieri et al 2010 reported that lithostratigraphic formations can be grouped into two main hydrogeological units volcanic and sedimentary units the properties of these units normally change toward increasing as related to porosity or permeability relation to recharging etc with time due to weathering subsequent erosion and re deposition chacha et al 2018a makoba and muzuka 2019 nesbitt and young 1984 the groundwaters in volcanic and sedimentary units are dominated by fracture flow and porous media flow respectively fig 4b in the study area the aquifers would be generally classified as phreatic but be confined against some fracture flow since pyroclastics with nephelinitic to phonolitic lavas upstream of the themi nduruma and tengeru rivers figs 4 are generally fractured being the main recharge area both shallow and deep groundwaters flow as fracture flow through the fractures ghiglieri et al 2010 lahars flowing southeast covering most of the tengeru and maji ya chai river watersheds and being fractured and porous are composed of volcanoclastic sediments forming a good aquifer ghiglieri et al 2010 the information from borehole bh1 fig 4a suggests that these formations are permeable enough makoba and muzuka 2019 the groundwater flow will exhibit properties of both fracture flow and porous media flow the mantling ash and alluvial and lacustrine sediments covering most of the themi and nduruma river watersheds fig 4a were reported to be aquifers with low transmissivity due to high clay content ghiglieri et al 2010 makoba and muzuka 2019 ngaramtoni area is covered by mantling ash and pyroclastic with nephelinitic to phonolitic lavas because of the limited stratigraphic and groundwater information in this study area the data on aquifer thickness were not available from the depth of deep wells controlled by the government the thickness of the aquifers is estimated to be over 250 m at the slope area in mmw table 3 and fig 4b since mt meru stratovolcano has a stratified structure in which lava and pyroclastic materials are piled up the groundwater is supposed to flow via lava and pyroclastic layers in the direction along the slope some researchers e g fujimoto et al 2016 frisbee et al 2017 plummer et al 2001 somers and mckenzie 2020 reported the contribution of groundwater to stream flow and or lake the groundwater circulation systems and the mixing of flow paths in high mountain environments in volcanic terrains deep groundwater moves through thick lava and pyroclastic flows the pyroclastic flows atop mt meru will work hydrologically similarly because of the lack of deep geological data and hydraulic potential profile in this area it is difficult to draw groundwater circulation systems shallow and deep groundwater flow paths and possible mixing lines of deep and shallow groundwater however mixing will likely occur in the groundwater discharge areas where the mountain slope changes from a steep slope to a gentle slope in which deep and shallow groundwater flow paths converge therefore it is critical to capture a resume of the groundwater flow system and the groundwater mixing from geochemical data the study area has a tropical climate with dry and wet seasons and the rainfall pattern is bimodal with a short rainy season in november and december and a long rainy season between march may or june july to september is the dry season the mean annual precipitation in the period 1988 2017 is approximately 764 mm at the arusha meteorological station mmw elevation 1372 m approximately 797 mm at the moshi meteorological station mkw elevation 813 m and approximately 506 mm at the kilimanjaro meteorological station mkw elevation 891 m tanzania meteorological agency fig 1 the arusha and moshi monthly average temperatures 1988 2017 vary between 14 8 c and 26 1 c and between 18 4 c and 29 9 c respectively tanzania meteorological agency the arusha and moshi mean annual relative humidity 1988 2017 varies between 66 and 78 and between 57 and 69 respectively tanzania meteorological agency in mmw the river system and wadi are well developed but many rivers dry up during the dry season in contrast a temporary river network and small ponds appear and lowlands and rivers are temporarily flooded especially at the foot of mt meru where the slope of the mountain becomes gentle during the rainy season therefore the groundwater level also decreases in the dry season and rises in the rainy season some shallower wells dry up in the dry season the groundwater well and spring water and river water samples were collected during three separate surveys aiming for the beginning of the rainy season march the end of the rainy season may and the dry season september figs 1 3 tables 1 6 samples were mainly collected from wells themi river watershed that supply drinking water to arusha city the capital of the arusha region where the population is booming and from wells around arusha city and for comparison from wells around moshi city the capital of kilimanjaro region many wells were shallower than 50 m from the surface in rural

and household purposes and supplied by the local governments local communities and villages fig 1 some water was obtained from private wells these data of re sampled and re measured samples are presented in the figures and tables without omission the depth d of wells pumping up groundwater was about 5 to 270 m from the surface tables 1 3 and 5 and fig 5c and most of the wells whose depth d is deeper than 20 m were pumped through a screen near the bottom of the well and the groundwater levels could not be measured because the pit was a closed system in the shallow wells d 20 m wells with a long open hole were rare data for d was obtained in 37 of 56 wells in this survey 2 2 methods 2 2 1 chemical analysis the ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do content and temperature t of the groundwater samples were measured in the field using portable instruments sc82 yokogawa electric co japan d 25 horiba ltd japan the alkalinity was measured in the laboratory on the day of water sampling by titration against 0 02 n or 0 05 n hcl using a mixture of bromocresol green and methyl red bcg mr as the indicator ph 4 8 groundwater samples were flushed through a nylon tube connected to the outlet of the pumping well or inserted into the spring water and were collected after sufficient purging when the monitored ec ph do orp and temperature

membrane filter and collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles 87sr 86sr isotopic analyses were not carried out for rock samples the groundwater samples for sf6 dating were collected unfiltered and without exposure to air in 500 ml glass bottles as recommended in the international atomic energy agency iaea guidebook busenberg et al 2006 sf6 was measured by purge and trap gas chromatography with an electron capture detector ecd shimadzu japan after pre concentration by cryogenic methods busenberg and plummer 2000 nakaya et al 2015 2018 the 230 to 280 ml for measurement of the 500 ml sample collected in the field was sucked into the bubbler and was degassed by bubbling with ultrapure nitrogen gas 99 99995 and sf6 gas degassed was adsorbed on the adsorbent at 75 c and pre concentrated sf6 gas was sent to ecd after desorption at 95 c a calibration curve was created from six calibration points using standard gas of 5 10 and 15 ppt by sampling 1 ml or 5 ml the detection limit of the sf6 concentrations in groundwater was approximately 0 1 fg kg 0 01 fmol l the major anions including fluoride and the major cations were determined in the laboratory by non suppressed ion chromatography with ic c4 and ic a3 columns shimadzu japan with a detection limit of 0 1 mg l a calibration curve was created from five to six calibration points using standard solutions from 0 1 to 50 mg l for each anion or each cation a calibration curve was created for fluoride detection from the standard solutions of 0 1 0 3 1 3 10 and 30 mg l samples with concentrations higher than the range of the standard curve were diluted with deionized water and analyzed the discrepancy in the ion balance for all samples was 4 83 average 2 02 as the dissolution of fluorite is mostly determined by the solubility

standard deviations n 5 the obtained ratios were normalized to the value of srm 987 87sr 86sr 0 71025 2 2 2 determination of groundwater residence time from sf6 dating tracer by piston flow and exponential mixing models and characteristics of sf6 dating tracer the residence time of the groundwater was determined from the piston flow model pfm and exponential mixing model emm leibundgut et al 2009 using sf6 gas dating busenberg and plummer 2000 based on atmospheric time records of sf6 gas supplementary fig s1a first sf6 in groundwater was converted to atmospheric concentration by henry s law using the recharge temperature and recharge altitude wanninkhof et al 1991 busenberg and plummer 1992 2000 nakaya et al 2018 because henry s constant depends on temperature and pressure elevation in this study the recharge temperature was set to the present average atmospheric temperature at the recharge altitude the elevations were set to the recharge altitudes the recharge altitude was estimated as in section 3 3 1 for all groundwater samples the dating tracer for instance sf6 concentration in the sampled groundwater c t is given by the following convolution integral leibundgut et al 2009 1 c t 0 c i t τ g τ dτ where ci t is the temporal variation of the measured tracer input concentration at time t τ is transit time and g τ is the transit time distribution function g τ are in pfm 2 g τ δ τ t in emm 3 g τ 1 t exp τ t where t is the mean travel time of groundwater that is groundwater residence time grt in this study the relationship between t and sf6 concentration converted to atmospheric concentration is shown in supplementary fig s1b for the cases of pfm and emm for groundwater sampled in 2018 error in grt due to measurement error of sf6 in water is 0 5 years in the case of piston flow the hydraulic head of the new groundwater recharge can induce movement of the old groundwater without mixing when groundwater is sampled along a simple flow path from a well screened in a specific interval by well pumping the grt can be calculated by pfm in this study most wells were well screened in a specific interval the grt in the piston flow model was specifically calculated as the difference between the sampling time and the recharge time measured by applying the converted sf6 concentration in groundwater to the atmospheric concentration record of sf6 for the southern hemisphere atmosphere supplementary fig s1a in which sf6 has been increasing monotonically since 1960 in the case of exponential mixing all of the individual groundwater flow paths are thoroughly mixed when groundwater is sampled along all flow paths from a well with a long open hole by well pumping the groundwater residence time can be calculated by emm in this study a well with a long open hole was rare and limited to shallow wells d 20 m in private houses here the difference between travel time and residence time is referred to e g botter et al 2010 2011 ginn 1999 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 nakaya et al 2018 the grt measured in this paper can be regarded as the exposure time of chemical reaction between recharge and discharge points along a groundwater flow path as defined by ginn 1999 because chemical reactions occur everywhere in the aquifer during groundwater flow nakaya et al 2011 2018 the residence time in this study is also linked to travel times i e the time taken for a particle to move through the control volume from infiltration of the water into the saturated zone of the aquifer to the discharge point in a well or spring botter et al 2011 therefore in flow models for the sf6 dating tracer used in this study grt determined by sf6 equals mean travel time from the viewpoint of chemical reactions during groundwater flows the residence time can be expressed as the response time in water rock interactions botter et al 2010 when the groundwater is in equilibrium with the atmosphere the age based on sf6 dating is zero the air component in the unsaturated zone is the equivalent of the atmospheric component therefore the residence time of water moving through the unsaturated zone cannot be measured when old groundwater with low sf6 concentration comes into contact with the atmosphere or mixes with young water such as rainwater river water and other surface water with high sf6 concentration it becomes rejuvenated and its apparent grt is shortened as a characteristic of sf6 dating tracer therefore even though rejuvenated groundwater has a long travel time and a long response time in water rock interactions botter et al 2010 the apparent grt is estimated to be short due to the contact between groundwater and the atmosphere in other words the sf6 dating tracer has the potential that mixing contact events between groundwater and the rejuvenating unsaturated zone component generated by the wet season in the process of groundwater flow can be detected 2 2 3 estimation method of the recharge altitude of natural water sources using stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in meteoric precipitation are depleted in heavy isotopes 18o and 2h with increasing elevation dansgaard 1964 especially in mountainous areas the stable isotopic ratios of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δd indicate a negative correlation with elevation being called the isotopic altitude effect ambach et al 1968 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 using this isotopic altitude effect the mean recharge altitude of the natural water sources rivers springs wells and reservoirs sampled in the field can be estimated e g poage and chamberlain 2001 yamanaka and yamada 2017 the changes of δ18o with elevation isotopic lapse rate were reported to be for example 0 194 100 m for a global mean bowen 2010 0 21 100 m for the sierra nevada ca ingraham and taylor 1991 0 34 100 m for the andes chile moser et al 1972 0 28 100 m for swiss alps siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 0 14 100 m for central himalaya bahadur 1976 0 10 100 m for mt kilimanjaro tanzania mckenzie et al 2010 0 17 100 m for mt cameroon cameroon fontes and olivry 1976 0 25 100 m for central japan waseda and nakai 1983 nakaya et al 2015 0 28 100 m for osaka basin japan nakaya et al 2009 and 0 28 100 m for most regions of the world poage and chamberlain 2001 there are no data on the isotopic altitude effect of mt meru since mt kilimanjaro 5895 m a s l and mt meru 4566 m a s l are very close a distance of about 70 km to each other both watersheds should show the same isotopic altitude effect therefore applying the isotopic altitude effect relationship between δ18o and altitude for mt kilimanjaro mckenzie et al 2010 to the δ18o of the natural water sources in the mt meru watershed the mean recharge altitudes were estimated in this study 3 results 3 1 water chemistry of fluoride contaminated water this section presents the results of analyses conducted on well spring and river water samples collected in 2018 and 2019 see tables 1 6 and associated figures and clarifies the factors that influence fluoride contamination in the groundwater in the area between arusha in the mmw and moshi in the mkw the fluoride concentration changes markedly at the boundary between the mmw and mkw fig 1 the average fluoride concentration in the water was 0 5 mg l in the mkw samples compared with 5 3 mg l in the mmw samples indicating a higher risk of exposure to fluoride contamination in the mmw water most groundwater and river water samples in the mmw were of the na hco3 type fig 5a tables 1 6 with fluoride concentrations ranging from high 1 5 mg l to extremely high 31 mg l figs 5b and 2 excluding 212 mg l in small momela lake fig 6a in maji ya chai river watershed the extremely high concentration range of fluoride detected and in ngaramtoni and themi river watersheds a high concentration range of fluoride was detected the depth of the well d from the surface becomes shallower toward the east and is shallower than 50 m east of the tengeru river fig 5c namely ngaramtoni area and themi river nduruma river and malala river are the watersheds where deep groundwater flow systems dominate in other words they may be areas where groundwater cannot be obtained unless a well is dug deeply since the elevation of mt meru increases toward the west in particular there are many deep wells in the ngaramtoni area implying that the groundwater level is low especially in the dry season however in the themi river watershed groundwater is also pumped from shallow wells as well as deep wells consisting of both shallow and deep groundwater systems tengeru and maji ya chai rivers will be the watershed where shallow groundwater flow systems dominate and the maji ya chai river watershed likely represents something similar to a high mountain pyroclastic talus slope watershed small and big momela lakes altitude 1400 m upstream of the maji ya chai river contain abnormally high concentrations of fluoride maji ya chai river watershed would be susceptible to upstream lakes influence via lahars in the shallow groundwater flow system e g nanyaro et al 1984 figs 4a and 5c the abnormally high fluoride concentration in surface water especially in small momela lake is due to the evaporative concentration of leachate containing fluoride from mt meru this na hco3 type water with a high fluoride concentration implies that the groundwater had slow flow or a long flow path in areas where interactions occurred between the water and host rocks that are relatively rich in carbon dioxide and fluoride such as the nephelinites and phonolites on mt meru ghiglieri et al 2010 nanyaro et al 1984 the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the mmw increased linearly as the sodium concentration increased and the surface water from small momela lake engare nanyuki river flowing into kenya and headwaters of the maji ya chai river system followed this trend figs 1 2 and 6a the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the mkw also increased linearly with increasing sodium concentration but the slope was gentler than that observed in the mmw fig 6a the correlation between the fluoride and sodium concentrations suggests that the solubility of fluorine increases due to the alkalization of groundwater in alkaline volcanic rocks as shown in fig 3 and tables 2 and 4 samples no 9 table 2 and no 41 table 4 from the same sampling locality from a shallow well d 7 35 m but with different sampling times and no 38 table 4 i e the three groundwater samples 9 41 and 38 of the mkw collected from an agricultural area were of the high nacl type with na and cl molar ratios of 1 1 suggesting that their fluoride originated from anthropogenic or geothermal sources in samples nos 11 and 53 river water in the mmw fig 2 collected from the same sampling locality but at different times sodium and fluoride increased by about 30 in the dry season september compared with in the long rainy season may the 87sr 86sr ratio of the water samples from the mmw and mkw ranged from 0 7037 to 0 7047 suggesting that the volcanic rocks in both watersheds were formed from the same type of magma fig 6b as the carbonatite of the ol doinyo lengai active volcano 87sr 86sr ratio 0 7040 0 7045 bell and tilton 2001 in the grv the opposing relationships between the fluoride concentration and the 87sr 86sr ratio in the mmw and mkw may reflect different sources of fluoride leaching from the geological substrate the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the 87sr 86sr ratio in the themi river watershed indicates that the water can be divided into at least two groups named w and e fig 6b group w is well water distributed on the western side of the themi river watershed while group e is that distributed on the eastern side fig 2 3 2 fluoride release into groundwater in ca na hco3 type groundwater it is well known that sodium increases and calcium decreases with progressive cation exchange reactions due to the smaller exchange coefficient of na ca in the adsorption desorption reaction e g appelo and postma 1999 fig 7a shows that fluoride increased with increasing na na ca values except in the mkw in association with alkalinization via cation exchange the fluoride concentration increases with increasing ph because of anion exchange with the hydroxide ion that has a similar ionic radius as the fluoride ion as an increase in the grt promotes na ca cation exchange f oh exchange to form f enriched water will more likely occur in older and alkaline solutions than in younger and no alkaline solutions fig 7b shows the relationship between the fluoride concentration and ph the fluoride concentration was higher under alkaline ph in the themi river and nduruma river watersheds enhancing the f oh exchange process in these two watersheds the fluoride concentration appears to be divided into two areas at a ph in the vicinity of 7 one with fluoride concentrations higher than approximately 4 mg l and the other with lower concentrations of fluoride encircled regions fig 7b fig 8 shows the relationships between f and ca2 and the saturation index for fluorite sifluorite in all water samples the fluoride concentration was low at high calcium levels fig 8a and the fluoride did not reach saturation for fluorite caf2 at a fluoride concentration of 10 mg l fig 8b as described above fluoride release into the natural water of the mmw is controlled by the progression of na ca cation exchange ph f oh exchange and a decrease in calcium base exchange however these water rock interactions may strongly depend on the grt and the groundwater flow path length gfpl to obtain the grt and gfpl of natural water the recharge altitude of groundwater and river water sources needs to be estimated in general the recharge altitude is the average elevation of the zone where rainwater recharges the watershed including groundwater aquifers we describe the estimation of recharge altitude in the next section 3 3 the relationship between the recharge altitude of natural water sources and the fluoride concentration 3 3 1 estimation of the recharge altitude of natural water sources using stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios δ18o and δd measured from rain and snow shallow groundwater and glacial melt in the mkw by mckenzie et al 2010 were used to estimate the mean recharge altitude of natural water sources wells springs and rivers of the study area fig 9a shows the relationship between δ18o and δd for groundwater spring river lake and rainwater in the mmw and mkw while the isotopic ratios of natural water in the mmw and mkw were distributed reasonably close to the global meteoric water line gmwl when δ18o was more depleted than 3 4 the plots with less depleted δ18o were distributed along a line with a much gentler slope this is caused by the mixing of local meteoric water with water from lakes and or rivers with high evaporation rates in the maji ya chai river watershed figs 1 4 therefore we hypothesize that the isotopic altitude effect of natural water with δ18o 3 4 in the mmw was the same as that in the mkw lugodisha et al 2020 the isotopic altitude effect hest m 1196 754 2δ18o in the mkw was determined from the regression line with a coefficient of determination r2 0 768 of the linear relationship between the sampling altitude and the δ18o of the shallow groundwater and glacial melt at altitudes higher than 1500 m a s l δ18o 3 4 fig 9b mckenzie et al 2010 as shallow groundwater and glacial melt can provide a proxy estimation of this effect mark and mckenzie 2007 based on the above hypothesis this relationship also applies to the mmw to determine the estimated recharge altitude hest of sample water 3 3 2 the relationship between the fluoride concentration and recharge altitude of natural water sources fig 10a and b show the relationships between the fluoride concentration and the 87sr 86sr ratio versus the recharge altitude which was estimated using the isotopic altitude effect of δ18o described above fig 9b mckenzie et al 2010 the fluoride concentration increased and the 87sr 86sr ratio decreased with increasing recharge altitude in the mmw fig 10a can be understood as follows as the recharge altitude increases the groundwater flow path and residence time from the recharge area to the discharge point tend to be longer indicating longer contact time between water and rock this will promote more leaching of fluoride by chemical weathering along groundwater flow paths fig 10b also shows two groups of water which are the same groups w and e distinguished by the relationship between the fluoride concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio in the themi river watershed fig 6b the two groups have different water flow paths from high to low altitudes as described in section 3 1 because there was a large difference in the 87sr 86sr ratio in water originating from high altitudes although these wells in the themi river watershed are located at approximately 1310 m to 1500 m a s l tables 1 3 and 5 the average recharge altitude was estimated to range from 1900 m to 2800 m based on the isotopic altitude effect fig 9b after all the two groups w and e in the themi river watershed are not significantly different other than the stratigraphic differences volcanic ash and pyroclastic layers are distributed around the recharge area above 1900 m a s l ghiglieri et al 2010 makoba and muzuka 2019 figs 2 and 4 and a volcanic ash cone is present in the crater of mt meru chacha et al 2018a vye brown et al 2014 thus based on the relationships shown in figs 10a and 2 the high groundwater fluoride contamination would be caused by leaching along the groundwater flow path starting from the volcanic ash and or pyroclastic layers e g bosshard stadlin et al 2017 makoba and muzuka 2019 nuccio 2016 moreover considering the relationship between the 87sr 86sr ratio and the recharge altitude fig 10b the groundwater flow path for group e runs through various strata indicating various 87sr 86sr values of 0 7041 0 7046 while the groundwater flow path for group w runs through almost a single stratum indicating an 87sr 86sr value of 0 70444 figs 1 4 3 4 the distribution of the grt according to the value of high precision sf6 age data t6a in tables 2 4 and 6 and table 8 most groundwater was estimated to have a residence time determined by pfm between two and forty years except for four samples that were at least 50 years old because sf6 gas is not detected with our sf6 dating system with a measurement limit of 50 years and because sf6 in the atmosphere is practically undetectable before 1960 fig s1a tables 8 and 9 show the grts determined by pfm and emm and parameters related to grt by watershed the supplementary fig s2 shows the relationship between grts by pfm and emm for collected groundwater samples both are in a monotonic curve relationship and when grt exceeds 10 years grt by emm is longer than pfm and the gap between the two widens especially when grt exceeds 20 years tables 8 and 9 show the grts determined by pfm and emm and parameters related to grt by watershed the supplementary fig s2 shows the relationship between grts by pfm and emm for collected groundwater samples both are in a monotonic curve relationship and when grt exceeds 10 years grt by emm is longer than pfm and the gap between the two widens especially when grt exceeds 20 years as described in section 2 1 most of the wells were pumped through a screen near the bottom of the well in this case as described in section 2 2 2 pfm is better than emm for estimating mean grt below the results are therefore organized using the grt determined by the pfm when water with high sf6 concentration young groundwater and water with low sf6 concentration old groundwater are mixed the sf6 concentration of mixed water depends on its mixing ratio in this study the apparent grt of the mixed groundwater was estimated by using pfm from the sf6 concentration of the mixed groundwater however regarding the relationships between grt and other parameters the trends were the same for both pfm and emm because both grts are in a monotonic curve relationship supplementary fig s2 as described in section 2 1 most of the wells were pumped through a screen near the bottom of the well in this case as described in section 2 2 2 pfm is better than emm for estimating mean grt below the results are therefore organized using the grt determined by the pfm when water with high sf6 concentration young groundwater and water with low sf6 concentration old groundwater are mixed the sf6 concentration of mixed water depends on its mixing ratio in this study the apparent grt of the mixed groundwater was estimated by using pfm from the sf6 concentration of the mixed groundwater however regarding the relationships between grt and other parameters the trends were the same for both pfm and emm because both grts are in a monotonic curve relationship supplementary fig s2 table 9 shows the range of grts by pfm and emm divided by watershed and the grt at each range of well depth d in the south of mt meru the grt tends to be longer in the west watersheds and shorter in the east watersheds this trend may be related to the distribution of well depth because many wells on the west side are deeper than 50 m while many wells on the east side are shallower than 50 m in mmw fig 5c although the grt tends to increase as the well is deeper in nduruma river watershed the trend is not clear in themi ngaramtoni malala tengel and maji ya chai river watersheds and mkw table 9 the samples recollected in the field at different times and remeasured can be compared for seasonal differences in grt in table 8 the sample numbers are shown by dividing the sampling periods the sample nos 1 14 were at the end of the rainy season may 2018 nos 15 57 were at the end of the dry season sep 2018 and nos 58 76 were at the beginning of the rainy season march 2019 for pairs 1 and 45 9 and 41 and 12 and 50 which are shallow wells or springs the grt tends to decrease significantly from the rainy season to the dry season while for pairs 7 and 36 8 and 42 and 14 and 49 which are deep wells the grt tends to increase slightly from the rainy season to the dry season when the groundwater level drops significantly from the rainy season to the dry season in this study area water that is in contact with the atmosphere or atmosphere easily tends to infiltrate into groundwater e g darling et al 2012 the trend will be even stronger in pumping wells therefore in that case rejuvenation of the age of well water can occur based on sf6 dating as described in 2 2 2 on the other hand there could be various reasons for the aging of wells during the dry season 3 5 the relationship between the grt and groundwater fluoride contamination as described in section 3 3 2 the high groundwater fluoride contamination would be caused by leaching along the groundwater flow path fluoride concentration will be strongly influenced by groundwater flow path length gfpl and grt gfpl and grt should also be correlated for a small watershed the difference hest h between the estimated recharge altitude hest and the sampling altitude h is a strong measure of gfpl and the deeper the well the longer the gfpl will be fig 11a b and c show the relationships between the hest h the well depth the grt determined from pfm and fluoride concentration respectively the hest h tends to become longer as the well depth d increases focusing on the themi river watershed where there is a lot of data for d and hest h is over 450 m even at shallow wells d 20 m fig 8a longer hest h leads to longer grt in groups with grt longer than 20 years of themi river watershed and in mkw fig 11b this correlation represents a normal physical relationship however in themi river watershed when the grt is shorter than 20 years the shorter the grt the longer the hest h tends to be suggesting that something unusual is happening to groundwater flows in ngaramtoni small watershed the relationship between hest h and grt is unclear fluoride concentration increases as hest h become longer in themi river nduruma river malala river and ngaramtoni watersheds fig 11c however in themi river watershed both plots have a somewhat large scatter in ngaramtoni watershed the relationship between fluoride concentration and hest h is divided into two groups the ratio of fluoride concentration to hest h the slope on the graph of fig 11c suggesting the degree of fluoride dissolution along the groundwater flow path is watershed dependent fig 11d e and f show the relationships between the fluoride concentration and the grt determined from pfm and do 0 06 9 99 mg l considering the complex behavior of grt in the themi river watershed the results for the groundwater samples collected from the themi river watershed are grouped into three symbols circles filled with red and blue and blue plus symbols the circles filled with red indicate groundwater groups with grt longer than 20 years the circles filled with blue indicate groundwater groups with grt shorter than 20 years and do larger than 3 4 mg l and those with blue plus symbols indicate groups other than the groups of circles filled with red and blue in the themi river watershed in the groundwater samples collected from the nduruma river watershed the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt fig 11d while the fluoride concentration fluctuated in the range of 1 5 3 5 mg l regardless of the do content except for samples with a do content of 0 07 0 09 mg l fig 11e in the themi river watershed the trend of the fluoride concentration against the grt and do content changed at a grt of about 20 years fig 11d and at a do of 3 4 mg l fig 11e the trend of do content decreasing with increasing grt also changed somewhat at a grt of about 20 years fig 11f the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt and decreasing do content for the older water samples circles filled with red in fig 11d and e and it increased with decreasing residence time and increasing do content with a correlation coefficient r 0 940 for the younger water samples circles filled with blue in fig 11d and e in the ngaramtoni small watershed in the mmw the fluoride concentration was not linearly related to the grt fig 11d while the fluoride concentration increased with increasing do content r 0 781 fig 11e however no clear and linear relationship was found between do content and grt in the ngaramtoni watershed fig 11f these results suggest that the infiltration of recent aerobic groundwater into an aquifer is another factor that can affect the fluoride concentration in addition to fluoride dissolution associated with alkalinization these mechanisms are discussed in the following section 4 discussion as shown in fig 12 groundwater samples from the themi river watershed circles filled with red or blue were categorized into groups a and b which exhibited different relationships between the fluoride and do contents residence time and recharge altitude the main difference between groups a and b is that they have a grt older than or younger than 18 20 years fig 12a table 7 1 here older younger and mixed groundwaters are described as groups a b and ab group a groundwater samples were older than 18 years and the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt chemical weathering i e mineral decomposition and dissolution and the resulting ion exchange in aquifers due to a long grt predominated in group a fig 12a since fluoride leaching progressed under low do conditions fig 12a b and c group b groundwater samples were younger than those of group a and the fluoride concentration increased with decreasing grt group b also had higher fluoride concentrations in the water samples with higher do concentrations and the relationship between do and grt fig 12b indicated that the do content was high higher than 3 4 mg l in the last two decades the do content decreased with increasing grt during these decades likely due to microbial activity and chemical weathering in the aquifer therefore in the last two decades fluoride leaching has probably been promoted by the active infiltration of aerobic water fig 12c this mechanism may be explained by fluoride leaching from weathering reaction from fluoride bearing minerals in oxic recharge water e g chae et al 2006 singh and mukherjee 2014 however for groundwater samples no 18 22 23 and 24 outside of groups a and b the mechanism of fluoride leaching into groundwater is complex to simplify the explanation here the older and younger endmembers of group a are represented by et1 and et2 respectively and et3 represents an endmember of groundwater that rejuvenates old water group a by entraining the atmosphere as described below table 7 2 the group b results can be explained by mixing with et2 and et3 as endmembers fig 12a and c similarly groundwater samples no 22 23 and 24 outside groups a and b group ab can be explained by mixing group a and b samples with et1 et2 and et3 as endmembers tables 7 1 and 7 2 as the youngest groundwater samples of et3 indicated a high fluoride concentration 5 6 5 mg l high recharge altitude 2600 2800 m a s l in fig 12d and high do content 10 mg l it is natural that their grt decreased and that their fluoride concentration was diluted due to the mixing of the atmospheric low fluoride concentrations in young water and high fluoride concentrations 6 5 mg l in old groundwater group a the reason for this is that the current atmosphere contains a large amount of oxygen and sf6 gas aging tracer in this study and the old groundwater should have a higher fluoride concentration than that of et3 the mechanism of rejuvenation related to grt is also described in section 2 2 2 the situation in which well water like et3 is formed is considered as follows since the et3 groundwater with high fluoride 5 6 5 mgf l has a do of 10 mg l in the range that is in contact with the atmosphere the groundwater is in an oxidizing condition for example when the groundwater level drops significantly from the rainy season to the dry season due to overpumping of the aquifer and seasonal fluctuation in water table elevation the atmosphere with high sf6 should be entrained into groundwater with surface water in water pumping in some deep wells e g darling et al 2012 the atmospheric component is the equivalent of the unsaturated zone component in this situation the age of old groundwater with high fluoride rejuvenates based on sf6 dating tracer resulting in groundwater like et3 some springs in mountain slope areas also can rejuvenate based on sf6 dating tracer due to seasonal fluctuations in groundwater table elevation e g darling et al 2012 mosquera et al 2020 groundwater samples from the nduruma river watershed blue squares can also be explained by mixing with en1 en2 en3 and en4 as endmembers table 7 2 where en1 represents the oldest groundwater with the highest fluoride in the nduruma river watershed en2 represents rainwater with no fluoride and a high do content of approximately 10 mg l en3 represents a high recharge altitude fig 12d a high do content would occur through the same process as that observed for et3 and en4 represents the focus connecting the three endmembers en1 en2 and en3 fig 12a and c as described in section 3 3 considering the relationship of the 87sr 86sr ratio versus the recharge altitude fig 12d the groundwater flow path for samples in groups a and b runs through various strata indicating variable 87sr 86sr values 0 7042 0 7046 according to the geological map and section in fig 4a and b makoba and muzuka 2019 the recharge zone 1900 2800 m elevation fig 12d for the samples in the themi river watershed figs 1 and 2 are in a pyroclastic layer with nephelinitic to phonolitic lava and a generally fractured formation constituting the potential aquifer in the mmw ghiglieri et al 2010 the groundwater for the samples in the themi river watershed flows through mantling ash and reddish brown soil layers via the pyroclastic layer with nephelinitic to phonolitic lava figs 1 4 and 12d in general volcanic ash is vulnerable to weathering because the specific surface area of the particles in volcanic ash is large as this ash consists of fine particles and because volcanic ash is vitreous and metastable suggesting that the mantling ash layer upstream of the reddish brown soil layer may play an important role in fluoride leaching in the mt meru slope area there are reports that old groundwater is mixed with young water in the mmw and mkw lugodisha et al 2020 mckenzie et al 2010 lugodisha et al 2020 also suggested that the low altitude groundwater in the ngaramtoni and arusha areas figs 1 4 originates from high altitude and local recharge sources with negligible fluoride contents on the southwestern slopes of mt meru in this study the relationships of the fluoride concentration versus grt do and recharge altitude in the themi river watershed fig 12 represent the mixing of aerobic groundwater et3 which is formed by the mixing of the atmospheric young water with a low fluoride concentration and the old groundwater of group a thus the mixing of aerobic groundwater and old groundwater group a has been active for approximately the last 20 years this mixing phenomenon is caused by pumping and groundwater equivalent to et3 can therefore occur everywhere in the watershed around the wells in areas of over pumping although the apparent grt of mixed groundwater is determined by pfm from the sf6 concentration it will be between the piston flow model age and the exponential mixing model leibundgut et al 2009 age the difference in the grt determined from the pfm and emm was 1 1 1 1 years average and standard deviation for grt

sodium was closely linked indicating that the leaching of both ions occurred by the same processes from various strata with various 87sr 86sr values between 0 7041 and 0 7046 therefore the leaching of both ions originated from different strata and the concentrations accumulated and were averaged in the groundwater flow path downstream however in the groundwater excluding group a the leaching of fluoride and sodium did not have a simple relationship suggesting that the leaching of these ions depended on the geology and their heterogeneity in the strata as well as the mixing ratio of young and

and 13b were influenced by geology or mixing with higher na and low f groundwater mbabaye et al 2018 reported that the fluoride concentration in well water increased exponentially from approximately 2 mg l to 32 mg l as the depth of the well decreased for 41 wells with depths of 5 m to 100 m in the southeastern part of the mmw meru district in the arusha region the fluoride concentration often increased sharply at a well depth shallower than 20 m from approximately 5 mg l to 32 mg l these authors also suggested that deep wells i e 50 m contain aquifer water with a low fluoride concentration fig 14 shows the distribution of fluoride concentration in groundwater grouped by well depth d and groundwater residence time grt in mmw in wells shallower than 50 m and wells deeper than 100 m more than half of the wells show fluoride concentrations above 4 mg l therefore fluoride concentration in deep wells i e 50 m is not necessarily low in mmw wells shallower than 50 m often have high fluoride concentrations exceeding 9 mg l strongly reflecting the influence of the maji ya chai river watershed which has extremely high fluoride contamination in wells shallower than 50 m figs 5b c and 11a in addition the grt of most wells is shorter than 10 years in maji ya chai river watershed fig 11a and b and in mmw 75 of wells with grt longer than 20 years show fluoride in the very high concentration range the relationship between the fluoride concentration and well depth between 10 m and 200 m from the surface fig 5b and c is shown divided into groups a b and ab table 7 1 for groundwater in the themi river watershed in fig 13c in group a the fluoride concentration in well water tended to increase as the depth of the well increased this occurred because the deeper the well the longer the grt figs 13c and 12 and the longer the contact time between rock and water in this study thus the fluoride concentration in well water naturally increases as the depth of the well increases however in the groundwater group b and the groundwater group ab mixed with group a and group b for this watershed the fluoride concentration in well water tended to increase as the depth of the well decreased the relationships for the groundwater group b and ab in the themi river watershedagreet with those for the meru district in the arusha region mbabaye et al 2018 in contrast to those observed for group a the relationship between the measured fluoride concentration and wells with a depth of 5 m to 100 m in the meru district in the arusha region mbabaye et al 2018 can be explained by the same formation process of the groundwater group b and the group ab mixed with group a and group b therefore the increased mixing of aerobic groundwater and old groundwater group a in the last 20 years has increased the fluoride concentration compared to groundwater group a without mixing in some shallower wells 100 m depth as indicated by the upward arrow in fig 13c and conversely the fluoride concentration of groundwaters has been diluted in some deeper wells 100 m depth as indicated by the downward arrow in fig 13c the population in arusha national bureau of statistics tanzania 2019 https www citypopulation de en tanzania admin 02arusha the capital city of the arusha region figs 1 and 2 increased drastically over a 25 year period from 102 540 in 1988 to 416 442 in 2012 this has resulted in a large increase in water demand which has resulted in the lowering of groundwater levels due to the over pumping of well water especially during the dry season the arusha urban water supply and sewerage authority auwsa reported that the present well yield is much lower than the initial well yield for all deep wells drilled by the government from 1968 to 1992 arusha urban water supply and sanitation authority 2019 http www auwsa go tz en services category water sources chacha et al 2018a pointed out that previous studies reported a decrease in borehole yields and subsequently a decline in groundwater levels in this area and attributed this to rapid urbanization industrial growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture that has escalated the water demand thus the well water that is managed by the government and transported to the arusha city area is beginning to be depleted chacha et al 2018b also reported that the continuous abstraction of groundwater from arusha aquifers in northern tanzania has resulted in a decline in water as the well water level drops toward the level of the screen for pumping well water the wells in the shallower aquifers will draw in old groundwater with high fluoride levels and the wells in the deeper aquifers will draw in younger groundwater with low fluoride levels as a result of this mixing process with young aerobic water the fluoride concentration of shallower wells will increase therefore the increase in water demand due to population growth will result in higher fluoride concentrations in the groundwater the leaching mechanism of fluoride in the groundwater around arusha can occur in any heavily populated urban area in the grv 5 conclusions this study focused on recent geogenic fluoride release exceeding the world health organization s upper limit for groundwater used for drinking purposes in relation to the water cycle on the southern slope of mt meru in the great rift valley east africa the following conclusions were drawn 1 the average recharge altitude of groundwater with a high geogenic fluoride concentration is estimated to range from 1900 m to 3000 m on the southern slope of mt meru and the fluoride concentration in wells tends to increase with an increase in the recharge altitude 2 the results demonstrate that the mixing of aerobic young water and old groundwater has been active for approximately the last 20 years and the fluoride concentration is increasing in some shallower wells 3 two trends denoted a and b separated by a residence time of about 20 years describe the relationship between the groundwater residence time grt and fluoride concentration in trend a grt longer than approximately 20 years the fluoride concentration increased with increasing grt while in group b grt shorter than approximately 20 years the fluoride concentration increased with increasing dissolved oxygen do 4 in trend a group a mostly representing deeper water a longer contact time between the groundwater and the volcanic aquifer increased the fluoride concentration and fluoride leaching due to water rock interactions weathering dissolution and ion exchange depending on the groundwater residence time 5 in trend b mixing aerobic high fluoride rejuvenated groundwater by infiltration with water in the unsaturated zone and surface water as well as old groundwater by pumping changed the fluoride concentration in some wells in the most recent 20 years 6 groundwaters formed by mixing groups a and b are also increasing fluoride levels in shallow wells the relationship between the grt and fluoride concentration suggests that a rapid increase in the demand for well water due to population growth and urbanization has accelerated the recharge of surface water as well as water with a high do content and promoted fluoride contamination through the mixing of well water further studies should include investigating anthropogenic effects on

1228,large deep lakes in plateau regions provide crucial ecosystem services but are susceptible to eutrophication due to their long water residence time to date the water quality of deep lakes has not received as much attention as that of shallow lakes owing to logistical challenges this study investigated the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of phosphorus and related environmental variables in a large deep lake in the yunnan plateau china fuxian lake generally the concentrations of total phosphorus tp r2 0 862 total dissolved phosphorus tdp r2 0 922 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip r2 0 889 exhibited a linear increase with the greater water depth whereas the ph and dissolved oxygen do showed decreasing trends the tp tdp and dip values were 0 012 0 006 and 0 004 mg l respectively in surface waters 0 5 m depth and increased to 0 074 0 065 and 0 062 mg l respectively at 140 0 m depth the averaged over ordering method demonstrated that do and air temperature accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip in the shallow water layer 0 5 20 0 m in contrast do and ph accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip in deeper water layers 40 0 150 0 m as a warm monomictic lake the higher observed phosphorus concentrations in deeper water and sediment potentially pose a risk of future eutrophication in the fuxian lake our findings demonstrate that more efficient technical and management measures should be taken to reduce the external phosphorus load to fuxian lake so that the load to and from the sediment will decrease eventually graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water quality nutrient dynamics water depth vertical distribution plateau lake china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction lakes provide numerous important ecosystem services such as the provision of water sources for drinking and irrigation mitigation of flood disasters and ecotourism steinman et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sterner et al 2020 however given rapid urbanization intense agricultural activities and industrial wastewater discharge the deterioration of the water quality of lakes has become a major global concern in recent decades especially in developing countries liang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 phosphorus is one of the essential elements for the growth of living organisms but in excessive concentrations can trigger severe eutrophication wang and liang 2015 li et al 2022 deep lakes usually experience less eutrophication than shallow lakes both regionally liboriussen et al 2009 liu et al 2012 and globally qin et al 2020 this difference is likely driven by the stronger thermal stratification of deep lakes which is a key regulator of biogeochemical cycles in lakes qin et al 2020 li et al 2022 according to the vertical changes in temperature and sediment water interactions the water column in deep lakes can be delineated into the epilimnion surface layer metalimnion thermocline and hypolimnion bottom layer qin et al 2020 numerous nutrients such as phosphorus and other pollutants settle out of the epilimnion and can get released from the sediments while thermal stratification hinders the exchange of materials between different water layers song et al 2013 li et al 2022 as a result gradients in lake chemistry are likely to be formed throughout the water column however studies on the vertical distribution of nutrients in large deep lakes are lacking especially on those associated with eutrophication in china there are 2700 lakes with surface areas exceeding 1 km2 of these lakes more than two thirds are located in the high plateau regions wang and dou 1998 wang et al 2018 compared to lakes in floodplains the ecosystems of plateau lakes are arguably more susceptible and vulnerable to eutrophication because of their longer water residence times and simpler food chains liu et al 2012 qin et al 2020 in particular liu et al 2012 used the trophic state index and revealed that seven of the nine lakes in the yunnan plateau were eutrophic outbreaks of local cyanobacterial blooms can intermittently occur in summer even in oligotrophic lakes such as fuxian lake li et al 2007 fuxian lake is the deepest lake in the yunnan plateau with maximum and mean depths of 155 m and 89 6 m respectively wang and dou 1998 notably fuxian lake is generally oligotrophic with total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations of 0 154 mg l and 0 013 mg l respectively in surface water wang and dou 1998 since the 1990s the water quality of fuxian lake has been maintained at a fairly high level but the water quality deterioration trend is now distinct chen et al 2019 thus far most studies on the water quality of the fuxian lake have focused on the surface layer chen et al 2019 whereas the nutrient status and influencing factors in deeper water layers for such deep lakes are poorly understood this study investigated the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of phosphorus and its related environmental variables in the fuxian lake a previous study indicated that water quality parameters did not exhibit significant differences between the wet and dry seasons in the yunnan plateau lakes liu et al 2012 based on this we first hypothesized that the phosphorus concentrations in water do not exhibit significant inter monthly variability phosphorus in the surface water layer deposited on the lakebed and can get released from the sediments while thermal stratification hampers the phosphorus exchange between different layers therefore we secondly hypothesized that the phosphorus concentration was lower in surface water than in bottom water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area fuxian lake 24 21 24 38 n 102 49 102 57 e is a warm monomictic lake located on the yunnan plateau in southwestern china xing et al 2020 it is the largest rift lake in china with an area of 211 km2 and has a surface elevation of 1722 m above sea level wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 the lake length is 31 5 km and the maximum width is 11 5 km fig 1 the water volume is 189 0 108 m3 the distribution of inflow rivers is as follows the larger rivers are spread in the northern watershed while smaller rivers are located in the western and eastern basins wang et al 2018 fig 1 shows that the haikou river represents the only outflow to the lower catchment the fuxian lake catchment covers an area of 674 7 km2 chen et al 2019 the land use type is forest 33 57 of the total watershed area followed by water 30 14 cropland 25 42 grassland 7 73 shrub 2 00 and impervious surface 1 14 the water outflow and volume of the lake have previously indicated that the mean water residence time is 167 years wang and dou 1998 wang et al 2018 from a climatological point of view the yunnan plateau is characterized by the southwestern monsoon induced seasonality with distinctly dry and wet seasons the wet season normally lasts from may to october the mean annual precipitation from 2018 to 2020 was 847 0 mm with 68 4 occurring from june to october the mean monthly air temperature is 17 3 c with the hottest month in june 22 4 c and the coldest month in january 10 8 c there is a complete mixing period in winter when the surface water cools to the same temperature as the bottom water xing et al 2020 2 2 field sampling we set three transects in the northern central and southern parts of the fuxian lake based on their geographical locations hydrological regimes and pollution features fig 1 along each transect we set up three or four plots for monthly water quality monitoring in particular we monitored the water quality at the surface layer 0 5 m 20 0 m 40 0 m 60 0 m and 80 0 m water depths from a depth of 80 0 m to the bottom layer we sampled every 10 m until the lakebed we measured the water temperature in situ by using a reversing thermometer following the chinese national standard gb 13195 91 we measured the ph and dissolved oxygen do in situ by using a multiparameter water quality monitoring instrument wtw multi 3410 germany furthermore water transparency was determined in situ by using the secchi depth sd method we collected 10 l of water in each layer using a free flow water sampler 436 390 hydro bios germany in addition we collected 5 kg of the top sediment layer of the lakebed 0 10 cm depth using a 1 16 m2 peterson sediment sampler the water and sediment samples were packaged in polyethylene film and plastic sampling bottles they were subsequently stored in a refrigerator at the yunnan center of ecological environment monitoring laboratory where we performed all the physical and chemical analyses we analyzed total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip following the chinese national standard gb11893 1989 to measure tp a 25 ml water sample was first digested with potassium persulfate then it was reacted with ascorbic acid and molybdate subsequently the tp concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at the wavelength of 700 μm for tdp the water was first filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size millipore filter and then determined by the tp procedure zhu et al 2015 for the dip the filtered water sample without digestion was determined by using the tp procedure after the extraction with 90 ethanol we measured chlorophyll a chl a concentrations using spectrophotometry at the wavelengths of 750 664 647 and 630 nm following the standard of environmental protection of china hj 897 2017 the sediment samples were air dried in the shade and sieved through a 20 or 60 mesh screen for further analysis of sediment total phosphorus stp and olsen phosphorus sop the soil samples were digested with sodium hydroxide then the stp was colorimetrically measured using the ascorbic acid reduction method olsen phosphorus sop was extracted with a 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate solution and measured colorimetrically using the ascorbic acid reduction method 2 3 statistical analyses climate data from eight meteorological stations around fuxian lake were obtained from the yunnan center of ecological environment monitoring first we used regression to analyze spatial and temporal changes in environmental variables of the fuxian lake if the data did not satisfy the variance homogeneity test we conducted kruskal wallis rank sum test we determine to use linear or nonlinear regression based on the distribution of the data in the scatter plot and chose the best fitting regression curve based on the value of r2 second we analyzed the variance to determine the statistical significance of the phosphorus concentration depending on months water depths and transects if the data did not satisfy the variance homogeneity test we conducted nonparametric tests to determine if there were significant spatio temporal differences in the water phosphorus variables third we divided the 14 sampling water depths into two groups based on the vertical water temperature gradient wang et al 2017 varol 2020 groupiincluded 0 5 m and 20 0 m water depths which corresponds to the epilimnion of the lake group ii included the water depth of 40 0 150 0 m corresponding to the hypolimnion of the lake wang et al 2017 fourth we used multi regression analyses to determine the influence of environmental variables on water phosphorus within the two groups we conducted log or square root sqrt transformation to improve the variables homoscedasticity finally we applied the averaged over ordering method to evaluate the variance explained by environmental variables in each water depth group huang et al 2022 all the statistical analyses were performed using the r package version 4 4 1 3 results 3 1 site

temperature ph do and chl a water temperature and chl a decreased rapidly from 20 0 m to 40 0 m and became relatively stable from a depth of 40 0 m to the lakebed fig 3a c water temperatures went from 18 20 c to 18 75 c at the shallow layer 0 5 20 0 m to 14 26 c to 15 12 c at greater depth 40 0 150 0 m chl a concentrations were estimated to be 3 48 3 43 μg l in the shallow layer and 2 00 2 28 μg l at greater depths the ph and do analysis revealed decreasing trends with increasing water depth fig 3b d the ph was 8 56 in the surface water layer and decreased to 7 72 at 140 0 m likewise do was estimated to be 7 67 mg l in the surface water layer but decreased to 1 81 mg l at the 140 0 m depth vertical variations in water temperature ph do and chl a in each of the three basins were similar to those of the entire lake fig 3a d 3 2 monthly and vertical variations of water phosphorus on the one hand the concentrations of tp and tdp varied significantly depending on water depth months and transects p 0 001 table 1 on the other hand the concentrations of water dip did not vary significantly with the water depth but varied significantly depending on months and transects p 0 05 table 1 notably the concentrations of tp r2 0 495 decreased from january to december in the entire lake fig 4a the tp tdp and dip concentrations in the northern basin were higher than those in the central and southern basins fig 4b d the mean concentrations of tp were 0 032 0 021 and 0 020 mg l in the northern central and southern lakes respectively fig 4b the mean concentrations of water tdp were 0 027 0 016 and 0 015 mg l in the northern central and southern lakes respectively fig 4c the mean concentrations of dip in water were 0 023 0 012 and 0 012 mg l in the northern central and southern lakes respectively fig 4d the concentrations of tp tdp and dip all increased with greater water depth the concentration of tp in water was found to be 0 012 mg l in the surface layer and increased to 0 074 mg l at a depth 140 0 m likewise the concentration of water tdp was estimated to be 0 006 mg l at the surface layer and increased to 0 065 mg l at the 140 0 m depth the concentration of water dip was determined to be 0 004 mg l at the surface layer and increased to 0 062 mg l at the 140 0 m depth fig 5 3 3 monthly variation of phosphorus in sediments the concentrations of stp and sop varied significantly among the three transects p 0 001 table 2 the stp varied between 1571 and 2253 mg kg 1 and the sop varied between 33 and 48 mg kg 1 the highest stp content was identified in the southern lake intermediate in the central lake and lowest in the northern lake 3 4 the relationship between water phosphorus and environmental variables the multi regression model suggests that the relationship between water phosphorus and environmental factors varied among the two water depth groups specifically the water tp in group i was positively correlated with air temperature and precipitation however the water tp in group ii was positively correlated with ph and air temperature and negatively associated with do and water temperature table 3 the water tdp in group i was positively correlated with do and air temperature however the water tdp in group ii was positively correlated with ph and chl a and negatively correlated with do table 3 the water dip in group i was positively correlated with do air temperature and sop and negatively correlated with ph however the water dip in group ii was positively correlated with chl a and negatively correlated with do the averaged over ordering method suggests that for group i do and air temperature accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp 62 tdp 65 and dip 58 fig 6a in addition water temperature accounted for 15 13 and 14 of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip respectively fig 6a for group ii do accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp 44 tdp 50 and dip 42 fig 6b in addition ph accounted for 14 10 and 21 of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip respectively fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 decreasing trend of monthly water total phosphorus concentration in 2021 notably the concentrations of tp in fuxian lake did not exhibit seasonal variation but showed a decreasing trend from january to december 2021 a previous study indicated that nutrient concentrations exhibited no significant differences between wet and dry seasons in the yunnan plateau lakes because the watersheds were dominated by vegetation and were less affected by agricultural activities liu et al 2012 however our results demonstrated that the water tp concentration exhibited a significantly decreasing trend at the intermonth scale fig 4a to protect the water of fuxian lake from eutrophication and pollution the government has implemented numerous measures in the last 10 years such as the construction of a riparian buffer zone prohibition of a phosphate mining and improvement of the capacity of wastewater treatment as a result the water quality has been improving and phosphorus concentrations have generally been decreasing since 2019 yang et al 2021 therefore these measures can help minimize the influence of seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation on phosphorus concentration based on this it can be inferred that phosphorus concentrations in water are not necessarily affected by weather variability but can be controlled using various phosphorus control approaches 4 2 higher water phosphorus concentration in the northern basin our results also showed that the concentrations of tp and tdp were significantly higher in the northern basin than in the central and southern basins the main industrial and agricultural areas are distributed in the northern plain of the catchment the same areas form the economic core of the region dai et al 2017 there are also more inflow rivers which represent the main pollutants clustered in the northern basin of fuxian lake fig 1 moreover numerous rivers in the northern catchment area suffer from severe tn tp and organic pollution caused by phosphorus based chemical production and runoff from agricultural areas especially from paddy fields dai et al 2017 wang et al 2018 despite the recent efforts to control pollution sources non point source pollution especially nitrogen and phosphorus stemming from agricultural cultivation and domestic wastewater remains a problem in the northern basin of the lake yao et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that a considerable proportion of domestic wastewater especially in rural settlements of the yunnan plateau had not been treated properly before its release into the river liu et al 2012 dai et al 2017 moreover the lake is affected by the southeastern monsoon thereby inducing more intense accumulation of potential pollutants in the northern basin yao et al 2017 4 3 increasing phosphorus concentration along water depth fundamentally thermal stratification plays a critical role in regulating the internal nutrient dynamics of deep lakes with low flow rates qin et al 2020 li et al 2022 thermal stratification of fuxian lake was elucidated in this study where the hypolimnion of 40 0 150 0 m lakebed was identified and where the temperature remained steady at 15 c fig 3a note that some previous studies have revealed slight variations of biochemical parameters for several lakes and reservoirs with thermal structures below a certain water depth mao et al 2018 li et al 2022 however we found that the concentrations of tp tdp and dip increased almost linearly with water depth in the fuxian lake the vertical profile of phosphorus is primarily determined by the input sedimentation vertical material exchange between water columns and release of phosphorus from sediment into the water column vollenweider 1975 qin et al 2020 in the fuxian lake phosphorus constantly settled to the bottom of the water columns yao et al 2017 whereas the recycling of dissolved phosphorus in the hypolimnion is hampered from the bottom water column song et al 2013 li et al 2022 furthermore these processes are exacerbated by the water column stratification and stability li et al 2022 regarding fuxian lake the vertical profile of phosphorus that had increased from the surface layer to the bottom is likely to be formed and retained by the long term external source input deposition of phosphate in deeper water sediment phosphorus release and water column stratification sediment is an important sink of phosphorus and also acts as a source releasing phosphorus into the water column through processes of diffusion convection and resuspension müller et al 2012 sediment phosphorus concentrations were the highest in the southern basin and lowest in the norther basin which contrasts with phosphorus concentrations in the water column higher sediment phosphorus concentration in the southern basin may reflect the historically sediment supply through gehe river from xingyun lake which is a eutrophic lake located to the south of the fuxian lake wang et al 2018 although the connection between fuxian lake and xingyun lake has been cut off in 2007 total phosphorus in sediments was still higher in the southern basin the tp concentration in the sediments was somewhat high in the fuxian lake with the range of 1571 2253 mg kg 1 thereby signifying much higher values than that of several eutrophic lakes such as chaohu lake 585 mg kg 1 wang et al 2021 and western taihu lake 337 3 1081 9 mg kg 1 wang et al 2019 if most of the p is bound to a stable fraction higher tp concentration in the sediment does not necessarily mean the internal loading will be high anderson et al 2021 however under the anaerobic conditions of the hypolimnion the iron oxide was reduced and the phosphate adsorbed by the iron oxide was released into the overlying water this phenomenon was a potential driver behind the increased tp levels in the bottom layer li et al 2022 4 4 the relation between water phosphorus with environmental variables both the regression models and averaged over ordering method revealed that the concentrations of water phosphorus were affected by various factors among the two water depth groups table 3 fig 6 in the shallow water layer 0 5 20 0 m which corresponded to the epilimnion phosphorus concentration was mostly affected by do and air temperature table 3 fig 6 however it was also affected by water temperature and precipitation in general the epilimnetic layer makes contact with the atmosphere and is mixed by precipitation and wind qin et al 2020 warmer temperatures in the epilimnion are conducive to algal growth as indicated by the higher chl a concentration in the shallow water layer zhu et al 2015 saros et al 2016 the growth of algae could absorb some amounts of phosphate at the beginning but the consequent decomposition of algae decreased do and induced the phosphate release from the decomposing algae and sediment the contribution of do to phosphorus concentration became more conspicuous in the deep water layer 40 0 150 0 m depth than in the surface water layer fig 6 the low levels of do in the bottom water were mainly driven by the decomposition of organic matter and by the lack of exchange with the upper water layer müller et al 2012 under prolonged anoxic conditions at the sediment water interface inorganic phosphorus can be released from iron hydroxides in sediments liboriussen et al 2009 foster and fulweiler 2019 hypolimnetic hypoxia can arguably exacerbate the release of soluble reactive phosphorus from sediments into surrounding water rogora et al 2018 anderson et al 2021 although hypolimnetic hypoxia was likely responsible for the internal phosphorus flux the active mechanisms of hypoxic extent on phosphorus dynamics are unclear for very deep lakes such as fuxian lake overall our findings provide important implications for managing phosphorus budgets as described below 4 5 implications for the management of deep lakes phosphorus enrichment in the bottom water of fuxian lake has attracted considerable attention and consequent concerns the tp concentrations in the bottom water have been estimated to be 0 0136 mg l in 2001 0 026 mg l in 2005 and 0 028 0 029 mg l in 2009 yao et al 2017 in 2021 the phosphorus concentration in the bottom water reached 0 065 mg l while in the last two decades phosphorus concentration has increased nearly two fold the water quality of fuxian lake was protected by law to maintain grade i state environmental protection administration 2002 although the phosphorus concentration in surface water was generally maintained at grade i 0 01 mg l thereby meeting the environmental quality standards for surface water of china higher concentrations of phosphorus in deeper water and sediment may still pose a larger potential risk for eutrophication our findings demonstrate that more efficient technical and management measures should be taken to reduce the external load of fuxian lake especially considering its ecological importance and vulnerability 5 conclusions this study examined the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of phosphorus and its related environmental variables in fuxian lake the concentrations of water tp did not exhibit seasonal variation but showed a decreasing trend from january to december 2021 generally the concentrations of tp tdp and dip exhibited a linear increase with greater water depth phosphorus was affected primarily by do and air temperature in the shallow water layer in contrast it was predominantly affected by do and ph in the deeper water layer the higher observed phosphorus concentrations in deeper water and sediment potentially pose a eutrophication risk in the future credit authorship contribution statement you ai duan conceptualization methodology writing original draft xin sheng

1228,large deep lakes in plateau regions provide crucial ecosystem services but are susceptible to eutrophication due to their long water residence time to date the water quality of deep lakes has not received as much attention as that of shallow lakes owing to logistical challenges this study investigated the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of phosphorus and related environmental variables in a large deep lake in the yunnan plateau china fuxian lake generally the concentrations of total phosphorus tp r2 0 862 total dissolved phosphorus tdp r2 0 922 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip r2 0 889 exhibited a linear increase with the greater water depth whereas the ph and dissolved oxygen do showed decreasing trends the tp tdp and dip values were 0 012 0 006 and 0 004 mg l respectively in surface waters 0 5 m depth and increased to 0 074 0 065 and 0 062 mg l respectively at 140 0 m depth the averaged over ordering method demonstrated that do and air temperature accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip in the shallow water layer 0 5 20 0 m in contrast do and ph accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip in deeper water layers 40 0 150 0 m as a warm monomictic lake the higher observed phosphorus concentrations in deeper water and sediment potentially pose a risk of future eutrophication in the fuxian lake our findings demonstrate that more efficient technical and management measures should be taken to reduce the external phosphorus load to fuxian lake so that the load to and from the sediment will decrease eventually graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water quality nutrient dynamics water depth vertical distribution plateau lake china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction lakes provide numerous important ecosystem services such as the provision of water sources for drinking and irrigation mitigation of flood disasters and ecotourism steinman et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sterner et al 2020 however given rapid urbanization intense agricultural activities and industrial wastewater discharge the deterioration of the water quality of lakes has become a major global concern in recent decades especially in developing countries liang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 phosphorus is one of the essential elements for the growth of living organisms but in excessive concentrations can trigger severe eutrophication wang and liang 2015 li et al 2022 deep lakes usually experience less eutrophication than shallow lakes both regionally liboriussen et al 2009 liu et al 2012 and globally qin et al 2020 this difference is likely driven by the stronger thermal stratification of deep lakes which is a key regulator of biogeochemical cycles in lakes qin et al 2020 li et al 2022 according to the vertical changes in temperature and sediment water interactions the water column in deep lakes can be delineated into the epilimnion surface layer metalimnion thermocline and hypolimnion bottom layer qin et al 2020 numerous nutrients such as phosphorus and other pollutants settle out of the epilimnion and can get released from the sediments while thermal stratification hinders the exchange of materials between different water layers song et al 2013 li et al 2022 as a result gradients in lake chemistry are likely to be formed throughout the water column however studies on the vertical distribution of nutrients in large deep lakes are lacking especially on those associated with eutrophication in china there are 2700 lakes with surface areas exceeding 1 km2 of these lakes more than two thirds are located in the high plateau regions wang and dou 1998 wang et al 2018 compared to lakes in floodplains the ecosystems of plateau lakes are arguably more susceptible and vulnerable to eutrophication because of their longer water residence times and simpler food chains liu et al 2012 qin et al 2020 in particular liu et al 2012 used the trophic state index and revealed that seven of the nine lakes in the yunnan plateau were eutrophic outbreaks of local cyanobacterial blooms can intermittently occur in summer even in oligotrophic lakes such as fuxian lake li et al 2007 fuxian lake is the deepest lake in the yunnan plateau with maximum and mean depths of 155 m and 89 6 m respectively wang and dou 1998 notably fuxian lake is generally oligotrophic with total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations of 0 154 mg l and 0 013 mg l respectively in surface water wang and dou 1998 since the 1990s the water quality of fuxian lake has been maintained at a fairly high level but the water quality deterioration trend is now distinct chen et al 2019 thus far most studies on the water quality of the fuxian lake have focused on the surface layer chen et al 2019 whereas the nutrient status and influencing factors in deeper water layers for such deep lakes are poorly understood this study investigated the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of phosphorus and its related environmental variables in the fuxian lake a previous study indicated that water quality parameters did not exhibit significant differences between the wet and dry seasons in the yunnan plateau lakes liu et al 2012 based on this we first hypothesized that the phosphorus concentrations in water do not exhibit significant inter monthly variability phosphorus in the surface water layer deposited on the lakebed and can get released from the sediments while thermal stratification hampers the phosphorus exchange between different layers therefore we secondly hypothesized that the phosphorus concentration was lower in surface water than in bottom water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area fuxian lake 24 21 24 38 n 102 49 102 57 e is a warm monomictic lake located on the yunnan plateau in southwestern china xing et al 2020 it is the largest rift lake in china with an area of 211 km2 and has a surface elevation of 1722 m above sea level wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 the lake length is 31 5 km and the maximum width is 11 5 km fig 1 the water volume is 189 0 108 m3 the distribution of inflow rivers is as follows the larger rivers are spread in the northern watershed while smaller rivers are located in the western and eastern basins wang et al 2018 fig 1 shows that the haikou river represents the only outflow to the lower catchment the fuxian lake catchment covers an area of 674 7 km2 chen et al 2019 the land use type is forest 33 57 of the total watershed area followed by water 30 14 cropland 25 42 grassland 7 73 shrub 2 00 and impervious surface 1 14 the water outflow and volume of the lake have previously indicated that the mean water residence time is 167 years wang and dou 1998 wang et al 2018 from a climatological point of view the yunnan plateau is characterized by the southwestern monsoon induced seasonality with distinctly dry and wet seasons the wet season normally lasts from may to october the mean annual precipitation from 2018 to 2020 was 847 0 mm with 68 4 occurring from june to october the mean monthly air temperature is 17 3 c with the hottest month in june 22 4 c and the coldest month in january 10 8 c there is a complete mixing period in winter when the surface water cools to the same temperature as the bottom water xing et al 2020 2 2 field sampling we set three transects in the northern central and southern parts of the fuxian lake based on their geographical locations hydrological regimes and pollution features fig 1 along each transect we set up three or four plots for monthly water quality monitoring in particular we monitored the water quality at the surface layer 0 5 m 20 0 m 40 0 m 60 0 m and 80 0 m water depths from a depth of 80 0 m to the bottom layer we sampled every 10 m until the lakebed we measured the water temperature in situ by using a reversing thermometer following the chinese national standard gb 13195 91 we measured the ph and dissolved oxygen do in situ by using a multiparameter water quality monitoring instrument wtw multi 3410 germany furthermore water transparency was determined in situ by using the secchi depth sd method we collected 10 l of water in each layer using a free flow water sampler 436 390 hydro bios germany in addition we collected 5 kg of the top sediment layer of the lakebed 0 10 cm depth using a 1 16 m2 peterson sediment sampler the water and sediment samples were packaged in polyethylene film and plastic sampling bottles they were subsequently stored in a refrigerator at the yunnan center of ecological environment monitoring laboratory where we performed all the physical and chemical analyses we analyzed total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip following the chinese national standard gb11893 1989 to measure tp a 25 ml water sample was first digested with potassium persulfate then it was reacted with ascorbic acid and molybdate subsequently the tp concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at the wavelength of 700 μm for tdp the water was first filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size millipore filter and then determined by the tp procedure zhu et al 2015 for the dip the filtered water sample without digestion was determined by using the tp procedure after the extraction with 90 ethanol we measured chlorophyll a chl a concentrations using spectrophotometry at the wavelengths of 750 664 647 and 630 nm following the standard of environmental protection of china hj 897 2017 the sediment samples were air dried in the shade and sieved through a 20 or 60 mesh screen for further analysis of sediment total phosphorus stp and olsen phosphorus sop the soil samples were digested with sodium hydroxide then the stp was colorimetrically measured using the ascorbic acid reduction method olsen phosphorus sop was extracted with a 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate solution and measured colorimetrically using the ascorbic acid reduction method 2 3 statistical analyses climate data from eight meteorological stations around fuxian lake were obtained from the yunnan center of ecological environment monitoring first we used regression to analyze spatial and temporal changes in environmental variables of the fuxian lake if the data did not satisfy the variance homogeneity test we conducted kruskal wallis rank sum test we determine to use linear or nonlinear regression based on the distribution of the data in the scatter plot and chose the best fitting regression curve based on the value of r2 second we analyzed the variance to determine the statistical significance of the phosphorus concentration depending on months water depths and transects if the data did not satisfy the variance homogeneity test we conducted nonparametric tests to determine if there were significant spatio temporal differences in the water phosphorus variables third we divided the 14 sampling water depths into two groups based on the vertical water temperature gradient wang et al 2017 varol 2020 groupiincluded 0 5 m and 20 0 m water depths which corresponds to the epilimnion of the lake group ii included the water depth of 40 0 150 0 m corresponding to the hypolimnion of the lake wang et al 2017 fourth we used multi regression analyses to determine the influence of environmental variables on water phosphorus within the two groups we conducted log or square root sqrt transformation to improve the variables homoscedasticity finally we applied the averaged over ordering method to evaluate the variance explained by environmental variables in each water depth group huang et al 2022 all the statistical analyses were performed using the r package version 4 4 1 3 results 3 1 site

relationship between water phosphorus and environmental factors varied among the two water depth groups specifically the water tp in group i was positively correlated with air temperature and precipitation however the water tp in group ii was positively correlated with ph and air temperature and negatively associated with do and water temperature table 3 the water tdp in group i was positively correlated with do and air temperature however the water tdp in group ii was positively correlated with ph and chl a and negatively correlated with do table 3 the water dip in group i was positively correlated with do air temperature and sop and negatively correlated with ph however the water dip in group ii was positively correlated with chl a and negatively correlated with do the averaged over ordering method suggests that for group i do and air temperature accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp 62 tdp 65 and dip 58 fig 6a in addition water temperature accounted for 15 13 and 14 of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip respectively fig 6a for group ii do accounted for a higher proportion of the explained variance of tp 44 tdp 50 and dip 42 fig 6b in addition ph accounted for 14 10 and 21 of the explained variance of tp tdp and dip respectively fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 decreasing trend of monthly water total phosphorus concentration in 2021 notably the concentrations of tp in fuxian lake did not exhibit seasonal variation but showed a decreasing trend from january to december 2021 a previous study indicated that nutrient concentrations exhibited no significant differences between wet and dry seasons in the yunnan plateau lakes because the watersheds were dominated by vegetation and were less affected by agricultural activities liu et al 2012 however our results demonstrated that the water tp concentration exhibited a significantly decreasing trend at the intermonth scale fig 4a to protect the water of fuxian lake from eutrophication and pollution the government has implemented numerous measures in the last 10 years such as the construction of a riparian buffer zone prohibition of a phosphate mining and improvement of the capacity of wastewater treatment as a result the water quality has been improving and phosphorus concentrations have generally been decreasing since 2019 yang et al 2021 therefore these measures can help minimize the influence of seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation on phosphorus concentration based on this it can be inferred that phosphorus concentrations in water are not necessarily affected by weather variability but can be controlled using various phosphorus control approaches 4 2 higher water phosphorus concentration in the northern basin our results also showed that the concentrations of tp and tdp were significantly higher in the northern basin than in the central and southern basins the main industrial and agricultural areas are distributed in the northern plain of the catchment the same areas form the economic core of the region dai et al 2017 there are also more inflow rivers which represent the main pollutants clustered in the northern basin of fuxian lake fig 1 moreover numerous rivers in the northern catchment area suffer from severe tn tp and organic pollution caused by phosphorus based chemical production and runoff from agricultural areas especially from paddy fields dai et al 2017 wang et al 2018 despite the recent efforts to control pollution sources non point source pollution especially nitrogen and phosphorus stemming from agricultural cultivation and domestic wastewater remains a problem in the northern basin of the lake yao et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that a considerable proportion of domestic wastewater especially in rural settlements of the yunnan plateau had not been treated properly before its release into the river liu et al 2012 dai et al 2017 moreover the lake is affected by the southeastern monsoon thereby inducing more intense accumulation of potential pollutants in the northern basin yao et al 2017 4 3 increasing phosphorus concentration along water depth fundamentally thermal stratification plays a critical role in regulating the internal nutrient dynamics of deep lakes with low flow rates qin et al 2020 li et al 2022 thermal stratification of fuxian lake was elucidated in this study where the hypolimnion of 40 0 150 0 m lakebed was identified and where the temperature remained steady at 15 c fig 3a note that some previous studies have revealed slight variations of biochemical parameters for several lakes and reservoirs with thermal structures below a certain water depth mao et al 2018 li et al 2022 however we found that the concentrations of tp tdp and dip increased almost linearly with water depth in the fuxian lake the vertical profile of phosphorus is primarily determined by the input sedimentation vertical material exchange between water columns and release of phosphorus from sediment into the water column vollenweider 1975 qin et al 2020 in the fuxian lake phosphorus constantly settled to the bottom of the water columns yao et al 2017 whereas the recycling of dissolved phosphorus in the hypolimnion is hampered from the bottom water column song et al 2013 li et al 2022 furthermore these processes are exacerbated by the water column stratification and stability li et al 2022 regarding fuxian lake the vertical profile of phosphorus that had increased from the surface layer to the bottom is likely to be formed and retained by the long term external source input deposition of phosphate in deeper water sediment phosphorus release and water column stratification sediment is an important sink of phosphorus and also acts as a source releasing phosphorus into the water column through processes of diffusion convection and resuspension müller et al 2012 sediment phosphorus concentrations were the highest in the southern basin and lowest in the norther basin which contrasts with phosphorus concentrations in the water column higher sediment phosphorus concentration in the southern basin may reflect the historically sediment supply through gehe river from xingyun lake which is a eutrophic lake located to the south of the fuxian lake wang et al 2018 although the connection between fuxian lake and xingyun lake has been cut off in 2007 total phosphorus in sediments was still higher in the southern basin the tp concentration in the sediments was somewhat high in the fuxian lake with the range of 1571 2253 mg kg 1 thereby signifying much higher values than that of several eutrophic lakes such as chaohu lake 585 mg kg 1 wang et al 2021 and western taihu lake 337 3 1081 9 mg kg 1 wang et al 2019 if most of the p is bound to a stable fraction higher tp concentration in the sediment does not necessarily mean the internal loading will be high anderson et al 2021 however under the anaerobic conditions of the hypolimnion the iron oxide was reduced and the phosphate adsorbed by the iron oxide was released into the overlying water this phenomenon was a potential driver behind the increased tp levels in the bottom layer li et al 2022 4 4 the relation between water phosphorus with environmental variables both the regression models and averaged over ordering method revealed that the concentrations of water phosphorus were affected by various factors among the two water depth groups table 3 fig 6 in the shallow water layer 0 5 20 0 m which corresponded to the epilimnion phosphorus concentration was mostly affected by do and air temperature table 3 fig 6 however it was also affected by water temperature and precipitation in general the epilimnetic layer makes contact with the atmosphere and is mixed by precipitation and wind qin et al 2020 warmer temperatures in the epilimnion are conducive to algal growth as indicated by the higher chl a concentration in the shallow water layer zhu et al 2015 saros et al 2016 the growth of algae could absorb some amounts of phosphate at the beginning but the consequent decomposition of algae decreased do and induced the phosphate release from the decomposing algae and sediment the contribution of do to phosphorus concentration became more conspicuous in the deep water layer 40 0 150 0 m depth than in the surface water layer fig 6 the low levels of do in the bottom water were mainly driven by the decomposition of organic matter and by the lack of exchange with the upper water layer müller et al 2012 under prolonged anoxic conditions at the sediment water interface inorganic phosphorus can be released from iron hydroxides in sediments liboriussen et al 2009 foster and fulweiler 2019 hypolimnetic hypoxia can arguably exacerbate the release of soluble reactive phosphorus from sediments into surrounding water rogora et al 2018 anderson et al 2021 although hypolimnetic hypoxia was likely responsible for the internal phosphorus flux the active mechanisms of hypoxic extent on phosphorus dynamics are unclear for very deep lakes such as fuxian lake overall our findings provide important implications for managing phosphorus budgets as described below 4 5 implications for the management of deep lakes phosphorus enrichment in the bottom water of fuxian lake has attracted considerable attention and consequent concerns the tp concentrations in the bottom water have been estimated to be 0 0136 mg l in 2001 0 026 mg l in 2005 and 0 028 0 029 mg l in 2009 yao et al 2017 in 2021 the phosphorus concentration in the bottom water reached 0 065 mg l while in the last two decades phosphorus concentration has increased nearly two fold the water quality of fuxian lake was protected by law to maintain grade i state environmental protection administration 2002 although the phosphorus concentration in surface water was generally maintained at grade i 0 01 mg l thereby meeting the environmental quality standards for surface water of china higher concentrations of phosphorus in deeper water and sediment may still pose a larger potential risk for eutrophication our findings demonstrate that more efficient technical and management measures should be taken to reduce the external load of fuxian lake especially considering its ecological importance and vulnerability 5 conclusions this study examined the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of phosphorus and its related environmental variables in fuxian lake the concentrations of water tp did not exhibit seasonal variation but showed a decreasing trend from january to december 2021 generally the concentrations of tp tdp and dip exhibited a linear increase with greater water depth phosphorus was affected primarily by do and air temperature in the shallow water layer in contrast it was predominantly affected by do and ph in the deeper water layer the higher observed phosphorus concentrations in deeper water and sediment potentially pose a eutrophication risk in the future credit authorship contribution statement you ai duan conceptualization methodology writing original draft xin sheng

1229,applying wastewater in subsurface drip irrigation helps address water shortage in arid and semi arid environments microbial contamination may result but soil amendments such as biochar could help protect soil and water resources to improve understanding this study investigated spatio temporal dynamics of fecal coliform retention in a biochar treated soil under subsurface drip irrigation two

the lysimeters were filled with biochar treated soil and had drippers located at 20 cm depth three irrigations were performed for either q and soil samples were taken after each irrigation at different times at the lysimeter centre at 5 15 25 and 50 cm depths and at the edge at 20 cm depth labeled 20 l soils containing biochar had much greater recovered coliforms from soil than the unamended controls the greatest retention was at 15 and 25 cm depth within 5 cm of the dripper for 1 biochar with the recovered cells about 70 for 2 l hr 1 discharge and 60 for 4 l hr 1 discharge the greatest concentration occurred immediately after irrigation but over 10 days the number of coliforms gradually decreased and inactivated therefore the coliform residence time soil depth and biochar rate all influenced coliform retention if the discharge rates and mads were considered we recommend slower subsurface dripper rates with high mad and biochar amendment to minimize fecal coliform

with water scarcity wen et al 2016 the reuse of wastewater in agriculture has now become a key practice to preserve water resources wen et al 2017 guy et al 2011 annually about 400 billion m3 of wastewater is produced from different sectors e g urban agriculture and industries across the world and it is expected to increase 51 by 2050 qadir et al 2020 zhang and shen 2017 regardless of the other contaminants wastewaters contain a large number of microorganisms e g bacteria protozoa viruses and parasite eggs that are human pathogens ibekwe et al 2018 the number and the type of pathogens vary in raw wastewaters depending on the source and treatment levels guy et al 2011 the concentrations of total coliform fecal coliform and escherichia coli e coli can occur from 107 to 109 105 108 and 105 1010 cfu l 1 respectively guy et al 2011 therefore wastewater irrigation imposes microbial pollution to the soil and environment prior to applying wastewater to soil several strategies are used to eliminate soil bacteria pollution e g solarization field steaming disinfectants methyl bromide fumigation antimicrobial drip irrigation and flaming gurtler et al 2020 gurtler et al 2014 however these techniques can be expensive and cause ecotoxicity from the wastewater that may damage beneficial soil microorganisms gurtler et al 2014 another approach to decrease the impacts of pathogens on soil contamination due to utilizing of wastewater could be the use of biochar biochar at 5 application rate was found to remove 85 of coliform appearing in leachate of silty loam soil columns irrigated over 4 months with municipal wastewater asghari et al 2022 in another study using poultry litter biochar at a 10 application rate bolster and abit 2012 observed that e coli transport decreased 5 fold compared to the controls in sandy soil columns 10 cm height however as biochar quality affects retention and antimicrobial impacts gurtler et al 2020 proposed fast pyrolysis generated biochars as an effective substance for e coli removal but also reported that age and temperature at which biochar produced are important suliman et al 2017 found mixing sand with pine wood biochar retained the pathogenic e coli in subsurface biochar is a carbon rich product produced via the thermal decomposition of many waste biomass feedstocks in the absence of or limited oxygen conditions guo et al 2021 gurtler et al 2020 biochar has thus gained considerable attention as an adsorbent and an amendment for the removal of contaminants from soil due to its low cost and useful properties e g high porosity specific surface area tong et al 2020 ahmad et al 2014 in general biochar application to soils can increase microbial populations microbial activity soil water holding capacity seed germination plant growth and yield productivity soil respiration rate and improvement of soil health resulting in decreases of nutrient leaching improve productivity and greater capacity to withstand mitigate climate change ahmad et al 2014 and effects on co2 emissions and soil mineralization jiang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 there have been several studies exploring how biochar affects the removal of pathogens and bacteria transport for water filtration systems for example kaetzl et al 2019 showed that biochar filters perform better than sand filters in the removal of fecal bacteria in wastewater due to the higher surface areas and the adsorption capacity demonstrated by less contamination from effluent for water irrigation of plants perez mercadoa et al 2019 distinguished particle diameters of biochar as a key factor in bacteria and virus removal and clarified the on farm biochar filters with three particle diameters including 1 4 2 8 and 5 mm were unsuccessful in removing bacterial and viral indicators in wastewater mohanty and boehm 2014 found that biochar amendment sand biofilter removed e coli by 96 from stormwaters the efficacy of biochar on bacteria retention has been found to depend on biochar type and the microorganisms abit et al 2014 the very large surface area of biochar could be responsible for its high removal rate of the pathogens as demonstrated in biochar filters kaetzl et al 2019 straining biofilm formation and the surface filtration of solid particles were other reasons for bacteria deposition by biochar by extension suliman et al 2017 attributed the collision efficiencies and the cell attachment of bacteria to the physicochemical properties of biochar in sand columns based on the potential capacity of biochar to mitigate pathogen and bacterial transport one application could be subsurface irrigation with wastewater to cope with water shortage and alleviate pathogens in soil subsurface drip irrigation has been widely used for wastewater application and compared to other irrigation systems e g flooding it can increase water use efficiency and reduce evaporation grecco et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 in subsurface drip irrigation systems water has laminar flow under the ground so bacteria movement can be considerably restricted compared to flooding counterparts esteves et al 2020 plauborg et al 2010 plastic irrigation tubes located at lower soil depths often coupled with lateral tubes to increase dispersal can reduce surface contamination at the same time this can increase water percolation depth which protects bacteria from harsh environmental conditions e g ultraviolet radiation heat etc and thus prolong bacteria survival it would be useful to apply best management practices to minimize bacteria movement and distribution through soil there is greater bacteria removal for subsurface drip irrigation compared to surface systems e g campos et al 2000 qiu et al 2017 wen et al 2016 wen et al 2016 at comparable water discharge rates i e 1 to 5 76 l hr 1 demonstrated that surface drip irrigation with lower discharge rates limits bacteria movement through soil while an increase in application rate could result in a wider distribution of e coli concentration through soil wen et al s 2016 research shows that for two soils with sandy and sandy loam textures about 70 and 98 of the bacteria are detected within a 10 and 5 cm radius of the pollution source respectively in a two year study to investigate e coli transport after applying secondary sewage effluent li and wen 2016 monitored 0 10 and 20 cm depths under three irrigation intervals 4 8 and 12 days and three irrigation levels in their research high irrigation frequency caused an increase of bacteria in soil and bacteria concentration in the surface layer of the soil increased as the amount of secondary sewage increased they concluded that subsurface drip irrigation provides less microbial contamination risk for the surface soil and plants than surface drip irrigation qiu et al 2017 studied e coli leaching from wastewater in field conditions during the growing period of maize zea mays l and did not observe any bacteria in drains at depths of 0 15 and 30 cm for three irrigation levels 70 100 and 130 of plant evapotranspiration requirements they reported that most bacteria were retained at 15 cm depth and deficit irrigation is the best practice to prevent soil microbial contamination therefore there is a knowledge gap for how bacteria fate will be influenced as the result of irrigation management in terms of maximum allowable depletion mad and the flow interruption which is needed to find the best practices for wastewater and biochar application in semi arid and arid areas mad is the main parameter for irrigation scheduling and designating the depth and interval of irrigation mad determines the maximum amount of soil water that based on irrigation management the crop can extract from the root zone between irrigations woodruff et al 1972 the different values of mad can cause various moisture contents in the soil before doing irrigation it has been found that spatio temporal variations of bacteria in soil and water can highly influence their growth and mortality and thus their fate as pollutants stocker et al 2015 bacteria concentrations at their source vary temporally creating a crucial factor of spatial temporal dynamics of bacteria in porous media sowah et al 2020 further spatio temporal variability is driven within the soil compared to deeper soil bacteria near the soil surface experience greater environmental stress from soil moisture jeon et al 2019 so become inactive or have shorter lifespans than at deeper depths tripathi et al 2019 therefore spatio temporal variations impact bacterial soil and water pollution which needs careful consideration in devising best management practices strategies to alleviate the risks of wastewater in irrigation however studies on bacteria spatio temporal variations have been mostly conducted at watershed scales using mathematical models rather than column and lysimeter experiments jeon et al 2019 kim et al 2018 particularly there are also some studies in this area that address bacteria transport and fate as the result of wastewater irrigation tabatabaei et al 2017 and soil and bacteria wettability texture manure type and flow interruption sepehrnia et al 2018 sepehrnia et al 2017 for example in a field experiment exploring cultivating turfgrass under subsurface drip irrigation using municipal wastewater fecal coliform near the soil surface decreased with increasing laterals depth tabatabaei et al 2017 in soil column experiments with soil from this region sepehrnia et al 2019 found that bacteria are highly mobile during irrigation and released due to changes in soil wettability under flow interruption in addition other studies conducted in this area explored solid manure management to control bacteria pollution sepehrnia et al 2021 tabatabaei et al 2022 however the impacts of biochar on bacteria fate that originated from wastewater water with regards to water management policies have not been reported we hypothesize that the dripper discharge rate with regard to mad soil depth biochar and the residence time of bacteria in soil are the field and management factors that can control spatio temporal dynamics of fecal coliforms additionally the clay loam soil used in this study has a much heavier texture compared to sandy loams found in previous studies e g li and wen 2016 so we provide more information about soil texture and the required water management strategies for minimizing bacterial pollution risk in soils though the effect of biochar on bacteria in the soil has been investigated in other studies there has been no direct study to explore the mad and biochar impacts on bacteria distribution under subsurface drip irrigation we thus considered mad to find an irrigation management practice through the control of bacteria retention via biochar therefore we aimed to understand the importance of biochar application for the removal of bacteria originated from wastewater under subsurface irrigation this research informs water management irrigation policies in semi arid areas building on previous research limited to column studies overall the main objectives of this study were i to evaluate the spatio temporal variation of bacteria under various biochar application rates at different depths and ii to propose the best water management practices for the subsurface irrigation with regards to the effects of mad water discharge and biochar rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 site study and the lysimeter set up the study was performed at a research farm in a greenhouse under controlled temperature 25 c located in the college of agriculture of shahrekord university 32 21 20 n 50 49 42 e shahrekord iran the annual average temperature was 11 5 c and precipitation 116 mm a field that was fallow for a year was used with characteristics of the soil and biochar in table 1 the soil had clay loam texture and classified as an inceptisol soil survey staff 2014 with 28 clay 34 5 silt and 36 5 sand the soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth in plastic containers and the plant debris was removed soil samples were air dried passed through a 2 mm sieve and mixed completely biochar see below for description was mixed with soil at rates of 0 0 5 and 1 w w 0 5 and 10 g per 1000 g soil wang et al 2019 soil with without biochar was packed into lysimeters in 5 cm increments at a soil field bulk density of 1 31 mg m 3 physical and chemical soil properties such as texture by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 electrical conductivity ec using ec meter and ph by ph meter rhoades 1996 sims 1996 are given in table 1 the experimental set up consisted of 18 glass lysimeters schematically shown in fig 1 the lysimeters l 70 cm w 17 cm d 60 cm were filled with the biochar treated soil and soil material as the control the soil was not sterilized to simulate natural soil conditions however sampling showed no fecal coliforms for soil before the beginning of the experiments the lysimeter walls were made from glass and treated with a very thin layer of grease prior to irrigation to prevent preferential flow along the walls kandelous and šimůnek 2010 the 0 38 mm wall thickness of the dripline 16 mm internal diameter with inline pressure compensating dripper in an operating range of 70 410 kpa sun water iran was installed at 20 cm depth at the centre of each lysimeter and connected to a wastewater reservoir containing fecal coliforms 3 99 1 4 105 cfu ml 1 several holes at the bottom of the lysimeters drained effluent 2 2 biochar the commercial biochar was prepared from sun company located in fars province iran it was produced from the soft wood materials of pomegranate punica granatum and plum prunus domestica pyrolyzed at 450 500 c the biochar was sieved to 2 mm filipovic et al 2020 liao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 to maximize biochar removal capacity mohanty and boehm 2014 the specific surface areas of biochar and soil were determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method brunauer et al 1938 the ph 1 5 of biochar was measured by ph meter rayment and higginson 1992 the properties of the biochar are given in table 1 2 3 bacteria preparation fecal coliforms are indicator organisms of bacterial contamination which are commonly used to check for the removal of pathogens from wastewater treatment plants mara and horan 2003 we harvested fecal coliforms as the indicator microorganism pang et al 2008 sepehrnia et al 2018 from a raw wastewater provided by shahrekord wastewater treatment plant iran macconkey agar was used to grow cells through incubation at 44 5 c for 24 h for either irrigation described in section 2 4 a bacteria suspension 30 9 2 ml containing 3 99 1 4 105 cfu ml 1 was prepared and added to the irrigation water ecwater 0 32 ds m 1 song et al 2006 the population was monitored by the plate counting method in triplicate prior to each irrigation 2 4 lysimeter irrigation the two discharge rates 2 l hr 1 q2 and 4 l hr 1 q4 were based on farmer practice for subsurface drip irrigation in this region thereby providing practical data about the impacts of biochar application irrigation was performed when the average of the soil water content at depths of 10 and 20 cm reached θmad the amount of irrigation depths and the values of θmad are calculated from eqns 1 and 2 respectively martin et al 1990 1 θ mad θ fc θ fc θ pwp mad 2 d θ fc θ mad d where θfc and θpwp are the volumetric water content moistures at field capacity and permanent wilting points cm3 cm 3 respectively the mad represents the maximum allowable depletion d is the irrigation depth cm and d is the depth of the soil cm in the first irrigation all treatments were irrigated to field capacity forslund et al 2011 the second and the third irrigations were performed according to the maximum allowable depletion related to either treatment soil water content was monitored using a sm300 moisture meter delta t devices cambridge uk at the intervals of the irrigations through small ports installed on the right half of the lysimeters wall the intervals and the applied polluted water volumes of the either irrigation changed based on the mad and the rate of added biochar so the longest irrigation interval was m70b1 nearly 12 days and the shortest one was m30 treatments 3 days the lysimeter walls were protected from direct sunlight during the experiments the depth of irrigation water was 17 cm in the first irrigation for all treatments on subsequent irrigations it was calculated for each treatment by eq 2 and applied as described in table 2 2 5 soil and bacteria sampling as mentioned above the dripper was installed at 20 cm depth and soil samples were collected at 5 points fig 1 depths of 5 15 25 and 50 cm at the centre of the lysimeter and at 20 cm depth at the edge of lysimeter to explore lateral flow and bacteria distribution at the edge of the wetting front labeled 20 l this spatial sampling was to determine the distribution of fecal coliforms through the soil profile and the wetted soil volume li and wen 2016 the depths of 5 cm were selected to consider the effect of upward capillary forces on bacteria movement and the depth of 15 cm was to illustrate the plough layer the 15 cm and 25 cm depths described bacteria distribution around the emitter as the zone with the highest soil moisture content moreover these points were selected to compare our results with other studies li and wen 2016 in addition the depth of 50 cm the lowest point in our experiment traced the downward bacteria transport as a risk of subsurface irrigation to detect the fate of bacteria sampling was performed immediately before and after either irrigation and 24 and 48 h later these times were based on the previous studies li and wen 2016 and based on bacteria inactivation at different times after irrigation found in the literatures kouznetsov et al 2004 li and wen 2016 samples were immediately transferred to the lab from which one gram of soil in three replications were subsampled the samples were placed into containers containing 9 ml of sterilized distilled water and mixed on the shaker for 30 min guber et al 2005 an aliquot 0 1 ml of the diluted solutions was used to culture cells on macconkey agar this is a selective and differential culture medium used for rapid detection of gram negative bacteria elazhary et al 1973 lactose fermenting bacteria positive lactose in this environment produce purple colonies with and bacteria that are unable to ferment lactose negative lactose create colorless colonies wanger et al 2017 after incubation 24 h at 44 0 5 c swanson et al 1992 each purple spot grown on the medium culture was counted visually as one fecal coliform colony the numbers of bacteria colonies on a plate was finally considered as the colony forming units cfu the bacteria concentration dimensionless in the solid phase per 1 g soil was plotted using the s c0 term versus time 2 6 bacteria inactivation bacteria inactivation was calculated for different time intervals using eq 3 hruby et al 2018 stocker et al 2015 3 c c 0 exp μt where c is the concentration of bacteria in the soil at time t c 0 is the initial bacteria concentration in the soil immediately after stoppage of irrigation t is the time and μ is the bacteria reduction coefficient t 1 2 7 data analysis statistical analysis was done using a randomized factorial blocks design performed in statistica 8 0 at the 0 05 level of probability four factors were considered as the independent factors including two discharges q2 and q4 three levels of biochar b0 0 b 0 5 0 5 and b1 1 w w three maximum allowable depletions m30 m50 and md70 and five depths 0 5 15 25 50 and 20 l cm to investigate the changes of coliform concentrations as the dependent variable two separate statistical analyses were performed in this study the first one was for bacteria concentration found at different soil sampling events and the second one was for bacteria inactivation rate that was found based on calculations using eq 3 the concentration of bacteria and inactivation rate were thus considered as the dependent variables in the first and the second analyses respectively and the biochar rates 0 0 5 and 1 mad 30 50 and 70 discharge rates 2 and 4 l hr 1 and the number of irrigations were independent factors the lsd was used to perform mean separations furthermore we assessed the flow interruption effect on bacteria concentration based on the six random time of soil sampling t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t12 and three selected irrigation times t1 t4 t8 among the whole irrigation periods i e t1 to t12 the selected ones were related to the beginning time of irrigation 3 results 3 1 soil and biochar properties the ph of soil was 8 07 0 11 and biochar was 7 37 0 21 adding biochar reduced mixture ph but its value was the same for the soils treated with 0 5 and 1 biochar the ec of biochar 0 43 ds m 1 was significantly higher than the soil 0 112 ds m 1 and biochar amended soils the ec values for the biochar treated soil mixtures 0 5 and 1 were 0 133 and 0 135 ds m 1 which were slightly higher than the control soil i e 0 112 ds m 1 furthermore adding 0 5 and 1 biochar to the soil resulted in increasing available water 4 and 12 respectively the cation content such as ca2 and mg2 were also higher for the two mixtures than the control soil more information about the statistical analyses of soil biochar and biochar treated soil properties is presented in table 1 3 2 dripper discharge rate impacts the distribution of fecal coliforms for the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate and the three levels of mad at different depths are illustrated in fig 2a c the most fecal coliforms were found around the dripper radius of 5 cm the fecal coliform concentration at 25 cm depth was significantly higher than that at 15 cm if the mads are considered p 0 0001 the concentration of fecal coliforms at 15 cm depth for the m30 was higher than m50 and m70 p 0 0001 there were no fecal coliforms recovered in the first irrigation at 5 cm depth while the concentration increased after the second and third irrigations for this depth a sharp decline in concentration occurred after stoppage of each irrigation in all levels of the mads if compared with the other depths so that the concentration dropped to zero before the beginning of next irrigation a similar trend was found for bacteria concentration at 20 l cm and 50 cm depth fluctuations in the fecal coliforms concentration were notable at these two positions there was no significant difference between these points 5 20 l cm and 50 cm if the various mads are considered p 0 0001 for the 4 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 2d f the maximum concentrations of fecal coliforms were also observed around the dripper located at 15 and 25 cm depths for these points the amount of fecal coliforms increased after each irrigation following a decreasing trend the retained fecal coliforms at 25 cm depth was significantly higher than at 15 cm depth s c0 0 42 vs 0 36 respectively the highest s c0 0 46 and the lowest s c0 0 31 cell retention with regard to mad were at 25 cm depth for the m30 and 15 cm depth for the m70 p 0 0001 respectively the fecal coliform concentration at 5 cm depth and m30 was higher than the m50 and m70 but there was not a significant difference between them p 0 05 similarly cell concentration decreased and reached zero during the two irrigation intervals for 4 l hr 1 the retained fecal coliforms s c0 was 0 0037 at the depth of 50 cm if the m30 and m70 are considered the concentration of fecal coliforms at point of 20 l cm for various mads was less than compared with the 50 cm depth there was no significant difference between the s c0 for 50 and 20 l cm depth with regard to the mads p 0 05 therefore the statistical analysis revealed that the retained fecal coliforms for the two discharge rates were significantly different p 0 05 further details are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 regardless of the discharge rates the treatments with the m30 always had larger cell concentrations at upper and lower parts of the dripper the amount of retained fecal coliforms for 2 l hr 1 discharge with m30 was higher than that of 4 l hr 1 discharge the fecal coliform concentration gradually decreased after termination of each irrigation before the second and the third irrigation this was especially obvious for m50 and m70 the smallest amount of fecal coliform was observed in the last sampling time that was done 10 days after the termination of the last irrigation p 0 05 3 3 biochar impacts the distribution of fecal coliforms for the 0 5 and 1 biochar treated lysimeters are presented in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively if the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate is considered the retained fecal coliforms for 1 biochar lysimeters was significantly higher than the 0 5 counterpart particularly at 25 and 15 cm depths fig 3 and fig 4 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference in the amount of retained fecal coliforms for 5 20 l and 50 cm depths the mad data illustrated that there was no significant difference in retained fecal coliforms between m30 and m50 while the retained fecal coliforms under m70 was significantly less than the other mads p 0 05 the q2m50b1 and q2m30b1 had the highest retained fecal coliforms compared to the other treatments the minimum concentration was observed for q2m70b0 5 by extension for the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 3a c and fig 4a c shows that there were no culturable fecal coliforms at 0 5 cm depth in lysimeters treated with 0 5 and 1 biochar for the various mads except q2m30b0 5 after beginning of the first irrigation by the third irrigation that dramatically decreased to zero therefore the possible reason is the longer intervals between the irrigations that impacted upward water flow and bacteria movement and consequently bacteria die off and probably a higher irreversible attachment rate under the m50 and m70 if compared with m30 the distribution of bacteria for the discharge 4 l hr 1 and the two applied biochar rates with regards to the three levels of mad are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the application of 1 biochar resulted in increase of 1 21 times higher cell retention compared to the 0 5 rate which was notable around the dripper depths of 15 and 25 cm p 0 05 similar to 2 l hr 1 with and without biochar treatments the minimum concentration of fecal coliforms was at 5 cm depth for 4 l hr 1 however there was no significant difference in fecal coliform retention rate between the two biochar application rates following a slightly more bacteria at depth of 20 l and 50 cm but with no significant difference between them p 0 05 addition of 1 biochar to soil resulted in 1 1 1 1 and 1 2 fold increase for the fecal coliform retention under mad 30 50 and 70 at of 25 cm depth compared to the 0 5 rate 3 4 fecal coliform survival the fecal coliform reduction coefficient in the course of maximum minimum and average die off was 0 046 0 0023 0 007 0 001 and 0 026 0 0098 day 1 as given in table 3 the values of coefficients for the control lysimeters under 2 l hr 1 discharge correspond to the mads of 30 50 and 70 and were 0 033 0 010 0 029 0 010 and 0 026 0 010 day 1 respectively for the 4 l hr 1 discharge they were 0 034 0 011 0 026 0 016 and 0 027 0 013 day 1 respectively for control soils the fecal coliform survival was most likely higher under 30 mad than 50 and 70 mad due to its short interval irrigation times although the statistical analysis showed no significant effects of the discharge rate p 0 05 biochar significantly promoted fecal coliform survival so that the 1 biochar had a stronger effect than either the 0 5 rate or control soil table 3 the details of die off coefficient values with regard to the mads and the irrigation are presented in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation bacteria retention mechanisms in porous media are attachment straining i e pore throat retention grain grain contacts and trapping in capillary forces i e film straining that all are well established e g bradford et al 2013 bradford and torkzaban 2008 the two discharge rates had the greatest fecal coliforms around the dripper one in the upper depth 15 cm and another one in the lower depth 25 cm from the dripper position 20 cm fig 2 for the low discharge rate 2 l hr 1 fig 2a c the contact time of fecal coliforms and the collectors was higher than that of the 4 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 2d f which could increase the probability of fecal coliform retention via attachment and trapping in capillary forces versus straining for the 4 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 2 illustrates that a great part of the cell retention took place at depths of 15 and 25 cm if compared to the other studied depths the ratios of fecal coliforms retained at 15 cm and 25 cm depth so hereafter called sd 15 sd 25 were thus calculated to illustrate the contribution of those depths under the two applied discharge rates table 4 the closer ratios to 1 indicate the equal contribution of 15 and 25 cm depths for fecal coliform retention regardless of the governing mechanisms the larger and the smaller values than 1 demonstrate the greater cell retention at 15 and 25 cm depths respectively the values of sd 15 sd 25 ratio changed minimally among the control treatments demonstrating the equal contribution of the two depths 15 and 25 cm and at the same time a higher role in controlling fecal coliform movement in soil compared with other depths as shown at figs 2 3 4 for this reason this ratio is not shown for other depths the calculations indicated that the sd 15 sd 25 ratios varied between 0 71 and 0 94 for the soil controls that were related to q4m50b0 and q4m70b0 respectively this shows that discharge rate 4 l hr 1 as the fecal coliform driver and the mad as the constraining factor to the lower depths i e recall that the greater the mad value the drier the soil medium for control soils our calculations using the ratio sd 15 sd 25 show that bacteria could have been physically rather than physiochemically trapped in the pores of soil and biochar however mathematical modeling can better determine the governing mechanism s of bacteria retention enriquez et al 2003 examined the movement of ms 2 bacteriophage in subsurface drip irrigation and also reported more bacteriophage around the dripper with a greater downward movement compared to the upward movement of bacteria similarly song et al 2006 reported fewer bacteria at soil surface for the subsurface drip irrigation compared to the furrow system shock et al 2016 reported that bacteria are filtered by soil in both vertical and horizontal directions under subsurface drip irrigation but cell concentrations were still much less compared to the position around the dripper further studies have also shown that the largest bacteria concentrations can be found in vicinity of the pollution source point assadian et al 2005 hidri et al 2014 li and wen 2016 shock et al 2016 tripathi et al 2019 to sum up both applied discharge rates affected bacteria transport and retention under the capillarity and gravity forces acting on fecal coliforms with different efficiency for the studied depths fig 2a f the findings showed that the gravity force for the 4 l hr 1 discharge was more effective on fecal coliform fate compared to capillary force for the 2 l hr 1 discharge table 4 because the downward transported fecal coliforms was more pronounced than the upward ones data not shown mohanty and boehm 2014 this can be precisely revealed through modeling process to illustrate the predominance of the retention mechanisms sepehrnia et al 2018 4 2 flow interruption the flow interruption in term of irrigation at different times e g 0 3 and 6 days fig 2a controlled fecal coliform concentration so that the cell count decreased in all treatments after stoppage of either irrigation li and wen 2016 this was a regular trend in our observations for the non biochar and biochar treatments figs 2 3 and 4 for example if the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate is considered fig 2 the fecal coliform concentration in term of s c0 in the q2m30b0 treatment was reduced from 0 56 to 0 12 such reduction ratios can be ascertained for the further treatments from fig 2 for these observations the differences in the s c0 of treatments over time illustrated using six randomly and the three selected times significantly reflected the effects of the mads the biochar and the discharge rates depth time and their interactions the average soil water content decreased from 0 35 cm3 cm 3 after stoppage of irrigation to 0 2 cm3 cm 3 in the last sampling the greater cell retention tendency i e see the highest s c0 for the mad 30 after either irrigation compared to the mads 50 and 70 regardless of the discharge rate demonstrated that the water content had the most impact on fecal coliform movement and viability jiang et al 2008 tripathi et al 2019 the values corresponded with kouznetsov et al 2004 study that found the average of fecal coliform die off rates were 0 15 0 083 and 0 043 day 1 from a subsurface drip irrigation study under 0 35 0 25 and 0 15 volumetric water contents respectively furthermore hruby et al 2018 found that bacteria die off rates ranged from 0 044 to 0 065 for e coli and 0 01 to 0 054 day 1 for enterococci in an agricultural soil after the application of a poultry manure however bacteria population increased in a biochar treated soil asirifi 2017 the effect of 12 types of fast pyrolysis and slow pyrolysis on survival of e coli o157 h7 in autoclaved soil over 8 weeks demonstrated that some variables such as type of biochar feed stocks biochar application rate and the various foodborne pathogens could affect bacteria inactivation gurtler et al 2014 the clay content of the soil with regard to the high specific surface areas could have played a great role in cell attachment abit et al 2014 balkhair 2017 khamkure et al 2016 and restricted fecal coliforms around the dripper if compared with previous studies performed in sandy soils forslund et al 2011 li and wen 2016 wen et al 2016 on the other hand clay might have also caused preferential flow for the discharge rate 4 l hr 1 that resulted in a greater fecal coliform transport to deeper depth e g 50 cm fig 2 q4m30 because preferential pathways may be created due to the swelling shrinkage and cracking of clay content of the studied site esfandiarpour boroujeni et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 tallon et al 2007 mosaddeghi et al 2009 reported that despite the greater adsorptive capacity of sandy clay loam in comparison to loamy sand loamy sand soil filtered more bacteria they concluded that the continuity of macropores i e preferential pathways was the main reason facilitating bacteria transport in sandy clay loam soil sepehrnia et al 2017 evaluated mobilization of bacteria using three solid manures cow sheep and poultry and three soil textures sandy loamy and silty clay loam and found that the clay content of soil texture could increase preferential transport of bacteria while woody manure particles can block sandy soil pores that resulted in a greater physical bacteria retention 4 3 biochar there is increased cell attachment for bacteria after biochar application due to the increase of the specific surface area abit et al 2014 this is illustrated in figs 3 and 4 if compared to the counterparts in fig 2 so that the retention in the biochar amended lysimeters with 1 biochar were on average 1 25 and 1 47 times more than those of 0 5 biochar and biochar free soil lysimeters control soil respectively p 0 0001 this result is consistent with previous studies emphasizing biochar s potential to attach and retain bacteria guo et al 2021 arief ismail et al 2016 mohanty et al 2014 therefore application of biochar can increase bacteria retention and limited spatio temporal dynamics of bacteria in soil suliman et al 2017 reported that bacteria collision efficiencies in sand columns amended with biochar were 37 and 9 times more than those of sand columns without biochar for pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria respectively the augmentation and improvement of some treatment processes of municipal wastewater after utilizing biochar was discussed by he et al 2022 in a field study the addition of rice husk biochar 20 t ha 1 tilled manually within the top 20 cm of soil did not decrease bacteria contamination under wastewater irrigation resulting in higher concentrations of fecal coliform and e coli in soil and on vegetable surfaces if compared with the who standards therefore it was found that the effect of biochar on bacteria contamination was negligible and soil and vegetables bacterial contaminations were directly related to the applied irrigation water supplied from wastewater asirifi et al 2021 in an another study using a two stage treatment system of municipal wastewater constructed with biochar sand and gravel however the application of biochar to remove bacteria was efficient up to 70 for total coliform and acceptable for agriculture irrigation nguyen et al 2020 with regard to the clay content e g 28 and specific surface area and the initial boundary conditions sepehrnia et al 2019 concluded that bacteria could irreversibly attach to the clay particles and cells are permanently inactivated cell recovery 10 for a wettable soil with 17 5 clay in contrast figs 3 and 4 show a higher s c0 for the biochar treated soils compared to the non treated biochar counterparts particularly after the second irrigation indicating greater competition between cells and biochar particles to occupy retention sites mohanty and boehm 2014 and at the same time the penetration of cells into the biochar pore spaces and protection from the attachment process to the clay particles abit et al 2014 wood derived biochar can maintain the form of plant cells and the pores interconnection with diameters of 5 10 μm that are suitable for bacteria retention abit et al 2014 if the latter is considered biochar could also carry cells i e so called colloid facilitated transport and contribute to the cell distribution furthermore fine biochar particles could be trapped in small pores and enhance bacteria retention in the pores sasidharan et al 2016 we did not observe a high concentration for the bacteria at the depths of 50 cm on the other hand the very close values of the sd 15 sd 25 ratios table 4 for depths of 15 and 25 cm indicating that cells were restricted but were still alive and recoverable by extension the values of the sd 15 sd 25 ratio showed the evidence of the biochar and mads impacts on fecal coliform fate through these two depths if m30 is considered table 4 the sd 15 sd 25 ratio reaches 0 91 for 4 l hr 1 discharge as the biochar rate increases from 0 to 1 table 4 illustrating that fecal coliform movement is restricted compared to q2 and cell distribution has been balanced between 15 and 25 cm depth on the other hand this ratio showed such a trend for m50 and m70 for both 2 and 4 l hr 1 discharge with a slighter slope increase for mean values table 4 compared to the m30 this demonstrates the effect of mads at the same time with the larger values for the 4 l hr 1 discharge from this the order and importance of the treatments on fecal coliform fate were observed a greater role of biochar rate than the discharge rate and the higher discharge rate effect than the mads the specific surface area of the soil 30 20 m2 g 1 table 1 was greater than the applied biochar 9 60 m2 g 1 table 1 this may increase the contribution of clay content in fecal coliform attachment compared to the biochar however we provided sufficient evidence of a unique biochar role in retention we thus believe that straining and pore blocking could be more likely the effective processes in fecal coliform retention compared to attachment sasidharan et al 2016 also reported that the changes in bacteria retention through biochar amended sand columns is straining abit et al 2014 and mohanty and boehm 2014 concluded that the rough surfaces and irregular shapes of biochar can improve bacteria retention by straining for clean bed media such as sand column studies bacteria collision efficiencies are attributed to decreased repulsive forces after biochar application due to the reduction of the net negative charge of biochar and sand particle surface mohanty and boehm 2014 the existence of cations such as ca2 mg2 k and na especially divalent cations in biochar can result in neutralizing anionic charge of a bacterial cell making its planar charge distribution heterogeneous so repulsive electrostatic forces decrease suliman et al 2017 therefore the interactions of cell biochar with regard to the surface charge properties i e zeta potential hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity features could also likely play an important role in bacteria sepehrnia et al 2019 sepehrnia et al 2018 but this was not possible to assess in our study the biochar treated soils had lower ph than the control soils table 1 this could also reduce electrostatic repulsion between bacteria and soil particles particularly when cells are very close to the surfaces sepehrnia et al 2018 that might result in attachment of bacteria cells there are some studies about the application of nanocellulose materials or other reinforced compounds by nanocelluloses for the sustained release of fertilizer or water retention in soil do nascimento et al 2022 kassem et al 2022 wang et al 2021 and or remediation of phenanthrene or heavy metals from contaminated soils mola ali abasiyan et al 2022 yin et al 2021 research shows the effect of different forms of nanocellulose can increase bacteria removal from water ma et al 2011 wang et al 2013 for instance the ability of cellulose nanofibers included in a microfiltration membrane for simultaneous removal of e coli and ms2 in a polluted water was shown by wang et al 2013 furthermore the production of biochar from cellulose nanocrystal can augment the cellulose material lifetime and increase desirable biochar properties for soil gas remediation and manufacturing applications d acierno et al 2021 in addition carbon fiber felt has been used as an electrochemical technology for disinfecting water against gram negative and positive bacteria ghernaout et al 2020 ni et al 2020 however we provided evidence from our observations to conclude that straining and pore blocking were responsible for fecal coliform retention in our experiment set up this can be mathematically revealed in the future studies the results showed that application of wastewater at a 2 l hr 1 discharge and for long irrigation intervals i e mad 70 or 50 as well as the highest applied biochar rate 1 can effectively control bacteria transport however biochar increased bacteria survival in soil which is very important for tuber plants therefore we recommend that depth of the emitter should be also taken into account with regards to the microbial quality of wastewater and the rate of the applied biochar mathematical modeling can explicitly describe the type of retention mechanism and thus provides information about intervals with regards to bacteria survival 4 4 limitations and future practical perspectives this experiment was conducted using lysimeters and the data provided interesting information for biochar application under different water management conditions by using discharge rates and irrigation systems typical of farmer practice field relevant data were generated but further field testing is required particularly when the soil is under the cultures of the plants furthermore although the duration of our experiment average 400 h was lengthy for a laboratory study an investigation of seasonal changes of bacteria concentrations in the field would be interested moreover testing the advantages of biochar application more comprehensively in the field could identify the best applied rate s and provide long term information with regards to precipitations and temperature changes over the seasons we suggest benefitting from cutting edge technologies such as scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectrometer eds methods to characterize soil microstructure modified by biochar 5 conclusion water discharge rates 2 and 4 l hr 1 and the biochar rates 0 0 5 and 1 with regard to mads 30 50 and 70 affected bacteria distribution at different soil depths the depletion of 70 of the available water in combination with 1 biochar before irrigation could significantly limit bacteria movement through soil profile no matter how the discharge rate was biochar reduced bacteria movement in upward and downward directions from the dripper position however it increased bacteria cell viability this showed that biochar pores can be harbors for cells and protect pathogens from inactivation due to the attachment to soil materials i e clay further research on mathematical modeling can reveal this so that the dominant mechanisms physical i e straining or physiochemical i e attachment governing cell fate are determined in our experimental set up biochar can be an effective material to limit fecal coliform transport through soil in subsurface drip irrigation however there is a higher pollution risk and a serious concern for the depths around the dripper because the viability of bacteria may increase exposure of cells to the plant root zone from the flow interruption effect it is recommended to apply high irrigation intervals for the subsurface drip irrigation if using contaminated

1229,applying wastewater in subsurface drip irrigation helps address water shortage in arid and semi arid environments microbial contamination may result but soil amendments such as biochar could help protect soil and water resources to improve understanding this study investigated spatio temporal dynamics of fecal coliform retention in a biochar treated soil under subsurface drip irrigation two dripper discharges rates of 2 and 4 l hr 1 containing fecal coliforms 3 99 1 4 105 cfu ml 1 three maximum allowable depletion levels mad 30 50 and 70 and three biochar levels 0 0 5 and 1 w w were used the lysimeters were filled with biochar treated soil and had drippers located at 20 cm depth three irrigations were performed for either q and soil samples were taken after each irrigation at different times at the lysimeter centre at 5 15 25 and 50 cm depths and at the edge at 20 cm depth labeled 20 l soils containing biochar had much greater recovered coliforms from soil than the unamended controls the greatest retention was at 15 and 25 cm depth within 5 cm of the dripper for 1 biochar with the recovered cells about 70 for 2 l hr 1 discharge and 60 for 4 l hr 1 discharge the greatest concentration occurred immediately after irrigation but over 10 days the number of coliforms gradually decreased and inactivated therefore the coliform residence time soil depth and biochar rate all influenced coliform retention if the discharge rates and mads were considered we recommend slower subsurface dripper rates with high mad and biochar amendment to minimize fecal coliform

with water scarcity wen et al 2016 the reuse of wastewater in agriculture has now become a key practice to preserve water resources wen et al 2017 guy et al 2011 annually about 400 billion m3 of wastewater is produced from different sectors e g urban agriculture and industries across the world and it is expected to increase 51 by 2050 qadir et al 2020 zhang and shen 2017 regardless of the other contaminants wastewaters contain a large number of microorganisms e g bacteria protozoa viruses and parasite eggs that are human pathogens ibekwe et al 2018 the number and the type of pathogens vary in raw wastewaters depending on the source and treatment levels guy et al 2011 the concentrations of total coliform fecal coliform and escherichia coli e coli can occur from 107 to 109 105 108 and 105 1010 cfu l 1 respectively guy et al 2011 therefore wastewater irrigation imposes microbial pollution to the soil and environment prior to applying wastewater to soil several strategies are used to eliminate soil bacteria pollution e g solarization field steaming disinfectants methyl bromide fumigation antimicrobial drip irrigation and flaming gurtler et al 2020 gurtler et al 2014 however these techniques can be expensive and cause ecotoxicity from the wastewater that may damage beneficial soil microorganisms gurtler et al 2014 another approach to decrease the impacts of pathogens on soil contamination due to utilizing of wastewater could be the use of biochar biochar at 5 application rate was found to remove 85 of coliform appearing in leachate of silty loam soil columns irrigated over 4 months with municipal wastewater asghari et al 2022 in another study using poultry litter biochar at a 10 application rate bolster and abit 2012 observed that e coli transport decreased 5 fold compared to the controls in sandy soil columns 10 cm height however as biochar quality affects retention and antimicrobial impacts gurtler et al 2020 proposed fast pyrolysis generated biochars as an effective substance for e coli removal but also reported that age and temperature at which biochar produced are important suliman et al 2017 found mixing sand with pine wood biochar retained the pathogenic e coli in subsurface biochar is a carbon rich product produced via the thermal decomposition of many waste biomass feedstocks in the absence of or limited oxygen conditions guo et al 2021 gurtler et al 2020 biochar has thus gained considerable attention as an adsorbent and an amendment for the removal of contaminants from soil due to its low cost and useful properties e g high porosity specific surface area tong et al 2020 ahmad et al 2014 in general biochar application to soils can increase microbial populations microbial activity soil water holding capacity seed germination plant growth and yield productivity soil respiration rate and improvement of soil health resulting in decreases of nutrient leaching improve productivity and greater capacity to withstand mitigate climate change ahmad et al 2014 and effects on co2 emissions and soil mineralization jiang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 there have been several studies exploring how biochar affects the removal of pathogens and bacteria transport for water filtration systems for example kaetzl et al 2019 showed that biochar filters perform better than sand filters in the removal of fecal bacteria in wastewater due to the higher surface areas and the adsorption capacity demonstrated by less contamination from effluent for water irrigation of plants perez mercadoa et al 2019 distinguished particle diameters of biochar as a key factor in bacteria and virus removal and clarified the on farm biochar filters with three particle diameters including 1 4 2 8 and 5 mm were unsuccessful in removing bacterial and viral indicators in wastewater mohanty and boehm 2014 found that biochar amendment sand biofilter removed e coli by 96 from stormwaters the efficacy of biochar on bacteria retention has been found to depend on biochar type and the microorganisms abit et al 2014 the very large surface area of biochar could be responsible for its high removal rate of the pathogens as demonstrated in biochar filters kaetzl et al 2019 straining biofilm formation and the surface filtration of solid particles were other reasons for bacteria deposition by biochar by extension suliman et al 2017 attributed the collision efficiencies and the cell attachment of bacteria to the physicochemical properties of biochar in sand columns based on the potential capacity of biochar to mitigate pathogen and bacterial transport one application could be subsurface irrigation with wastewater to cope with water shortage and alleviate pathogens in soil subsurface drip irrigation has been widely used for wastewater application and compared to other irrigation systems e g flooding it can increase water use efficiency and reduce evaporation grecco et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 in subsurface drip irrigation systems water has laminar flow under the ground so bacteria movement can be considerably restricted compared to flooding counterparts esteves et al 2020 plauborg et al 2010 plastic irrigation tubes located at lower soil depths often coupled with lateral tubes to increase dispersal can reduce surface contamination at the same time this can increase water percolation depth which protects bacteria from harsh environmental conditions e g ultraviolet radiation heat etc and thus prolong bacteria survival it would be useful to apply best management practices to minimize bacteria movement and distribution through soil there is greater bacteria removal for subsurface drip irrigation compared to surface systems e g campos et al 2000 qiu et al 2017 wen et al 2016 wen et al 2016 at comparable water discharge rates i e 1 to 5 76 l hr 1 demonstrated that surface drip irrigation with lower discharge rates limits bacteria movement through soil while an increase in application rate could result in a wider distribution of e coli concentration through soil wen et al s 2016 research shows that for two soils with sandy and sandy loam textures about 70 and 98 of the bacteria are detected within a 10 and 5 cm radius of the pollution source respectively in a two year study to investigate e coli transport after applying secondary sewage effluent li and wen 2016 monitored 0 10 and 20 cm depths under three irrigation intervals 4 8 and 12 days and three irrigation levels in their research high irrigation frequency caused an increase of bacteria in soil and bacteria concentration in the surface layer of the soil increased as the amount of secondary sewage increased they concluded that subsurface drip irrigation provides less microbial contamination risk for the surface soil and plants than surface drip irrigation qiu et al 2017 studied e coli leaching from wastewater in field conditions during the growing period of maize zea mays l and did not observe any bacteria in drains at depths of 0 15 and 30 cm for three irrigation levels 70 100 and 130 of plant evapotranspiration requirements they reported that most bacteria were retained at 15 cm depth and deficit irrigation is the best practice to prevent soil microbial contamination therefore there is a knowledge gap for how bacteria fate will be influenced as the result of irrigation management in terms of maximum allowable depletion mad and the flow interruption which is needed to find the best practices for wastewater and biochar application in semi arid and arid areas mad is the main parameter for irrigation scheduling and designating the depth and interval of irrigation mad determines the maximum amount of soil water that based on irrigation management the crop can extract from the root zone between irrigations woodruff et al 1972 the different values of mad can cause various moisture contents in the soil before doing irrigation it has been found that spatio temporal variations of bacteria in soil and water can highly influence their growth and mortality and thus their fate as pollutants stocker et al 2015 bacteria concentrations at their source vary temporally creating a crucial factor of spatial temporal dynamics of bacteria in porous media sowah et al 2020 further spatio temporal variability is driven within the soil compared to deeper soil bacteria near the soil surface experience greater environmental stress from soil moisture jeon et al 2019 so become inactive or have shorter lifespans than at deeper depths tripathi et al 2019 therefore spatio temporal variations impact bacterial soil and water pollution which needs careful consideration in devising best management practices strategies to alleviate the risks of wastewater in irrigation however studies on bacteria spatio temporal variations have been mostly conducted at watershed scales using mathematical models rather than column and lysimeter experiments jeon et al 2019 kim et al 2018 particularly there are also some studies in this area that address bacteria transport and fate as the result of wastewater irrigation tabatabaei et al 2017 and soil and bacteria wettability texture manure type and flow interruption sepehrnia et al 2018 sepehrnia et al 2017 for example in a field experiment exploring cultivating turfgrass under subsurface drip irrigation using municipal wastewater fecal coliform near the soil surface decreased with increasing laterals depth tabatabaei et al 2017 in soil column experiments with soil from this region sepehrnia et al 2019 found that bacteria are highly mobile during irrigation and released due to changes in soil wettability under flow interruption in addition other studies conducted in this area explored solid manure management to control bacteria pollution sepehrnia et al 2021 tabatabaei et al 2022 however the impacts of biochar on bacteria fate that originated from wastewater water with regards to water management policies have not been reported we hypothesize that the dripper discharge rate with regard to mad soil depth biochar and the residence time of bacteria in soil are the field and management factors that can control spatio temporal dynamics of fecal coliforms additionally the clay loam soil used in this study has a much heavier texture compared to sandy loams found in previous studies e g li and wen 2016 so we provide more information about soil texture and the required water management strategies for minimizing bacterial pollution risk in soils though the effect of biochar on bacteria in the soil has been investigated in other studies there has been no direct study to explore the mad and biochar impacts on bacteria distribution under subsurface drip irrigation we thus considered mad to find an irrigation management practice through the control of bacteria retention via biochar therefore we aimed to understand the importance of biochar application for the removal of bacteria originated from wastewater under subsurface irrigation this research informs water management irrigation policies in semi arid areas building on previous research limited to column studies overall the main objectives of this study were i to evaluate the spatio temporal variation of bacteria under various biochar application rates at different depths and ii to propose the best water management practices for the subsurface irrigation with regards to the effects of mad water discharge and biochar rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 site study and the lysimeter set up the study was performed at a research farm in a greenhouse under controlled temperature 25 c located in the college of agriculture of shahrekord university 32 21 20 n 50 49 42 e shahrekord iran the annual average temperature was 11 5 c and precipitation 116 mm a field that was fallow for a year was used with characteristics of the soil and biochar in table 1 the soil had clay loam texture and classified as an inceptisol soil survey staff 2014 with 28 clay 34 5 silt and 36 5 sand the soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth in plastic containers and the plant debris was removed soil samples were air dried passed through a 2 mm sieve and mixed completely biochar see below for description was mixed with soil at rates of 0 0 5 and 1 w w 0 5 and 10 g per 1000 g soil wang et al 2019 soil with without biochar was packed into lysimeters in 5 cm increments at a soil field bulk density of 1 31 mg m 3 physical and chemical soil properties such as texture by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 electrical conductivity ec using ec meter and ph by ph meter rhoades 1996 sims 1996 are given in table 1 the experimental set up consisted of 18 glass lysimeters schematically shown in fig 1 the lysimeters l 70 cm w 17 cm d 60 cm were filled with the biochar treated soil and soil material as the control the soil was not sterilized to simulate natural soil conditions however sampling showed no fecal coliforms for soil before the beginning of the experiments the lysimeter walls were made from glass and treated with a very thin layer of grease prior to irrigation to prevent preferential flow along the walls kandelous and šimůnek 2010 the 0 38 mm wall thickness of the dripline 16 mm internal diameter with inline pressure compensating dripper in an operating range of 70 410 kpa sun water iran was installed at 20 cm depth at the centre of each lysimeter and connected to a wastewater reservoir containing fecal coliforms 3 99 1 4 105 cfu ml 1 several holes at the bottom of the lysimeters drained effluent 2 2 biochar the commercial biochar was prepared from sun company located in fars province iran it was produced from the soft wood materials of pomegranate punica granatum and plum prunus domestica pyrolyzed at 450 500 c the biochar was sieved to 2 mm filipovic et al 2020 liao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 to maximize biochar removal capacity mohanty and boehm 2014 the specific surface areas of biochar and soil were determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method brunauer et al 1938 the ph 1 5 of biochar was measured by ph meter rayment and higginson 1992 the properties of the biochar are given in table 1 2 3 bacteria preparation fecal coliforms are indicator organisms of bacterial contamination which are commonly used to check for the removal of pathogens from wastewater treatment plants mara and horan 2003 we harvested fecal coliforms as the indicator microorganism pang et al 2008 sepehrnia et al 2018 from a raw wastewater provided by shahrekord wastewater treatment plant iran macconkey agar was used to grow cells through incubation at 44 5 c for 24 h for either irrigation described in section 2 4 a bacteria suspension 30 9 2 ml containing 3 99 1 4 105 cfu ml 1 was prepared and added to the irrigation water ecwater 0 32 ds m 1 song et al 2006 the population was monitored by the plate counting method in triplicate prior to each irrigation 2 4 lysimeter irrigation the two discharge rates 2 l hr 1 q2 and 4 l hr 1 q4 were based on farmer practice for subsurface drip irrigation in this region thereby providing practical data about the impacts of biochar application irrigation was performed when the average of the soil water content at depths of 10 and 20 cm reached θmad the amount of irrigation depths and the values of θmad are calculated from eqns 1 and 2 respectively martin et al 1990 1 θ mad θ fc θ fc θ pwp mad 2 d θ fc θ mad d where θfc and θpwp are the volumetric water content moistures at field capacity and permanent wilting points cm3 cm 3 respectively the mad represents the maximum allowable depletion d is the irrigation depth cm and d is the depth of the soil cm in the first irrigation all treatments were irrigated to field capacity forslund et al 2011 the second and the third irrigations were performed according to the maximum allowable depletion related to either treatment soil water content was monitored using a sm300 moisture meter delta t devices cambridge uk at the intervals of the irrigations through small ports installed on the right half of the lysimeters wall the intervals and the applied polluted water volumes of the either irrigation changed based on the mad and the rate of added biochar so the longest irrigation interval was m70b1 nearly 12 days and the shortest one was m30 treatments 3 days the lysimeter walls were protected from direct sunlight during the experiments the depth of irrigation water was 17 cm in the first irrigation for all treatments on subsequent irrigations it was calculated for each treatment by eq 2 and applied as described in table 2 2 5 soil and bacteria sampling as mentioned above the dripper was installed at 20 cm depth and soil samples were collected at 5 points fig 1 depths of 5 15 25 and 50 cm at the centre of the lysimeter and at 20 cm depth at the edge of lysimeter to explore lateral flow and bacteria distribution at the edge of the wetting front labeled 20 l this spatial sampling was to determine the distribution of fecal coliforms through the soil profile and the wetted soil volume li and wen 2016 the depths of 5 cm were selected to consider the effect of upward capillary forces on bacteria movement and the depth of 15 cm was to illustrate the plough layer the 15 cm and 25 cm depths described bacteria distribution around the emitter as the zone with the highest soil moisture content moreover these points were selected to compare our results with other studies li and wen 2016 in addition the depth of 50 cm the lowest point in our experiment traced the downward bacteria transport as a risk of subsurface irrigation to detect the fate of bacteria sampling was performed immediately before and after either irrigation and 24 and 48 h later these times were based on the previous studies li and wen 2016 and based on bacteria inactivation at different times after irrigation found in the literatures kouznetsov et al 2004 li and wen 2016 samples were immediately transferred to the lab from which one gram of soil in three replications were subsampled the samples were placed into containers containing 9 ml of sterilized distilled water and mixed on the shaker for 30 min guber et al 2005 an aliquot 0 1 ml of the diluted solutions was used to culture cells on macconkey agar this is a selective and differential culture medium used for rapid detection of gram negative bacteria elazhary et al 1973 lactose fermenting bacteria positive lactose in this environment produce purple colonies with and bacteria that are unable to ferment lactose negative lactose create colorless colonies wanger et al 2017 after incubation 24 h at 44 0 5 c swanson et al 1992 each purple spot grown on the medium culture was counted visually as one fecal coliform colony the numbers of bacteria colonies on a plate was finally considered as the colony forming units cfu the bacteria concentration dimensionless in the solid phase per 1 g soil was plotted using the s c0 term versus time 2 6 bacteria inactivation bacteria inactivation was calculated for different time intervals using eq 3 hruby et al 2018 stocker et al 2015 3 c c 0 exp μt where c is the concentration of bacteria in the soil at time t c 0 is the initial bacteria concentration in the soil immediately after stoppage of irrigation t is the time and μ is the bacteria reduction coefficient t 1 2 7 data analysis statistical analysis was done using a randomized factorial blocks design performed in statistica 8 0 at the 0 05 level of probability four factors were considered as the independent factors including two discharges q2 and q4 three levels of biochar b0 0 b 0 5 0 5 and b1 1 w w three maximum allowable depletions m30 m50 and md70 and five depths 0 5 15 25 50 and 20 l cm to investigate the changes of coliform concentrations as the dependent variable two separate statistical analyses were performed in this study the first one was for bacteria concentration found at different soil sampling events and the second one was for bacteria inactivation rate that was found based on calculations using eq 3 the concentration of bacteria and inactivation rate were thus considered as the dependent variables in the first and the second analyses respectively and the biochar rates 0 0 5 and 1 mad 30 50 and 70 discharge rates 2 and 4 l hr 1 and the number of irrigations were independent factors the lsd was used to perform mean separations furthermore we assessed the flow interruption effect on bacteria concentration based on the six random time of soil sampling t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t12 and three selected irrigation times t1 t4 t8 among the whole irrigation periods i e t1 to t12 the selected ones were related to the beginning time of irrigation 3 results 3 1 soil and biochar properties the ph of soil was 8 07 0 11 and biochar was 7 37 0 21 adding biochar reduced mixture ph but its value was the same for the soils treated with 0 5 and 1 biochar the ec of biochar 0 43 ds m 1 was significantly higher than the soil 0 112 ds m 1 and biochar amended soils the ec values for the biochar treated soil mixtures 0 5 and 1 were 0 133 and 0 135 ds m 1 which were slightly higher than the control soil i e 0 112 ds m 1 furthermore adding 0 5 and 1 biochar to the soil resulted in increasing available water 4 and 12 respectively the cation content such as ca2 and mg2 were also higher for the two mixtures than the control soil more information about the statistical analyses of soil biochar and biochar treated soil properties is presented in table 1 3 2 dripper discharge rate impacts the distribution of fecal coliforms for the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate and the three levels of mad at different depths are illustrated in fig 2a c the most fecal coliforms were found around the dripper radius of 5 cm the fecal coliform concentration at 25 cm depth was significantly higher than that at 15 cm if the mads are considered p 0 0001 the concentration of fecal coliforms at 15 cm depth for the m30 was higher than m50 and m70 p 0 0001 there were no fecal coliforms recovered in the first irrigation at 5 cm depth while the concentration increased after the second and third irrigations for this depth a sharp decline in concentration occurred after stoppage of each irrigation in all levels of the mads if compared with the other depths so that the concentration dropped to zero before the beginning of next irrigation a similar trend was found for bacteria concentration at 20 l cm and 50 cm depth fluctuations in the fecal coliforms concentration were notable at these two positions there was no significant difference between these points 5 20 l cm and 50 cm if the various mads are considered p 0 0001 for the 4 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 2d f the maximum concentrations of fecal coliforms were also observed around the dripper located at 15 and 25 cm depths for these points the amount of fecal coliforms increased after each irrigation following a decreasing trend the retained fecal coliforms at 25 cm depth was significantly higher than at 15 cm depth s c0 0 42 vs 0 36 respectively the highest s c0 0 46 and the lowest s c0 0 31 cell retention with regard to mad were at 25 cm depth for the m30 and 15 cm depth for the m70 p 0 0001 respectively the fecal coliform concentration at 5 cm depth and m30 was higher than the m50 and m70 but there was not a significant difference between them p 0 05 similarly cell concentration decreased and reached zero during the two irrigation intervals for 4 l hr 1 the retained fecal coliforms s c0 was 0 0037 at the depth of 50 cm if the m30 and m70 are considered the concentration of fecal coliforms at point of 20 l cm for various mads was less than compared with the 50 cm depth there was no significant difference between the s c0 for 50 and 20 l cm depth with regard to the mads p 0 05 therefore the statistical analysis revealed that the retained fecal coliforms for the two discharge rates were significantly different p 0 05 further details are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 regardless of the discharge rates the treatments with the m30 always had larger cell concentrations at upper and lower parts of the dripper the amount of retained fecal coliforms for 2 l hr 1 discharge with m30 was higher than that of 4 l hr 1 discharge the fecal coliform concentration gradually decreased after termination of each irrigation before the second and the third irrigation this was especially obvious for m50 and m70 the smallest amount of fecal coliform was observed in the last sampling time that was done 10 days after the termination of the last irrigation p 0 05 3 3 biochar impacts the distribution of fecal coliforms for the 0 5 and 1 biochar treated lysimeters are presented in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively if the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate is considered the retained fecal coliforms for 1 biochar lysimeters was significantly higher than the 0 5 counterpart particularly at 25 and 15 cm depths fig 3 and fig 4 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference in the amount of retained fecal coliforms for 5 20 l and 50 cm depths the mad data illustrated that there was no significant difference in retained fecal coliforms between m30 and m50 while the retained fecal coliforms under m70 was significantly less than the other mads p 0 05 the q2m50b1 and q2m30b1 had the highest retained fecal coliforms compared to the other treatments the minimum concentration was observed for q2m70b0 5 by extension for the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 3a c and fig 4a c shows that there were no culturable fecal coliforms at 0 5 cm depth in lysimeters treated with 0 5 and 1 biochar for the various mads except q2m30b0 5 after beginning of the first irrigation by the third irrigation that dramatically decreased to zero therefore the possible reason is the longer intervals between the irrigations that impacted upward water flow and bacteria movement and consequently bacteria die off and probably a higher irreversible attachment rate under the m50 and m70 if compared with m30 the distribution of bacteria for the discharge 4 l hr 1 and the two applied biochar rates with regards to the three levels of mad are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the application of 1 biochar resulted in increase of 1 21 times higher cell retention compared to the 0 5 rate which was notable around the dripper depths of 15 and 25 cm p 0 05 similar to 2 l hr 1 with and without biochar treatments the minimum concentration of fecal coliforms was at 5 cm depth for 4 l hr 1 however there was no significant difference in fecal coliform retention rate between the two biochar application rates following a slightly more bacteria at depth of 20 l and 50 cm but with no significant difference between them p 0 05 addition of 1 biochar to soil resulted in 1 1 1 1 and 1 2 fold increase for the fecal coliform retention under mad 30 50 and 70 at of 25 cm depth compared to the 0 5 rate 3 4 fecal coliform survival the fecal coliform reduction coefficient in the course of maximum minimum and average die off was 0 046 0 0023 0 007 0 001 and 0 026 0 0098 day 1 as given in table 3 the values of coefficients for the control lysimeters under 2 l hr 1 discharge correspond to the mads of 30 50 and 70 and were 0 033 0 010 0 029 0 010 and 0 026 0 010 day 1 respectively for the 4 l hr 1 discharge they were 0 034 0 011 0 026 0 016 and 0 027 0 013 day 1 respectively for control soils the fecal coliform survival was most likely higher under 30 mad than 50 and 70 mad due to its short interval irrigation times although the statistical analysis showed no significant effects of the discharge rate p 0 05 biochar significantly promoted fecal coliform survival so that the 1 biochar had a stronger effect than either the 0 5 rate or control soil table 3 the details of die off coefficient values with regard to the mads and the irrigation are presented in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation bacteria retention mechanisms in porous media are attachment straining i e pore throat retention grain grain contacts and trapping in capillary forces i e film straining that all are well established e g bradford et al 2013 bradford and torkzaban 2008 the two discharge rates had the greatest fecal coliforms around the dripper one in the upper depth 15 cm and another one in the lower depth 25 cm from the dripper position 20 cm fig 2 for the low discharge rate 2 l hr 1 fig 2a c the contact time of fecal coliforms and the collectors was higher than that of the 4 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 2d f which could increase the probability of fecal coliform retention via attachment and trapping in capillary forces versus straining for the 4 l hr 1 discharge rate fig 2 illustrates that a great part of the cell retention took place at depths of 15 and 25 cm if compared to the other studied depths the ratios of fecal coliforms retained at 15 cm and 25 cm depth so hereafter called sd 15 sd 25 were thus calculated to illustrate the contribution of those depths under the two applied discharge rates table 4 the closer ratios to 1 indicate the equal contribution of 15 and 25 cm depths for fecal coliform retention regardless of the governing mechanisms the larger and the smaller values than 1 demonstrate the greater cell retention at 15 and 25 cm depths respectively the values of sd 15 sd 25 ratio changed minimally among the control treatments demonstrating the equal contribution of the two depths 15 and 25 cm and at the same time a higher role in controlling fecal coliform movement in soil compared with other depths as shown at figs 2 3 4 for this reason this ratio is not shown for other depths the calculations indicated that the sd 15 sd 25 ratios varied between 0 71 and 0 94 for the soil controls that were related to q4m50b0 and q4m70b0 respectively this shows that discharge rate 4 l hr 1 as the fecal coliform driver and the mad as the constraining factor to the lower depths i e recall that the greater the mad value the drier the soil medium for control soils our calculations using the ratio sd 15 sd 25 show that bacteria could have been physically rather than physiochemically trapped in the pores of soil and biochar however mathematical modeling can better determine the governing mechanism s of bacteria retention enriquez et al 2003 examined the movement of ms 2 bacteriophage in subsurface drip irrigation and also reported more bacteriophage around the dripper with a greater downward movement compared to the upward movement of bacteria similarly song et al 2006 reported fewer bacteria at soil surface for the subsurface drip irrigation compared to the furrow system shock et al 2016 reported that bacteria are filtered by soil in both vertical and horizontal directions under subsurface drip irrigation but cell concentrations were still much less compared to the position around the dripper further studies have also shown that the largest bacteria concentrations can be found in vicinity of the pollution source point assadian et al 2005 hidri et al 2014 li and wen 2016 shock et al 2016 tripathi et al 2019 to sum up both applied discharge rates affected bacteria transport and retention under the capillarity and gravity forces acting on fecal coliforms with different efficiency for the studied depths fig 2a f the findings showed that the gravity force for the 4 l hr 1 discharge was more effective on fecal coliform fate compared to capillary force for the 2 l hr 1 discharge table 4 because the downward transported fecal coliforms was more pronounced than the upward ones data not shown mohanty and boehm 2014 this can be precisely revealed through modeling process to illustrate the predominance of the retention mechanisms sepehrnia et al 2018 4 2 flow interruption the flow interruption in term of irrigation at different times e g 0 3 and 6 days fig 2a controlled fecal coliform concentration so that the cell count decreased in all treatments after stoppage of either irrigation li and wen 2016 this was a regular trend in our observations for the non biochar and biochar treatments figs 2 3 and 4 for example if the 2 l hr 1 discharge rate is considered fig 2 the fecal coliform concentration in term of s c0 in the q2m30b0 treatment was reduced from 0 56 to 0 12 such reduction ratios can be ascertained for the further treatments from fig 2 for these observations the differences in the s c0 of treatments over time illustrated using six randomly and the three selected times significantly reflected the effects of the mads the biochar and the discharge rates depth time and their interactions the average soil water content decreased from 0 35 cm3 cm 3 after stoppage of irrigation to 0 2 cm3 cm 3 in the last sampling the greater cell retention tendency i e see the highest s c0 for the mad 30 after either irrigation compared to the mads 50 and 70 regardless of the discharge rate demonstrated that the water content had the most impact on fecal coliform movement and viability jiang et al 2008 tripathi et al 2019 the values corresponded with kouznetsov et al 2004 study that found the average of fecal coliform die off rates were 0 15 0 083 and 0 043 day 1 from a subsurface drip irrigation study under 0 35 0 25 and 0 15 volumetric water contents respectively furthermore hruby et al 2018 found that bacteria die off rates ranged from 0 044 to 0 065 for e coli and 0 01 to 0 054 day 1 for enterococci in an agricultural soil after the application of a poultry manure however bacteria population increased in a biochar treated soil asirifi 2017 the effect of 12 types of fast pyrolysis and slow pyrolysis on survival of e coli o157 h7 in autoclaved soil over 8 weeks demonstrated that some variables such as type of biochar feed stocks biochar application rate and the various foodborne pathogens could affect bacteria inactivation gurtler et al 2014 the clay content of the soil with regard to the high specific surface areas could have played a great role in cell attachment abit et al 2014 balkhair 2017 khamkure et al 2016 and restricted fecal coliforms around the dripper if compared with previous studies performed in sandy soils forslund et al 2011 li and wen 2016 wen et al 2016 on the other hand clay might have also caused preferential flow for the discharge rate 4 l hr 1 that resulted in a greater fecal coliform transport to deeper depth e g 50 cm fig 2 q4m30 because preferential pathways may be created due to the swelling shrinkage and cracking of clay content of the studied site esfandiarpour boroujeni et al 2018 jiang et al 2010 tallon et al 2007 mosaddeghi et al 2009 reported that despite the greater adsorptive capacity of sandy clay loam in comparison to loamy sand loamy sand soil filtered more bacteria they concluded that the continuity of macropores i e preferential pathways was the main reason facilitating bacteria transport in sandy clay loam soil sepehrnia et al 2017 evaluated mobilization of bacteria using three solid manures cow sheep and poultry and three soil textures sandy loamy and silty clay loam and found that the clay content of soil texture could increase preferential transport of bacteria while woody manure particles can block sandy soil pores that resulted in a greater physical bacteria retention 4 3 biochar there is increased cell attachment for bacteria after biochar application due to the increase of the specific surface area abit et al 2014 this is illustrated in figs 3 and 4 if compared to the counterparts in fig 2 so that the retention in the biochar amended lysimeters with 1 biochar were on average 1 25 and 1 47 times more than those of 0 5 biochar and biochar free soil lysimeters control soil respectively p 0 0001 this result is consistent with previous studies emphasizing biochar s potential to attach and retain bacteria guo et al 2021 arief ismail et al 2016 mohanty et al 2014 therefore application of biochar can increase bacteria retention and limited spatio temporal dynamics of bacteria in soil suliman et al 2017 reported that bacteria collision efficiencies in sand columns amended with biochar were 37 and 9 times more than those of sand columns without biochar for pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria respectively the augmentation and improvement of some treatment processes of municipal wastewater after utilizing biochar was discussed by he et al 2022 in a field study the addition of rice husk biochar 20 t ha 1 tilled manually within the top 20 cm of soil did not decrease bacteria contamination under wastewater irrigation resulting in higher concentrations of fecal coliform and e coli in soil and on vegetable surfaces if compared with the who standards therefore it was found that the effect of biochar on bacteria contamination was negligible and soil and vegetables bacterial contaminations were directly related to the applied irrigation water supplied from wastewater asirifi et al 2021 in an another study using a two stage treatment system of municipal wastewater constructed with biochar sand and gravel however the application of biochar to remove bacteria was efficient up to 70 for total coliform and acceptable for agriculture irrigation nguyen et al 2020 with regard to the clay content e g 28 and specific surface area and the initial boundary conditions sepehrnia et al 2019 concluded that bacteria could irreversibly attach to the clay particles and cells are permanently inactivated cell recovery 10 for a wettable soil with 17 5 clay in contrast figs 3 and 4 show a higher s c0 for the biochar treated soils compared to the non treated biochar counterparts particularly after the second irrigation indicating greater competition between cells and biochar particles to occupy retention sites mohanty and boehm 2014 and at the same time the penetration of cells into the biochar pore spaces and protection from the attachment process to the clay particles abit et al 2014 wood derived biochar can maintain the form of plant cells and the pores interconnection with diameters of 5 10 μm that are suitable for bacteria retention abit et al 2014 if the latter is considered biochar could also carry cells i e so called colloid facilitated transport and contribute to the cell distribution furthermore fine biochar particles could be trapped in small pores and enhance bacteria retention in the pores sasidharan et al 2016 we did not observe a high concentration for the bacteria at the depths of 50 cm on the other hand the very close values of the sd 15 sd 25 ratios table 4 for depths of 15 and 25 cm indicating that cells were restricted but were still alive and recoverable by extension the values of the sd 15 sd 25 ratio showed the evidence of the biochar and mads impacts on fecal coliform fate through these two depths if m30 is considered table 4 the sd 15 sd 25 ratio reaches 0 91 for 4 l hr 1 discharge as the biochar rate increases from 0 to 1 table 4 illustrating that fecal coliform movement is restricted compared to q2 and cell distribution has been balanced between 15 and 25 cm depth on the other hand this ratio showed such a trend for m50 and m70 for both 2 and 4 l hr 1 discharge with a slighter slope increase for mean values table 4 compared to the m30 this demonstrates the effect of mads at the same time with the larger values for the 4 l hr 1 discharge from this the order and importance of the treatments on fecal coliform fate were observed a greater role of biochar rate than the discharge rate and the higher discharge rate effect than the mads the specific surface area of the soil 30 20 m2 g 1 table 1 was greater than the applied biochar 9 60 m2 g 1 table 1 this may increase the contribution of clay content in fecal coliform attachment compared to the biochar however we provided sufficient evidence of a unique biochar role in retention we thus believe that straining and pore blocking could be more likely the effective processes in fecal coliform retention compared to attachment sasidharan et al 2016 also reported that the changes in bacteria retention through biochar amended sand columns is straining abit et al 2014 and mohanty and boehm 2014 concluded that the rough surfaces and irregular shapes of biochar can improve bacteria retention by straining for clean bed media such as sand column studies bacteria collision efficiencies are attributed to decreased repulsive forces after biochar application due to the reduction of the net negative charge of biochar and sand particle surface mohanty and boehm 2014 the existence of cations such as ca2 mg2 k and na especially divalent cations in biochar can result in neutralizing anionic charge of a bacterial cell making its planar charge distribution heterogeneous so repulsive electrostatic forces decrease suliman et al 2017 therefore the interactions of cell biochar with regard to the surface charge properties i e zeta potential hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity features could also likely play an important role in bacteria sepehrnia et al 2019 sepehrnia et al 2018 but this was not possible to assess in our study the biochar treated soils had lower ph than the control soils table 1 this could also reduce electrostatic repulsion between bacteria and soil particles particularly when cells are very close to the surfaces sepehrnia et al 2018 that might result in attachment of bacteria cells there are some studies about the application of nanocellulose materials or other reinforced compounds by nanocelluloses for the sustained release of fertilizer or water retention in soil do nascimento et al 2022 kassem et al 2022 wang et al 2021 and or remediation of phenanthrene or heavy metals from contaminated soils mola ali abasiyan et al 2022 yin et al 2021 research shows the effect of different forms of nanocellulose can increase bacteria removal from water ma et al 2011 wang et al 2013 for instance the ability of cellulose nanofibers included in a microfiltration membrane for simultaneous removal of e coli and ms2 in a polluted water was shown by wang et al 2013 furthermore the production of biochar from cellulose nanocrystal can augment the cellulose material lifetime and increase desirable biochar properties for soil gas remediation and manufacturing applications d acierno et al 2021 in addition carbon fiber felt has been used as an electrochemical technology for disinfecting water against gram negative and positive bacteria ghernaout et al 2020 ni et al 2020 however we provided evidence from our observations to conclude that straining and pore blocking were responsible for fecal coliform retention in our experiment set up this can be mathematically revealed in the future studies the results showed that application of wastewater at a 2 l hr 1 discharge and for long irrigation intervals i e mad 70 or 50 as well as the highest applied biochar rate 1 can effectively control bacteria transport however biochar increased bacteria survival in soil which is very important for tuber plants therefore we recommend that depth of the emitter should be also taken into account with regards to the microbial quality of wastewater and the rate of the applied biochar mathematical modeling can explicitly describe the type of retention mechanism and thus provides information about intervals with regards to bacteria survival 4 4 limitations and future practical perspectives this experiment was conducted using lysimeters and the data provided interesting information for biochar application under different water management conditions by using discharge rates and irrigation systems typical of farmer practice field relevant data were generated but further field testing is required particularly when the soil is under the cultures of the plants furthermore although the duration of our experiment average 400 h was lengthy for a laboratory study an investigation of seasonal changes of bacteria concentrations in the field would be interested moreover testing the advantages of biochar application more comprehensively in the field could identify the best applied rate s and provide long term information with regards to precipitations and temperature changes over the seasons we suggest benefitting from cutting edge technologies such as scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectrometer eds methods to characterize soil microstructure modified by biochar 5 conclusion water discharge rates 2 and 4 l hr 1 and the biochar rates 0 0 5 and 1 with regard to mads 30 50 and 70 affected bacteria distribution at different soil depths the depletion of 70 of the available water in combination with 1 biochar before irrigation could significantly limit bacteria movement through soil profile no matter how the discharge rate was biochar reduced bacteria movement in upward and downward directions from the dripper position however it increased bacteria cell viability this showed that biochar pores can be harbors for cells and protect pathogens from inactivation due to the attachment to soil materials i e clay further research on mathematical modeling can reveal this so that the dominant mechanisms physical i e straining or physiochemical i e attachment governing cell fate are determined in our experimental set up biochar can be an effective material to limit fecal coliform transport through soil in subsurface drip irrigation however there is a higher pollution risk and a serious concern for the depths around the dripper because the viability of bacteria may increase exposure of cells to the plant root zone from the flow interruption effect it is recommended to apply high irrigation intervals for the subsurface drip irrigation if using contaminated wastewater for treated and non treated biochar soils in fields author statement forough abbasi teshnizi data curation conceptualization methodology formal analysis funding acquisition writing original
