16825,a circular carbon bioeconomy has potential to halt atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases causing climate change and sustainably produce chemical agricultural and fuel products here we report application of a simplified technoeconomic assessment to critically review two approaches in this space microbial electrosynthesis and gas fermentation for microbial electrosynthesis decoupling of surface dependant abiotic process for electron delivery from volume dependant biotic carbon fixation is shown as the only economically viable strategy to scale up due to comparatively low biofilm electron consumption rate this is effectively an electrolyser assisted gas fermentation system targeting high value products such as protein for human food consumption is one of the few pathways forward for electrolyser assisted gas fermentation alternatively gas fermentation of reformed biogas presents an interesting and potentially more sustainable implementation pathway to improve economic viability of chemicals this critical review suggests linking water treatment resource recovery with gas fermentation is attractive for bioplastics and butanol in terms of competitiveness and market

resulted in exponential atmospheric accumulation of carbon dioxide co2 reaching over 407 ppm in 2018 unprecedented at any point in the last 800 000 years blunden and arndt 2019 greenhouse gases such as co2 and methane ch4 trap heat and have already caused ca 1 0 c of global warming above pre industrial levels with associated long term changes to climate sea level and extreme weather events limiting warming to 1 5 c a target agreed at the 21st conference of parties in paris would require net co2 emissions to reduce by approximately 45 relative to 2010 levels by 2030 reaching net zero by 2050 ipcc 2018 as a result scientific research to meet these targets and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels is arguably the defining challenge of the 21st century industrial greenhouse gas emissions represent roughly one third of all emissions worldwide yet have proven difficult to reduce staffell et al 2019 for industry the challenge is how to economically decrease emissions that are integral to the process e g steel production or the result of reaction stoichiometry e g cement production production plants typically have a long design life e g 50 years which presents limited opportunity for new technology to reduce emissions moreover developing new green technologies to compete against incumbents with already depreciated asset bases is challenging elmekawy et al 2016 making it imperative to guide research efforts with appropriate economic justification considering costs supply demand and technology high energy efficiency bioproduction of chemicals and fuels haas et al 2018 using basic renewable resources may offer a sustainable solution for production whilst also having lower operating conditions temperature and pressure meaning smaller capital expenditures köpke and simpson 2020 thus far biotechnology has for the most part been based on biomass fermentations via the sugar platform however based on current fuel demand of 2000 mt yr fig 1 table s1 an optimistic growth yield of 8 t ha yr and fermentation yield of 30 500 800 mha would be required just for biofuel production not including food which is equivalent to 30 60 of land currently used for food production 1 5 gha irena 2014 therefore complementary biotechnology approaches will be required gas fermentation with acetogens has a smaller associated footprint compared with biomass fermentation harnisch et al 2019 typical feedstocks for gas fermentation include synthesis gases produced through biomass gasification as well as industrial exhausts containing mixtures of h2 co and co2 collectively referred to as syngas microbial electrosynthesis is a potential complementary future platform technology that like gas fermentation uses acetogens for carbon fixation nevin et al 2010 through direct use of electrodes to feed acetogens with the required reducing equivalents for cellular metabolism microbial electrosynthesis has attracted significant attention in recent years for its potential to sustainably convert gas streams containing mostly co2 into platform chemicals in the context of the so called circular bioeconomy and unlike other biotechnology approaches such as microalgae microbial electrosynthesis offers opportunities to store excess renewable electricity in chemicals and fuels and reduce industrial environmental impact this concept is often termed power to x with x indicating for example gas fuels or chemicals harnisch et al 2019 despite increasing interest the transition has proven challenging to implement due to economics zimmermann and schomäcker 2017 within the area of microbial electrosynthesis of the limited number of economic assessments available in the scientific literature christodoulou et al 2017 jourdin et al 2020 shemfe et al 2018 they have not covered the range of products and pathways suggestion by researchers a simple assessment considering only energy input has been undertaken across a range of products as an initial screening tool desloover et al 2012 critically whilst there is great promise to link production with intermittent renewable electricity for low cost production many researchers have failed to account for the subsequent poor utilisation of plant capacity prévoteau et al 2020 this would cause capital expenses to dominate levelised cost of chemicals lccs that is lifetime production costs amortised over lifetime production more detailed technoeconomic assessments have been completed for electrochemical approaches na et al 2019 spurgeon and kumar 2018 in the absence of a broad assessment to direct research streams for maximum impact there has been a strong focus in microbial electrosynthesis literature on production of acetate a carboxylate with two carbon atoms i e c2 based on their higher market cost relative to acetate chain elongation products such as medium chain carboxylates and higher alcohols have been the other major chemical groups targeted accordingly these form the boundary for our techno economic assessment to produce platform chemicals covering fuels and plastics overlaying market dynamics against potential products is critically important for commercialisation here we critically reviewed progress in microbial electrosynthesis and gas fermentation focussing on this biological co2 utilisation technology due to high efficiency and low cost compared to electrochemical and thermocatalytic approaches further the technology can use renewable electricity as the means to close the carbon cycle we conducted a simplified technoeconomic assessment based on cash flow analysis adopting the lcc metric to maintain consistency with input data used in our analysis and define pathways towards economic viability of co2 valorisation 2 processes 2 1 acetogens a link between electrochemistry and chemicals production acetogens are a unique group of bacteria comprising more than 100 known anaerobic microorganisms well characterised organisms include acetobacterium woodii clostridium ljungdahlii c autoethanogenum c carboxidivorans c aceticum eubacterium limosum and others in moorella spp and sporomusa spp de tissera et al 2019 spirito et al 2014 acetogens use the wood ljungdahl wl pathway also known as the reductive acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa pathway the most energy efficient autotrophic pathway for carbon fixation besides ethanol acetogens can natively produce acetate butanol lactate and 2 3 butanediol liew et al 2016 recent advances in metabolic engineering are rapidly increasing productivities and broadening the product spectrum to include isopropanol acetone succinic acid and isoprene amongst others jet fuel production is also advancing rapidly when coupling gas fermentation with the thermochemical alcohol to jet process atj de tissera et al 2019 handler et al 2016 liew et al 2016 wang et al 2014 advances in anaerobic microbial carbon fixation for chemical and fuel production are presented below for the two technologies gas fermentation discussed in section 2 2 and microbial electrosynthesis discussed in section 2 3 2 2 gas fermentation gas fermentation can use numerous waste streams containing h2 co and co2 i e synthesis gas or syngas from industrial processes such as steel manufacture exhausts and gasified solid or agricultural wastes as carbon and energy sources molitor et al 2016 steel mills currently produce 1400 mt yr of off gases globally de tissera et al 2019 syngas is also a widely used intermediate in thermochemical production routes for example fischer tropsch is an established catalytic process to produce mixes of hydrocarbon products from co and h2 methanol is also synthesised from syngas using a metal catalyst therefore similar to gas fermentation both these processes could be used for sustainable fuel production dimitriou et al 2015 okeke and mani 2017 gas fermentation is considered the leading sustainable alternative because it uses living organisms as catalysts i e acetogens which have greater tolerance to contaminants present in the gaseous feedstock less stringent syngas composition requirements and the ability to function at lower temperatures and pressures further since the biocatalyst can easily be interchanged gas fermentation offers more opportunities for product diversification without costly infrastructure changes köpke and simpson 2020 together these factors pave the way for improved process economics in the last decade acetogenic fermentation has become economically viable the highest ethanol rate so far is 369 g l d using pressurised reactors and more than 192 g l d at atmospheric pressure gaddy et al 2007 molitor et al 2016 peer reviewed gas fermentation literature data are presented in table s2 due to the inert nature of co2 acetogens can only convert gaseous feedstocks containing a suitable source of energy such as syngas containing co and h2 off gases containing mostly co2 while less attractive from an energetic viewpoint represent the vast majority of emissions further some co2 streams such as those associated to cement production have few mitigation opportunities as emissions are stoichiometrically associated with calcination of limestone to clinker van ruijven et al 2016 however for these streams the main concern is the source of metabolic energy to activate co2 2 3 microbial electrosynthesis whilst maintaining the same co2 fixation pathway with acetogens as gas fermentation an opportunity to supplement the lack of a suitable gaseous electron donors is offered by microbial electrosynthesis first reported in 1979 hongo and iwahara 1979 the term microbial electrosynthesis was then introduced by nevin and co workers in 2010 to define synthesis reactions in bioelectrochemical systems using microbes as biocatalysts nevin et al 2010 it was shown that sporomusa ovata was able to reduce co2 and generate acetate using the cathode of a bioelectrochemical system as the sole electron donor nevin et al 2010 later the same group showed that other acetogenic bacteria such as clostridium ljungdahlii c aceticum and moorella thermoacetica could also produce organic acids through microbial electrosynthesis nevin et al 2011 in the years since research in the area of electricity driven bioproduction has boomed with studies highlighting the need for improving productivity yields titers and product spectrum prévoteau et al 2020 however over 75 of studies published to date focused mostly on the production of acetate table s3 with titers and productivities far exceeded by those reported for gas fermentation with acetogens christodoulou et al 2017 flexer and jourdin 2020 as acetate is not particularly attractive economically fig 1 and table s1 and is difficult to extract from the biological medium recent research has been shifting toward production of higher chain organic fatty acids and alcohols for example medium chain carboxylates such as caproate c6 jourdin et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018 have been targeted on the basis of high value jourdin et al 2019 relative ease of extraction due to its low solubility in water and potential as a platform chemical further it has also been proposed that caproate can be used to produce drop in fuels through electro organic synthesis urban et al 2017 microbial electrosynthesis is based on the direct electrochemical supply of electrons to acetogens for co2 fixation this is attractive because contrary to gas fermentation electrosynthesis can potentially overcome higher gas mass transfer issues that typically affect h2 and co based fermentations as well as having higher theoretical carbon and energy product yields harnisch et al 2019 the process relies on the cultivation of acetogens on the surface of the cathode electrode where electron transfer is thought to occur through direct electron transfer e g using outer membrane cytochromes or other redox enzymes or through indirect electron transfer typically involving h2 generated at the electrode via water electrolysis prévoteau et al 2020 fig s1 compares gas fermentation and microbial electrosynthesis studies published between 2010 and 2020 in terms of volumetric productivity and titers while there has been significant improvement in recent years with values now in the order of g l d productivities and titers for microbial electrosynthesis are still up to one magnitude lower than those achievable in gas fermentation notably despite significant research effort direct feeding of acetogens with electrons has not been proven and is still poorly understood with hydrogen production being increasingly accepted as the intermediate in the best performing systems bajracharya et al 2015 harnisch et al 2019 prévoteau et al 2020 performance of microbial electrosynthesis against established benchmarks is presented in table 1 showing volumetric productivity is not the parameter most affecting economic viability jourdin and colleagues have shown total product energy efficiencies of 38 whilst also maintaining g l d productivities jourdin et al 2018 as this is close to the 50 energy efficiency target usually used for electrochemical system viability bajracharya et al 2019 any economic analysis considering only operational costs or electricity as a proxy overstates the true viability of microbial electrosynthesis in terms of titers the highest value achieved 16 g ljourdin et al 2019 is relatively low making the costly downstream processing step even more challenging but most importantly the highest observed current density sustained over a period of time obtained using a carbon felt electrode and normalised to projected surface area psa in high productivity microbial electrosynthesis is 11 ma cm2 jourdin et al 2018 this is a long way short of commercial electrolysers currently able to deliver h2 at up to 2000 ma cm2 prévoteau et al 2020 and the typically accepted viability threshold for electrochemical systems at 300 ma cm2 jouny et al 2018 such a low current density makes capital costs a non negligible contribution to production costs a fact that with a few exceptions notably prévoteau et al 2020 has not been widely acknowledged in literature these factors suggest from both a technical and economic perspective that it may be more appropriate for microbial electrosynthesis implementation to physically separate the abiotic process generating redox equivalents e g in the form of h2 produced through water electrolysis from the biotic process achieving gas fermentation into products this effectively yields an electrolyser assisted gas fermentation harnisch et al 2019 importantly through this decoupling strategies for implementation allow the improvement of abiotic and biotic processes separately on the basis of their specific requirements for optimisation in particular electrolytes and grow medium reactors geometry and configurations it is noted that such a system has recently been referred to as technical photosynthesis when powered by solar energy haas et al 2018 given acetogens can have energy efficiencies 80 claassens et al 2019 haas et al 2018 the overall solar to electrical solar pv to chemical energy conversion water electrolysis and fermentation should be much higher than photosynthetic organisms ca 10 15 compared to around 1 for photosynthesis haas et al 2018 3 technoeconomic framework for co2 valorisation acetogens offer a means to valorise co2 using renewable electricity and produce chemicals at high energy efficiency various production routes have been suggested in the literature which we present in detail in section 3 1 these can be grouped into four synthesis pathways reflecting strategies to reduce lcc moving down the list of the same underlying co2 fixation technology i e acetogenic fermentation as with any cost reduction there is a trade off in this case in terms of sustainability and substrate availability microbial electrosynthesis with a renewable source of carbon assumed to enable a circular carbon bioeconomy i e co2 from the atmosphere electrolyser assisted gas fermentation separating the abiotic and biotic processes in microbial electrosynthesis is considered as a strategy to reduce costs again a renewable source of carbon was assumed gas fermentation of reformed biogas this waste stream is renewable and was investigated as a mechanism to reduce cost as has been demonstrated for thermochemical methanol synthesis dimitriou et al 2015 and fischer tropsch fuels hydrocarbons dimitriou et al 2015 okeke and mani 2017 however the limited availability of biogas reduces the scale and hence sustainability of these production routes gas fermentation of waste syngas this is the only group which can not be considered renewable nor a circular carbon bioeconomy however it was considered in this assessment as it offers an ad interim strategy to reduce emissions and has demonstrated economic viability at scale it is worth noting in the latter two groups both waste streams can serve as a source of energy as they contain co and h2 significantly reducing cost compared to the former two groups a non renewable waste stream containing co2 only e g from a coal power station would lose this economic benefit whilst simultaneously minimising the sustainability benefit due to a net life cycle transfer of carbon to the atmosphere therefore such streams were not considered here we developed a high level technoeconomic framework presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 to compare these various routes and products to competing technology and current markets given the broad range of products considered we did not undertake detailed design of each production route but rather leveraged published values for unit operations in process chains to calculate lccs this is sensitive to parameters and limitations discussed in sections 4 6 and 4 7 3 1 production routes several production pathways were investigated by breaking down into common unit operations with table s5 through table s7 presenting the 70 various combinations each with a unique id number for 11 different products ranging from carboxylates and alcohols as well as other products reported in literature as attainable from upgrade of gas fermentation microbial electrolysis products i e alkanes angenent et al 2016 single cell protein molitor et al 2019 bioplastics mistry et al 2019 ethyl acetate andersen et al 2016 production routes are classified according to their synthesis pathway carbon source energy source and the final end product a typical simplified process flow diagram is presented in fig 2 microbial electrosynthesis is presented for ids 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 table s5 electrolyser assisted gas fermentation is presented for h2 table s5 ids 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 and via co table s5 ids 45 48 as the intermediate energy source for gas fermentation a scenario for h2 electrochemical production cost projected for 2030 was also assessed electrolysers simultaneously producing h2 hcooh and h2 co as co substrates for fermentation were considered as these may allow better product specificity liew et al 2016 table s5 h2 hcooh ids 47 50 51 54 h2 co ids 49 52 53 55 production of longer chain carboxylates through carbon chain elongation was investigated as ids 9 16 and 29 32 table s5 further details on production pathways mass balances and reactions can be found in the supplementary material section s3 1 alternative routes were also investigated as a means to reduce lccs for example h2 and co can be produced through biogas reforming table s5 ids 2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30 34 38 42 or obtained directly from steel mill waste syngas table s5 ids 3 7 11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 43 for several products in situ recovery is required to overcome low titers and metabolite toxicity whilst also increasing productivity and reducing downstream processing costs van hecke et al 2014 distillation is the traditional technique used to extract ethanol kiss et al 2016 and combining with gas stripping has been shown to result in 80 energy saving wang et al 2014 potentially overcoming economic barriers to butanol production in situ extraction of carboxylates can be achieved through electrodialysis and ion exchange hernandez et al 2021 kiss et al 2016 van hecke et al 2014 electrodialysis has been assumed here due to potential for lower extraction costs self cleaning abilities through reversing polarity and because it does not disrupt ph of the fermentation broth kumar et al 2019 other extraction technologies could prove useful in the future such as pertraction however economic investigations are yet to be undertaken and thus has not been included in this analysis cavalcante et al 2017 production of biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate phb requires cell disruption and extraction table s5 id 37 40 single cell protein scp depending on its end use may also require cell disruption hence in our assessment we assumed disruption to produce protein concentrate as presented in dai et al 2007 which is required for human consumption table s5 id 41 44 further details on cell disruption can be found in the supplementary material section s3 table s6 ids 56 64 combines thermochemical and fermentation approaches to investigate synergies for short term implementation strategies for example methanol has been advocated as a cheap fermentation substrate which can be produced thermochemically id 62 by the same token that electrolysers can link renewable electricity with gas fermentations thermochemical processes such as fischer tropsch and methanol synthesis stoll et al 2019 can also be linked through syngas electrochemical production of h2 and co ross et al 2017 competing production pathways that do not involve any fermentation unit operations are shown in table s7 ids 65 70 for competing processes such as fischer tropsch a strict h2 co ratio is required and therefore an additional reverse water gas shift reactor which has not been demonstrated at commercial scale and pressure swing adsorption gas separation are also required dimitriou et al 2015 several of these competing pathways have been reported in literature for example linking biogas reforming with fischer tropsch fuel production id 66 3 2 cash flow analysis for each of the production routes discussed in section 3 1 we have developed capital and operational costs using literature for all financial parameters and input assumptions we have used 2019 as the reference year and an australian reference plant size of 180 000 t yr scaling capital costs from the cited values as detailed in the supplementary material section s3 cash flow cf analysis based on net present value npv and levelised cost of chemicals lcc has been applied as it is a reliable methodology allowing comparison to present market prices na et al 2019 whilst presented in us results are based on australian renewable energy supply which is recognised for its low cost renewable energy potential hank et al 2018 overall assumptions and equations are listed in table 2 with lang factors used to scale equipment purchase cost epc to total depreciable capital tdc i e capex total

expenses ge associated with corporate activities as well as taxes are deducted from gross profit by converting all costs and sales s to a npv and assuming it equal to zero at a desired hurdle rate

et al 2004 3 2 1 variable costs variable costs include co2 capture water and electrolyser electricity we have adopted solar energy with 6 h of pumped hydro energy storage phes as us 65 62 mwh 2020 value decreasing to us 58 82 mwh in 2030 graham et al 2019 based on solar data at karratha in western australia this would allow substrate supply to a fermenter 87 of the time a co2 capture cost from the atmosphere of us 257 t in 2020 and us 117 t in 2030 has been used based on adjusting values for the plant operational time supplementary material section s3 2 water cost is based on current bulk supply charges in brisbane australia of us 2 05 t wastewater disposal and cooling water were taken as us 0 58 kl and us 5 57 gj wageningenx 2018 further details on derivation of all variable costs can be found in supplementary material section s3 2 3 3 fuel potential of products synthetic production of alkanes and alcohols are widely reported to be substitutes to gasoline anitha et al 2015 achieving a lcc comparable to the market price is however not a useful metric to measure the economic viability of liquid fuels therefore fuel lccs were further levelised to distance travelled for comparison amongst them and with conventional gasoline this was achieved through the following equation 3 3 l c c d l c c d f e where the term lccd us 100 km is the lcc us kg for a fuel levelised to distance travelled based on the fuel economy fe expressed in l 100 km and fuel density d as kg l fuel economy is based on the argonne national laboratory greet model for a my 2015 passenger vehicle as summarised in table 3 4 results and discussion results for each of the production routes in our technoeconomic framework are presented below first in sections 4 1 and 4 2 it is shown how microbial electrosynthesis in its current form has barriers to commercialisation sections 4 3 and 4 4 show how the underlying technology i e acetogenic fermentation can take advantage of cheaper sources of reducing equivalents to improve viability finally a comparison is made to existing fuel technologies in section 4 5 a sensitivity analysis and limitations are presented in sections 4 6 and 4 7 4 1 microbial electrosynthesis economics favour decoupling of biotic and abiotic processes lccs for microbial electrosynthesis are difficult to compute given the technology level of development jourdin et al 2020 however for all of our assessed products we show lccs at least an order of magnitude above the market price table 4 there is a significant difference between economics of microbial electrosynthesis and electrolyser assisted gas fermentation based on h2 electrolysis cost of us 5400 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id e2 whilst there has been improvement to microbial electrosynthesis current densities the highest value we are aware of 11 ma cm2 psa jourdin et al 2018 is still two orders of magnitude lower than a commercial electrolyser to understand the drivers of this and the consequent increase in capital cost consider claassens and colleagues calculated an upper current density limit of 50 ma cm2 for acetogens based on molecular hydrogen uptake and an optimistic biofilm thickness of 100 µm claassens et al 2019 it is important to recognise that since this is normalised to the biofilm surface it is the equivalent to considering the electrode total surface area tsa which can be ca 30 times the projected surface area psa for microbial electrosynthesis employing 3d electrodes e g carbon felt or reticulated vitreous carbon rvc accordingly this suggests that acetogen metabolism could theoretically support up to 1500 ma cm2 psa current which would lead to comparable economics with electrolyser assisted gas fermentation for reasons discussed below this value should be viewed with caution and is heavily dependant on assumptions while biofilm thickness is typically not reported in most studies for the sake of the argument we can consider an acetogenic biofilm thickness of 7 5 µm reported by jourdin and colleagues on a multiwalled carbon nanotubes coated rvc 2 54 mm pore diameter electrode capable of consuming electrons at 0 63 ma cm2 tsa jourdin et al 2016 at a characteristic biofilm cell density of 0 5 gdcw cm3 claassens et al 2019 this is equivalent to an electron uptake rate of 17 4 µmol e s gdcw which is lower than the upper limit for electron uptake by acetogens estimated by claassens and colleagues at 100 µmol e s gdcw claassens et al 2019 it is therefore unclear if acetogens can uptake electrons directly from electrodes at the same rate as molecular hydrogen assuming it is possible to reach this upper limit at a typical biofilm thickness of 10 µm we estimated an optimistic current density of 150 ma cm2 psa would be possible which is already more than 10 times higher than the highest current density of 11 ma cm2 psa reported by jourdin et al 2018 yet this would still not be sufficient to achieve economic viability for microbial electrosynthesis for example for acetate the lcc in this case is us 6500 t for microbial electrosynthesis compared to us 1800 t for electrolyser assisted gas fermentation table 4 this further illustrates that there are issues with achievable biofilm thickness and electron uptake limiting acetogen metabolism compared to a gas fermenter consequently current density has a significant effect on capital cost estimation and lcc na et al 2019 to a lesser degree overpotentials and energy efficiency influence lcc such that the best performing microbial electrosynthesis systems are around half as efficient as commercial electrolysers table s10 hence electricity costs are ca double for microbial electrosynthesis compared to electrolyser assisted gas fermentation we further investigated the required conditions to achieve the same lcc for acetate with microbial electrosynthesis and electrolyser assisted gas fermentation i e us 1800 t table 4 noting that for both routes this is still almost 3x the market price us 650 t table 4 to provide a capital cost target we assumed 100 faradaic efficiency at a cell voltage of 1 4 v corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 78 double the current best performing systems table 1 jourdin et al 2018 to meet the electrolyser assisted gas fermentation pathway cost the capex for microbial electrosynthesis under these optimistic assumptions would need to be 1 5th of current electrolyser costs on a per m2 basis documented in the us h2a project ainscough et al 2014 whilst the cathode catalysts used for microbial electrosynthesis are likely to be cheaper than those employed in water electrolysis refer supplementary material section s3 3 1 significant cost reductions will still be required for the anode considered in our assessment to be performing water electrolysis to o2 to maintain consistency with commercial electrolysers ion selective membranes and balance of plant costs which make up the majority of the capital cost ainscough et al 2014 however making these design changes without negatively impacting on productivity remains a challenge for researchers achieving a thick biofilm together with the maximal acetogen uptake rate will be important for the technology to be economically competitive alternatively at current performance bioelectrode costs m2 would need to be orders of magnitude lower than in commercial electrolysers as such in the subsequent analysis we considered electrolyser assisted gas fermentation as the only economically viable pathway forward for microbial electrosynthesis 4 2 going beyond acetate 4 2 1 medium chain products can be competitive but lack market size some acetogens such as c carboxidivorans and e limosum can produce higher products via direct condensation of acetyl coa however most literature has focussed on non acetogenic chain elongation via the reverse β oxidation rbo pathway this process works by elongating short chain carboxylates using an electron donor such as ethanol or lactate and represents another strategy to produce more desirable products cavalcante et al 2017 spirito et al 2014 table s4 presents a summary of selected chain elongation works notably grootscholten and colleagues have achieved industrial relevant caproate c6 productivities of 56 g l d grootscholten et al 2013 which is higher than the proposed benchmark of 24 g l d table 1 compared to acetate longer chain carboxylates such as caproate and caprylate have received great interest because of their higher value vassilev et al 2018 and potential for easier extraction chen et al 2017 kucek et al 2016 this has led to suggestions of combining electrolysers gas fermentation and chain elongation to upgrade the product spectrum of acetogens haas et al 2018 however a major limitation here remains the slow rate at which ethanol i e the electron donor for chain elongation can be produced from acetate vassilev et al 2018 our assessment shows that caproate is the only chemical that could be produced completely renewably via electrolyser assisted gas fermentation at a price competitive with the current market us 3100 t compared to us 3700 t table 4 this is also supported in a recent techno economic assessment of caproate microbial electrosynthesis production jourdin et al 2020 however there are significant caveats to this namely that the market for caproic acid is currently only 10 kt yr fig 1 table s1 market prices would have to significantly reduce to render the carboxylate platform possibilities economically attractive moscoviz et al 2019 spirito et al 2014 with the exception of perhaps niche high value applications such as pharmaceuticals nutraceuticals and cosmetics however hardly a bioeconomy based on co2 envisaged by researchers further downstream processing of carboxylates has been suggested to produce drop in fuels and significantly increase market demand acetogens can natively hydrogenate carboxylates to alcohols during solventogenesis liew et al 2016 other ideas include ketonisation steinbusch et al 2011 or kolbe electrolysis to decane angenent et al 2016 harnisch and schröder 2019 in the latter cases this would also allow spontaneous separation due to low density and solubility urban et al 2017 here however we show that this pathway results in a lcc almost seven times the current market price us 4300 t compared to us 620 t table 4 perhaps equally important there is no significant cost advantage over competing technology such as coupling electrolytic syngas co h2 production with fischer tropsch us 4300 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 65 or with syngas fermentation and alcohol to jet us 4400 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 59 therefore it may make more sense to try and develop market interest in the carboxylate platform through products that do not have strong competition technology such as butyrate or higher alcohols even for butyrate the resulting lcc us 2700 t table 4 still needs to reduce to be competitive to its current market value us 1800 t table 4 and even further to be a platform chemical moscoviz et al 2019 spirito et al 2014 the obvious area for improvement is downstream processing for electrodialytic extraction considered in our assessment this could include reducing energy consumption e g through more efficient configurations and installation costs e g through the use of spiral wound systems that have been suggested to reduce the required membrane area wright and winter 2019 4 2 2 co2 electrolysis long term viability an alternative to chain elongation is to provide acetogens with more reduced substrates which could be produced through co2 electrolysis this technology is at pre commercialisation stage for co and formic acid which can currently be produced at low overpotential and high faradaic efficiency spurgeon and kumar 2018 this approach could potentially be advantageous because unlike gas fermentation with h2 co2 mixtures which typically produce acetate other products are then feasible however at the expense of significant substrate oxidation and co2 production to balance reducing equivalents this reduces the overall process efficiency which is detrimental to process economics as well as increasing co2 emissions incorporating h2 as a co substrate with co negates the need for co oxidation and as we show here improves efficiency such that there is a 46 reduction in lcc for ethanol us 3400 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 49 compared to us 6300 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 48 this is however still well above the market price of us 480 t table 4 it is reasonable to assume lccs would approach that calculated for the h2 co2 pathway with improvements made to current density in co2 electrolysers to formic acid and co thus co2 electrolysis may eventually offer a means to improve economics and product spectrum interestingly heffernan and colleagues recently demonstrated a promising carbon distribution to ethanol needing only a small addition of co to a co2 and h2 fermentation heffernan et al 2020 4 2 3 acetate shows promise as a substrate for bioproteins and bioplastics production acetate has also been suggested as a potential intermediate to use as feedstock for biomass growth e g yielding protein or bioplastics i e power to protein power to plastics molitor and colleagues showed a two stage bioprocessing system with c ljungdahlii first anaerobically fermenting h2 and co2 to acetate then used to grow yeast of fungal cells under aerobic conditions as a type of single cell protein scp the carbon yield to biomass was 25 with a protein mass fraction of 40 50 molitor et al 2019 this concept is not without precedence as a protein source for both animals and humans consumption with the notable case of germany replacing half of all imported protein with yeast biomass during world war i nasseri et al 2011 however scp can not be the sole source of protein for humans due to associated health problems such as gout without further costly treatment to disrupt the cell wall and remove the nucleic acid content or extract the protein fraction quorn is an example which is processed by centrifugation filtration rna reduction and spray drying nasseri et al 2011 given that protein for human consumption has a much higher value and market than commodity chemicals fig 1 table s1 using acetate for scp production could be a scalable strategy our assessment shows when considered as a human food scp at a lcc of us 9300 t table 4 is within the typical retail price of common protein sources priced at around us 15 000 t tables 4 s1 however further consideration is required for costs associated with reaching sufficient purity and quality for human consumption as well as understanding social acceptance as an animal feed this scenario is not presented in our evaluation however it would likely be less favourable in fact even though in this case the costly cell disruption processing step is not required the market cost of animal feed is far lower at only us 460 t table s1 even below the cost of the acetate substrate thus making its production less competitive regarding bioplastics dai and colleagues used acetate as a sole substrate for biomass growth accumulating the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate phb to 41 of the dry cell weight dai et al 2007 similar to scp for human consumption phb must be recovered by costly cell disruption with our methodology for the power to plastics concept showing a lcc of us 7100 t table 4 still well above the plastics market price of ca us 1000 t fig 1 table s1 interestingly acetogens have been engineered to produce the monomer unit 3 hydroxybutyrate 3hb extracellularly köpke and simpson 2020 which may significantly improve the process economics however this was not considered in our assessment 4 2 4 future of water electrolysis to 2030 does not offer significant improvement predicted electrolyser cost reductions of 17 by 2030 section s3 3 1 us 5400 per ton h2 compared to us 4400 t coupled with a 55 reduction in co2 capture costs show a corresponding decrease in lccs of between 20 and 30 table 4 intuitively the biggest changes are seen in the more reduced products due to the higher requirement of hydrogen reducing power for their production however these projections do not significantly change the overall process economics assuming there are no significant changes in market prices renewable lactic acid production from h2 co2 fermentation would be the only attractive proposition out of the eleven products investigated benefitting from electrolyser cost reductions us 1400 t in 2030 is below the us 1500 t market price table 4 however it is known the price of lactic acid must half rodrigues et al 2017 in order for bioplastic pla production to be competitive with petrochemical alternatives and this 11 difference is therefore not sufficient this is however much closer to competitiveness than phb at us 5300 t table 4 lactic acid has significant potential in the bioplastics market however one must consider fermentation is not the main cost for existing production but rather extraction furthermore we note lactic acid has never been demonstrated as a major product in gas fermentations even using co which would likely mean yields will never compete with the industrially relevant route involving lactic acid bacteria at near its market price us 1800 t table 4 our assessment shows that butyrate presents an interesting opportunity closing to within 20 us 2200 t table 4 by 2030 unlike caproic acid it has a much larger market and potential use cases fig 1 table s1 in particular its isomer isobutyric acid could substitute fossil based production of methyl methacrylic acid chen et al 2017 isobutyric acid production by reactor microbiomes has been reported by several groups including ours chen et al 2017 vassilev et al 2018 considering an acute supply shortage pachapur et al 2016 there could be a niche opportunity for microbial electrochemical technologies to meet the butyric acid market all alcohols and alkanes considered here would remain more than twice the current market price thereby achieving little change in their economic viability the sole ester investigated ethyl acetate would remain ca 1 5x the current market price table 4 while it is difficult to predict future chemical prices this analysis is based on the best available electrolyser projections ainscough et al 2014 and a constant fermentation unit cost given most experts believe electrolyser cost reductions are thought to result from economy of scale rather than r d schmidt et al 2017 gas fermentation research must consider alternative implementation pathways in order to become an adopted co2 valorisation technology this is particularly important because as the cost of hydrogen reduces the likelihood of hydrogen transport infrastructure investment increases reducing the final consumer price below that of co2 based fuels 4 3 biogas for sustainable and economic chemical synthesis water electrolysis using renewable energy is not the only way to source sustainable h2 for chemical production at appropriate scale reformed biogas has also been shown as an economically viable source for h2 montenegro camacho et al 2017 this is however limited by biogas availability which results in smaller plant sizes than others investigated here ca 1 5th 1 15th and therefore lccs for this scenario suffer from lack of economy of scale 40 to 120 despite this when coupled with gas fermentation product economics such as for butanol us 1100 t ethanol us 880 t and methanol us 630 t are improved by 60 compared to electrolyser assisted gas fermentation table 4 of these butanol is the closest to its market price albeit still at a 20 cost premium interestingly production of lactic acid using biogas as a carbon and energy source reduces the production cost 39 below the market price almost to the point where polylactic acid pla would be competitive one option to further reduce costs is to use biogas directly as a substrate negating the need for a reformer however anaerobic oxidation of methane technology is in its infancy and so is not considered here refer supplementary material section 3 3 3 broadly speaking this illustrates gas fermentation warrants further attention for water utility operators as it would offer greater revenue streams than cogeneration as product values are higher than typical biogas energy content value further the worldwide annual biogas availability at wastewater and landfills estimated at ca 1470 mt co2e epa 2012 could potentially satisfy the demand for a bioplastic substitute of polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate pet kumar et al 2019 of around 250 mt yr beckman 2018 as a comparison using biogas for fuel production could potentially only satisfy less than 10 of the current market 4 4 steel mill off gas fermentation is a commercial reality today three commercial gas fermentation plants operate or are under construction using steel mill off gas in asia and europe the first gas fermentation commercial plant opened in may 2018 in hebei province china capable of producing 42 kt yr ethanol köpke and simpson 2020 not surprisingly whilst we have not considered detailed aspects of the design such as gas mix composition adjustments our assessment shows an ethanol lcc of us 270 t well below the market price of us 480 t table 4 lanzatech is a key player producing ethanol from steel mill off gas similarly most other products considered including butanol are below their respective market prices highlighting the economic drivers for using steel mill off gas for acetogenic fermentations consequently lanzatech is broadening their product using metabolic engineering however one must consider the sustainability of steel waste gas availability steel production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions van ruijven et al 2016 yet there is considerable scope for mitigation through recycling electrification and substituting process fossil fuels with renewable hydrogen nidheesh and kumar 2019 furthermore whilst life cycle assessments lcas have shown this process to have 60 lower emissions than conventional gasoline handler et al 2016 gas fermentation of reformed biogas as discussed above would likely be even more attractive 4 5 fuel assessment acetogens natively can produce alcohols which are considered alternative fuels köpke and simpson 2020 unlike the economic assessment above fuel assessments should be normalised to a distance travelled to allow comparison to gasoline technology additionally whilst we do not attempt to quantify there are inherent differences in sustainability of fossil fuel based gasoline and the biotechnology approaches discussed in this paper alcohols are already used in the racing industry due to safety and performance advantages over gasoline particularly methanol anitha et al 2015 and ethanol as they offer integrated solutions to renewable energy storage and platform chemical production hank et al 2018 ethanol is already widely used in blend ratios handler et al 2016 however it has a number of drawbacks such as low energy density corrosion potential to engines and infrastructure and storage issues associated with water absorption butanol is a drop in fuel more similar to gasoline wang et al 2014 moreover with a higher energy density butanol can reduce co2 co and nox emissions on a per kilometre basis in existing gasoline vehicles albeit with potential cold start issues liu et al 2019 it is also worth considering the special case of jet fuel the aviation industry one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise staffell et al 2019 due to strict regulations on new technologies for safe operation geleynse et al 2018 is very sensitive to fuel costs which represent approximately 30 of the overall operating costs deane et al 2017 to maintain aircraft ranges and route economics a comparable energy density to jet fuel is required therefore precluding electric aircraft alcohol to jet is a thermo catalytic process being investigated commercially as a complementary technology to gas fermentation linking ethanol and butanol to alkane production geleynse et al 2018 here we present a comparison between fuels produced according to our chosen production scenarios results are presented in table 5 as well as a comparing to competing pathways based on fischer tropsch methanol synthesis and biomass fermentation gasoline with its production cost of us 3 8 100 km is presented as the benchmark interestingly fuel production through coupling water electrolysis and gas fermentation i e electrolyser assisted gas fermentation column in table 5 is typically associated with a lcc levelised to a distance travelled lccd that is five to nine times that of gasoline this highlights the significant difficulty of this technology to be used for renewable fuel production at present lower molecular weight fuels such as ethanol perform better in this analysis due to a higher overall energy efficiency from synthesis through to use however even using 2030 electrolyser projected costs lccds are still four to six times that of gasoline 10 18 us 100 km table 5 using biogas as an energy and carbon source allows ethanol to be within double the gasoline price 5 8 us 100 km table 5 interestingly in our analysis decane production through gas fermentation chain elongation and kolbe electrolysis does not have as much a cost benefit from using biogas instead of water electrolysis with air captured co2 us 14 100 km versus us 18 100 km table 5 this is likely because decane production requires multiple unit operations diluting the importance of hydrogen cost despite waste syngas not being a sustainable long term strategy demonstrated pathways to ethanol us 1 8 100 km table 5 would both be 40 cheaper than current gasoline levelised price us 3 8 100 km 4 5 1 other technologies for fuels production it is important to consider the processes calculated here in the context of alternative thermochemical approaches fischer tropsch is the established thermochemical technology to produce fuels from syngas reported costs for fischer tropsch fuels show a large variability depending on substrate e g biogas biomass and scale but is between us 1400 t and us 2000 t dimitriou et al 2015 at typical industry scales compared to a biogas fischer tropsch process evaluated here at us 2300 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 66 our assessment suggests that this is more economically attractive than the gas fermentation of reformed biogas pathway via carbon chain elongation and kolbe electrolysis to alkanes us 2700 t table 4 it is important to note that a direct comparison is not possible since the microbial electrosynthesis pathway assumes an optimistic 100 faradaic efficiency to decane urban et al 2017 whereas fischer tropsch yields a mix of products interestingly when alcohol to jet is coupled to gas fermentation of reformed biogas the overall lcc is 10 via ethanol and 17 via butanol lower than for biogas reforming assisted fischer tropsch us 2100 t us 1900 t and us 2300 t respectively on supplementary material cash flow sheet ids 58 60 and 66 this appears to be because of acetogen flexibility in substrate ratio does not require the additional reverse water gas shift compared to fischer tropsch demonstrating the power of combining fermentation approaches with downstream thermochemical unit operations as opposed the direct fischer tropsch approach despite these process advantages it appears the only way to be competitive with liquid fossil fuels is using waste gas feedstock or biomass 4 5 2 comparison to electric vehicles shows why liquid fuels are relevant when considering fuel potential it is worth comparing to other technologies such as liquid hydrogen fuel cell vehicles fcev and battery electric vehicles bevs which requires consideration of more than just levelised cost of fuel we do not aim to provide a holistic consumer cost here due to complicating factors such as government subsidies and differing purchase prices but rather highlight aspects for further consideration unlike the liquid fuels discussed to this point there are distribution infrastructure changes required for such technologies these costs will be location specific however when considered at a global scale are not trivial and should be considered further hydrogen fcev distribution infrastructure could cost up to us 15 trillion 300 times that estimated for alcohol fuels kaskavelis 2019 however hydrogen refueller costs are likely to drop by more than 67 as the technology mature staffell et al 2019 current pump price is us 10 kg irena 2018 in japan and us 13 99 kg in california conventional hydrogen production which suggests distribution costs between us 8 kg and us 10 kg irena 2018 or between us 8 2 100 km and us 10 100 km based on data in table 3 distribution infrastructure costs for bevs are difficult to estimate because it is inherently dependant on charging behaviour some modelling has shown likely grid upgrade costs between us 1700 and us 5800 per bev at 15 penetration sahoo et al 2019 or us 1 7 5 8 trillion for the 1 billion global car fleet in line with further estimates of us 5 trillion kaskavelis 2019 assuming a cost of capital of 6 and 10 000 km annual travel distance this could equate to between us 1 5 100 km and us 5 1 100 km in the context of the fuel assessment here these are not trivial amounts and should be considered further in any comparison to synthetic fuels 4 5 3 the case for methanol whilst there are currently no economically viable completely renewable and sustainable fuel technology options there remains an increasing urgency to decarbonise the transportation and industrial sectors for example we estimate that a us 235 t carbon price the equivalent of us 10 100 km would be required to make electrolyser assisted gas fermentation to ethanol us 14 100 km table 5 competitive with gasoline whilst fuel cell research could improve the situation through improved efficiencies perhaps there is also a need to make step wise emission reductions through incremental technology transitions similar to gas fermentation using steel mill waste gas adopting a cheap feedstock for example methanol or natural gas albeit with positive emissions could be an ad interim strategy in the transition to a completely circular co2 bioeconomy acetogen metabolism has been primarily investigated for c1 gases co and co2 they however suffer from low water solubility which is a limitation on productivity cotton et al 2020 methanol could have a transformative impact on biotechnology being completely miscible in water and can be produced as renewable feedstocks directly from co2 cotton et al 2020 in addition to improved mass transfer efficiency metabolic analysis shows that methanol has the highest energetic efficiency 80 90 of all c1 electron donor e g compared to h2 co2 or co at 60 80 claassens et al 2019 cotton et al 2020 based on growth rates and product spectrum butyribacterium methylotrophicum and eubacterium limosum are methylotrophic acetogen candidates suitable for industrial production cotton et al 2020 non renewable methanol synthesis plants rely on economy of scale and the low market price of us 300 t fig 1 illustrates the interest for its use as a biotechnology feedstock for example drop in fuel butanol could potentially be produced at the current market price through this route us 930 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 62 however it is worth noting that renewable methanol production from co2 through the thermochemical route is more expensive than the current market price renewable methanol has been suggested as feasible at as low as us 560 t hank et al 2018 in some locations which would increase this calculated butanol lcc overall this suggests acetogenic methylotrophic growth has interesting potential to reach higher products at higher growth rates and energy efficiency and be potentially economically viable 4 6 sensitivity analysis due to the difficulties in the attainment of high quality and consistent data and the necessity to make a number of assumptions to enable our assessments we conducted a sensitivity analysis on select products to investigate the most important parameters affecting the calculated lccs four production routes were selected to cover all of the associated unit operations investigated table s5 ids 5 13 22 26 input parameters are presented in table s11 and results are summarised in fig 3 noting not all parameters are involved in all routes importantly all parameters attenuate relative changes such that lcc is affected to a lesser degree for electrolyser enabled pathways ethanol and decane on fig 3 sensitivity analysis shows the electrolyser cost is the critical component of lcc this allows commentary to be made around industrial waste streams containing only co2 such as those produced by cement plants and coal power plants utilising these streams would be similar to electrolyser assisted gas fermentation because an energy source i e h2 from electrolysis is required to activate co2 since also for this scenario electrolytic h2 production is the main driver of cost as opposed to co2 capture fig 3 there is little benefit to valorise co2 waste streams from a purely economic point of view for example even if the co2 waste stream had a zero cost and could be used directly into a gas fermenter the ethanol lcc reduction would be 14 and still almost four times the market price further this reduction is not sufficient to make the lcc for any product investigated bar lactate drop below the market price data not shown equally important since these approaches do not result in a closed carbon cycle since the source or carbon is non renewable it is also not as a sustainable approach as those investigated notably the biogas reforming assisted pathways presented to butanol and lactate are dominated more by the gas fermenter costs in the case of lactate extraction is a key cost additional case study data showing how epcs relate to tci would be very beneficial to reinforce these results 4 7 limitations the analysis presented here is based on a 15 hurdle rate and upfront capital however platform chemicals and fuel production plants may be different and with a loan period which would impact the lccs calculated here therefore comparing to the market price could be misleading yet drawing conclusions between different productions to direct research remains valid concept designs underpinning this analysis may not reflect potential scale up designs for example it has been assumed for all electrolysers that the anode reaction is left as oxygen evolution as suggested by na et al 2019 adopting organic oxidation reactions at the anode could improve economics this could be achieved for example using production routes coupling kolbe electrolysis at the anode with hydrogen production at the cathode however the challenge would be then balancing multiple product supply and demand a fuel product at the cathode would need to balance electron production at the anode gas fermentation conceptual designs in this work are based on a gas fermentation for ethanol production the reference unit operation is designed based on a set productivity and titre and by applying this to other fermentations an assumption must be made around capacity here we assume an equal mol c and do not seek to account for demonstrated production rate difference obviously there is significant variation between pathways shown in literature e g table s2 which can be attributed to natural microorganism metabolism but also down to research interest however as the work here is looking at identifying research directions it is assumed these productivities and titers can be achieved across the board furthermore some pathways despite having genes coding in genomes may never be elucidated or demonstrated 5 conclusions acetogenic microorganisms hold promise to promote a circular carbon bioeconomy through our economic assessment we reinforce recent literature suggesting separation of abiotic and biotic processes in microbial electrosynthesis is the most likely scale up pathway even then cost reductions are still required for the abiotic electrochemical reduction step to h2 to make microbial electrosynthesis as is economically viable research is required to significantly reduce costs associated with electrodes especially the often overlooked anode membranes and the balance of plant as well as to overcome the apparent current density limit of acetogens analysis suggests there are implementation pathways to consider which can improve the overall process economics for acetogens for example reforming of biogas can significantly improve sustainable production while the use of steel mill waste gas improves process economics whilst from an emissions perspective this is worse than utilising biogas it would still be an improvement on current petrochemical practices of the 11 products we assessed there needs to be a redistribution of research focus towards products with higher chances of competing with current fossil fuel technology including butyrate

16825,a circular carbon bioeconomy has potential to halt atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases causing climate change and sustainably produce chemical agricultural and fuel products here we report application of a simplified technoeconomic assessment to critically review two approaches in this space microbial electrosynthesis and gas fermentation for microbial electrosynthesis decoupling of surface dependant abiotic process for electron delivery from volume dependant biotic carbon fixation is shown as the only economically viable strategy to scale up due to comparatively low biofilm electron consumption rate this is effectively an electrolyser assisted gas fermentation system targeting high value products such as protein for human food consumption is one of the few pathways forward for electrolyser assisted gas fermentation alternatively gas fermentation of reformed biogas presents an interesting and potentially more sustainable implementation pathway to improve economic

resulted in exponential atmospheric accumulation of carbon dioxide co2 reaching over 407 ppm in 2018 unprecedented at any point in the last 800 000 years blunden and arndt 2019 greenhouse gases such as co2 and methane ch4 trap heat and have already caused ca 1 0 c of global warming above pre industrial levels with associated long term changes to climate sea level and extreme weather events limiting warming to 1 5 c a target agreed at the 21st conference of parties in paris would require net co2 emissions to reduce by approximately 45 relative to 2010 levels by 2030 reaching net zero by 2050 ipcc 2018 as a result scientific research to meet these targets and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels is arguably the defining challenge of the 21st century industrial greenhouse gas emissions represent roughly one third of all emissions worldwide yet have proven difficult to reduce staffell et al 2019 for industry the challenge is how to economically decrease emissions that are integral to the process e g steel production or the result of reaction stoichiometry e g cement production production plants typically have a long design life e g 50 years which presents limited opportunity for new technology to reduce emissions moreover developing new green technologies to compete against incumbents with already depreciated asset bases is challenging elmekawy et al 2016 making it imperative to guide research efforts with appropriate economic justification considering costs supply demand and technology high energy efficiency bioproduction of chemicals and fuels haas et al 2018 using basic renewable resources may offer a sustainable solution for production whilst also having lower operating conditions temperature and pressure meaning smaller capital expenditures köpke and simpson 2020 thus far biotechnology has for the most part been based on biomass fermentations via the sugar platform however based on current fuel demand of 2000 mt yr fig 1 table s1 an optimistic growth yield of 8 t ha yr and fermentation yield of 30 500 800 mha would be required just for biofuel production not including food which is equivalent to 30 60 of land currently used for food production 1 5 gha irena 2014 therefore complementary biotechnology approaches will be required gas fermentation with acetogens has a smaller associated footprint compared with biomass fermentation harnisch et al 2019 typical feedstocks for gas fermentation include synthesis gases produced through biomass gasification as well as industrial exhausts containing mixtures of h2 co and co2 collectively referred to as syngas microbial electrosynthesis is a potential complementary future platform technology that like gas fermentation uses acetogens for carbon fixation nevin et al 2010 through direct use of electrodes to feed acetogens with the required reducing equivalents for cellular metabolism microbial electrosynthesis has attracted significant attention in recent years for its potential to sustainably convert gas streams containing mostly co2 into platform chemicals in the context of the so called circular bioeconomy and unlike other biotechnology approaches such as microalgae microbial electrosynthesis offers opportunities to store excess renewable electricity in chemicals and fuels and reduce industrial environmental impact this concept is often termed power to x with x indicating for example gas fuels or chemicals harnisch et al 2019 despite increasing interest the transition has proven challenging to implement due to economics zimmermann and schomäcker 2017 within the area of microbial electrosynthesis of the limited number of economic assessments available in the scientific literature christodoulou et al 2017 jourdin et al 2020 shemfe et al 2018 they have not covered the range of products and pathways suggestion by researchers a simple assessment considering only energy input has been undertaken across a range of products as an initial screening tool desloover et al 2012 critically whilst there is great promise to link production with intermittent renewable electricity for low cost production many researchers have failed to account for the subsequent poor utilisation of plant capacity prévoteau et al 2020 this would cause capital expenses to dominate levelised cost of chemicals lccs that is lifetime production costs amortised over lifetime production more detailed technoeconomic assessments have been completed for electrochemical approaches na et al 2019 spurgeon and kumar 2018 in the absence of a broad assessment to direct research streams for maximum impact there has been a strong focus in microbial electrosynthesis literature on production of acetate a carboxylate with two carbon atoms i e c2 based on their higher market cost relative to acetate chain elongation products such as medium chain carboxylates and higher alcohols have been the other major chemical groups targeted accordingly these form the boundary for our techno economic assessment to produce platform chemicals covering fuels and plastics overlaying market dynamics against potential products is critically important for commercialisation here we critically reviewed progress in microbial electrosynthesis and gas fermentation focussing on this biological co2 utilisation technology due to high efficiency and low cost compared to electrochemical and thermocatalytic approaches further the technology can use renewable electricity as the means to close the carbon cycle we conducted a simplified technoeconomic assessment based on cash flow analysis adopting the lcc metric to maintain consistency with input data used in our analysis and define pathways towards economic viability of co2 valorisation 2 processes 2 1 acetogens a link between electrochemistry and chemicals production acetogens are a unique group of bacteria comprising more than 100 known anaerobic microorganisms well characterised organisms include acetobacterium woodii clostridium ljungdahlii c autoethanogenum c carboxidivorans c aceticum eubacterium limosum and others in moorella spp and sporomusa spp de tissera et al 2019 spirito et al 2014 acetogens use the wood ljungdahl wl pathway also known as the reductive acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa pathway the most energy efficient autotrophic pathway for carbon fixation besides ethanol acetogens can natively produce acetate butanol lactate and 2 3 butanediol liew et al 2016 recent advances in metabolic engineering are rapidly increasing productivities and broadening the product spectrum to include isopropanol acetone succinic acid and isoprene amongst others jet fuel production is also advancing rapidly when coupling gas fermentation with the thermochemical alcohol to jet process atj de tissera et al 2019 handler et al 2016 liew et al 2016 wang et al 2014 advances in anaerobic microbial carbon fixation for chemical and fuel production are presented below for the two technologies gas fermentation discussed in section 2 2 and microbial electrosynthesis discussed in section 2 3 2 2 gas fermentation gas fermentation can use numerous waste streams containing h2 co and co2 i e synthesis gas or syngas from industrial processes such as steel manufacture exhausts and gasified solid or agricultural wastes as carbon and energy sources molitor et al 2016 steel mills currently produce 1400 mt yr of off gases globally de tissera et al 2019 syngas is also a widely used intermediate in thermochemical production routes for example fischer tropsch is an established catalytic process to produce mixes of hydrocarbon products from co and h2 methanol is also synthesised from syngas using a metal catalyst therefore similar to gas fermentation both these processes could be used for sustainable fuel production dimitriou et al 2015 okeke and mani 2017 gas fermentation is considered the leading sustainable alternative because it uses living organisms as catalysts i e acetogens which have greater tolerance to contaminants present in the gaseous feedstock less stringent syngas composition requirements and the ability to function at lower temperatures and pressures further since the biocatalyst can easily be interchanged gas fermentation offers more opportunities for product diversification without costly infrastructure changes köpke and simpson 2020 together these factors pave the way for improved process economics in the last decade acetogenic fermentation has become economically viable the highest ethanol rate so far is 369 g l d using pressurised reactors and more than 192 g l d at atmospheric pressure gaddy et al 2007 molitor et al 2016 peer reviewed gas fermentation literature data are presented in table s2 due to the inert nature of co2 acetogens can only convert gaseous feedstocks containing a suitable source of energy such as syngas containing co and h2 off gases containing mostly co2 while less attractive from an energetic viewpoint represent the vast majority of emissions further some co2 streams such as those associated to cement production have few mitigation opportunities as emissions are stoichiometrically associated with calcination of limestone to clinker van ruijven et al 2016 however for these streams the main concern is the source of metabolic energy to activate co2 2 3 microbial electrosynthesis whilst maintaining the same co2 fixation pathway with acetogens as gas fermentation an opportunity to supplement the lack of a suitable gaseous electron donors is offered by microbial electrosynthesis first reported in 1979 hongo and iwahara 1979 the term microbial electrosynthesis was then introduced by nevin and co workers in 2010 to define synthesis reactions in bioelectrochemical systems using microbes as biocatalysts nevin et al 2010 it was shown that sporomusa ovata was able to reduce co2 and generate acetate using the cathode of a bioelectrochemical system as the sole electron donor nevin et al 2010 later the same group showed that other acetogenic bacteria such as clostridium ljungdahlii c aceticum and moorella thermoacetica could also produce organic acids through microbial electrosynthesis nevin et al 2011 in the years since research in the area of electricity driven bioproduction has boomed with studies highlighting the need for improving productivity yields titers and product spectrum prévoteau et al 2020 however over 75 of studies published to date focused mostly on the production of acetate table s3 with titers and productivities far exceeded by those reported for gas fermentation with acetogens christodoulou et al 2017 flexer and jourdin 2020 as acetate is not particularly attractive economically fig 1 and table s1 and is difficult to extract from the biological medium recent research has been shifting toward production of higher chain organic fatty acids and alcohols for example medium chain carboxylates such as caproate c6 jourdin et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018 have been targeted on the basis of high value jourdin et al 2019 relative ease of extraction due to its low solubility in water and potential as a platform chemical further it has also been proposed that caproate can be used to produce drop in fuels through electro organic synthesis urban et al 2017 microbial electrosynthesis is based on the direct electrochemical supply of electrons to acetogens for co2 fixation this is attractive because contrary to gas fermentation electrosynthesis can potentially overcome higher gas mass transfer issues that typically affect h2 and co based fermentations as well as having higher theoretical carbon and energy product yields harnisch et al 2019 the process relies on the cultivation of acetogens on the surface of the cathode electrode where electron transfer is thought to occur through direct electron transfer e g using outer membrane cytochromes or other redox enzymes or through indirect electron transfer typically involving h2 generated at the electrode via water electrolysis prévoteau et al 2020 fig s1 compares gas fermentation and microbial electrosynthesis studies published between 2010 and 2020 in terms of volumetric productivity and titers while there has been significant improvement in recent years with values now in the order of g l d productivities and titers for microbial electrosynthesis are still up to one magnitude lower than those achievable in gas fermentation notably despite significant research effort direct feeding of acetogens with electrons has not been proven and is still poorly understood with hydrogen production being increasingly accepted as the intermediate in the best performing systems bajracharya et al 2015 harnisch et al 2019 prévoteau et al 2020 performance of microbial electrosynthesis against established benchmarks is presented in table 1 showing volumetric productivity is not the parameter most affecting economic viability jourdin and colleagues have shown total product energy efficiencies of 38 whilst also maintaining g l d productivities jourdin et al 2018 as this is close to the 50 energy efficiency target usually used for electrochemical system viability bajracharya et al 2019 any economic analysis considering only operational costs or electricity as a proxy overstates the true viability of microbial electrosynthesis in terms of titers the highest value achieved 16 g ljourdin et al 2019 is relatively low making the costly downstream processing step even more challenging but most importantly the highest observed current density sustained over a period of time obtained using a carbon felt electrode and normalised to projected surface area psa in high productivity microbial electrosynthesis is 11 ma cm2 jourdin et al 2018 this is a long way short of commercial electrolysers currently able to deliver h2 at up to 2000 ma cm2 prévoteau et al 2020 and the typically accepted viability threshold for electrochemical systems at 300 ma cm2 jouny et al 2018 such a low current density makes capital costs a non negligible contribution to production costs a fact that with a few exceptions notably prévoteau et al 2020 has not been widely acknowledged in literature these factors suggest from both a technical and economic perspective that it may be more appropriate for microbial electrosynthesis implementation to physically separate the abiotic process generating redox equivalents e g in the form of h2 produced through water electrolysis from the biotic process achieving gas fermentation into products this effectively yields an electrolyser assisted gas fermentation harnisch et al 2019 importantly through this decoupling strategies for implementation allow the improvement of abiotic and biotic processes separately on the basis of their specific requirements for optimisation in particular electrolytes and grow medium reactors geometry and configurations it is noted that such a system has recently been referred to as technical photosynthesis when powered by solar energy haas et al 2018 given acetogens can have energy efficiencies 80 claassens et al 2019 haas et al 2018 the overall solar to electrical solar pv to chemical energy conversion water electrolysis and fermentation should be much higher than photosynthetic organisms ca 10 15 compared to around 1 for photosynthesis haas et al 2018 3 technoeconomic framework for co2 valorisation acetogens offer a means to valorise co2 using renewable electricity and produce chemicals at high energy efficiency various production routes have been suggested in the literature which we present in detail in section 3 1 these can be grouped into four synthesis pathways reflecting strategies to reduce lcc moving down the list of the same underlying co2 fixation technology i e acetogenic fermentation as with any cost reduction there is a trade off in this case in terms of sustainability and substrate availability microbial electrosynthesis with a renewable source of carbon assumed to enable a circular carbon bioeconomy i e co2 from the atmosphere electrolyser assisted gas fermentation separating the abiotic and biotic processes in microbial electrosynthesis is considered as a strategy to reduce costs again a renewable source of carbon was assumed gas fermentation of reformed biogas this waste stream is renewable and was investigated as a mechanism to reduce cost as has been demonstrated for thermochemical methanol synthesis dimitriou et al 2015 and fischer tropsch fuels hydrocarbons dimitriou et al 2015 okeke and mani 2017 however the limited availability of biogas reduces the scale and hence sustainability of these production routes gas fermentation of waste syngas this is the only group which can not be considered renewable nor a circular carbon bioeconomy however it was considered in this assessment as it offers an ad interim strategy to reduce emissions and has demonstrated economic viability at scale it is worth noting in the latter two groups both waste streams can serve as a source of energy as they contain co and h2 significantly reducing cost compared to the former two groups a non renewable waste stream containing co2 only e g from a coal power station would lose this economic benefit whilst simultaneously minimising the sustainability benefit due to a net life cycle transfer of carbon to the atmosphere therefore such streams were not considered here we developed a high level technoeconomic framework presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 to compare these various routes and products to competing technology and current markets given the broad range of products considered we did not undertake detailed design of each production route but rather leveraged published values for unit operations in process chains to calculate lccs this is sensitive to parameters and limitations discussed in sections 4 6 and 4 7 3 1 production routes several production pathways were investigated by breaking down into common unit operations with table s5 through table s7 presenting the 70 various combinations each with a unique id number for 11 different products ranging from carboxylates and alcohols as well as other products reported in literature as attainable from upgrade of gas fermentation microbial electrolysis products i e alkanes angenent et al 2016 single cell protein molitor et al 2019 bioplastics mistry et al 2019 ethyl acetate andersen et al 2016 production routes are classified according to their synthesis pathway carbon source energy source and the final end product a typical simplified process flow diagram is presented in fig 2

table s5 ids 45 48 as the intermediate energy source for gas fermentation a scenario for h2 electrochemical production cost projected for 2030 was also assessed electrolysers simultaneously producing h2 hcooh and h2 co as co substrates for fermentation were considered as these may allow better product specificity liew et al 2016 table s5 h2 hcooh ids 47 50 51 54 h2 co ids 49 52 53 55 production of longer chain carboxylates through carbon chain elongation was investigated as ids 9 16 and 29 32 table s5 further details on production pathways mass balances and reactions can be found in the supplementary material section s3 1 alternative routes were also investigated as a means to reduce lccs for example h2 and co can be produced through biogas reforming table s5 ids 2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30 34 38 42 or obtained directly from steel mill waste syngas table s5 ids 3 7 11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 43 for several products in situ recovery is required to overcome low titers and metabolite toxicity whilst also increasing productivity and reducing downstream processing costs van hecke et al 2014 distillation is the traditional technique used to extract ethanol kiss et al 2016 and combining with gas stripping has been shown to result in 80 energy saving wang et al 2014 potentially overcoming economic barriers to butanol production in situ extraction of carboxylates can be achieved through electrodialysis and ion exchange hernandez et al 2021 kiss et al 2016 van hecke et al 2014 electrodialysis has been assumed here due to potential for lower extraction costs self cleaning abilities through reversing polarity and because it does not disrupt ph of the fermentation broth kumar et al 2019 other extraction technologies could prove useful in the future such as pertraction however economic investigations are yet to be undertaken and thus has not been included in this analysis cavalcante et al 2017 production of biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate phb requires cell disruption and extraction table s5 id 37 40 single cell protein scp depending on its end use may also require cell disruption hence in our assessment we assumed disruption to produce protein concentrate as presented in dai et al 2007 which is required for human consumption table s5 id 41 44 further details on cell disruption can be found in the supplementary material section s3 table s6 ids 56 64 combines thermochemical and fermentation approaches to investigate synergies for short term implementation strategies for example methanol has been advocated as a cheap fermentation substrate which can be produced thermochemically id 62 by the same token that electrolysers can link renewable electricity with gas fermentations thermochemical processes such as fischer tropsch and methanol synthesis stoll et al 2019 can also be linked through syngas electrochemical production of h2 and co ross et al 2017 competing production pathways that do not involve any fermentation unit operations are shown in table s7 ids 65 70 for competing processes such as fischer tropsch a strict h2 co ratio is required and therefore an additional reverse water gas shift reactor which has not been demonstrated at commercial scale and pressure swing adsorption gas separation are also required dimitriou et al 2015 several of these competing pathways have been reported in literature for example linking biogas reforming with fischer tropsch fuel production id 66 3 2 cash flow analysis for each of the production routes discussed in section 3 1 we have developed capital and operational costs using literature for all financial parameters and input assumptions we have used 2019 as the reference year and an australian reference plant size of 180 000 t yr scaling capital costs from the cited values as detailed in the supplementary material section s3 cash flow cf analysis based on net present value npv and levelised cost of chemicals lcc has been applied as it is a reliable methodology allowing comparison to present market prices na et al 2019 whilst presented in us results are based on australian renewable energy supply which is recognised for its low cost renewable energy potential hank et al 2018 overall assumptions and equations are listed in table 2 with lang factors used to scale equipment purchase cost epc to total depreciable capital tdc i e capex total

et al 2004 3 2 1 variable costs variable costs include co2 capture water and electrolyser electricity we have adopted solar energy with 6 h of pumped hydro energy storage phes as us 65 62 mwh 2020 value decreasing to us 58 82 mwh in 2030 graham et al 2019 based on solar data at karratha in western australia this would allow substrate supply to a fermenter 87 of the time a co2 capture cost from the atmosphere of us 257 t in 2020 and us 117 t in 2030 has been used based on adjusting values for the plant operational time supplementary material section s3 2 water cost is based on current bulk supply charges in brisbane australia of us 2 05 t wastewater disposal and cooling water were taken as us 0 58 kl and us 5 57 gj wageningenx 2018 further details on derivation of all variable costs can be found in supplementary material section s3 2 3 3 fuel potential of products synthetic production of alkanes and alcohols are widely reported to be substitutes to gasoline anitha et al 2015 achieving a lcc comparable to the market price is however not a useful metric to measure the economic viability of liquid fuels therefore fuel lccs were further levelised to distance travelled for comparison amongst them and with conventional gasoline this was achieved through the following equation 3 3 l c c d l c c d f e where the term lccd us 100 km is the lcc us kg for a fuel levelised to distance travelled based on the fuel economy fe expressed in l 100 km and fuel density d as kg l fuel economy is based on the argonne national laboratory greet model for a my 2015 passenger vehicle as summarised in table 3 4 results and discussion results for each of the production routes in our technoeconomic framework are presented below first in sections 4 1 and 4 2 it is shown how microbial electrosynthesis in its current form has barriers to commercialisation sections 4 3 and 4 4 show how the underlying technology i e acetogenic fermentation can take advantage of cheaper sources of reducing equivalents to improve viability finally a comparison is made to existing fuel technologies in section 4 5 a sensitivity analysis and limitations are presented in sections 4 6 and 4 7 4 1 microbial electrosynthesis economics favour decoupling of biotic and abiotic processes lccs for microbial electrosynthesis are difficult to compute given the technology level of development jourdin et al 2020 however for all of our assessed products we show lccs at least an order of magnitude above the market price table 4 there is a significant difference between economics of microbial electrosynthesis and electrolyser assisted gas fermentation based on h2 electrolysis cost of us 5400 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id e2 whilst there has been improvement to microbial electrosynthesis current densities the highest value we are aware of 11 ma cm2 psa jourdin et al 2018 is still two orders of magnitude lower than a commercial electrolyser to understand the drivers of this and the consequent increase in capital cost consider claassens and colleagues calculated an upper current density limit of 50 ma cm2 for acetogens based on molecular hydrogen uptake and an optimistic biofilm thickness of 100 µm claassens et al 2019 it is important to recognise that since this is normalised to the biofilm surface it is the equivalent to considering the electrode total surface area tsa which can be ca 30 times the projected surface area psa for microbial electrosynthesis employing 3d electrodes e g carbon felt or reticulated vitreous carbon rvc accordingly this suggests that acetogen metabolism could theoretically support up to 1500 ma cm2 psa current which would lead to comparable economics with electrolyser assisted gas fermentation for reasons discussed below this value should be viewed with caution and is heavily dependant on assumptions while biofilm thickness is typically not reported in most studies for the sake of the argument we can consider an acetogenic biofilm thickness of 7 5 µm reported by jourdin and colleagues on a multiwalled carbon nanotubes coated rvc 2 54 mm pore diameter electrode capable of consuming electrons at 0 63 ma cm2 tsa jourdin et al 2016 at a characteristic biofilm cell density of 0 5 gdcw cm3 claassens et al 2019 this is equivalent to an electron uptake rate of 17 4 µmol e s gdcw which is lower than the upper limit for electron uptake by acetogens estimated by claassens and colleagues at 100 µmol e s gdcw claassens et al 2019 it is therefore unclear if acetogens can uptake electrons directly from electrodes at the same rate as molecular hydrogen assuming it is possible to reach this upper limit at a typical biofilm thickness of 10 µm we estimated an optimistic current density of 150 ma cm2 psa would be possible which is already more than 10 times higher than the highest current density of 11 ma cm2 psa reported by jourdin et al 2018 yet this would still not be sufficient to achieve economic viability for microbial electrosynthesis for example for acetate the lcc in this case is us 6500 t for microbial electrosynthesis compared to us 1800 t for electrolyser assisted gas fermentation table 4 this further illustrates that there are issues with achievable biofilm thickness and electron uptake limiting acetogen metabolism compared to a gas fermenter consequently current density has a significant effect on capital cost estimation and lcc na et al 2019 to a lesser degree overpotentials and energy efficiency influence lcc such that the best performing microbial electrosynthesis systems are around half as efficient as commercial electrolysers table s10 hence electricity costs are ca double for microbial electrosynthesis compared to electrolyser assisted gas fermentation we further investigated the required conditions to achieve the same lcc for acetate with microbial electrosynthesis and electrolyser assisted gas fermentation i e us 1800 t table 4 noting that for both routes this is still almost 3x the market price us 650 t table 4 to provide a capital cost target we assumed 100 faradaic efficiency at a cell voltage of 1 4 v corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 78 double the current best performing systems table 1 jourdin et al 2018 to meet the electrolyser assisted gas fermentation pathway cost the capex for microbial electrosynthesis under these optimistic assumptions would need to be 1 5th of current electrolyser costs on a per m2 basis documented in the us h2a project ainscough et al 2014 whilst the cathode catalysts used for microbial electrosynthesis are likely to be cheaper than those employed in water electrolysis refer supplementary material section s3 3 1 significant cost reductions will still be required for the anode considered in our assessment to be performing water electrolysis to o2 to maintain consistency with commercial electrolysers ion selective membranes and balance of plant costs which make up the majority of the capital cost ainscough et al 2014 however making these design changes without negatively impacting on productivity remains a challenge for researchers achieving a thick biofilm together with the maximal acetogen uptake rate will be important for the technology to be economically competitive alternatively at current performance bioelectrode costs m2 would need to be orders of magnitude lower than in commercial electrolysers as such in the subsequent analysis we considered electrolyser assisted gas fermentation as the only economically viable pathway forward for microbial electrosynthesis 4 2 going beyond acetate 4 2 1 medium chain products can be competitive but lack market size some acetogens such as c carboxidivorans and e limosum can produce higher products via direct condensation of acetyl coa however most literature has focussed on non acetogenic chain elongation via the reverse β oxidation rbo pathway this process works by elongating short chain carboxylates using an electron donor such as ethanol or lactate and represents another strategy to produce more desirable products cavalcante et al 2017 spirito et al 2014 table s4 presents a summary of selected chain elongation works notably grootscholten and colleagues have achieved industrial relevant caproate c6 productivities of 56 g l d grootscholten et al 2013 which is higher than the proposed benchmark of 24 g l d table 1 compared to acetate longer chain carboxylates such as caproate and caprylate have received great interest because of their higher value vassilev et al 2018 and potential for easier extraction chen et al 2017 kucek et al 2016 this has led to suggestions of combining electrolysers gas fermentation and chain elongation to upgrade the product spectrum of acetogens haas et al 2018 however a major limitation here remains the slow rate at which ethanol i e the electron donor for chain elongation can be produced from acetate vassilev et al 2018 our assessment shows that caproate is the only chemical that could be produced completely renewably via electrolyser assisted gas fermentation at a price competitive with the current market us 3100 t compared to us 3700 t table 4 this is also supported in a recent techno economic assessment of caproate microbial electrosynthesis production jourdin et al 2020 however there are significant caveats to this namely that the market for caproic acid is currently only 10 kt yr fig 1 table s1 market prices would have to significantly reduce to render the carboxylate platform possibilities economically attractive moscoviz et al 2019 spirito et al 2014 with the exception of perhaps niche high value applications such as pharmaceuticals nutraceuticals and cosmetics however hardly a bioeconomy based on co2 envisaged by researchers further downstream processing of carboxylates has been suggested to produce drop in fuels and significantly increase market demand acetogens can natively hydrogenate carboxylates to alcohols during solventogenesis liew et al 2016 other ideas include ketonisation steinbusch et al 2011 or kolbe electrolysis to decane angenent et al 2016 harnisch and schröder 2019 in the latter cases this would also allow spontaneous separation due to low density and solubility urban et al 2017 here however we show that this pathway results in a lcc almost seven times the current market price us 4300 t compared to us 620 t table 4 perhaps equally important there is no significant cost advantage over competing technology such as coupling electrolytic syngas co h2 production with fischer tropsch us 4300 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 65 or with syngas fermentation and alcohol to jet us 4400 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 59 therefore it may make more sense to try and develop market interest in the carboxylate platform through products that do not have strong competition technology such as butyrate or higher alcohols even for butyrate the resulting lcc us 2700 t table 4 still needs to reduce to be competitive to its current market value us 1800 t table 4 and even further to be a platform chemical moscoviz et al 2019 spirito et al 2014 the obvious area for improvement is downstream processing for electrodialytic extraction considered in our assessment this could include reducing energy consumption e g through more efficient configurations and installation costs e g through the use of spiral wound systems that have been suggested to reduce the required membrane area wright and winter 2019 4 2 2 co2 electrolysis long term viability an alternative to chain elongation is to provide acetogens with more reduced substrates which could be produced through co2 electrolysis this technology is at pre commercialisation stage for co and formic acid which can currently be produced at low overpotential and high faradaic efficiency spurgeon and kumar 2018 this approach could potentially be advantageous because unlike gas fermentation with h2 co2 mixtures which typically produce acetate other products are then feasible however at the expense of significant substrate oxidation and co2 production to balance reducing equivalents this reduces the overall process efficiency which is detrimental to process economics as well as increasing co2 emissions incorporating h2 as a co substrate with co negates the need for co oxidation and as we show here improves efficiency such that there is a 46 reduction in lcc for ethanol us 3400 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 49 compared to us 6300 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 48 this is however still well above the market price of us 480 t table 4 it is reasonable to assume lccs would approach that calculated for the h2 co2 pathway with improvements made to current density in co2 electrolysers to formic acid and co thus co2 electrolysis may eventually offer a means to improve economics and product spectrum interestingly heffernan and colleagues recently demonstrated a promising carbon distribution to ethanol needing only a small addition of co to a co2 and h2 fermentation heffernan et al 2020 4 2 3 acetate shows promise as a substrate for bioproteins and bioplastics production acetate has also been suggested as a potential intermediate to use as feedstock for biomass growth e g yielding protein or bioplastics i e power to protein power to plastics molitor and colleagues showed a two stage bioprocessing system with c ljungdahlii first anaerobically fermenting h2 and co2 to acetate then used to grow yeast of fungal cells under aerobic conditions as a type of single cell protein scp the carbon yield to biomass was 25 with a protein mass fraction of 40 50 molitor et al 2019 this concept is not without precedence as a protein source for both animals and humans consumption with the notable case of germany replacing half of all imported protein with yeast biomass during world war i nasseri et al 2011 however scp can not be the sole source of protein for humans due to associated health problems such as gout without further costly treatment to disrupt the cell wall and remove the nucleic acid content or extract the protein fraction quorn is an example which is processed by centrifugation filtration rna reduction and spray drying nasseri et al 2011 given that protein for human consumption has a much higher value and market than commodity chemicals fig 1 table s1 using acetate for scp production could be a scalable strategy our assessment shows when considered as a human food scp at a lcc of us 9300 t table 4 is within the typical retail price of common protein sources priced at around us 15 000 t tables 4 s1 however further consideration is required for costs associated with reaching sufficient purity and quality for human consumption as well as understanding social acceptance as an animal feed this scenario is not presented in our evaluation however it would likely be less favourable in fact even though in this case the costly cell disruption processing step is not required the market cost of animal feed is far lower at only us 460 t table s1 even below the cost of the acetate substrate thus making its production less competitive regarding bioplastics dai and colleagues used acetate as a sole substrate for biomass growth accumulating the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate phb to 41 of the dry cell weight dai et al 2007 similar to scp for human consumption phb must be recovered by costly cell disruption with our methodology for the power to plastics concept showing a lcc of us 7100 t table 4 still well above the plastics market price of ca us 1000 t fig 1 table s1 interestingly acetogens have been engineered to produce the monomer unit 3 hydroxybutyrate 3hb extracellularly köpke and simpson 2020 which may significantly improve the process economics however this was not considered in our assessment 4 2 4 future of water electrolysis to 2030 does not offer significant improvement predicted electrolyser cost reductions of 17 by 2030 section s3 3 1 us 5400 per ton h2 compared to us 4400 t coupled with a 55 reduction in co2 capture costs show a corresponding decrease in lccs of between 20 and 30 table 4 intuitively the biggest changes are seen in the more reduced products due to the higher requirement of hydrogen reducing power for their production however these projections do not significantly change the overall process economics assuming there are no significant changes in market prices renewable lactic acid production from h2 co2 fermentation would be the only attractive proposition out of the eleven products investigated benefitting from electrolyser cost reductions us 1400 t in 2030 is below the us 1500 t market price table 4 however it is known the price of lactic acid must half rodrigues et al 2017 in order for bioplastic pla production to be competitive with petrochemical alternatives and this 11 difference is therefore not sufficient this is however much closer to competitiveness than phb at us 5300 t table 4 lactic acid has significant potential in the bioplastics market however one must consider fermentation is not the main cost for existing production but rather extraction furthermore we note lactic acid has never been demonstrated as a major product in gas fermentations even using co which would likely mean yields will never compete with the industrially relevant route involving lactic acid bacteria at near its market price us 1800 t table 4 our assessment shows that butyrate presents an interesting opportunity closing to within 20 us 2200 t table 4 by 2030 unlike caproic acid it has a much larger market and potential use cases fig 1 table s1 in particular its isomer isobutyric acid could substitute fossil based production of methyl methacrylic acid chen et al 2017 isobutyric acid production by reactor microbiomes has been reported by several groups including ours chen et al 2017 vassilev et al 2018 considering an acute supply shortage pachapur et al 2016 there could be a niche opportunity for microbial electrochemical technologies to meet the butyric acid market all alcohols and alkanes considered here would remain more than twice the current market price thereby achieving little change in their economic viability the sole ester investigated ethyl acetate would remain ca 1 5x the current market price table 4 while it is difficult to predict future chemical prices this analysis is based on the best available electrolyser projections ainscough et al 2014 and a constant fermentation unit cost given most experts believe electrolyser cost reductions are thought to result from economy of scale rather than r d schmidt et al 2017 gas fermentation research must consider alternative implementation pathways in order to become an adopted co2 valorisation technology this is particularly important because as the cost of hydrogen reduces the likelihood of hydrogen transport infrastructure investment increases reducing the final consumer price below that of co2 based fuels 4 3 biogas for sustainable and economic chemical synthesis water electrolysis using renewable energy is not the only way to source sustainable h2 for chemical production at appropriate scale reformed biogas has also been shown as an economically viable source for h2 montenegro camacho et al 2017 this is however limited by biogas availability which results in smaller plant sizes than others investigated here ca 1 5th 1 15th and therefore lccs for this scenario suffer from lack of economy of scale 40 to 120 despite this when coupled with gas fermentation product economics such as for butanol us 1100 t ethanol us 880 t and methanol us 630 t are improved by 60 compared to electrolyser assisted gas fermentation table 4 of these butanol is the closest to its market price albeit still at a 20 cost premium interestingly production of lactic acid using biogas as a carbon and energy source reduces the production cost 39 below the market price almost to the point where polylactic acid pla would be competitive one option to further reduce costs is to use biogas directly as a substrate negating the need for a reformer however anaerobic oxidation of methane technology is in its infancy and so is not considered here refer supplementary material section 3 3 3 broadly speaking this illustrates gas fermentation warrants further attention for water utility operators as it would offer greater revenue streams than cogeneration as product values are higher than typical biogas energy content value further the worldwide annual biogas availability at wastewater and landfills estimated at ca 1470 mt co2e epa 2012 could potentially satisfy the demand for a bioplastic substitute of polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate pet kumar et al 2019 of around 250 mt yr beckman 2018 as a comparison using biogas for fuel production could potentially only satisfy less than 10 of the current market 4 4 steel mill off gas fermentation is a commercial reality today three commercial gas fermentation plants operate or are under construction using steel mill off gas in asia and europe the first gas fermentation commercial plant opened in may 2018 in hebei province china capable of producing 42 kt yr ethanol köpke and simpson 2020 not surprisingly whilst we have not considered detailed aspects of the design such as gas mix composition adjustments our assessment shows an ethanol lcc of us 270 t well below the market price of us 480 t table 4 lanzatech is a key player producing ethanol from steel mill off gas similarly most other products considered including butanol are below their respective market prices highlighting the economic drivers for using steel mill off gas for acetogenic fermentations consequently lanzatech is broadening their product using metabolic engineering however one must consider the sustainability of steel waste gas availability steel production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions van ruijven et al 2016 yet there is considerable scope for mitigation through recycling electrification and substituting process fossil fuels with renewable hydrogen nidheesh and kumar 2019 furthermore whilst life cycle assessments lcas have shown this process to have 60 lower emissions than conventional gasoline handler et al 2016 gas fermentation of reformed biogas as discussed above would likely be even more attractive 4 5 fuel assessment acetogens natively can produce alcohols which are considered alternative fuels köpke and simpson 2020 unlike the economic assessment above fuel assessments should be normalised to a distance travelled to allow comparison to gasoline technology additionally whilst we do not attempt to quantify there are inherent differences in sustainability of fossil fuel based gasoline and the biotechnology approaches discussed in this paper alcohols are already used in the racing industry due to safety and performance advantages over gasoline particularly methanol anitha et al 2015 and ethanol as they offer integrated solutions to renewable energy storage and platform chemical production hank et al 2018 ethanol is already widely used in blend ratios handler et al 2016 however it has a number of drawbacks such as low energy density corrosion potential to engines and infrastructure and storage issues associated with water absorption butanol is a drop in fuel more similar to gasoline wang et al 2014 moreover with a higher energy density butanol can reduce co2 co and nox emissions on a per kilometre basis in existing gasoline vehicles albeit with potential cold start issues liu et al 2019 it is also worth considering the special case of jet fuel the aviation industry one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise staffell et al 2019 due to strict regulations on new technologies for safe operation geleynse et al 2018 is very sensitive to fuel costs which represent approximately 30 of the overall operating costs deane et al 2017 to maintain aircraft ranges and route economics a comparable energy density to jet fuel is required therefore precluding electric aircraft alcohol to jet is a thermo catalytic process being investigated commercially as a complementary technology to gas fermentation linking ethanol and butanol to alkane production geleynse et al 2018 here we present a comparison between fuels produced according to our chosen production scenarios results are presented in table 5 as well as a comparing to competing pathways based on fischer tropsch methanol synthesis and biomass fermentation gasoline with its production cost of us 3 8 100 km is presented as the benchmark interestingly fuel production through coupling water electrolysis and gas fermentation i e electrolyser assisted gas fermentation column in table 5 is typically associated with a lcc levelised to a distance travelled lccd that is five to nine times that of gasoline this highlights the significant difficulty of this technology to be used for renewable fuel production at present lower molecular weight fuels such as ethanol perform better in this analysis due to a higher overall energy efficiency from synthesis through to use however even using 2030 electrolyser projected costs lccds are still four to six times that of gasoline 10 18 us 100 km table 5 using biogas as an energy and carbon source allows ethanol to be within double the gasoline price 5 8 us 100 km table 5 interestingly in our analysis decane production through gas fermentation chain elongation and kolbe electrolysis does not have as much a cost benefit from using biogas instead of water electrolysis with air captured co2 us 14 100 km versus us 18 100 km table 5 this is likely because decane production requires multiple unit operations diluting the importance of hydrogen cost despite waste syngas not being a sustainable long term strategy demonstrated pathways to ethanol us 1 8 100 km table 5 would both be 40 cheaper than current gasoline levelised price us 3 8 100 km 4 5 1 other technologies for fuels production it is important to consider the processes calculated here in the context of alternative thermochemical approaches fischer tropsch is the established thermochemical technology to produce fuels from syngas reported costs for fischer tropsch fuels show a large variability depending on substrate e g biogas biomass and scale but is between us 1400 t and us 2000 t dimitriou et al 2015 at typical industry scales compared to a biogas fischer tropsch process evaluated here at us 2300 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 66 our assessment suggests that this is more economically attractive than the gas fermentation of reformed biogas pathway via carbon chain elongation and kolbe electrolysis to alkanes us 2700 t table 4 it is important to note that a direct comparison is not possible since the microbial electrosynthesis pathway assumes an optimistic 100 faradaic efficiency to decane urban et al 2017 whereas fischer tropsch yields a mix of products interestingly when alcohol to jet is coupled to gas fermentation of reformed biogas the overall lcc is 10 via ethanol and 17 via butanol lower than for biogas reforming assisted fischer tropsch us 2100 t us 1900 t and us 2300 t respectively on supplementary material cash flow sheet ids 58 60 and 66 this appears to be because of acetogen flexibility in substrate ratio does not require the additional reverse water gas shift compared to fischer tropsch demonstrating the power of combining fermentation approaches with downstream thermochemical unit operations as opposed the direct fischer tropsch approach despite these process advantages it appears the only way to be competitive with liquid fossil fuels is using waste gas feedstock or biomass 4 5 2 comparison to electric vehicles shows why liquid fuels are relevant when considering fuel potential it is worth comparing to other technologies such as liquid hydrogen fuel cell vehicles fcev and battery electric vehicles bevs which requires consideration of more than just levelised cost of fuel we do not aim to provide a holistic consumer cost here due to complicating factors such as government subsidies and differing purchase prices but rather highlight aspects for further consideration unlike the liquid fuels discussed to this point there are distribution infrastructure changes required for such technologies these costs will be location specific however when considered at a global scale are not trivial and should be considered further hydrogen fcev distribution infrastructure could cost up to us 15 trillion 300 times that estimated for alcohol fuels kaskavelis 2019 however hydrogen refueller costs are likely to drop by more than 67 as the technology mature staffell et al 2019 current pump price is us 10 kg irena 2018 in japan and us 13 99 kg in california conventional hydrogen production which suggests distribution costs between us 8 kg and us 10 kg irena 2018 or between us 8 2 100 km and us 10 100 km based on data in table 3 distribution infrastructure costs for bevs are difficult to estimate because it is inherently dependant on charging behaviour some modelling has shown likely grid upgrade costs between us 1700 and us 5800 per bev at 15 penetration sahoo et al 2019 or us 1 7 5 8 trillion for the 1 billion global car fleet in line with further estimates of us 5 trillion kaskavelis 2019 assuming a cost of capital of 6 and 10 000 km annual travel distance this could equate to between us 1 5 100 km and us 5 1 100 km in the context of the fuel assessment here these are not trivial amounts and should be considered further in any comparison to synthetic fuels 4 5 3 the case for methanol whilst there are currently no economically viable completely renewable and sustainable fuel technology options there remains an increasing urgency to decarbonise the transportation and industrial sectors for example we estimate that a us 235 t carbon price the equivalent of us 10 100 km would be required to make electrolyser assisted gas fermentation to ethanol us 14 100 km table 5 competitive with gasoline whilst fuel cell research could improve the situation through improved efficiencies perhaps there is also a need to make step wise emission reductions through incremental technology transitions similar to gas fermentation using steel mill waste gas adopting a cheap feedstock for example methanol or natural gas albeit with positive emissions could be an ad interim strategy in the transition to a completely circular co2 bioeconomy acetogen metabolism has been primarily investigated for c1 gases co and co2 they however suffer from low water solubility which is a limitation on productivity cotton et al 2020 methanol could have a transformative impact on biotechnology being completely miscible in water and can be produced as renewable feedstocks directly from co2 cotton et al 2020 in addition to improved mass transfer efficiency metabolic analysis shows that methanol has the highest energetic efficiency 80 90 of all c1 electron donor e g compared to h2 co2 or co at 60 80 claassens et al 2019 cotton et al 2020 based on growth rates and product spectrum butyribacterium methylotrophicum and eubacterium limosum are methylotrophic acetogen candidates suitable for industrial production cotton et al 2020 non renewable methanol synthesis plants rely on economy of scale and the low market price of us 300 t fig 1 illustrates the interest for its use as a biotechnology feedstock for example drop in fuel butanol could potentially be produced at the current market price through this route us 930 t supplementary material cash flow sheet id 62 however it is worth noting that renewable methanol production from co2 through the thermochemical route is more expensive than the current market price renewable methanol has been suggested as feasible at as low as us 560 t hank et al 2018 in some locations which would increase this calculated butanol lcc overall this suggests acetogenic methylotrophic growth has interesting potential to reach higher products at higher growth rates and energy efficiency and be potentially economically viable 4 6 sensitivity analysis due to the difficulties in the attainment of high quality and consistent data and the necessity to make a number of assumptions to enable our assessments we conducted a sensitivity analysis on select products to investigate the most important parameters affecting the calculated lccs four production routes were selected to cover all of the associated unit operations investigated table s5 ids 5 13 22 26 input parameters are presented in table s11 and results are summarised in fig 3 noting not all parameters are involved in all routes importantly all parameters attenuate relative changes such that lcc is affected to a lesser degree for electrolyser enabled pathways ethanol and decane on fig 3 sensitivity analysis shows the electrolyser cost is the critical component of lcc this allows commentary to be made around industrial waste streams containing only co2 such as those produced by cement plants and coal power plants utilising these streams would be similar to electrolyser assisted gas fermentation because an energy source i e h2 from electrolysis is required to activate co2 since also for this scenario electrolytic h2 production is the main driver of cost as opposed to co2 capture fig 3 there is little benefit to valorise co2 waste streams from a purely economic point of view for example even if the co2 waste stream had a zero cost and could be used directly into a gas fermenter the ethanol lcc reduction would be 14 and still almost four times the market price further this reduction is not sufficient to make the lcc for any product investigated bar lactate drop below the market price data not shown equally important since these approaches do not result in a closed carbon cycle since the source or carbon is non renewable it is also not as a sustainable approach as those investigated notably the biogas reforming assisted pathways presented to butanol and lactate are dominated more by the gas fermenter costs in the case of lactate extraction is a key cost additional case study data showing how epcs relate to tci would be very beneficial to reinforce these results 4 7 limitations the analysis presented here is based on a 15 hurdle rate and upfront capital however platform chemicals and fuel production plants may be different and with a loan period which would impact the lccs calculated here therefore comparing to the market price could be misleading yet drawing conclusions between different productions to direct research remains valid concept designs underpinning this analysis may not reflect potential scale up designs for example it has been assumed for all electrolysers that the anode reaction is left as oxygen evolution as suggested by na et al 2019 adopting organic oxidation reactions at the anode could improve economics this could be achieved for example using production routes coupling kolbe electrolysis at the anode with hydrogen production at the cathode however the challenge would be then balancing multiple product supply and demand a fuel product at the cathode would need to balance electron production at the anode gas fermentation conceptual designs in this work are based on a gas fermentation for ethanol production the reference unit operation is designed based on a set productivity and titre and by applying this to other fermentations an assumption must be made around capacity here we assume an equal mol c and do not seek to account for demonstrated production rate difference obviously there is significant variation between pathways shown in literature e g table s2 which can be attributed to natural microorganism metabolism but also down to research interest however as the work here is looking at identifying research directions it is assumed these productivities and titers can be achieved across the board furthermore some pathways despite having genes coding in genomes may never be elucidated or demonstrated 5 conclusions acetogenic microorganisms hold promise to promote a circular carbon bioeconomy through our economic assessment we reinforce recent literature suggesting separation of abiotic and biotic processes in microbial electrosynthesis is the most likely scale up pathway even then cost reductions are still required for the abiotic electrochemical reduction step to h2 to make microbial electrosynthesis as is economically viable research is required to significantly reduce costs associated with electrodes especially the often overlooked anode membranes and the balance of plant as well as to overcome the apparent current density limit of acetogens analysis suggests there are implementation pathways to consider which can improve the overall process economics for acetogens for example reforming of biogas can significantly improve sustainable production while the use of steel mill waste gas improves process economics whilst from an emissions perspective this is worse than utilising biogas it would still be an improvement on current petrochemical practices of the 11 products we assessed there needs to be a redistribution of research focus towards products with higher chances of competing with current fossil fuel technology including butyrate

16826,nanoplastics nps are plastic particles with sizes ranging between 1 and 1000 nm exhibiting exceptional qualities such as large surface area lightweight durability therefore are widely used in cosmetics paints electronics etc nps are inevitability released into the aquatic environment where they tend to interact with both the extracellular polymeric substances eps and other fractions of natural organic matter nom respectively secreted by organisms e g dna proteins and carbohydrates and degradation byproducts of organic materials e g humic acid and fulvic acid fluxed into the water bodies these biomolecules robustly encapsulate nps to develop an eco corona layer that alters not only the physicochemical properties but also the fate bioreactivity and ecological impacts of nps therefore this review summarized the documented studies highlighting the eco corona formation on nps and associated ecological implications in the aquatic environment after presenting the precise background information on the occurrence of nps and eps in the aquatic environment we demonstrated the basic difference between eco corona and bio corona formation the reviewed studies showed that the eco corona formed on nps have varying sizes and composition mainly depending on the properties of parent biomolecules characteristics of nps and physicochemical parameters of the aquatic environment further the potential methods for characterization and quantification of eco corona and its composition have been also highlighted moreover the ecological implications both toxic and non toxic of eco corona formation on nps in marine and freshwater environments have been also summarized last but not the least challenges and future research directions are also given e g conducting field studies on eco corona formation in the aquatic environment optimizing methods for its characterization and quantification and considering eco corona concept in the future toxicity studies on nps finally understanding eco corona formation will be critical to unveil the complex np interactions occurring in natural aquatic systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics eco corona extracellular polymeric substances toxicity aquatic organisms 1 introduction plastics are abundantly used in various fields owing to their unique properties such as low cost lightweight durability and portability due to the high market demand a gradual increase in global plastic manufacturing has been observed since the 1960s with the recent production of 360 million tons in 2018 plasticseurope 2019 however unregulated consumption and improper disposal of plastics have resulted in their ubiquitous accumulation in every corner of the globe which researchers describe as living in the plasticene alimi et al 2018 rochman et al 2013 the recent plastic load in surface waters of the open ocean is estimated as high as 10 000 40 000 tons therefore plastics are considered as one of the major components of marine litter cózar et al 2014 law et al 2010 in the natural environment plastic debris and microplastics mps will break down into miniature particles termed nanoplastics nps through various processes such as hydrolysis biodegradation photodegradation and mechanical abrasion lambert and wagner 2016 moreover nps are also released inevitably into the environment from products that contain manufactured nano sized particles for various biomedical applications and consumer products koelmans et al 2017 the occurrence and accumulation of nps in the aquatic environment have raised alarming concerns due to their known hazardous impacts on aquatic organisms gaylarde et al 2020 although studies on the occurrence of nps in the aquatic environment are elusive yet they have been reported in water samples from the north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 and in surface snow from the austrian alps materić et al 2020 recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that nps can induce physiological wang et al 2021a and behavioral alterations mattsson et al 2015 embryotoxicity eliso et al 2020 reproductive abnormalities sarasamma et al 2020 transgenerational impacts liu et al 2020 and immunotoxicity greven et al 2016 in aquatic organisms besides plastic entities natural organic matter nom is also ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment comprised of complex assemblies of heterogeneous organic compounds with significantly varying composition and molecular weight wang et al 2015 nom can be categorized into autochthonous and allochthonous compounds respectively released inside the water body and formed outside and then transported into the water body docter et al 2015b the autochthonous nom is an assembly of biomolecules released by organisms after in situ reduction and it accounts for a significant proportion of organic macromolecules in the aquatic ecosystem wilkinson and lead 2007 among autochthonous nom the extracellular polymeric substances eps are the main and important constituents secreted by aquatic organisms as metabolic byproducts in response to stress or for habitat adaptations gutierrez et al 2013 recent studies showed that not only microbes bacteria algae etc but invertebrates e g daphnia magna also release eps that are mainly comprised of high molecular weight polysaccharides and to a lesser extent also contained proteins nucleic acid and lipids delattre et al 2016 nasser and lynch 2016 for example daphnia magna secretes eps in the form of proteins in the freshwater environment which can adsorb on nps surface altering their size and identity and serve as signaling factors assisting them to interact efficiently with cellular recognition receptors nasser and lynch 2016 marine water bodies are dynamic usually rich in eps secreted by organisms therefore exhibiting higher chances of interaction between nps and eps corsi et al 2020 for instance a variety of eps are released by marine diatoms either in response to an environmental stimulus or as a mandatory step in their basal metabolism grassi et al 2020 the composition of marine eps is diverse comprising biomolecules of various sizes and molecular weight spanning from amino acids to protein peptides and polysaccharides that give rise to macromolecular entities and also contribute to the overall complexity of the marine ecosystem grassi et al 2020 due to high protein content marine eps usually facilitate aggregates formation and serve as the active storage sites with strong adaptive properties to uptake new materials therefore eps aggregates can stabilize the extracellular enzymes that result in the induction of protein repository through the digestion process hence enhancing the protein accumulation in the ecosystem flemming et al 2016 hazardous materials plastics dispersant and oil and environmental stresses nutrient limitation and variations in the light exposure can alter the protein to carbohydrate p c ratio of eps bacosa et al 2018 kamalanathan et al 2019 shiu et al 2020b this change in the p c ratio can alter the adsorptive properties quenching potential and physical hindrance of eps for hazardous particles therefore regulates their effective quantity reaching aquatic organisms nichols et al 2005 further the aggregation behavior stickiness and hydrophobicity can also regulate the key properties of eps affecting the interactions of aquatic organisms with plastic particles that ultimately play important role in the transport and fate of nps in the environment chiu et al 2019 santschi et al 2020 more information on the cellular biosynthesis fate and interactive properties of eps in the aquatic environment is provided in text s1 and s2 of the supplementary information among allochthonous nom humic acid ha fulvic acid fa and humin are the most common compounds that are degradation byproducts of organic materials gutierrez et al 2018 they are also originated as byproducts of bacterial metabolism and through different oxidation processes in the environment lynch et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ha and fa are mainly present in the aquatic environment while humin is mainly present in the terrestrial environment due to its insolubility in the aquatic phase ihss 2007 owing to the heterogeneous functional groups covalently linked phenolic rings ha can easily interact with nps through hydrophobic interactions in the aquatic environment szabó et al 2017 winkler and ghosh 2018 conversely fa is more water soluble due to deprotonation of its functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups higher oxygen content and low molecular weight schellekens et al 2017 in seawater nom is usually comprised of elevated concentrations of ha and fa excreted products metabolic waste and exuded polysaccharides proteins and lipids which lead to the formation of complex and geographically diverse polymeric mixtures gibson et al 2007 recently the interactions among nps and ecosystem components eco nano interface have gained increasing attention in the aquatic environment nom mainly eps inevitability interacts with both primary and secondary nps and compete for hydrophobic surfaces grassi et al 2020 the eps np interaction is driven by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors through various forces such as steric hindrance electrostatic and hydrophobic bonds which largely depend on the properties of nps e g size concentration and surface functionalization eps e g charge concentration and functional groups and medium e g ph salinity and ionic strength philippe and schaumann 2014 therefore these interactions can regulate the colloidal behavior of nps by provoking additional electrosteric stabilization or inducing destabilization by enhancing bridging mechanisms in aquatic environment further such interfaces not only influence the bioavailability and biological impacts of nps but also change their environmental fate distribution and transportation by modifying their sinking or floating behavior nasser et al 2020 importantly the impacts of bio nano interactions have been extensively studied for nanoparticles in terms of their internalization potential and ultimately changed toxicity potential both with in vivo and in vitro models kihara et al 2020 lin et al 2017 pulido reyes et al 2017 albeit studies on eco nano interface are elusive yet the interaction of nps with the totality of nom especially eps can lead to the development of diverse biomolecular coating on the surface of nps collectively known as eco corona lynch et al 2014 the suspension of nps with eps in the aquatic environment can result in tightly coated layers on the surface of nps or develop a composite network embedding individual np particles turning into aggregates grassi et al 2020 moreover the dispersion of nps in the aquatic environment confers some degree of polydispersity resulting in their complex interactions with eps the eps np interaction in natural water is a complex process and this cannot be simply viewed as the formation of aggregates or a uniform molecular layer on the particle surface the adsorption of eps on nps can portray a competing phenomenon in the aquatic environment where aggregates can be formed due to high salinity while the development of eco corona can disrupt this process wang et al 2021b although the studies highlighting eco corona formation on nps in the natural environment are in their infancy stage the impacts of eco corona in altering the properties and toxicity of nps have been highlighted in recent studies fadare et al 2020 grassi et al 2020 saavedra et al 2019 further the inclusion of the eco corona concept in nanotoxicity testing is highly encouraged to obtain ecologically rational results nasser et al 2020 interestingly recent studies on the ecological effects of nps mediated eco corona showed contrasting results e g the formation of eco corona increased the uptake of nps and enhanced their toxicity to daphnia magna nasser and lynch 2016 meanwhile the protective role of eco corona against nps toxicity to daphnia magna has been also reported saavedra et al 2019 similarly the eco corona formation increased the cell viability and reduced the oxidative stress and membrane permeability in marine algae chlorella sp natarajan et al 2020 these studies showed that our knowledge of the eco corona formation on nps and associated ecological impacts in the aquatic environment is still not comprehensive fadare et al 2020 therefore to gain a sufficiently broad knowledge and solve eco corona riddles huge datasets are required for many different combinations of nps and eps and their potential interactions hence this review collates the knowledge on the documented studies regarding the eco corona formation on nps and associated implications in the aquatic environment with the following objectives 1 presenting precise background information on the sources and occurrence of nps and eps and the basic difference between eco corona and bio corona formation 2 providing potential methods for characterization and quantification of eco corona and its composition 3 highlighting factors affecting the eco corona formation such as characteristics of nps properties of biomolecules and physicochemical characteristics of the aquatic environment 4 elucidating change in ecological implications of nps mediated by eco corona both toxic and non toxic and 5 summarizing the existing challenges and future research directions regarding eco corona formation on nps in the aquatic environment this systematic review was compiled in compliance with principles recommended in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma method moher et al 2010 more details on the implementation steps of the prisma method are shown in text s3 of the supplementary information 2 sources fate and implications of nanoplastics in the aquatic environment generally nps are defined as plastic particles with a size between 1 nm and 1000 nm gigault et al 2018 however some studies have suggested a maximum size of 100 nm besseling et al 2019 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to remove nps from the wastewater inevitably releasing them to aquatic resources kihara et al 2020 important sources and processes involved in the generation and formation of nps in the aquatic environment are presented in fig 1 similar to mps nps are also categorized into primary and secondary nps based on their sources primary nps are engineered plastic particles produced with nano sizes for specific applications such as paints electronics and cosmetics hadri et al 2020 among other known sources of primary nps include the careless release from products such as cleansing scrubs toothpaste pigments tyre and road wear and textiles kihara et al 2020 recently nps emission as a by product from 3d printers is gaining attention considering the elevated use of 3d printing alimi et al 2018 peng et al 2020 secondary nps originate from the unintentional natural and anthropogenic degradation and fragmentation of mps plastic litter and bulk plastics besseling et al 2014 wagner and reemtsma 2019 for example polystyrene ps plastics degraded down to nps inside a weathering chamber after 4 weeks of retention duration lambert and wagner 2016 the mechanical milling using plastics in agriculture is also reported to release nps beddoes et al 2015 compared to primary nps secondary nps are highly polydisperse and more heterogeneous exhibiting varying sizes shapes and surface charges hadri et al 2020 so far amaral zettler et al 2020 presented the best hypothetical model on processes involved in the degradation of plastics in aquatic bodies i e 1 physicochemical degradation that mainly comprised of photodegradation uv a and uv b lights thermal degradation visible light and thermal oxidation infrared radiation which depolymerize plastics into oligomers and monomers through bond scission and 2 biological degradation mainly consisted of the mechanical activity of microorganisms that colonize in crevices and cracks on plastics and several enzymes have been already discovered that can degrade specific non hydrolysable plastic polymers e g pe alkane dehydrogenase laccases and oxygenases ps hydroxyquinone peroxidases and hydrolysable plastic polymers e g pet hydrolase cutinases and pur esterases one of the main problems associated with the degradation process is that it not only decreases the size but also radically reduces the molecular weight of the polymers making them more bioavailable for aquatic organisms ferreira et al 2019 compared with mps nps are more elusive to biological defense barriers including cell membranes mucous layers and tissues yong et al 2020 several factors such as the surface charge particle size and elemental composition as well as the nature of chemical interactions assist nps in crossing biological barriers alarmingly the experimental studies highlighted that nps are capable to induce multifaceted impacts on all kinds of life ranging from microorganisms to marine mammals and even humans as reviewed by huang et al 2021 due to analytical limitations methods for measuring nps in the aquatic environment are still at the developing stage therefore controversies exist that claim whether np concentrations present in aquatic resources are sufficient to induce adverse effects however it is speculated that the concentration of nps in the aquatic environment could be 1014 times higher than those reported for mps owing to their release from various sources and fragmentation besseling et al 2019 so far a limited number of studies have measured nps in natural aquatic environment field samples for instance the polymer composition of nps was mainly comprised of pvc 73 18 pet 18 16 and ps 9 10 in water samples from the north atlantic gyre ter halle et al 2017 the surface snow samples from the austrian alps were contaminated with low levels of pet polymer of nps i e 5 4 27 4 ng ml 1 materić et al 2020 moreover pvc pe and ps polymers of nps were observed in water extracts of agriculture soil samples collected from central france wahl et al 2021 similarly water extracts of beach sand samples from the north atlantic gyre were contaminated with pvc and ps polymers of nps davranche et al 2020 the ecological impacts of nps are mainly associated with their intrinsic properties including size shape surface charge coating and functionalization gonzález fernández et al 2018 for marine organisms the adverse impacts of nps have been reported starting from the initial days of nps related research piccardo et al 2020 for freshwater organism a vast number of studies has been conducted recently on daphnia magna highlighting the impaired reproduction developmental abnormalities and transgenerational adverse effects fadare et al 2020 kelpsiene et al 2020 lin et al 2019 xu et al 2020 similarly studies on other model organisms such as bivalves and crustaceans also reported adverse impacts e g reduced fertilization and embryogenesis growth and developmental abnormalities and behavioral alterations lin et al 2019 rist et al 2019 tallec et al 2018 exposure to functionalized polystyrene nanoplastics psnps induced the deformed larval phenotypes in blue mussel ec 50 0 15 μg ml 1 for embryos and reduced fertilization and embryogenesis in pacific oysters ec50 4 9 μg ml 1 for gametes rist et al 2019 tallec et al 2018 nps mediated toxicity has been also extensively investigated in different fish species as recently highlighted in multiple reviews ferreira et al 2019 jacob et al 2020 triebskorn et al 2018 moreover nps are tended to bioaccumulate and transfer along the food chain and are reported to induce behavioral impacts at higher trophic levels mattsson et al 2017 sökmen et al 2020 however elucidating the biochemical and functional mechanisms of nps toxicity is challenging yet mainly due to the complex nature of np eps interactions and unknown biological targets especially at the interface level kihara et al 2020 bio corona and eco corona are exemplary cases of such complex interfacial interactions of nps respectively in biological and environmental systems as highlighted in the following section 3 eco corona vs bio corona formation the basic concept the term environmental or eco corona is defined as an environmentally acquired encapsulation of synthetic particles plastic or non plastic by biomolecules such as proteins carbohydrates etc baalousha et al 2018 grassi et al 2020 this paradigm has been recently translated from protein or bio corona which is the robust coating of nanomaterials nms with a layer of biomolecules upon entering into an in vivo biological environment cedervall et al 2007 after entering into the environment nms or nps may interact with biomolecules such as nom including eps resulting in the formation of eco corona fig 2a in the aquatic environment organic biomolecules compete with each other to attach the hydrophobic surface of nps zeng et al 2019 more specifically eco corona is developed on nps when eps are sourced from the exoproteome proteins released as a result of signaling and habitat adaptation or from the metabolic activities of aquatic organisms proteins carbohydrates dna etc nasser and lynch 2016 on the other hand bio corona is developed when nps interact and adsorb endogenous proteins through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions canesi et al 2017 lowry et al 2012 contrary to bio corona eco corona is an abiotic entity which reveals interactions between nps and a specific set of eps that may affect by the surrounding environmental factors and result in an exposure scenario dependent outcome importantly the eco corona formation can significantly change the bioavailability of nps thus impacting associated biological impacts the eco corona adsorbs macromolecules from the surrounding which may control interactions and exchange of nps with minerals organic materials and pollutants in aquatic bodies therefore the acquired eco corona may dictate the biological and chemical reactivity of nps natarajan et al 2020 recently the bio corona formation on the surface of nms has been extensively explored owing to a wide range of nm applications especially in biomedicine docter et al 2015a kuruvilla et al 2017 the bio corona exhibits a dynamic character that assists it to evolve continuously as protein adsorb and desorb on the surface of nms pino et al 2013 walkey and chan 2012 therefore being a dynamic entity bio corona develops two distinctive structures 1 hard corona which is appeared when the surface of nms is encapsulated by a layer of tightly adsorbed biomolecules lynch and dawson 2008 and 2 soft corona which is comprised of a layer of robustly exchanging and loosely attached biomolecules exhibiting a low degree of structural changes pulido reyes et al 2017 fig 2a in contrast hard corona undergoes a high degree of conformational changes slow exchange duration long retention time and strong binding affinity yang et al 2013 however occasionally they may resemble each other e g soft and hard coronae developed by human serum albumin hsa and lysozyme lys on psnps do have structural similarities kihara et al 2020 fig 2b more information on bio corona formation and its properties is provided in text s3 of the supplementary information a vast number of previous in vitro and in vivo studies highlighted the bio corona formation on non plastic nms and the associated change in biological impacts canesi et al 2017 docter et al 2015a docter et al 2015b pulido reyes et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 however a limited number of studies focused on the bio corona formation on plastic particles mps or nps and associated toxicological implications considering the abundance of plastic particles eco corona formation has become a critical parameter in predictive models to explain the potential fate distribution and interactions of nps in the aquatic environment kihara et al 2020 however studies are relatively scarce yet that highlighted eco corona formation factors affecting the eco corona formation and the associated change in toxic and non toxic impacts of nps in the aquatic environment moreover similar to that in bio corona formation proteins in the aquatic environment can compete with each other to interact with nps to form eco corona which may induce stabilizing or destabilizing effects on plastic particles and alter their fate and ecological impacts 4 eco corona formation on nanoplastics in the aquatic environment recently multiple studies highlighted the eco corona formation on nps under laboratory conditions mediated by organism secreted eps proteins carbohydrates etc or through artificially added nom ha fa and alginate in aquatic mediums however studies demonstrating this phenomenon in natural waters are elusive yet a summary of recent studies elucidating the eco corona formation on nps in the presence of freshwater and marine organisms is given in table 1 regarding freshwater scenarios fadare et al 2020 reported the formation of eco corona and bio corona on aminated polystyrene nanoplastics nh2 psnps 100 120 nm exposed to daphnia magna at an exposure concentration of 100 mg l 1 and incubation of 24 h in the presence of ha and fa proteomic analysis of both coronae identified 1004 proteins in total 281 unique proteins associated with eco corona in the medium and 723 with bio corona in homogenates of daphnia magna the significant proteins included in the profile of eco corona were the actin alpha skeletal muscle protein the 70 kda heat shock protein hsp70 the 14 3 3 protein epsilon zeta delta alpha enolase vitellogenin 1 didomain hemoglobin etc fadare et al 2020 in another study fadare et al 2019 reported the eco corona development on nh2 psnps 100 120 nm exposed to daphnia magna at an exposure concentration of 400 mg l 1 and incubation for 0 96 h in the presence of ha ha nps mixture showed a distinct pattern of excitation emission matrix eem and a high fluorescent intensity compared to single ha solution and nps suspension strongly suggesting eco corona formation nasser and lynch 2016 also highlighted the eco corona formation in the presence of daphnia magna albeit without the addition of any nom in this study organisms were exposed to carboxylated polystyrene nanoplastics cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 90 110 nm by using a concentration of 10 mg l 1 at various incubation periods 1 6 h the significant components of eco corona were comprised of secreted qsec sensor protein 50 4 kda and type vi secretion system 74 8 kda which play important roles in cell to cell signalling and stress responses respectively similarly wu et al 2019 also used daphnia magna to decipher the formation of the biogenic aggregates on pristine psnps and functional cooh psnps negatively charged n nh2 psnps and positively charged p nh2 psnps of various sizes 50 300 nm in the presence of ha interestingly robust aggregates with diameter as high as 4516 nm were observed among ha and p nh2 psnps 100 nm albeit no significant p 0 05 aggregates formation was observed for remaining nps due to similar charges along with daphnia magna saavedra et al 2019 employed brachionus calyciflorus and thamnocephalus platyurus to decipher eco corona formation on cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 200 nm in the presence of alginate and ha and the formed eco corona modified the surface charge on nh2 psnps altogether these studies showed that pristine or functional nps robustly interact with naturally released eps or artificially added nom through eco corona formation and most of the studies from freshwater settings reported the manual addition of nom to facilitate eco corona formation in the presence of aquatic organisms moreover daphnia magna was frequently used as a model organism to investigate eco corona formation because it releases a significant amount of eps comprised of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acid and lipids in freshwater delattre et al 2016 nasser and lynch 2016 relatively more studies are available that highlighted eco corona formation on nps in the presence of marine organisms table 1 for instance fungi trichoderma reecsei released large quantities of hydrophobins highly adhesive proteins that strongly bind on the surface of psnps of various sizes and functional groups compared to pristine nps grunér et al 2016 a recent study employed marine alga chlorella sp highlighting eco corona formation on pristine and functional psnps of size 300 nm natarajan et al 2020 to facilitate eco corona formation plain psnps cooh psnps and nh2 psnps were aged for 12 24 and 48 h in the eps containing medium this study highlighted that the negatively charged nh2 psnps exhibited a higher binding affinity for eps components compared to that of positively charged ones grassi et al 2020 employed marine diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum to elucidate the eps mediated eco corona formation on cooh psnps 60 nm the presence of eps induced the formation of protein and carbohydrate complexes of size ranged between 30 100 kda on the surface of nps and reduced the self aggregation of plastic particles in eps containing natural seawater compared with that of eps free natural seawater chen et al 2011 reported potential hydrophobic interactions between ps nps 23 nm and eps released by three marine phytoplankton species phaeodactylum tricornutum ankistrodesmus angustus and amphora sp the formation of eps psnp aggregates in terms of microscopic gel 4 6 µm was observed after 72 h of exposure to nps at 10 and 100 ppb summers et al 2018 conducted a study based on simulated sea surface conditions that revealed interactions between nps 50 100 500 nm and eps produced by halomonas sp the extracted eps was observed to formulate aggregates with psnps after incubation for 24 h at a concentration of 5 mg l 1 and aggregates were largely composed of glycoprotein biopolymer shiu et al 2020a recently reported the secretion of protein rich eps from marine phytoplanktons and aggregates formation after exposure to nps briefly thalassiosira pseudonana skeletonema grethae phaeodactylum tricornutum and dunaliella tertiolecta were exposed to psnps 55 1000 nm with concentrations ranged between 10 4 to 250 mg l 1 exposure to the higher concentrations of relatively small sized nps induced the release of eps with elevated p c ratios and promoted aggregates formation compared to low concentrations and large sized nps contrary to freshwater studies on marine settings employed various types of organisms diatoms algae oysters to highlight eco corona mediated interaction of nps with eps moreover no artificial enrichment of media using nom was reported which could be attributed to the fact that marine organisms release large quantities of eps therefore implicating higher chances of interaction between nps and eps grassi et al 2020 besides in vivo studies in vitro studies have also highlighted eco corona formation between nps and biomolecules for instance a recent study exposed oocytes and spermatozoa from oyster crassostrea gigas to various concentrations 0 1 100 mg l 1 of cooh psnps and nh2 psnps for different exposure durations 1 3 and 5 h and significantly increased cell size and complexity mediated by eco corona formation were observed between plastic particles and oyster gametes gonzález fernández et al 2018 similarly the hemocytes extracted from bivalve mytilus galloprovincialis reported forming eco corona and bio corona on nh2 psnps 50 nm at 25 mg l 1 in artificial seawater asw and bivalve haemolymph after incubation for 24 h respectively the abundance 75 76 sequence coverage of putative c1q protein containing mgc1q6 domain was observed as hard bio corona in the haemolymph and as small eco corona clusters or chains of in asw canesi et al 2016 besides eco corona formation by secreted eps or added nom artificially supplemented proteins have been also investigated to interact with nps through eco corona development for instance li et al 2021a recently reported the formation of eco corona on bare psnps cooh psnps and nh2 psnps of various sizes 40 90 nm at 10 mg l 1 mediated by bovine serum albumin bsa one of the most abundant proteins in surface water the formed eco exhibited a stabilization effect on negatively charged bare psnps and cooh psnps while inhibited the aggregation of positively charged nh2 psnps this study further demonstrated the eco corona mediated stabilization of all three psnps in the lake river and seawater samples n 9 due to the sufficient amount of dom in the river 4 42 mg c l 1 and lake 14 6 mg c l 1 the three psnps observed stable via steric repulsion and eco corona formation however in the seawater only bare psnps and cooh psnps developed aggregates while no aggregates were observed for nh2 psnps due to the presence of a high concentration of so4 2 and cl in seawater contrary to the experimental results li et al 2021a similarly shiu et al 2020b highlighted the interaction of psnps 25 nm 10 µg l 1 with dom biopolymers in river and lake water samples after incubation for 10 d the dom np aggregates appeared in the form of microgels approximately 4 6 μm in size reaching equilibrium within 90 120 h and exhibited a similar assembly curve in water samples from both sources another study investigated the eco corona formation on psnps 200 500 and 1000 nm mediated by bsa and lys proteins in the marine aquatic environment peng et al 2020 bsa adsorbed on small sized psnps 200 and 500 nm to formulate eco corona through colloidal steric hindrance which ultimately decreased the aggregate size of nps for instance the aggregates of middle sized nps 500 nm reduced in diameter from 1740 nm to 765 nm after 40 min of incubation with bsa conversely the lys failed to form eco corona on the surface of larger nps 500 and 1000 nm attributed to the significantly low adsorption of protein molecules nevertheless the lys developed eco corona on smaller nps 200 nm via bridging effect and electrostatic adsorption dong et al 2020 in summary nearly all the available studies used pristine psnps or functional cooh psnps and nh2 psnps to investigate eco corona development so far nps with varying sizes 23 nm to 1000 nm and exposure concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 were subjected to incubation at different periods 1 h to 10 d with freshwater or marine organisms for the development of eco corona or biogenic aggregates the formed eco corona varies in size and composition depends on the types of nom initially used or eps secreted by aquatic organisms the composition of eco corona in reviewed studies revealed the presence of various organic components such as dna carbohydrates functional proteins long chain organic acids polysaccharide rich compounds and glycoprotein biopolymer ranging from size 20 kda to 100 kda contrary to experimental conditions the natural waters exhibit complicated composition of nom eps ions and inorganic colloids which can play a significant role in eco corona formation li et al 2021a therefore studies should be conducted to understand the eco corona formation on nps and their physicochemical properties and molecular composition in realistic environmental conditions once eco corona is formed it can significantly modify the identity of nps and influence their interactions with biotic and abiotic entities in the aquatic environment nasser and lynch 2016 therefore it is critically important to devise methods for characterizing various elements of eco corona and its properties such as size morphology type of attached proteins distinguish between soft and hard eco corona and structure of participating biomolecules which can assist further to understand fate and bioreactivity of nps in the aquatic environment 5 potential methods for eco corona measurement in the aquatic environment potential techniques for the identification and quantification of eco corona formation on nps and their composition in the aquatic environment are presented in fig 3 several factors are involved in eco corona formation on nps in the aquatic environment section 6 the impact of size composition biological and physicochemical properties of eco corona is largely unknown yet natarajan et al 2020 however it is well defined that biogenic aggregates in the aquatic environment exhibit unique characteristics and behave differently from the rest of the ecosystem components they are dynamic having large interfacial energies thus can develop a robust eco nano interface through particle particle interactions which are stronger than the thermal energy of the medium santschi 2018 thus various scenario dependent potential techniques should be devised to measure eco corona and its properties which will ultimately help to understand the eco nano interface fate and transportation of nps in the environment there are three main potential approaches to quantify eco corona formation on nps and their components including 1 measurement of eco corona through isolation from nps 2 indirect quantification by size measurements and 3 direct quantification of bounded proteins 5 1 measurement of eco corona through isolation for quantification of bio eco corona one of the critical parameters in characterizing the average number of biomolecules proteins n attached on nps surface under certain environmental experimental conditions pino et al 2013 setting aside other controlling factors assuming that corona is formed on the surface of all the nps there will be two mandatory parameters for the holistic characterization of the corona i e the concentration of proteins attached on the surface of nps c np p and the concentration of nps in the medium environmental matrix c 0 np then the following eq 1 will define the average number of proteins n 1 n c np p c 0 np the detection of eco corona through this approach mainly required two steps 1 characterization and quantification of nps and 2 measurement and compositional profiling of formed corona before quantification of nps in environmental samples there are two challenging steps pre concentration and separation of nps in the aquatic environment matrix digestion is not necessary for clean freshwater or marine water samples oßmann et al 2018 ter halle et al 2017 secondly the eco corona is comprised of the attached nom hence the digestion will cause the loss of proteins albeit the enzymatic digestion can be applied for the measurement of eco corona as mentioned in section 5 3 preconcentration of nps usually carried out through methods such as ultracentrifugation ultrafiltration cloud point extraction cpe and continuous flow centrifugation cfc and their separation is commonly attained through membrane filtration field flow fractionation fff and size exclusion chromatography sec cai et al 2021 regarding quantification of nps pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms thermal desorption coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry tds gc ms and raman spectroscopy are the most popular analytical methods for the detection of environmental nps schwaferts et al 2020 ter halle et al 2017 the elemental detection techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms is also recently applied to detect metal containing nanoparticles without digestion jiménez lamana et al 2020 various other correlation based techniques such as are also photothermal absorption correlation spectroscopy phacs and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs are also adopted for precise measurement of nps directly in the solution however these techniques can only be applied on colloidally stable nps due to their sensitivity towards agglomeration octeau et al 2009 zemanová et al 2003 further the dispersion of nps also plays a critical role in shaping the attached corona for instance most nps showed aggregates formation especially under high salinity conditions pellegrino et al 2005 wu et al 2019 and the development of eco corona on agglomerated nps will be different than that on highly dispersed nps therefore a complete characterization of nps including their colloidal behavior should be an integral part of studies deciphering eco corona formation on nps among various nps characterization techniques the most commonly used microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are included dynamic light scattering dls canesi et al 2016 chen et al 2011 grassi et al 2020 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir fadare et al 2019 wu et al 2019 transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm fadare et al 2019 natarajan et al 2020 shim et al 2017 wu et al 2019 tem is usually used when the hydrodynamic diameter dh of nps is relatively much higher than that of geometric diameter dc implying less dispersion and more agglomeration of nps rivera gil et al 2013 in this case the absorption spectra are helpful and extinction at a longer wavelength i e 1000 nm is mostly attributed to scattering of np aggregates rather than absorption hühn et al 2013 employing sem is advantageous as it provides very clear and high resolution images of plastic particles assisting in discerning plastics from organic matter cooper and corcoran 2010 coupling with eds sem provides the elemental composition of plastic particles facilitating the discrimination of carbon dominant plastics from inorganic particles shim et al 2017 however it can only be used for the characterization of specific nps as the colored particles cannot be identified using sem shim et al 2017 sem eds also exhibits certain limitations e g its challenging to distinguish between eds spectra from plastic polymers and adsorbed debris on the plastics dehghani et al 2017 afm can also provide clear images at high resolutions up to nanometers and can be operated in both contact and noncontact mode with objects shim et al 2017 recently raman spectroscopy has been also opted to characterize nps with size 100 nm fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 albeit it also exhibits certain limitations such as polymer degradation and fluorescence that can be a significant source of interference thus applicable to non fluorescent and stable nps lenz et al 2015 when compared to ftir raman provides a higher resolution wider spectral coverage and lower water interference ribeiro claro et al 2017 generally after pretreatment pre concentration separation microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are usually integrated for holistic quantification of nps e g ftir dls py gc ms and tds gc ms were used in combination for measurement of fingerprints and topology of nps in the north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 further a combination of sem ft ir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used for the successful quantification of polyethylene nanoplastics penps with sizes ranging from 24 6 to 52 14 nm hernandez et al 2017 similarly online coupling of fff with raman was used to quantify nps with the lowest size of 200 nm and low raman scattering limitation was dealt with using 2d optical tweezers for trapping particles schwaferts et al 2020 combining with raman or ft ir afm can be employed to detect the elemental composition of nps and it can acquire images and ir absorption spectra with spatial resolutions of 50 100 nm shim et al 2017 for the ex situ approach separation of unbounded proteins from bounded proteins and nps is also mandatory and the concentration of unbound proteins c p in the supernatant is used for indirect ex situ measurement of c np p through the following eq 2 2 c np p c 0 p c p some studies have employed the combination of centrifugation sds page and mass spectroscopy for isolation and compositional profiling of eco corona canesi et al 2016 chen et al 2011 grassi et al 2020 further eco corona proteins characterization through sec proteomics flow cytometry and protein quantification kits have been also reported chen et al 2011 fadare et al 2020 gonzález fernández et al 2018 summers et al 2018 however this ex situ quantification of eco corona proteins needs a separation step that can be challenging for instance the larger nps may undergo precipitation after centrifugation and the bounded proteins will also precipitate while unbounded proteins will remain in the supernatant pitek et al 2012 schäffler et al 2013 after the collection of unbounded proteins the bounded proteins will be detached from the nps surface and released into the solution due to the potential shift in the equilibrium of eqs 1 and 2 then only a weakly attached fraction of the original corona and persistently bounded fraction on nps will be lost this is the basic criteria to differentiate between soft and hard corona moreover the centrifugation based separation of unbounded proteins in the presence of small nps 10 nm could be complex and time consuming and may need ultracentrifugation owing to the small masses of nps jedlovszky hajdú et al 2012 another challenge for indirect measurement of attached protein fraction is to analyze the difference between the soft and hard corona and elucidated their competitive binding on the surface of nps milani et al 2012 5 2 indirect quantification by size measurements the indirect quantification of adsorbed corona on nps has been also reported through in situ size measurements in terms of hydrodynamic radii using various techniques including dls phase analysis light scattering pals fluorescence microscopy etc fadare et al 2019 saavedra et al 2019 wu et al 2019 for these techniques the separation of nps from the medium containing both bounded and unbounded proteins is not a prerequisite in this case the rule of thumb is more proteins are encapsulated per np the larger will be the value of dh however such measurements are only possible when nps are colloidally stable and exhibit a narrow size distribution in this way measurements represent the real equilibrium scenario and are carried out without facing the challenge of separating unbounded proteins which showed the huge conceptual advantage of using this method pino et al 2013 while using dls for indirect size measurement the differentiation between the light scattered from nps and free proteins is necessary therefore for such dls measurements the size of nps should be significantly larger than that of protein then dls will assist for appropriate analysis of in situ development of protein corona enabling convenient dh measurements of np protein complexes however if nps and proteins exhibit the same size the light scattering from them can no longer be separated from the one from the unbounded proteins hühn et al 2013 in such circumstances fluorescence microscopy offers a good alternative to dls albeit requires fluorescent labeled nps that do not interfere with corona formation zhang et al 2011 further only fluorescent corona np protein aggregates can be measured by fluorescence microscopy and autofluorescence signals from unattached proteins should be neglected the measurement of corona formation through size quantification using these techniques dls and fluorescence microscopy is mainly feasible for smaller nps once the protein eco corona is developed the dh of nps will increase through following the linear conformation of the biomolecules pino et al 2013 5 3 direct quantification of bounded proteins considering the loss of original protein corona through centrifugation and washing steps demonstrated in eq 1 and 2 the direct measurement of eco corona bounded on nps is more feasible in this way both the amount as well as the composition of attached proteins biomolecules on nps surface can be determined a classical approach is an enzymatic digestion of the attached proteins and then their quantification through mass spectrometry or gel electrophoresis jedlovszky hajdú et al 2012 lesniak et al 2012 mahmoudi et al 2013 tenzer et al 2011 in this way the bounded proteins are separated based on their molecular weight which is subsequently coupled with protein databased for the identification of protein species generally for small sized nps 10 nm less than nmax 100 proteins are attached that are evenly distributed however hundreds of proteins have been reported to be attached further to protein corona encapsulated nps and it is predetermined that protein corona formed on each nps will not be the same tenzer et al 2011 importantly there are 100 existing protein species distributed in the realistic biological environmental medium which may bound to 100 protein binding sites per np therefore the protein eco corona formulated on individual nps can be significantly different notedly this approach has been applied for protein identification and quantification in studies on the bio corona formation and yet to be validated in studies on eco corona formation pino et al 2013 in summary the existing studies mostly employed the first approach i e the measurement of eco corona and its composition through centrifugation based isolation and then applying spectrometric and electrophoresis techniques to further quantify the molecular components table 1 for eco corona differentiating between soft and hard eco corona will be another challenge and warranted further investigations importantly most of these studies were conducted under laboratory conditions and characterized nps before using them for eco corona therefore all of these studies lacking the quantification of nps under realistic conditions or in the natural aquatic environment which is yet another challenge required extensive research 6 factors affecting eco corona formation on nanoplastics studies are still elusive that highlighted specific influencing factors involved in eco corona formation on nps in the aquatic environment shiu et al 2020a generally three main elements can describe the interaction between nps and biomolecules in the aquatic environment 1 the size aging and surface properties of nps 2 the physicochemical characteristics of the aquatic environment and 3 the levels composition and functional properties of biomolecules fig 4 table 1 2 6 1 size aging and surface characteristics of nanoplastics particle size can influence the surface reactivity surface energy surface charge and electronic structure of nps which can alter the nature of interactive forces among nps and approaching biological surfaces zhang 2014 for instance owing to the high surface energy smaller nps tend to aggregate more under given circumstances compared to larger particles he et al 2008 for instance the small sized psnps 200 nm tend to formulate eco corona with bsa and lys respectively through colloidal steric hindrance and electrostatic adsorption however the large sized psnps 500 and 1000 nm failed to formulate eco corona with lys due to lack of adsorption dong et al 2020 summers et al 2018 also observed that the smallest nps 50 nm promoted the development of larger eps np aggregates as compared to larger nps 100 and 500 nm nps are surface coated or functionalized to enhance their stability through generating steric electrostatic and hydrophilic repulsion forces among plastic particles for instance the positively charged nh2 psnps showed destabilization in the presence of negatively charged ha due to charge neutralization compared to neutral psnps and negatively charged cooh psnps chen et al 2011 similarly due to the negative surface charge nh2 psnps formed rapid and larger aggregates with positively charged alginate and ha compared to positively charged cooh nps saavedra et al 2019 conversely due to alike charges the addition of negatively charged ha induced a negligible effect on the aggregation of negatively charged psnps n nh2 psnps and cooh psnps and consequently they appeared more stable however positively charged p nh2 psnps rapidly formulate aggregates with negatively charged ha implying that ha may first neutralize the surface charge of nps and then adsorbed onto them wu et al 2019 coupled with the surface charge the aging of nps also plays a significantly important role in eco corona formation on the surface of nps for instance the negatively charged nh2 psnps exhibited a higher binding affinity for eps components than positively charged cooh psnps when they were subjected to aging for 12 24 and 48 h in the eps containing medium natarajan et al 2020 and the formation of eco corona enhanced with the increase in aging duration e g the mean dh of cooh psnps was significantly increased p 0 001 from 282 37 to 512 6 nm as the aging duration increased from 12 to 48 h natarajan et al 2020 similarly a longer incubation period 4 and 6 h increased the agglomeration propensity of nps with secreted proteins when compared to a short incubation period 1 h attributed to proteins rearrangements during the longer incubation span nasser and lynch 2016 similarly the biogenic aggregates between eps from halomonas sp and psnps attained the size 0 5 1 mm of marine snow 0 5 mm after 72 h of incubation while these agglomerates were barely visible to the naked eye during the initial incubation for 24 h summers et al 2018 besides size aging and surface characteristics the shape aggregation dispersion behavior as well as surface properties of nps such as polymer type composition surface charge and functional groups can influence the interaction of nps with biomolecules canesi et al 2017 verma and stellacci 2010 yeh et al 2012 in summary these available studies showed that smaller size opposite charges and longer incubation period are more preferable conditions or characteristics for nps to formulate eco corona or biogenic aggregates with eps and other fractions of nom 6 2 concentration and properties of biomolecules the concentration composition and properties of biomolecules control the aggregation of nps by forming an adsorption layer on the plastics in the aquatic environment li et al 2021b the concentration of nom showed a direct relationship with np aggregates formation and also exhibited a dispersive effect on plastic particles in the aquatic environment summers et al 2018 for instance an increase in the concentration of bsa 1 10 mg c l 1 enhanced the eco corona associated stabilization of negatively charged bare psnps and cooh psnps while exhibited a destabilizing effect on negatively charged nh2 psnps li et al 2021a similarly the addition of 1 mg l 1 of ha and alginate induced eco corona formation on nh2 nps with z average diameter of 670 6 nm and 924 0 nm respectively saavedra et al 2019 however the higher concentration of ha 2 mg l 1 has a stabilizing effect due to eco corona formation with limited aggregation revealed by a decrease in the zeta potential saavedra et al 2019 a similar study revealed the rapid aggregation of positively charged p nh2 psnps 100 nm in the presence of ha and the largest aggregates were observed at 10 mg l 1 ha reaching dh of 4516 01 nm while a further increase in ha concentration exhibited stabilizing effect nps and their aggregation decreased dh 192 04 nm through steric stabilization and electrostatic repulsion wu et al 2019 in contrast the various concentration of ha 1 50 mg l 1 failed to induce any considerable changes to zeta potential or particle size of nh2 psnps after incubation for 0 96 h except a slight decrease of zeta potentials of nps after 96 h implying that the ha formulated eco corona on nps without causing precipitation or agglomeration shiu et al 2020a the composition of eps can also impact eco corona formation on nps in various ways one of the important parameters is the p c ratio of eps which depends on factors such as the size of nps and sensitivity of the exposed species shiu et al 2020a for instance eps with a relatively low fraction of protein hydrophobic such as from amphora sp required a higher concentration of nps 100 ppb to initiate the development of eps np aggregates however for protein rich eps partially hydrophobic from ankistrodesmus angustus and phaeodactylum tricornutum formulated significantly larger aggregates 4 5 mm at low concentration of nps 10 ppb chen et al 2011 the type of biomolecules distinguished by charge can also play a significant role in the formation of eco corona on nps for instance the negatively charged bsa can easily formulate eco corona on psnps using colloidal steric hindrance while the positively charged lys failed to do so owing to the low adsorption of protein molecules in seawater dong et al 2020 similarly ha decreased the protein binding on nh2 psnps whereas fa had the opposite effect on eco corona formation in daphnia magna containing medium saavedra et al 2019 in conclusion studies presented here showed that the lower concentration higher protein content and opposite charge on eps or nom can increase their interactions with nps to form eco corona however discrepancies also exist in the available studies therefore further research is warranted to elucidate the concrete role of eps properties and concentration in the formation of eco corona with nps in the aquatic environment 6 3 properties of the medium aquatic environment in the natural aquatic environment the properties of the water body can substantially modify the characteristics of nps grassi et al 2020 for instance ph salinity conditioning and ionic strength of the medium not only affect the interaction between nps and biomolecules but also plays important role in shaping the properties of nps such as effective charge aggregation state hydrodynamic size surface valences and dispersion in the aquatic environment gonzález fernández et al 2018 the concentration of electrolytes in the aquatic environment can influence the aggregation behavior of nps by altering their surface charges wang et al 2021b for example at 0 01 mm level of fecl3 100 nm nps showed a stable behavior while their size was increased to 350 nm as the concentration of fecl3 increased to 0 1 and 1 mm cai et al 2018 another key factor that controls the aggregation of plastic particles in the aquatic environment is the valency of ions for instance the critical coagulation concentration ccc of psnps in nacl solution monovalent was 32 fold and 80 fold higher than those in mgcl2 and cacl2 solution divalent respectively shams et al 2020 changes in the composition and physicochemical parameters of the medium can also impact the concentration of secreted proteins eps as well as their interactions with nps for instance the pre conditioning of medium with daphnia magna and chollera vulgaris increased the concentration of secreted proteins that ultimately enhanced the polydispersity index pdi and particle size of nh2 psnps through the formation of larger aggregates nasser and lynch 2016 the stability of nps and their interaction with biomolecules in the aquatic environment can be affected greatly by a change in salinity for instance the increase in salinity addition of nacl and cacl2 enhanced eco corona formation between bsa and negatively charged bare psnps cooh psnps while reduced the formation of the aggregates for positively charged nh2 psnps li et al 2021a however the aggregation of nh2 psnps with bsa was observed in the presence of na2so4 mediated by charge neutralization and patch charge attraction in which so4 2 played a critical role in attaching particles li et al 2021a further the dh of pristine psnps and cooh psnps was decreased while increased for n nh2 psnps and p nh2 psnps in a 10 nacl solution with the increasing ha concentration wu et al 2019 the increasing salinity can reduce the stabilizing effect of ha on nps hence despite the presence of nom nps can form robust and large aggregates in areas of higher salinity wu et al 2019 in the seawater with 35 practical salinity units psu the lys successfully adsorbed on small nps 200 nm to establish eco corona and increase their colloidal size from 485 nm to 2237 nm while failed to formulate eco corona with large nps 500 and 1000 nm dong et al 2020 however the eco corona was also observed among the large nps 500 nm and lys in the diluted seawater 3 5 psu attributed to the strong electrostatic attraction dong et al 2020 shiu et al 2020b also reported that salinity could sever as a critical factor to influence the size and number of np dom microgels e g at 17 psu the highest particle count with an increase of over 215 of dom in microgels was found in the lake and river water samples while the salinity of 34 psu resulted in only a 154 increase implying that nps and dom may interact to form large organic entities and settle down at a specific salinity and change the fate of nps in aquatic bodies the ph of the medium can impact surface charges and ionization of functional groups of plastic particles which ultimately can control the aggregation behavior of nps through electrostatic forces li et al 2018 in general the ph of a typical natural aquatic environment remains between 5 and 9 chowdhury et al 2013 an increase in the stability of psnps 100 nm and cooh psnps 303 nm was reported with an increase in ph value in nacl solution romero cano et al 2001 conversely the particle size of penps remains constant from 284 92 140 56 nm to 310 29 165 58 nm in 10 mm nacl solution at ph 5 9 attributed to the strong electrostatic repulsion forces among particles shams et al 2020 this contrasting results from different studies may be due to the difference in particle size surface chemistry and heterogeneity of the investigated nps praetorius et al 2020 here reviewed studies showed that the higher electrolyte concentration lower ionic valency and conditioning of the medium enhanced the interaction of nps with eps albeit the role of ph and salinity levels on eco corona formation not showed an obvious trend hence further studies are recommended to clarify the importance of medium properties in eps led eco corona development on nps 7 ecological implications of eco corona formation in the aquatic environment recent studies showed that eps or biomolecules encapsulate nps in the aquatic environment and modify their physicochemical properties bioreactivity and transportation through eco corona formation alimi et al 2018 galloway 2015 pulido reyes et al 2017 therefore eco corona can influence the environmental fate and bioavailability of nps and ultimately change their ecological impacts toxic and non toxic in the aquatic environment fadare et al 2020 nasser et al 2020 natarajan et al 2020 a summary of recent studies highlighting the change in toxic and non toxic implications of nps mediated by eco corona formation is presented in table 2 7 1 change in toxic impacts of nanoplastics regarding freshwater organisms several studies have been conducted on various species mainly on daphnia magna for instance the presence of nom significantly reduced the acute toxicity of nh2 psnps to daphnia magna exposed at varying treatment doses 1 400 mg l 1 and exposure duration 0 96 h due to eco corona formation although the percentage of surviving organisms was significantly increased the endocrine related genes cat gst p gp vtg and hsp70 exhibited significantly elevated expressions fadare et al 2020 in another study the presence of ha eco corona formation increases the survival rate of daphnia magna by 70 100 based on the various concentration of ha 1 50 mg l 1 and nh2 psnps 1 400 mg l 1 moreover the eco corona formation on nps induced no significant changes to the expression levels of cat gst hsp70 and p gp compared with pristine nps therefore diminishing their hazardous impacts fadare et al 2019 similarly the acute toxicity 0 96 h of bare psnps and p nh2 psnps 50 300 nm was significantly reduced in terms of the increased survival rate of daphnia magna in the presence of ha attributed to the eco corona formation and stabilizing effect of ha on negatively charged nps wu et al 2019 further saavedra et al 2019 unveiled that the eco corona formation decreased the toxicity of cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 200 nm to daphnia magna brachionus calyciflorus and thamnocephalus platyurus after exposure at various concentrations 10 400 mg l 1 for 24 96 h much higher ec50 values of nps were observed for all the three test organisms in the presence of nom highlighted the protective role of eco corona formation against nps toxicity saavedra et al 2019 conversely a recent study on daphnia magna highlighted the eco corona associated increase in the uptake and toxicity of cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 90 110 nm at relatively lower exposure concentration 0 0001 1 mg ml 1 after 24 h exposure due to eco corona formation the inefficient removal of nps from the gut of organisms and associated decrease in algal feeding rate was observed in neonates after 6 h of exposure nasser and lynch 2016 the contrasting results from these two studies on daphnia magna using the same np polymers cooh psnps and nh2 psnps could be attributed to the sources of eco corona i e proteins from manually added alginate isolated from macrocyctis pyrifera and ha isolated from the suwannee river versus proteins secreted by daphnia magna and chollera vulgaris secondly both studies used different exposure concentrations of nps and respectively elucidated acute and chronic toxicity endpoints nasser and lynch 2016 saavedra et al 2019 relatively fewer studies are available that reported the eco corona mediated change in toxic impacts of nps in marine organisms for instance a recent study reported the eps mediated eco corona significantly enhanced the cell viability and reduced the oxidative stress and membrane permeability in marine algae chlorella sp exposed to psnps natarajan et al 2020 similarly the presence of eps decreased ros generation in marine diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum exposed to a relatively high concentration 100 mg l 1 of cooh psnps 60 nm implying that eps exhibit ros scavenging properties grassi et al 2020 hence the decrease in oxidative stress and associated toxicity due to eco corona formation is generally attributed to the ros quenching potential of eps and the composition and properties of eps may change based on the sensitivity of the secreting aquatic organisms that consequently will alter their ros quenching abilities further the eco corona formation also decreases the effective surface area of nps that may play a critical role in decreasing the potential toxic impacts natarajan et al 2020 in contrast a recent in vitro study on oocytes and spermatozoa from oyster crassostrea gigas reported significantly increased ros levels in sperm cells after exposure to a high exposure concentration 100 mg l 1 of cooh psnps attributed to the attached carboxylic function group gonzález fernández et al 2018 similarly shiu et al 2020a concluded that higher concentrations 250 mg l 1 of nps 55 nm inhibited the growth of phytoplankton species and enhancing p c ratios of eps implying nps mediated higher cellular stress on phytoplanktons and secretion of protein rich eps for instance nh2 psnps mediated bio corona in haemolymph serum increased ros production cellular damage and dysregulation of p38 and mapk signaling in haemocytes of bivalve mytilus galloprovincialis while significantly less toxic impacts of nps mediate by eco corona formation were appeared in asw canesi et al 2016 in conclusion a significant fraction of reviewed studies reported a reduction in toxic impacts of nps after eco corona formation mainly attributed to the significantly decreased ros generation due to sequestration of free radicals by adsorbed biomolecules on nps however some studies have reported contrasting results i e the eco corona formation exacerbated the toxicity of nps to the aquatic organism in terms of growth inhibition increased cellular stress shiu et al 2020a lower ec50 values longer gut retention of particles altered feeding behavior nasser and lynch 2016 as well as significantly elevated expressions endocrine related genes cat gst p gp vtg and hsp70 fadare et al 2020 contrary to bio corona that mostly decreased toxicity to organisms through a reduction in surface energy of nps the eco corona may take a different course as the adsorbed eps on nps may regulate their bioreactivity and fate thereby changing the uptake retention and bioavailability to aquatic organisms which may cause an increase in toxicity therefore further in vivo and in vitro studies should be conducted to draw a concrete conclusion on the role of eco corona formation on the toxicity of nps in the aquatic environment 7 2 change in transportation and fate of nanoplastics the formation of eco corona can increase or decrease the transportation of nps in the aquatic environment for instance the bsa formed eco corona on small sized nps 200 and 500 nm through colloidal steric hindrance and decreased the aggregate size which ultimately caused an increase in the transportation of nps conversely the lys interacted with nps 200 nm via bridging effect and electrostatic adsorption resulted in the formation of large aggregates that reduce the transport of nps in the marine aquatic environment dong et al 2020 further nps interact with eps forming microscopic gels 4 6 µm that induced a significant acceleration in amphora sp while nps alone in the absence of eps caused a moderate acceleration in ankistrodesmus angustus and phaeodactylum tricornutum after 10 days of incubation implying that np eps complex formation enhanced the transportation of not only itself but also that of associated aquatic species chen et al 2011 importantly eps have been reported as the key source of nom in the marine environment and np mediated changes in eps assembly can lead to deleterious environmental impacts altering different organic carbon pools re directing the carbon flux and potentially disturbing the carbon cycle in the ocean moreover biogenic aggregates play almost similar role to that of the colloidal pump and biological pump in the vertical transportation of nps from the surface to the deep floor in the water column in the aquatic environment chen et al 2011 shiu et al 2020a demonstrated that eps acts as a tackiness agent and enhances adsorption and aggregation of plastic particles which ultimately make them sink deeper and change their fate in the marine aquatic environment summers et al 2018 also speculated that the formation of eps np agglomerates may change their sinking velocity and buoyant density in the aquatic environment based on the composition of eps and nps size in the biogenic aggregates compared to the native microgels the formation of dom psnp microgels significantly increased the particle counts from 1404 to 2035 and from 8063 to 14 128 respectively in river and lake water samples shiu et al 2020b therefore psnps interact with original unassembled polymers in the aquatic environment assisting the microgels formation further inducing the dom pom transition importantly the micro sized gel structures containing nps organic matter and other pollutants overlap with the preferred food sources for organisms at the bottom of the food chain cole et al 2013 consequently the np microgels may undergo bioaccumulation along the food chain in an organism at a higher trophic level such as invertebrates filter feeding fishes and even humans cole et al 2016 however eps mediated flocculation aggregation and sedimentation of nps in terms of eco corona can also be beneficial because this phenomenon not only servers as a trap for plastic particles but also adsorb other hazardous pollutants participating in the self cleansing capacity of aquatic bodies moreover if stable and radioactive metallic groups are attached to nps mediated eco corona they can act as useful tracers for particle and organic carbon fluxes in the aquatic environment santschi 2018 therefore nps mediated eco corona formation can influence the transportation and fate of nps through floating sinking and sedimentation in aquatic bodies hence elucidating associated potential pathways warranted further investigations 8 existing challenges and future research perspectives 8 1 clarifying the role of nanoplastic properties it is still challenging to understand the role of np properties in the formation of eco corona and how those properties influence the interactions among nps and eps so far the reviewed studies employed ps as model nps with selected functional groups cooh nh2 surface charges and sizes to decipher their interactions with eps under laboratory conditions in the natural aquatic environment primary and secondary nps are more heterogeneous exhibiting various polymer type composition shape age surface coating and aggregation state all these np properties potentially play important roles in the eco nano interface which warranted further field and experimental studies however investigating np characteristics for their role in eco nano formation could be challenging especially extrapolating results from experimental conditions to the natural environment in this case creating a model system can simplify understanding the eco nano interface similar to that previously established for bio nano interface to understand the development and structure of protein corona formation on nps and their interactions using a model cellular membrane kihara et al 2020 as shown in table 1 recent in vivo and in vitro studies employed various traditional techniques including gel electrophoresis spectroscopy and spectrometry to measure the components of eco corona results from these studies provided the baseline data in terms of composition of eco corona molecular weight or size of eps nps assembly and rarely on the impact of np surface coating and size on the composition or structure of eco corona therefore the model system coupled with computational simulation can assist to explore the role of multiple factors involved in the eco nano interface including characteristics of nps physicochemical properties of formed eco corona and attached molecules and favorable aquatic conditions for example computational modeling has been recently applied to simulate the interactions of nps with proteins predicting the change in structure and associated implications hollóczki and gehrke 2019 in the future the availability of data related to eco corona formation its composition and associated ecological implications may enable designing models based on machine learning or artificial intelligence that can predict the eco corona mediated nps behavior and toxicity and assist to optimize their environmental distribution through adsorption of selective eps that will ultimately lead to the development of eco friendly nps nasser et al 2020 8 2 undermining the importance of medium properties physicochemical characteristics of the medium such as ph temperature and ionic strength not only affect the interaction between nps and eps for eco corona development but also play important role in shaping the properties of nps such as effective charge aggregation state hydrodynamic size surface valences and dispersion in the aquatic environment gonzález fernández et al 2018 so far only the impact of salinity ph and different electrolytes on nps mediated eco corona formation have been studied section 6 3 while the role of other influencing factors such as temperature conductivity divalent cations etc warranted further investigations 8 3 uncertainties in ecological impacts regarding the ecological implications of eco corona reviewed literature showed discrepancies in results in terms of either increased or decreased toxic and non toxic impacts in the aquatic environment table 2 previous studies have shown both increase or decrease in ros generation survival rate and bioavailability of nps to aquatic organisms mediated by eco corona formation therefore it s important to unveil physicochemical properties complete profile and bioreactivity of eco corona and its impacts on bioavailability and fate of nps in the aquatic environment currently most of the existing studies were based on laboratory experiments that used organism secreted eps artificially added nom and model proteins to highlight eco corona formation on nps therefore the composition of the corona was either comprised of added nom or rarely reported the complex assembly of eps such as dna carbohydrates functional proteins long chain organic acids polysaccharide rich compounds and glycoprotein biopolymer table 1 therefore future studies should consider unveiling other important elements of eco corona such as its morphology type of attached eps distinguish between soft and hard eco corona and structure of participating eps e g secondary or quaternary proteins as the natural aquatic environment contains a variety of organisms that secrete a cocktail of eps that co occurs with other anthropogenic chemicals including nps therefore studies should consider both eps and anthropogenic chemicals in the aquatic environment for their possible role in the eco corona formation and associated toxicological implications further it is yet to define if the size of formed eco corona has a direct impact on the toxicological impacts of nps due to the small size and trojan horse effect nps are more elusive to biological defense barriers and observed more toxic than mps in a biological system kihara et al 2020 therefore studies should be conducted to elucidate the impact of the size of eco corona biomolecules determining the nps ecotoxicity starting from the large nom fractions to proteins and polysaccharides and the smallest of the small molecules such as metabolites 8 4 recommendations for future nanotoxicity testing recently the inclusion of the eco corona concept in nanotoxicity testing is highly encouraged to obtain ecologically rational results nasser et al 2020 it is worth mentioning here that the type sensitivity feeding behavior and microbiome of organisms all can influence the secretion of eps and ultimately regulate the nature and composition of formed eco corona and associated ecological implications contrary to bio corona in the cellular environment in which proteins drive nps to adsorb on specific receptors result in toxicity reduction through a decrease in surface energy of nps the eco corona may act differently as the adsorbed biomolecules on the surface of nps drive their fate and bioreactivity thereby changing their uptake and retention in aquatic organisms which may cause an increase in toxicity therefore the toxicity testing on aquatic organism should consider the presence of secreted biomolecules which is more dynamic and closer to environmentally relevant conditions as compared to the static conditions suggested in the oecd toxicity testing considering such factors are critically important for in depth mechanistic toxicity investigations elucidating genes or proteins expressions and response of signaling pathways to ensure that such impacts of nps are ecologically relevant 9 conclusion this review summarized the documented studies highlighting the eco corona formation on nps and associated ecological implications in the aquatic environment in the aquatic environment nps are encapsulated by eco corona comprised of secreted biomolecules including dna proteins and carbohydrates as well as of allochthonous compounds such as ha and fa the eco corona formation is influenced by various factors such as characteristics of nps properties of eps and physicochemical parameters of the aquatic environment the formed eco corona altered surface charge size stability and other physicochemical properties of nps and ultimately their bioreactivity bioavailability and ecological implications importantly most of the existing studies were based on laboratory experiments and therefore used model nps that could be significantly different from those in the environment exhibiting various shapes polymers and functionals groups similarly artificially added nom or model proteins were used in most of the studies and rarely organism secreted eps to highlight eco corona formation therefore field studies are highly recommended to understand the nexus among eco corona and nps and their ecological implication in water bodies further it is a huge challenge yet to develop an integrated technique for the measurement of both nps and eco corona formation in the natural aquatic environment however the available studies have comprehensively demonstrated that the eco corona formation can alter the ecological implications of nps albeit it s yet to define the reasons behind the discrepancies in the findings of the available studies lastly continuing studies are mandatory to understand the role of eco corona in defining the np interactions with biological fractions in aquatic ecosystems declaration of

16826,nanoplastics nps are plastic particles with sizes ranging between 1 and 1000 nm exhibiting exceptional qualities such as large surface area lightweight durability therefore are widely used in cosmetics paints electronics etc nps are inevitability released into the aquatic environment where they tend to interact with both the extracellular polymeric substances eps and other fractions of natural organic matter nom respectively secreted by organisms e g dna proteins and carbohydrates and degradation byproducts of organic materials e g humic acid and fulvic acid fluxed into the water bodies these biomolecules robustly encapsulate nps to develop an eco corona layer that alters not only the physicochemical properties but also the fate bioreactivity and ecological impacts of nps therefore this review summarized the documented studies highlighting the eco corona formation on nps and associated ecological implications in the aquatic environment after presenting the precise background information on the occurrence of nps and eps in the aquatic environment we demonstrated the basic difference between eco corona and bio corona formation the reviewed studies showed that the eco corona formed on nps have varying sizes and composition mainly depending on the properties of parent biomolecules characteristics of nps and physicochemical parameters of the aquatic environment further the potential methods for characterization and quantification of eco corona and its composition have been also highlighted moreover the ecological implications both toxic and non toxic of eco corona formation on nps in marine and freshwater environments have been also summarized last but not the least challenges and future research directions are also given e g conducting field studies on eco corona formation in the aquatic environment optimizing methods for its characterization and quantification and considering eco corona concept in the future toxicity studies on nps finally understanding eco corona formation will be critical to unveil the complex np interactions occurring in natural aquatic systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics eco corona extracellular polymeric substances toxicity aquatic organisms 1 introduction plastics are abundantly used in various fields owing to their unique properties such as low cost lightweight durability and portability due to the high market demand a gradual increase in global plastic manufacturing has been observed since the 1960s with the recent production of 360 million tons in 2018 plasticseurope 2019 however unregulated consumption and improper disposal of plastics have resulted in their ubiquitous accumulation in every corner of the globe which researchers describe as living in the plasticene alimi et al 2018 rochman et al 2013 the recent plastic load in surface waters of the open ocean is estimated as high as 10 000 40 000 tons therefore plastics are considered as one of the major components of marine litter cózar et al 2014 law et al 2010 in the natural environment plastic debris and microplastics mps will break down into miniature particles termed nanoplastics nps through various processes such as hydrolysis biodegradation photodegradation and mechanical abrasion lambert and wagner 2016 moreover nps are also released inevitably into the environment from products that contain manufactured nano sized particles for various biomedical applications and consumer products koelmans et al 2017 the occurrence and accumulation of nps in the aquatic environment have raised alarming concerns due to their known hazardous impacts on aquatic organisms gaylarde et al 2020 although studies on the occurrence of nps in the aquatic environment are elusive yet they have been reported in water samples from the north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 and in surface snow from the austrian alps materić et al 2020 recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that nps can induce physiological wang et al 2021a and behavioral alterations mattsson et al 2015 embryotoxicity eliso et al 2020 reproductive abnormalities sarasamma et al 2020 transgenerational impacts liu et al 2020 and immunotoxicity greven et al 2016 in aquatic organisms besides plastic entities natural organic matter nom is also ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment comprised of complex assemblies of heterogeneous organic compounds with significantly varying composition and molecular weight wang et al 2015 nom can be categorized into autochthonous and allochthonous compounds respectively released inside the water body and formed outside and then transported into the water body docter et al 2015b the autochthonous nom is an assembly of biomolecules released by organisms after in situ reduction and it accounts for a significant proportion of organic macromolecules in the aquatic ecosystem wilkinson and lead 2007 among autochthonous nom the extracellular polymeric substances eps are the main and important constituents secreted by aquatic organisms as metabolic byproducts in response to stress or for habitat adaptations gutierrez et al 2013 recent studies showed that not only microbes bacteria algae etc but invertebrates e g daphnia magna also release eps that are mainly comprised of high molecular weight polysaccharides and to a lesser extent also contained proteins nucleic acid and lipids delattre et al 2016 nasser and lynch 2016 for example daphnia magna secretes eps in the form of proteins in the freshwater environment which can adsorb on nps surface altering their size and identity and serve as signaling factors assisting them to interact efficiently with cellular recognition receptors nasser and lynch 2016 marine water bodies are dynamic usually rich in eps secreted by organisms therefore exhibiting higher chances of interaction between nps and eps corsi et al 2020 for instance a variety of eps are released by marine diatoms either in response to an environmental stimulus or as a mandatory step in their basal metabolism grassi et al 2020 the composition of marine eps is diverse comprising biomolecules of various sizes and molecular weight spanning from amino acids to protein peptides and polysaccharides that give rise to macromolecular entities and also contribute to the overall complexity of the marine ecosystem grassi et al 2020 due to high protein content marine eps usually facilitate aggregates formation and serve as the active storage sites with strong adaptive properties to uptake new materials therefore eps aggregates can stabilize the extracellular enzymes that result in the induction of protein repository through the digestion process hence enhancing the protein accumulation in the ecosystem flemming et al 2016 hazardous materials plastics dispersant and oil and environmental stresses nutrient limitation and variations in the light exposure can alter the protein to carbohydrate p c ratio of eps bacosa et al 2018 kamalanathan et al 2019 shiu et al 2020b this change in the p c ratio can alter the adsorptive properties quenching potential and physical hindrance of eps for hazardous particles therefore regulates their effective quantity reaching aquatic organisms nichols et al 2005 further the aggregation behavior stickiness and hydrophobicity can also regulate the key properties of eps affecting the interactions of aquatic organisms with plastic particles that ultimately play important role in the transport and fate of nps in the environment chiu et al 2019 santschi et al 2020 more information on the cellular biosynthesis fate and interactive properties of eps in the aquatic environment is provided in text s1 and s2 of the supplementary information among allochthonous nom humic acid ha fulvic acid fa and humin are the most common compounds that are degradation byproducts of organic materials gutierrez et al 2018 they are also originated as byproducts of bacterial metabolism and through different oxidation processes in the environment lynch et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ha and fa are mainly present in the aquatic environment while humin is mainly present in the terrestrial environment due to its insolubility in the aquatic phase ihss 2007 owing to the heterogeneous functional groups covalently linked phenolic rings ha can easily interact with nps through hydrophobic interactions in the aquatic environment szabó et al 2017 winkler and ghosh 2018 conversely fa is more water soluble due to deprotonation of its functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl groups higher oxygen content and low molecular weight schellekens et al 2017 in seawater nom is usually comprised of elevated concentrations of ha and fa excreted products metabolic waste and exuded polysaccharides proteins and lipids which lead to the formation of complex and geographically diverse polymeric mixtures gibson et al 2007 recently the interactions among nps and ecosystem components eco nano interface have gained increasing attention in the aquatic environment nom mainly eps inevitability interacts with both primary and secondary nps and compete for hydrophobic surfaces grassi et al 2020 the eps np interaction is driven by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors through various forces such as steric hindrance electrostatic and hydrophobic bonds which largely depend on the properties of nps e g size concentration and surface functionalization eps e g charge concentration and functional groups and medium e g ph salinity and ionic strength philippe and schaumann 2014 therefore these interactions can regulate the colloidal behavior of nps by provoking additional electrosteric stabilization or inducing destabilization by enhancing bridging mechanisms in aquatic environment further such interfaces not only influence the bioavailability and biological impacts of nps but also change their environmental fate distribution and transportation by modifying their sinking or floating behavior nasser et al 2020 importantly the impacts of bio nano interactions have been extensively studied for nanoparticles in terms of their internalization potential and ultimately changed toxicity potential both with in vivo and in vitro models kihara et al 2020 lin et al 2017 pulido reyes et al 2017 albeit studies on eco nano interface are elusive yet the interaction of nps with the totality of nom especially eps can lead to the development of diverse biomolecular coating on the surface of nps collectively known as eco corona lynch et al 2014 the suspension of nps with eps in the aquatic environment can result in tightly coated layers on the surface of nps or develop a composite network embedding individual np particles turning into aggregates grassi et al 2020 moreover the dispersion of nps in the aquatic environment confers some degree of polydispersity resulting in their complex interactions with eps the eps np interaction in natural water is a complex process and this cannot be simply viewed as the formation of aggregates or a uniform molecular layer on the particle surface the adsorption of eps on nps can portray a competing phenomenon in the aquatic environment where aggregates can be formed due to high salinity while the development of eco corona can disrupt this process wang et al 2021b although the studies highlighting eco corona formation on nps in the natural environment are in their infancy stage the impacts of eco corona in altering the properties and toxicity of nps have been highlighted in recent studies fadare et al 2020 grassi et al 2020 saavedra et al 2019 further the inclusion of the eco corona concept in nanotoxicity testing is highly encouraged to obtain ecologically rational results nasser et al 2020 interestingly recent studies on the ecological effects of nps mediated eco corona showed contrasting results e g the formation of eco corona increased the uptake of nps and enhanced their toxicity to daphnia magna nasser and lynch 2016 meanwhile the protective role of eco corona against nps toxicity to daphnia magna has been also reported saavedra et al 2019 similarly the eco corona formation increased the cell viability and reduced the oxidative stress and membrane permeability in marine algae chlorella sp natarajan et al 2020 these studies showed that our knowledge of the eco corona formation on nps and associated ecological impacts in the aquatic environment is still not comprehensive fadare et al 2020 therefore to gain a sufficiently broad knowledge and solve eco corona riddles huge datasets are required for many different combinations of nps and eps and their potential interactions hence this review collates the knowledge on the documented studies regarding the eco corona formation on nps and associated implications in the aquatic environment with the following objectives 1 presenting precise background information on the sources and occurrence of nps and eps and the basic difference between eco corona and bio corona formation 2 providing potential methods for characterization and quantification of eco corona and its composition 3 highlighting factors affecting the eco corona formation such as characteristics of nps properties of biomolecules and physicochemical characteristics of the aquatic environment 4 elucidating change in ecological implications of nps mediated by eco corona both toxic and non toxic and 5 summarizing the existing challenges and future research directions regarding eco corona formation on nps in the aquatic environment this systematic review was compiled in compliance with principles recommended in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma method moher et al 2010 more details on the implementation steps of the prisma method are shown in text s3 of the supplementary information 2 sources fate and implications of nanoplastics in the aquatic environment generally nps are defined as plastic particles with a size between 1 nm and 1000 nm gigault et al 2018 however some studies have suggested a maximum size of 100 nm besseling et al 2019 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to remove nps from the wastewater inevitably releasing them to aquatic resources kihara et al 2020 important sources and processes involved in the generation and formation of nps in the aquatic environment are presented in fig 1 similar to mps nps are also categorized into primary and secondary nps based on their sources primary nps are engineered plastic particles produced with nano sizes for specific applications such as paints electronics and cosmetics hadri et al 2020 among other known sources of primary nps include the careless release from products such as cleansing scrubs toothpaste pigments tyre and road wear and textiles kihara et al 2020 recently nps emission as a by product from 3d printers is gaining attention considering the elevated use of 3d printing alimi et al 2018 peng et al 2020 secondary nps originate from the unintentional natural and anthropogenic degradation and fragmentation of mps plastic litter and bulk plastics besseling et al 2014 wagner and reemtsma 2019 for example polystyrene ps plastics degraded down to nps inside a weathering chamber after 4 weeks of retention duration lambert and wagner 2016 the mechanical milling using plastics in agriculture is also reported to release nps beddoes et al 2015 compared to primary nps secondary nps are highly polydisperse and more heterogeneous exhibiting varying sizes shapes and surface charges hadri et al 2020 so far amaral zettler et al 2020 presented the best hypothetical model on processes involved in the degradation of plastics in aquatic bodies i e 1 physicochemical degradation that mainly comprised of photodegradation uv a and uv b lights thermal degradation visible light and thermal oxidation infrared radiation which depolymerize plastics into oligomers and monomers through bond scission and 2 biological degradation mainly consisted of the mechanical activity of microorganisms that colonize in crevices and cracks on plastics and several enzymes have been already discovered that can degrade specific non hydrolysable plastic polymers e g pe alkane dehydrogenase laccases and oxygenases ps hydroxyquinone peroxidases and hydrolysable plastic polymers e g pet hydrolase cutinases and pur esterases one of the main problems associated with the degradation process is that it not only decreases the size but also radically reduces the molecular weight of the polymers making them more bioavailable for aquatic organisms ferreira et al 2019 compared with mps nps are more elusive to biological defense barriers including cell membranes mucous layers and tissues yong et al 2020 several factors such as the surface charge particle size and elemental composition as well as the nature of chemical interactions assist nps in crossing biological barriers alarmingly the experimental studies highlighted that nps are capable to induce multifaceted impacts on all kinds of life ranging from microorganisms to marine mammals and even humans as reviewed by huang et al 2021 due to analytical limitations methods for measuring nps in the aquatic environment are still at the developing stage therefore controversies exist that claim whether np concentrations present in aquatic resources are sufficient to induce adverse effects however it is speculated that the concentration of nps in the aquatic environment could be 1014 times higher than those reported for mps owing to their release from various sources and fragmentation besseling et al 2019 so far a limited number of studies have measured nps in natural aquatic environment field samples for instance the polymer composition of nps was mainly comprised of pvc 73 18 pet 18 16 and ps 9 10 in water samples from the north atlantic gyre ter halle et al 2017 the surface snow samples from the austrian alps were contaminated with low levels of pet polymer of nps i e 5 4 27 4 ng ml 1 materić et al 2020 moreover pvc pe and ps polymers of nps were observed in water extracts of agriculture soil samples collected from central france wahl et al 2021 similarly water extracts of beach sand samples from the north atlantic gyre were contaminated with pvc and ps polymers of nps davranche et al 2020 the ecological impacts of nps are mainly associated with their intrinsic properties including size shape surface charge coating and functionalization gonzález fernández et al 2018 for marine organisms the adverse impacts of nps have been reported starting from the initial days of nps related research piccardo et al 2020 for freshwater organism a vast number of studies has been conducted recently on daphnia magna highlighting the impaired reproduction developmental abnormalities and transgenerational adverse effects fadare et al 2020 kelpsiene et al 2020 lin et al 2019 xu et al 2020 similarly studies on other model organisms such as bivalves and crustaceans also reported adverse impacts e g reduced fertilization and embryogenesis growth and developmental abnormalities and behavioral alterations lin et al 2019 rist et al 2019 tallec et al 2018 exposure to functionalized polystyrene nanoplastics psnps induced the deformed larval phenotypes in blue mussel ec 50 0 15 μg ml 1 for embryos and reduced fertilization and embryogenesis in pacific oysters ec50 4 9 μg ml 1 for gametes rist et al 2019 tallec et al 2018 nps mediated toxicity has been also extensively investigated in different fish species as recently highlighted in multiple reviews ferreira et al 2019 jacob et al 2020 triebskorn et al 2018 moreover nps are tended to bioaccumulate and transfer along the food chain and are reported to induce behavioral impacts at higher trophic levels mattsson et al 2017 sökmen et al 2020 however elucidating the biochemical and functional mechanisms of nps toxicity is challenging yet mainly due to the complex nature of np eps interactions and unknown biological targets especially at the interface level kihara et al 2020 bio corona and eco corona are exemplary cases of such complex interfacial interactions of nps respectively in biological and environmental systems as highlighted in the following section 3 eco corona vs bio corona formation the basic concept the term environmental or eco corona is defined as an environmentally acquired encapsulation of synthetic particles plastic or non plastic by biomolecules such as proteins carbohydrates etc baalousha et al 2018 grassi et al 2020 this paradigm has been recently translated from protein or bio corona which is the robust coating of nanomaterials nms with a layer of biomolecules upon entering into an in vivo biological environment cedervall et al 2007 after entering into the environment nms or nps may interact with biomolecules such as nom including eps resulting in the formation of eco corona fig 2a in the aquatic environment organic biomolecules compete with each other to attach the hydrophobic surface of nps zeng et al 2019 more specifically eco corona is developed on nps when eps are sourced from the exoproteome proteins released as a result of signaling and habitat adaptation or from the metabolic activities of aquatic organisms proteins carbohydrates dna etc nasser and lynch 2016 on the other hand bio corona is developed when nps interact and adsorb endogenous proteins through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions canesi et al 2017 lowry et al 2012 contrary to bio corona eco corona is an abiotic entity which reveals interactions between nps and a specific set of eps that may affect by the surrounding environmental factors and result in an exposure scenario dependent outcome importantly the eco corona formation can significantly change the bioavailability of nps thus impacting associated biological impacts the eco corona adsorbs macromolecules from the surrounding which may control interactions and exchange of nps with minerals organic materials and pollutants in aquatic bodies therefore the acquired eco corona may dictate the biological and chemical reactivity of nps natarajan et al 2020 recently the bio corona formation on the surface of nms has been extensively explored owing to a wide range of nm applications especially in biomedicine docter et al 2015a kuruvilla et al 2017 the bio corona exhibits a dynamic character that assists it to evolve continuously as protein adsorb and desorb on the surface of nms pino et al 2013 walkey and chan 2012 therefore being a dynamic entity bio corona develops two distinctive structures 1 hard corona which is appeared when the surface of nms is encapsulated by a layer of tightly adsorbed biomolecules lynch and dawson 2008 and 2 soft corona which is comprised of a layer of robustly exchanging and loosely attached biomolecules exhibiting a low degree of structural changes pulido reyes et al 2017 fig 2a in contrast hard corona undergoes a high degree of conformational changes slow exchange duration long retention time and strong binding affinity yang et al 2013 however occasionally they may resemble each other e g soft and hard coronae developed by human serum albumin hsa and lysozyme lys on psnps do have structural similarities kihara et al 2020 fig 2b more information on bio corona formation and its properties is provided in text s3 of the supplementary information a vast number of previous in vitro and in vivo studies highlighted the bio corona formation on non plastic nms and the associated change in biological impacts canesi et al 2017 docter et al 2015a docter et al 2015b pulido reyes et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 however a limited number of studies focused on the bio corona formation on plastic particles mps or nps and associated toxicological implications considering the abundance of plastic particles eco corona formation has become a critical parameter in predictive models to explain the potential fate distribution and interactions of nps in the aquatic environment kihara et al 2020 however studies are relatively scarce yet that highlighted eco corona formation factors affecting the eco corona formation and the associated change in toxic and non toxic impacts of nps in the aquatic environment moreover similar to that in bio corona formation proteins in the aquatic environment can compete with each other to interact with nps to form eco corona which may induce stabilizing or destabilizing effects on plastic particles and alter their fate and ecological impacts 4 eco corona formation on nanoplastics in the aquatic environment recently multiple studies highlighted the eco corona formation on nps under laboratory conditions mediated by organism secreted eps proteins carbohydrates etc or through artificially added nom ha fa and alginate in aquatic mediums however studies demonstrating this phenomenon in natural waters are elusive yet a summary of recent studies elucidating the eco corona formation on nps in the presence of freshwater and marine organisms is given in table 1 regarding freshwater scenarios fadare et al 2020 reported the formation of eco corona and bio corona on aminated polystyrene nanoplastics nh2 psnps 100 120 nm exposed to daphnia magna at an exposure concentration of 100 mg l 1 and incubation of 24 h in the presence of ha and fa proteomic analysis of both coronae identified 1004 proteins in total 281 unique proteins associated with eco corona in the medium and 723 with bio corona in homogenates of daphnia magna the significant proteins included in the profile of eco corona were the actin alpha skeletal muscle protein the 70 kda heat shock protein hsp70 the 14 3 3 protein epsilon zeta delta alpha enolase vitellogenin 1 didomain hemoglobin etc fadare et al 2020 in another study fadare et al 2019 reported the eco corona development on nh2 psnps 100 120 nm exposed to daphnia magna at an exposure concentration of 400 mg l 1 and incubation for 0 96 h in the presence of ha ha nps mixture showed a distinct pattern of excitation emission matrix eem and a high fluorescent intensity compared to single ha solution and nps suspension strongly suggesting eco corona formation nasser and lynch 2016 also highlighted the eco corona formation in the presence of daphnia magna albeit without the addition of any nom in this study organisms were exposed to carboxylated polystyrene nanoplastics cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 90 110 nm by using a concentration of 10 mg l 1 at various incubation periods 1 6 h the significant components of eco corona were comprised of secreted qsec sensor protein 50 4 kda and type vi secretion system 74 8 kda which play important roles in cell to cell signalling and stress responses respectively similarly wu et al 2019 also used daphnia magna to decipher the formation of the biogenic aggregates on pristine psnps and functional cooh psnps negatively charged n nh2 psnps and positively charged p nh2 psnps of various sizes 50 300 nm in the presence of ha interestingly robust aggregates with diameter as high as 4516 nm were observed among ha and p nh2 psnps 100 nm albeit no significant p 0 05 aggregates formation was observed for remaining nps due to similar charges along with daphnia magna saavedra et al 2019 employed brachionus calyciflorus and thamnocephalus platyurus to decipher eco corona formation on cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 200 nm in the presence of alginate and ha and the formed eco corona modified the surface charge on nh2 psnps altogether these studies showed that pristine or functional nps robustly interact with naturally released eps or artificially added nom through eco corona formation and most of the studies from freshwater settings reported the manual addition of nom to facilitate eco corona formation in the presence of aquatic organisms moreover daphnia magna was frequently used as a model organism to investigate eco corona formation because it releases a significant amount of eps comprised of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acid and lipids in freshwater delattre et al 2016 nasser and lynch 2016 relatively more studies are available that highlighted eco corona formation on nps in the presence of marine organisms table 1 for instance fungi trichoderma reecsei released large quantities of hydrophobins highly adhesive proteins that strongly bind on the surface of psnps of various sizes and functional groups compared to pristine nps grunér et al 2016 a recent study employed marine alga chlorella sp highlighting eco corona formation on pristine and functional psnps of size 300 nm natarajan et al 2020 to facilitate eco corona formation plain psnps cooh psnps and nh2 psnps were aged for 12 24 and 48 h in the eps containing medium this study highlighted that the negatively charged nh2 psnps exhibited a higher binding affinity for eps components compared to that of positively charged ones grassi et al 2020 employed marine diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum to elucidate the eps mediated eco corona formation on cooh psnps 60 nm the presence of eps induced the formation of protein and carbohydrate complexes of size ranged between 30 100 kda on the surface of nps and reduced the self aggregation of plastic particles in eps containing natural seawater compared with that of eps free natural seawater chen et al 2011 reported potential hydrophobic interactions between ps nps 23 nm and eps released by three marine phytoplankton species phaeodactylum tricornutum ankistrodesmus angustus and amphora sp the formation of eps psnp aggregates in terms of microscopic gel 4 6 µm was observed after 72 h of exposure to nps at 10 and 100 ppb summers et al 2018 conducted a study based on simulated sea surface conditions that revealed interactions between nps 50 100 500 nm and eps produced by halomonas sp the extracted eps was observed to formulate aggregates with psnps after incubation for 24 h at a concentration of 5 mg l 1 and aggregates were largely composed of glycoprotein biopolymer shiu et al 2020a recently reported the secretion of protein rich eps from marine phytoplanktons and aggregates formation after exposure to nps briefly thalassiosira pseudonana skeletonema grethae phaeodactylum tricornutum and dunaliella tertiolecta were exposed to psnps 55 1000 nm with concentrations ranged between 10 4 to 250 mg l 1 exposure to the higher concentrations of relatively small sized nps induced the release of eps with elevated p c ratios and promoted aggregates formation compared to low concentrations and large sized nps contrary to freshwater studies on marine settings employed various types of organisms diatoms algae oysters to highlight eco corona mediated interaction of nps with eps moreover no artificial enrichment of media using nom was reported which could be attributed to the fact that marine organisms release large quantities of eps therefore implicating higher chances of interaction between nps and eps grassi et al 2020 besides in vivo studies in vitro studies have also highlighted eco corona formation between nps and biomolecules for instance a recent study exposed oocytes and spermatozoa from oyster crassostrea gigas to various concentrations 0 1 100 mg l 1 of cooh psnps and nh2 psnps for different exposure durations 1 3 and 5 h and significantly increased cell size and complexity mediated by eco corona formation were observed between plastic particles and oyster gametes gonzález fernández et al 2018 similarly the hemocytes extracted from bivalve mytilus galloprovincialis reported forming eco corona and bio corona on nh2 psnps 50 nm at 25 mg l 1 in artificial seawater asw and bivalve haemolymph after incubation for 24 h respectively the abundance 75 76 sequence coverage of putative c1q protein containing mgc1q6 domain was observed as hard bio corona in the haemolymph and as small eco corona clusters or chains of in asw canesi et al 2016 besides eco corona formation by secreted eps or added nom artificially supplemented proteins have been also investigated to interact with nps through eco corona development for instance li et al 2021a recently reported the formation of eco corona on bare psnps cooh psnps and nh2 psnps of various sizes 40 90 nm at 10 mg l 1 mediated by bovine serum albumin bsa one of the most abundant proteins in surface water the formed eco exhibited a stabilization effect on negatively charged bare psnps and cooh psnps while inhibited the aggregation of positively charged nh2 psnps this study further demonstrated the eco corona mediated stabilization of all three psnps in the lake river and seawater samples n 9 due to the sufficient amount of dom in the river 4 42 mg c l 1 and lake 14 6 mg c l 1 the three psnps observed stable via steric repulsion and eco corona formation however in the seawater only bare psnps and cooh psnps developed aggregates while no aggregates were observed for nh2 psnps due to the presence of a high concentration of so4 2 and cl in seawater contrary to the experimental results li et al 2021a similarly shiu et al 2020b highlighted the interaction of psnps 25 nm 10 µg l 1 with dom biopolymers in river and lake water samples after incubation for 10 d the dom np aggregates appeared in the form of microgels approximately 4 6 μm in size reaching equilibrium within 90 120 h and exhibited a similar assembly curve in water samples from both sources another study investigated the eco corona formation on psnps 200 500 and 1000 nm mediated by bsa and lys proteins in the marine aquatic environment peng et al 2020 bsa adsorbed on small sized psnps 200 and 500 nm to formulate eco corona through colloidal steric hindrance which ultimately decreased the aggregate size of nps for instance the aggregates of middle sized nps 500 nm reduced in diameter from 1740 nm to 765 nm after 40 min of incubation with bsa conversely the lys failed to form eco corona on the surface of larger nps 500 and 1000 nm attributed to the significantly low adsorption of protein molecules nevertheless the lys developed eco corona on smaller nps 200 nm via bridging effect and electrostatic adsorption dong et al 2020 in summary nearly all the available studies used pristine psnps or functional cooh psnps and nh2 psnps to investigate eco corona development so far nps with varying sizes 23 nm to 1000 nm and exposure concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 were subjected to incubation at different periods 1 h to 10 d with freshwater or marine organisms for the development of eco corona or biogenic aggregates the formed eco corona varies in size and composition depends on the types of nom initially used or eps secreted by aquatic organisms the composition of eco corona in reviewed studies revealed the presence of various organic components such as dna carbohydrates functional proteins long chain organic acids polysaccharide rich compounds and glycoprotein biopolymer ranging from size 20 kda to 100 kda contrary to experimental conditions the natural waters exhibit complicated composition of nom eps ions and inorganic colloids which can play a significant role in eco corona formation li et al 2021a therefore studies should be conducted to understand the eco corona formation on nps and their physicochemical properties and molecular composition in realistic environmental conditions once eco corona is formed it can significantly modify the identity of nps and influence their interactions with biotic and abiotic entities in the aquatic environment nasser and lynch 2016 therefore it is critically important to devise methods for characterizing various elements of eco corona and its properties such as size morphology type of attached proteins distinguish between soft and hard eco corona and structure of participating biomolecules which can assist further to understand fate and bioreactivity of nps in the aquatic environment 5 potential methods for eco corona measurement in the aquatic environment potential techniques for the identification and quantification of eco corona formation on nps and their composition in the aquatic environment are presented in fig 3 several factors are involved in eco corona formation on nps in the aquatic environment section 6 the impact of size composition biological and physicochemical properties of eco corona is largely unknown yet natarajan et al 2020 however it is well defined that biogenic aggregates in the aquatic environment exhibit unique characteristics and behave differently from the rest of the ecosystem components they are dynamic having large interfacial energies thus can develop a robust eco nano interface through particle particle interactions which are stronger than the thermal energy of the medium santschi 2018 thus various scenario dependent potential techniques should be devised to measure eco corona and its properties which will ultimately help to understand the eco nano interface fate and transportation of nps in the environment there are three main potential approaches to quantify eco corona formation on nps and their components including 1 measurement of eco corona through isolation from nps 2 indirect quantification by size measurements and 3 direct quantification of bounded proteins 5 1 measurement of eco corona through isolation for quantification of bio eco corona one of the critical parameters in characterizing the average number of biomolecules proteins n attached on nps surface under certain environmental experimental conditions pino et al 2013 setting aside other controlling factors assuming that corona is formed on the surface of all the nps there will be two mandatory parameters for the holistic characterization of the corona i e the concentration of proteins attached on the surface of nps c np p and the concentration of nps in the medium environmental matrix c 0 np then the following eq 1 will define the average number of proteins n 1 n c np p c 0 np the detection of eco corona through this approach mainly required two steps 1 characterization and quantification of nps and 2 measurement and compositional profiling of formed corona before quantification of nps in environmental samples there are two challenging steps pre concentration and separation of nps in the aquatic environment matrix digestion is not necessary for clean freshwater or marine water samples oßmann et al 2018 ter halle et al 2017 secondly the eco corona is comprised of the attached nom hence the digestion will cause the loss of proteins albeit the enzymatic digestion can be applied for the measurement of eco corona as mentioned in section 5 3 preconcentration of nps usually carried out through methods such as ultracentrifugation ultrafiltration cloud point extraction cpe and continuous flow centrifugation cfc and their separation is commonly attained through membrane filtration field flow fractionation fff and size exclusion chromatography sec cai et al 2021 regarding quantification of nps pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms thermal desorption coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry tds gc ms and raman spectroscopy are the most popular analytical methods for the detection of environmental nps schwaferts et al 2020 ter halle et al 2017 the elemental detection techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms is also recently applied to detect metal containing nanoparticles without digestion jiménez lamana et al 2020 various other correlation based techniques such as are also photothermal absorption correlation spectroscopy phacs and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs are also adopted for precise measurement of nps directly in the solution however these techniques can only be applied on colloidally stable nps due to their sensitivity towards agglomeration octeau et al 2009 zemanová et al 2003 further the dispersion of nps also plays a critical role in shaping the attached corona for instance most nps showed aggregates formation especially under high salinity conditions pellegrino et al 2005 wu et al 2019 and the development of eco corona on agglomerated nps will be different than that on highly dispersed nps therefore a complete characterization of nps including their colloidal behavior should be an integral part of studies deciphering eco corona formation on nps among various nps characterization techniques the most commonly used microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are included dynamic light scattering dls canesi et al 2016 chen et al 2011 grassi et al 2020 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir fadare et al 2019 wu et al 2019 transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm fadare et al 2019 natarajan et al 2020 shim et al 2017 wu et al 2019 tem is usually used when the hydrodynamic diameter dh of nps is relatively much higher than that of geometric diameter dc implying less dispersion and more agglomeration of nps rivera gil et al 2013 in this case the absorption spectra are helpful and extinction at a longer wavelength i e 1000 nm is mostly attributed to scattering of np aggregates rather than absorption hühn et al 2013 employing sem is advantageous as it provides very clear and high resolution images of plastic particles assisting in discerning plastics from organic matter cooper and corcoran 2010 coupling with eds sem provides the elemental composition of plastic particles facilitating the discrimination of carbon dominant plastics from inorganic particles shim et al 2017 however it can only be used for the characterization of specific nps as the colored particles cannot be identified using sem shim et al 2017 sem eds also exhibits certain limitations e g its challenging to distinguish between eds spectra from plastic polymers and adsorbed debris on the plastics dehghani et al 2017 afm can also provide clear images at high resolutions up to nanometers and can be operated in both contact and noncontact mode with objects shim et al 2017 recently raman spectroscopy has been also opted to characterize nps with size 100 nm fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 albeit it also exhibits certain limitations such as polymer degradation and fluorescence that can be a significant source of interference thus applicable to non fluorescent and stable nps lenz et al 2015 when compared to ftir raman provides a higher resolution wider spectral coverage and lower water interference ribeiro claro et al 2017 generally after pretreatment pre concentration separation microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are usually integrated for holistic quantification of nps e g ftir dls py gc ms and tds gc ms were used in combination for measurement of fingerprints and topology of nps in the north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 further a combination of sem ft ir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used for the successful quantification of polyethylene nanoplastics penps with sizes ranging from 24 6 to 52 14 nm hernandez et al 2017 similarly online coupling of fff with raman was used to quantify nps with the lowest size of 200 nm and low raman scattering limitation was dealt with using 2d optical tweezers for trapping particles schwaferts et al 2020 combining with raman or ft ir afm can be employed to detect the elemental composition of nps and it can acquire images and ir absorption spectra with spatial resolutions of 50 100 nm shim et al 2017 for the ex situ approach separation of unbounded proteins from bounded proteins and nps is also mandatory and the concentration of unbound proteins c p in the supernatant is used for indirect ex situ measurement of c np p through the following eq 2 2 c np p c 0 p c p some studies have employed the combination of centrifugation sds page and mass spectroscopy for isolation and compositional profiling of eco corona canesi et al 2016 chen et al 2011 grassi et al 2020 further eco corona proteins characterization through sec proteomics flow cytometry and protein quantification kits have been also reported chen et al 2011 fadare et al 2020 gonzález fernández et al 2018 summers et al 2018 however this ex situ quantification of eco corona proteins needs a separation step that can be challenging for instance the larger nps may undergo precipitation after centrifugation and the bounded proteins will also precipitate while unbounded proteins will remain in the supernatant pitek et al 2012 schäffler et al 2013 after the collection of unbounded proteins the bounded proteins will be detached from the nps surface and released into the solution due to the potential shift in the equilibrium of eqs 1 and 2 then only a weakly attached fraction of the original corona and persistently bounded fraction on nps will be lost this is the basic criteria to differentiate between soft and hard corona moreover the centrifugation based separation of unbounded proteins in the presence of small nps 10 nm could be complex and time consuming and may need ultracentrifugation owing to the small masses of nps jedlovszky hajdú et al 2012 another challenge for indirect measurement of attached protein fraction is to analyze the difference between the soft and hard corona and elucidated their competitive binding on the surface of nps milani et al 2012 5 2 indirect quantification by size measurements the indirect quantification of adsorbed corona on nps has been also reported through in situ size measurements in terms of hydrodynamic radii using various techniques including dls phase analysis light scattering pals fluorescence microscopy etc fadare et al 2019 saavedra et al 2019 wu et al 2019 for these techniques the separation of nps from the medium containing both bounded and unbounded proteins is not a prerequisite in this case the rule of thumb is more proteins are encapsulated per np the larger will be the value of dh however such measurements are only possible when nps are colloidally stable and exhibit a narrow size distribution in this way measurements represent the real equilibrium scenario and are carried out without facing the challenge of separating unbounded proteins which showed the huge conceptual advantage of using this method pino et al 2013 while using dls for indirect size measurement the differentiation between the light scattered from nps and free proteins is necessary therefore for such dls measurements the size of nps should be significantly larger than that of protein then dls will assist for appropriate analysis of in situ development of protein corona enabling convenient dh measurements of np protein complexes however if nps and proteins exhibit the same size the light scattering from them can no longer be separated from the one from the unbounded proteins hühn et al 2013 in such circumstances fluorescence microscopy offers a good alternative to dls albeit requires fluorescent labeled nps that do not interfere with corona formation zhang et al 2011 further only fluorescent corona np protein aggregates can be measured by fluorescence microscopy and autofluorescence signals from unattached proteins should be neglected the measurement of corona formation through size quantification using these techniques dls and fluorescence microscopy is mainly feasible for smaller nps once the protein eco corona is developed the dh of nps will increase through following the linear conformation of the biomolecules pino et al 2013 5 3 direct quantification of bounded proteins considering the loss of original protein corona through centrifugation and washing steps demonstrated in eq 1 and 2 the direct measurement of eco corona bounded on nps is more feasible in this way both the amount as well as the composition of attached proteins biomolecules on nps surface can be determined a classical approach is an enzymatic digestion of the attached proteins and then their quantification through mass spectrometry or gel electrophoresis jedlovszky hajdú et al 2012 lesniak et al 2012 mahmoudi et al 2013 tenzer et al 2011 in this way the bounded proteins are separated based on their molecular weight which is subsequently coupled with protein databased for the identification of protein species generally for small sized nps 10 nm less than nmax 100 proteins are attached that are evenly distributed however hundreds of proteins have been reported to be attached further to protein corona encapsulated nps and it is predetermined that protein corona formed on each nps will not be the same tenzer et al 2011 importantly there are 100 existing protein species distributed in the realistic biological environmental medium which may bound to 100 protein binding sites per np therefore the protein eco corona formulated on individual nps can be significantly different notedly this approach has been applied for protein identification and quantification in studies on the bio corona formation and yet to be validated in studies on eco corona formation pino et al 2013 in summary the existing studies mostly employed the first approach i e the measurement of eco corona and its composition through centrifugation based isolation and then applying spectrometric and electrophoresis techniques to further quantify the molecular components table 1 for eco corona differentiating between soft and hard eco corona will be another challenge and warranted further investigations importantly most of these studies were conducted under laboratory conditions and characterized nps before using them for eco corona therefore all of these studies lacking the quantification of nps under realistic conditions or in the natural aquatic environment which is yet another challenge required extensive research 6 factors affecting eco corona formation on nanoplastics studies are still elusive that highlighted specific influencing factors involved in eco corona formation on nps in the aquatic environment shiu et al 2020a generally three main elements can describe the interaction between nps and biomolecules in the aquatic environment 1 the size aging and surface properties of nps 2 the physicochemical characteristics of the aquatic environment and 3 the levels composition and functional properties of biomolecules fig 4 table 1 2 6 1 size aging and surface characteristics of nanoplastics particle size can influence the surface reactivity surface energy surface charge and electronic structure of nps which can alter the nature of interactive forces among nps and approaching biological surfaces zhang 2014 for instance owing to the high surface energy smaller nps tend to aggregate more under given circumstances compared to larger particles he et al 2008 for instance the small sized psnps 200 nm tend to formulate eco corona with bsa and lys respectively through colloidal steric hindrance and electrostatic adsorption however the large sized psnps 500 and 1000 nm failed to formulate eco corona with lys due to lack of adsorption dong et al 2020 summers et al 2018 also observed that the smallest nps 50 nm promoted the development of larger eps np aggregates as compared to larger nps 100 and 500 nm nps are surface coated or functionalized to enhance their stability through generating steric electrostatic and hydrophilic repulsion forces among plastic particles for instance the positively charged nh2 psnps showed destabilization in the presence of negatively charged ha due to charge neutralization compared to neutral psnps and negatively charged cooh psnps chen et al 2011 similarly due to the negative surface charge nh2 psnps formed rapid and larger aggregates with positively charged alginate and ha compared to positively charged cooh nps saavedra et al 2019 conversely due to alike charges the addition of negatively charged ha induced a negligible effect on the aggregation of negatively charged psnps n nh2 psnps and cooh psnps and consequently they appeared more stable however positively charged p nh2 psnps rapidly formulate aggregates with negatively charged ha implying that ha may first neutralize the surface charge of nps and then adsorbed onto them wu et al 2019 coupled with the surface charge the aging of nps also plays a significantly important role in eco corona formation on the surface of nps for instance the negatively charged nh2 psnps exhibited a higher binding affinity for eps components than positively charged cooh psnps when they were subjected to aging for 12 24 and 48 h in the eps containing medium natarajan et al 2020 and the formation of eco corona enhanced with the increase in aging duration e g the mean dh of cooh psnps was significantly increased p 0 001 from 282 37 to 512 6 nm as the aging duration increased from 12 to 48 h natarajan et al 2020 similarly a longer incubation period 4 and 6 h increased the agglomeration propensity of nps with secreted proteins when compared to a short incubation period 1 h attributed to proteins rearrangements during the longer incubation span nasser and lynch 2016 similarly the biogenic aggregates between eps from halomonas sp and psnps attained the size 0 5 1 mm of marine snow 0 5 mm after 72 h of incubation while these agglomerates were barely visible to the naked eye during the initial incubation for 24 h summers et al 2018 besides size aging and surface characteristics the shape aggregation dispersion behavior as well as surface properties of nps such as polymer type composition surface charge and functional groups can influence the interaction of nps with biomolecules canesi et al 2017 verma and stellacci 2010 yeh et al 2012 in summary these available studies showed that smaller size opposite charges and longer incubation period are more preferable conditions or characteristics for nps to formulate eco corona or biogenic aggregates with eps and other fractions of nom 6 2 concentration and properties of biomolecules the concentration composition and properties of biomolecules control the aggregation of nps by forming an adsorption layer on the plastics in the aquatic environment li et al 2021b the concentration of nom showed a direct relationship with np aggregates formation and also exhibited a dispersive effect on plastic particles in the aquatic environment summers et al 2018 for instance an increase in the concentration of bsa 1 10 mg c l 1 enhanced the eco corona associated stabilization of negatively charged bare psnps and cooh psnps while exhibited a destabilizing effect on negatively charged nh2 psnps li et al 2021a similarly the addition of 1 mg l 1 of ha and alginate induced eco corona formation on nh2 nps with z average diameter of 670 6 nm and 924 0 nm respectively saavedra et al 2019 however the higher concentration of ha 2 mg l 1 has a stabilizing effect due to eco corona formation with limited aggregation revealed by a decrease in the zeta potential saavedra et al 2019 a similar study revealed the rapid aggregation of positively charged p nh2 psnps 100 nm in the presence of ha and the largest aggregates were observed at 10 mg l 1 ha reaching dh of 4516 01 nm while a further increase in ha concentration exhibited stabilizing effect nps and their aggregation decreased dh 192 04 nm through steric stabilization and electrostatic repulsion wu et al 2019 in contrast the various concentration of ha 1 50 mg l 1 failed to induce any considerable changes to zeta potential or particle size of nh2 psnps after incubation for 0 96 h except a slight decrease of zeta potentials of nps after 96 h implying that the ha formulated eco corona on nps without causing precipitation or agglomeration shiu et al 2020a the composition of eps can also impact eco corona formation on nps in various ways one of the important parameters is the p c ratio of eps which depends on factors such as the size of nps and sensitivity of the exposed species shiu et al 2020a for instance eps with a relatively low fraction of protein hydrophobic such as from amphora sp required a higher concentration of nps 100 ppb to initiate the development of eps np aggregates however for protein rich eps partially hydrophobic from ankistrodesmus angustus and phaeodactylum tricornutum formulated significantly larger aggregates 4 5 mm at low concentration of nps 10 ppb chen et al 2011 the type of biomolecules distinguished by charge can also play a significant role in the formation of eco corona on nps for instance the negatively charged bsa can easily formulate eco corona on psnps using colloidal steric hindrance while the positively charged lys failed to do so owing to the low adsorption of protein molecules in seawater dong et al 2020 similarly ha decreased the protein binding on nh2 psnps whereas fa had the opposite effect on eco corona formation in daphnia magna containing medium saavedra et al 2019 in conclusion studies presented here showed that the lower concentration higher protein content and opposite charge on eps or nom can increase their interactions with nps to form eco corona however discrepancies also exist in the available studies therefore further research is warranted to elucidate the concrete role of eps properties and concentration in the formation of eco corona with nps in the aquatic environment 6 3 properties of the medium aquatic environment in the natural aquatic environment the properties of the water body can substantially modify the characteristics of nps grassi et al 2020 for instance ph salinity conditioning and ionic strength of the medium not only affect the interaction between nps and biomolecules but also plays important role in shaping the properties of nps such as effective charge aggregation state hydrodynamic size surface valences and dispersion in the aquatic environment gonzález fernández et al 2018 the concentration of electrolytes in the aquatic environment can influence the aggregation behavior of nps by altering their surface charges wang et al 2021b for example at 0 01 mm level of fecl3 100 nm nps showed a stable behavior while their size was increased to 350 nm as the concentration of fecl3 increased to 0 1 and 1 mm cai et al 2018 another key factor that controls the aggregation of plastic particles in the aquatic environment is the valency of ions for instance the critical coagulation concentration ccc of psnps in nacl solution monovalent was 32 fold and 80 fold higher than those in mgcl2 and cacl2 solution divalent respectively shams et al 2020 changes in the composition and physicochemical parameters of the medium can also impact the concentration of secreted proteins eps as well as their interactions with nps for instance the pre conditioning of medium with daphnia magna and chollera vulgaris increased the concentration of secreted proteins that ultimately enhanced the polydispersity index pdi and particle size of nh2 psnps through the formation of larger aggregates nasser and lynch 2016 the stability of nps and their interaction with biomolecules in the aquatic environment can be affected greatly by a change in salinity for instance the increase in salinity addition of nacl and cacl2 enhanced eco corona formation between bsa and negatively charged bare psnps cooh psnps while reduced the formation of the aggregates for positively charged nh2 psnps li et al 2021a however the aggregation of nh2 psnps with bsa was observed in the presence of na2so4 mediated by charge neutralization and patch charge attraction in which so4 2 played a critical role in attaching particles li et al 2021a further the dh of pristine psnps and cooh psnps was decreased while increased for n nh2 psnps and p nh2 psnps in a 10 nacl solution with the increasing ha concentration wu et al 2019 the increasing salinity can reduce the stabilizing effect of ha on nps hence despite the presence of nom nps can form robust and large aggregates in areas of higher salinity wu et al 2019 in the seawater with 35 practical salinity units psu the lys successfully adsorbed on small nps 200 nm to establish eco corona and increase their colloidal size from 485 nm to 2237 nm while failed to formulate eco corona with large nps 500 and 1000 nm dong et al 2020 however the eco corona was also observed among the large nps 500 nm and lys in the diluted seawater 3 5 psu attributed to the strong electrostatic attraction dong et al 2020 shiu et al 2020b also reported that salinity could sever as a critical factor to influence the size and number of np dom microgels e g at 17 psu the highest particle count with an increase of over 215 of dom in microgels was found in the lake and river water samples while the salinity of 34 psu resulted in only a 154 increase implying that nps and dom may interact to form large organic entities and settle down at a specific salinity and change the fate of nps in aquatic bodies the ph of the medium can impact surface charges and ionization of functional groups of plastic particles which ultimately can control the aggregation behavior of nps through electrostatic forces li et al 2018 in general the ph of a typical natural aquatic environment remains between 5 and 9 chowdhury et al 2013 an increase in the stability of psnps 100 nm and cooh psnps 303 nm was reported with an increase in ph value in nacl solution romero cano et al 2001 conversely the particle size of penps remains constant from 284 92 140 56 nm to 310 29 165 58 nm in 10 mm nacl solution at ph 5 9 attributed to the strong electrostatic repulsion forces among particles shams et al 2020 this contrasting results from different studies may be due to the difference in particle size surface chemistry and heterogeneity of the investigated nps praetorius et al 2020 here reviewed studies showed that the higher electrolyte concentration lower ionic valency and conditioning of the medium enhanced the interaction of nps with eps albeit the role of ph and salinity levels on eco corona formation not showed an obvious trend hence further studies are recommended to clarify the importance of medium properties in eps led eco corona development on nps 7 ecological implications of eco corona formation in the aquatic environment recent studies showed that eps or biomolecules encapsulate nps in the aquatic environment and modify their physicochemical properties bioreactivity and transportation through eco corona formation alimi et al 2018 galloway 2015 pulido reyes et al 2017 therefore eco corona can influence the environmental fate and bioavailability of nps and ultimately change their ecological impacts toxic and non toxic in the aquatic environment fadare et al 2020 nasser et al 2020 natarajan et al 2020 a summary of recent studies highlighting the change in toxic and non toxic implications of nps mediated by eco corona formation is presented in table 2 7 1 change in toxic impacts of nanoplastics regarding freshwater organisms several studies have been conducted on various species mainly on daphnia magna for instance the presence of nom significantly reduced the acute toxicity of nh2 psnps to daphnia magna exposed at varying treatment doses 1 400 mg l 1 and exposure duration 0 96 h due to eco corona formation although the percentage of surviving organisms was significantly increased the endocrine related genes cat gst p gp vtg and hsp70 exhibited significantly elevated expressions fadare et al 2020 in another study the presence of ha eco corona formation increases the survival rate of daphnia magna by 70 100 based on the various concentration of ha 1 50 mg l 1 and nh2 psnps 1 400 mg l 1 moreover the eco corona formation on nps induced no significant changes to the expression levels of cat gst hsp70 and p gp compared with pristine nps therefore diminishing their hazardous impacts fadare et al 2019 similarly the acute toxicity 0 96 h of bare psnps and p nh2 psnps 50 300 nm was significantly reduced in terms of the increased survival rate of daphnia magna in the presence of ha attributed to the eco corona formation and stabilizing effect of ha on negatively charged nps wu et al 2019 further saavedra et al 2019 unveiled that the eco corona formation decreased the toxicity of cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 200 nm to daphnia magna brachionus calyciflorus and thamnocephalus platyurus after exposure at various concentrations 10 400 mg l 1 for 24 96 h much higher ec50 values of nps were observed for all the three test organisms in the presence of nom highlighted the protective role of eco corona formation against nps toxicity saavedra et al 2019 conversely a recent study on daphnia magna highlighted the eco corona associated increase in the uptake and toxicity of cooh psnps and nh2 psnps 90 110 nm at relatively lower exposure concentration 0 0001 1 mg ml 1 after 24 h exposure due to eco corona formation the inefficient removal of nps from the gut of organisms and associated decrease in algal feeding rate was observed in neonates after 6 h of exposure nasser and lynch 2016 the contrasting results from these two studies on daphnia magna using the same np polymers cooh psnps and nh2 psnps could be attributed to the sources of eco corona i e proteins from manually added alginate isolated from macrocyctis pyrifera and ha isolated from the suwannee river versus proteins secreted by daphnia magna and chollera vulgaris secondly both studies used different exposure concentrations of nps and respectively elucidated acute and chronic toxicity endpoints nasser and lynch 2016 saavedra et al 2019 relatively fewer studies are available that reported the eco corona mediated change in toxic impacts of nps in marine organisms for instance a recent study reported the eps mediated eco corona significantly enhanced the cell viability and reduced the oxidative stress and membrane permeability in marine algae chlorella sp exposed to psnps natarajan et al 2020 similarly the presence of eps decreased ros generation in marine diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum exposed to a relatively high concentration 100 mg l 1 of cooh psnps 60 nm implying that eps exhibit ros scavenging properties grassi et al 2020 hence the decrease in oxidative stress and associated toxicity due to eco corona formation is generally attributed to the ros quenching potential of eps and the composition and properties of eps may change based on the sensitivity of the secreting aquatic organisms that consequently will alter their ros quenching abilities further the eco corona formation also decreases the effective surface area of nps that may play a critical role in decreasing the potential toxic impacts natarajan et al 2020 in contrast a recent in vitro study on oocytes and spermatozoa from oyster crassostrea gigas reported significantly increased ros levels in sperm cells after exposure to a high exposure concentration 100 mg l 1 of cooh psnps attributed to the attached carboxylic function group gonzález fernández et al 2018 similarly shiu et al 2020a concluded that higher concentrations 250 mg l 1 of nps 55 nm inhibited the growth of phytoplankton species and enhancing p c ratios of eps implying nps mediated higher cellular stress on phytoplanktons and secretion of protein rich eps for instance nh2 psnps mediated bio corona in haemolymph serum increased ros production cellular damage and dysregulation of p38 and mapk signaling in haemocytes of bivalve mytilus galloprovincialis while significantly less toxic impacts of nps mediate by eco corona formation were appeared in asw canesi et al 2016 in conclusion a significant fraction of reviewed studies reported a reduction in toxic impacts of nps after eco corona formation mainly attributed to the significantly decreased ros generation due to sequestration of free radicals by adsorbed biomolecules on nps however some studies have reported contrasting results i e the eco corona formation exacerbated the toxicity of nps to the aquatic organism in terms of growth inhibition increased cellular stress shiu et al 2020a lower ec50 values longer gut retention of particles altered feeding behavior nasser and lynch 2016 as well as significantly elevated expressions endocrine related genes cat gst p gp vtg and hsp70 fadare et al 2020 contrary to bio corona that mostly decreased toxicity to organisms through a reduction in surface energy of nps the eco corona may take a different course as the adsorbed eps on nps may regulate their bioreactivity and fate thereby changing the uptake retention and bioavailability to aquatic organisms which may cause an increase in toxicity therefore further in vivo and in vitro studies should be conducted to draw a concrete conclusion on the role of eco corona formation on the toxicity of nps in the aquatic environment 7 2 change in transportation and fate of nanoplastics the formation of eco corona can increase or decrease the transportation of nps in the aquatic environment for instance the bsa formed eco corona on small sized nps 200 and 500 nm through colloidal steric hindrance and decreased the aggregate size which ultimately caused an increase in the transportation of nps conversely the lys interacted with nps 200 nm via bridging effect and electrostatic adsorption resulted in the formation of large aggregates that reduce the transport of nps in the marine aquatic environment dong et al 2020 further nps interact with eps forming microscopic gels 4 6 µm that induced a significant acceleration in amphora sp while nps alone in the absence of eps caused a moderate acceleration in ankistrodesmus angustus and phaeodactylum tricornutum after 10 days of incubation implying that np eps complex formation enhanced the transportation of not only itself but also that of associated aquatic species chen et al 2011 importantly eps have been reported as the key source of nom in the marine environment and np mediated changes in eps assembly can lead to deleterious environmental impacts altering different organic carbon pools re directing the carbon flux and potentially disturbing the carbon cycle in the ocean moreover biogenic aggregates play almost similar role to that of the colloidal pump and biological pump in the vertical transportation of nps from the surface to the deep floor in the water column in the aquatic environment chen et al 2011 shiu et al 2020a demonstrated that eps acts as a tackiness agent and enhances adsorption and aggregation of plastic particles which ultimately make them sink deeper and change their fate in the marine aquatic environment summers et al 2018 also speculated that the formation of eps np agglomerates may change their sinking velocity and buoyant density in the aquatic environment based on the composition of eps and nps size in the biogenic aggregates compared to the native microgels the formation of dom psnp microgels significantly increased the particle counts from 1404 to 2035 and from 8063 to 14 128 respectively in river and lake water samples shiu et al 2020b therefore psnps interact with original unassembled polymers in the aquatic environment assisting the microgels formation further inducing the dom pom transition importantly the micro sized gel structures containing nps organic matter and other pollutants overlap with the preferred food sources for organisms at the bottom of the food chain cole et al 2013 consequently the np microgels may undergo bioaccumulation along the food chain in an organism at a higher trophic level such as invertebrates filter feeding fishes and even humans cole et al 2016 however eps mediated flocculation aggregation and sedimentation of nps in terms of eco corona can also be beneficial because this phenomenon not only servers as a trap for plastic particles but also adsorb other hazardous pollutants participating in the self cleansing capacity of aquatic bodies moreover if stable and radioactive metallic groups are attached to nps mediated eco corona they can act as useful tracers for particle and organic carbon fluxes in the aquatic environment santschi 2018 therefore nps mediated eco corona formation can influence the transportation and fate of nps through floating sinking and sedimentation in aquatic bodies hence elucidating associated potential pathways warranted further investigations 8 existing challenges and future research perspectives 8 1 clarifying the role of nanoplastic properties it is still challenging to understand the role of np properties in the formation of eco corona and how those properties influence the interactions among nps and eps so far the reviewed studies employed ps as model nps with selected functional groups cooh nh2 surface charges and sizes to decipher their interactions with eps under laboratory conditions in the natural aquatic environment primary and secondary nps are more heterogeneous exhibiting various polymer type composition shape age surface coating and aggregation state all these np properties potentially play important roles in the eco nano interface which warranted further field and experimental studies however investigating np characteristics for their role in eco nano formation could be challenging especially extrapolating results from experimental conditions to the natural environment in this case creating a model system can simplify understanding the eco nano interface similar to that previously established for bio nano interface to understand the development and structure of protein corona formation on nps and their interactions using a model cellular membrane kihara et al 2020 as shown in table 1 recent in vivo and in vitro studies employed various traditional techniques including gel electrophoresis spectroscopy and spectrometry to measure the components of eco corona results from these studies provided the baseline data in terms of composition of eco corona molecular weight or size of eps nps assembly and rarely on the impact of np surface coating and size on the composition or structure of eco corona therefore the model system coupled with computational simulation can assist to explore the role of multiple factors involved in the eco nano interface including characteristics of nps physicochemical properties of formed eco corona and attached molecules and favorable aquatic conditions for example computational modeling has been recently applied to simulate the interactions of nps with proteins predicting the change in structure and associated implications hollóczki and gehrke 2019 in the future the availability of data related to eco corona formation its composition and associated ecological implications may enable designing models based on machine learning or artificial intelligence that can predict the eco corona mediated nps behavior and toxicity and assist to optimize their environmental distribution through adsorption of selective eps that will ultimately lead to the development of eco friendly nps nasser et al 2020 8 2 undermining the importance of medium properties physicochemical characteristics of the medium such as ph temperature and ionic strength not only affect the interaction between nps and eps for eco corona development but also play important role in shaping the properties of nps such as effective charge aggregation state hydrodynamic size surface valences and dispersion in the aquatic environment gonzález fernández et al 2018 so far only the impact of salinity ph and different electrolytes on nps mediated eco corona formation have been studied section 6 3 while the role of other influencing factors such as temperature conductivity divalent cations etc warranted further investigations 8 3 uncertainties in ecological impacts regarding the ecological implications of eco corona reviewed literature showed discrepancies in results in terms of either increased or decreased toxic and non toxic impacts in the aquatic environment table 2 previous studies have shown both increase or decrease in ros generation survival rate and bioavailability of nps to aquatic organisms mediated by eco corona formation therefore it s important to unveil physicochemical properties complete profile and bioreactivity of eco corona and its impacts on bioavailability and fate of nps in the aquatic environment currently most of the existing studies were based on laboratory experiments that used organism secreted eps artificially added nom and model proteins to highlight eco corona formation on nps therefore the composition of the corona was either comprised of added nom or rarely reported the complex assembly of eps such as dna carbohydrates functional proteins long chain organic acids polysaccharide rich compounds and glycoprotein biopolymer table 1 therefore future studies should consider unveiling other important elements of eco corona such as its morphology type of attached eps distinguish between soft and hard eco corona and structure of participating eps e g secondary or quaternary proteins as the natural aquatic environment contains a variety of organisms that secrete a cocktail of eps that co occurs with other anthropogenic chemicals including nps therefore studies should consider both eps and anthropogenic chemicals in the aquatic environment for their possible role in the eco corona formation and associated toxicological implications further it is yet to define if the size of formed eco corona has a direct impact on the toxicological impacts of nps due to the small size and trojan horse effect nps are more elusive to biological defense barriers and observed more toxic than mps in a biological system kihara et al 2020 therefore studies should be conducted to elucidate the impact of the size of eco corona biomolecules determining the nps ecotoxicity starting from the large nom fractions to proteins and polysaccharides and the smallest of the small molecules such as metabolites 8 4 recommendations for future nanotoxicity testing recently the inclusion of the eco corona concept in nanotoxicity testing is highly encouraged to obtain ecologically rational results nasser et al 2020 it is worth mentioning here that the type sensitivity feeding behavior and microbiome of organisms all can influence the secretion of eps and ultimately regulate the nature and composition of formed eco corona and associated ecological implications contrary to bio corona in the cellular environment in which proteins drive nps to adsorb on specific receptors result in toxicity reduction through a decrease in surface energy of nps the eco corona may act differently as the adsorbed biomolecules on the surface of nps drive their fate and bioreactivity thereby changing their uptake and retention in aquatic organisms which may cause an increase in toxicity therefore the toxicity testing on aquatic organism should consider the presence of secreted biomolecules which is more dynamic and closer to environmentally relevant conditions as compared to the static conditions suggested in the oecd toxicity testing considering such factors are critically important for in depth mechanistic toxicity investigations elucidating genes or proteins expressions and response of signaling pathways to ensure that such impacts of nps are ecologically relevant 9 conclusion this review summarized the documented studies highlighting the eco corona formation on nps and associated ecological implications in the aquatic environment in the aquatic environment nps are encapsulated by eco corona comprised of secreted biomolecules including dna proteins and carbohydrates as well as of allochthonous compounds such as ha and fa the eco corona formation is influenced by various factors such as characteristics of nps properties of eps and physicochemical parameters of the aquatic environment the formed eco corona altered surface charge size stability and other physicochemical properties of nps and ultimately their bioreactivity bioavailability and ecological implications importantly most of the existing studies were based on laboratory experiments and therefore used model nps that could be significantly different from those in the environment exhibiting various shapes polymers and functionals groups similarly artificially added nom or model proteins were used in most of the studies and rarely organism secreted eps to highlight eco corona formation therefore field studies are highly recommended to understand the nexus among eco corona and nps and their ecological implication in water bodies further it is a huge challenge yet to develop an integrated technique for the measurement of both nps and eco corona formation in the natural aquatic environment however the available studies have comprehensively demonstrated that the eco corona formation can alter the ecological implications of nps albeit it s yet to define the reasons behind the discrepancies in the findings of the available studies lastly continuing studies are mandatory to understand the role of eco corona in defining the np interactions with biological fractions in aquatic ecosystems declaration of

16827,self supply is a ubiquitous response by households to the public water supply inadequacies found worldwide self supply is invested in and managed by an individual household accessible on premises and unregulated vulnerability to faecal contamination is a concern due to reliance on low cost technologies and shallow groundwater this review aims to evaluate the evidence base on the safety of groundwater self supply in low and middle income countries in relation to faecal contamination differences in microbial water quality between source types settings countries and ownership were investigated a search of peer reviewed studies in low and middle income countries was conducted in online databases including pubmed web of science proquest and environmental complete studies were included if they had sufficient detail about the water samples to be related to groundwater self supply contained extractable data on faecal indicator bacteria fib including thermotolerant coliform or escherichia coli and were published in english between 1990 and april 2020 a total of 30 studies were included resulting in 100 datasets and 26 981 water samples across the studies fib were present in 36 self supply samples the odds of fib being detected was significantly higher for unimproved sources or 8 19 95 ci 4 04 16 59 p 0 001 and for sources in low income countries or 3 85

test found no evidence of small study publication bias for self supply compared to public supply no evidence of bias due to lack of randomization or season was found but study design and quality could potentially bias the results to achieve sustainable development goal 6 1 on safe drinking water for all more attention is needed from governments to engage with self supply and formulate balanced policy responses graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords self supply faecal contamination groundwater private water supply sdg water quality 1 introduction sustainable development goal sdg 6 1 calls for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 to meet the criteria of a safely managed drinking water service households must use an improved water source that is accessible on premises sufficiently available when needed and free from faecal and chemical contamination who and unicef 2017 an improved water facility includes sources that are protected from outside contamination by nature of their construction such as boreholes protected dug wells or rainwater harvesting who and unicef 2017 although billions of people have gained access to basic water services and much progress has been made towards reaching sdg 6 1 more extensive efforts are needed to fully realize the sdg ambition to achieve universal access for all in 2017 more than 2 2 billion people still lacked access to a safely managed water service who and unicef 2021 the lack of access to safe drinking water is felt disproportionately by disadvantaged community groups who and unicef 2019 household self supply has become essential for people who are beyond the reach of utility or community managed water supplies and for those who need to complement an inadequate supply grönwall et al 2010 self supply is a service delivery model usually relying on groundwater or rainwater it is characterized as an on premises water supply that is invested in and maintained by a household and therefore based on affordable technologies grönwall and danert 2020 self supply exists all over the world in both rural and urban settings one third of the total urban population in continental africa are likely to rely on self supply chávez garcía silva et al 2020 in asia pacific over 700 million people depend on self supply across rural and urban areas foster et al 2021 rural areas with low population density are often difficult or expensive to reach with public or centralised water supply systems adeniji oloukoi et al 2013 allen et al 2006 sutton 2009 in urban areas cities are expanding rapidly so that individual households in outskirts choose to go off grid and organize their own drinking water access when there is no reliable and convenient public supply grönwall 2016 grönwall and danert 2020 komakech and de bont 2018 kulabako et al 2010 liddle et al 2016 self supply has the potential to provide a safely managed water service as it is located on the premises of a user household however self supply services are generally unregulated and unmonitored grönwall and danert 2020 grönwall et al 2010 therefore little is known about the extent to which self supply provides drinking water that is free from contamination and poor water quality and its associated health risks remain a prime concern sutton 2009 many self supply services rely on shallow groundwater sources which are highly vulnerable to contamination from human activities grönwall et al 2010 moreover groundwater self supply often relies on simple construction and lifting technologies faecal contamination from various sources such as sanitation systems solid waste dumps household sullage stormwater drains and animals also poses a risk argoss 2001 contamination of drinking water constitutes a major burden on public health in low income countries due to water related disease such as diarrhoeal diseases bain et al 2014b the world health organization who drinking water guidelines include criteria for assessing health risks and setting targets for improving water safety who 2011 the recommended measure for assessing faecal contamination by the who is the presence of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli or alternatively thermotolerant coliform ttc who and unicef 2010 the concentration of faecal indicator bacteria is suggested to be an indicator of health risks however fib are imperfect in representing risk and monitoring is required that goes beyond the single measurements of indicators or contaminants to interpreting health hazards charles et al 2020 nevertheless even using imperfect methods there is an urgent need to understand and address the risks and benefits related to self supply in order to guide policy and practice towards safely managed services that meet the needs of disadvantaged populations this systematic review with meta analysis aims to provide insight on the safety of groundwater self supply in lmic regarding faecal contamination amongst selected studies this study seeks to understand the extent to which groundwater self supply is free from faecal contamination and addresses three research questions 1 to what extent is groundwater self supply contaminated with fib in lmic 2 how does faecal contamination vary between source types countries rural and urban areas seasons and study designs 3 how does self supply compare to public supply in terms of faecal contamination the focus of the study is self supply based on groundwater sources further the literature review focuses on microbial water quality as reported by fib 2 methods the systematic review of studies including faecal contamination of groundwater self supply in lmics was conducted according to the prisma guidelines moher et al 2009 methods for search strategy study eligibility and data extraction were adapted from bain et al 2014b and are described in the protocol s1 2 1 search strategy studies were identified from peer reviewed literature online databases were searched including pubmed web of science proquest and environmental complete search terms regarding water quality were combined with self supply terms and restricted to lmics using a list of country names bain et al 2014b searches were conducted between april and june 2020 2 2 eligibility and selection studies were included in the review provided they i

investigate the influence of source type on water quality each type of water source was recorded and matched with the corresponding joint monitoring programme jmp source definition and classified as improved or unimproved who and unicef 2017 groundwater sources from studies that did not distinguish between protected and unprotected wells were categorised as unclassified dug well groundwater sources that did not distinguish between borehole and dug wells were categorised as unclassified 2 4 study quality and risk of bias each study was rated for quality based on a quality score between 0 and 10 for specified criteria table 1 quality criteria are based on those used by bain et al 2014b quality control criteria extracted included information on the selection selection described

and lower quality was determined by the median of quality scores of the studies no study was excluded based on a low quality score study designs were identified and categorized as either cross sectional longitudinal study 6 months cohort intervention or diagnostic study the influence of study design and quality on bias between studies was investigated using meta regression with study design type and quality criteria as subgroups as described in the analysis section 2 5 3 between study analysis 2 5 analysis 2 5 1 data for analysis only studies reporting noncompliance results were used for meta analysis measures of central tendency from studies were not included in the meta analysis because of limited reporting for studies reporting both e coli and ttc data only the e coli results were used for studies reporting summarised results from sub results only the sub results were used for studies which assessed water quality at both source and point of use only results from the water source were included in the analysis for the intervention study only the dataset several years after the emergency event and intervention was used for analysis ali et al 2019 2 5 2 qualitative synthesis to qualitatively assess the proportion of studies reporting frequent and high levels of microbial contamination cumulative density functions cdfs of the proportion of samples with 1 fib per 100 ml and 100 fib per 100 ml were plotted for each water source type using the ggplot2 function in the statistical analysis software rstudio version 1 2 5001 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria results of unclassified water sources were not included in the cdfs fib concentrations from datasets reporting results in risk classification were plotted using microsoft office excel 2016 the extent of fib contamination of self supply was calculated based on the included datasets used for meta analysis 2 5 3 between study analysis to investigate heterogeneity between studies in faecal contamination random effects meta regression was used to test a priori defined subgroups such as setting season source type and other study characteristics as possible explanations continuity correction of 0 5 was employed in microsoft office excel 2016 for proportions of 0 or 1 sweeting et al 2004 for studies with zero positive samples 0 5 was substituted for the number of positive samples and for studies where all samples were positive 0 5 was subtracted from the total number of positive samples the metafor package in the statistical analysis software r version 1 2 5001 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria was used for meta regression viechtbauer 2010 a logit transformation for the analysis of proportion was applied to the proportion of samples with 1 fib per 100 ml and 100 fib per 100 ml using the escalc function to compare the faecal contamination with the defined subgroups random effects pooled odds ratio were calculated using the rma function the dersimonian laird estimator was used to estimate the amount of heterogeneity dersimonian and laird 1986 2 5 4 within study analysis studies that included extractable water quality data from both self supply and public water sources were combined using meta analysis with the odds ratio as the effect measure to compare the faecal contamination based on the proportion of samples 1 fib per 100 ml pooled estimates were calculated using the escalc and rma function in the r metafor package heterogeneity was estimated using higgins i2 higgins and thompson 2002 here heterogeneity refers to the variation in faecal contamination levels between the studies forest plots were created using the forest function for self supply compared to public water sources self supply compared to public piped water sources and improved self supply water sources compared to improved public water sources the influence of small study bias was assessed with the funnel plot method and egger s regression test for odds ratio and standard error using the funnel rma and regtest functions egger et al 1997 3 results 3 1 search results in total 677 records were identified through database searches and additional three reports through snowball searching fig 1 most studies were excluded because water sources were not related to self supply or there were no extractable e coli or ttc data several studies did not mention the ownership of the water source or did not differentiate the fib results between public and self owned water sources an adequate description of the water source to allow them to be matched to the jmp source was missing in numerous studies for example some studies described water sources as wells but did not provide information about the construction e g protected or unprotected dug well in total 30 studies were incorporated in the review resulting in 100 datasets and 26 981 water samples tables 2 and s2 3 2 study characteristics characteristics of the included studies are presented

results in fib risk classifications showed that fib were detected in all datasets n 22 and exceeded levels of 50 and 100 fib per 100 ml in 95 of the datasets although the proportion of samples in which fib were detected were higher for unimproved sources such as unprotected dug wells samples from improved sources such as boreholes still exceeded levels of 100 fib per 100 ml in nine of ten datasets samples from protected dug wells exceeded levels of 50 fib per 100 ml in both of the datasets the results are in agreement with a comparison to cdfs by source type showing a similar pattern to those from the fib risk classification figs 2 and s6 fib were detected in a lower proportion of samples from boreholes and in a higher proportion of samples in unprotected and protected dug wells 3

significantly higher likelihood of fib contamination was found for self supply water sources compared to public water sources meta analysis of studies containing water quality fib data from both self

other improved public sources and included only one unimproved water source for a small number of studies the or was smaller than one indicating that in some settings self supplied water is less likely to contain fib than the public water sources ejechi and ejechi 2008 when comparing improved self supply sources with improved public sources odds of faecal contamination were again higher for

contaminated with fib meta analysis between studies demonstrated that unimproved groundwater self supply i e unprotected dug wells was more likely to be contaminated with fib than improved sources such as boreholes or protected dug wells or 8 19 95 ci 4 04 16 59 p 0 001 likewise cdfs and fib risk classification showed more frequent fib contamination for unimproved self supply sources these findings are consistent with previous analysis of microbial contamination in groundwater sources more broadly bain et al 2014b nonetheless faecal contamination was still frequently reported for self supply in the form of boreholes 28 of samples and protected dug wells 77 of samples suggesting well protection alone does not fully address water quality problems for self supply sources even with protection self supply systems often rely on low cost technologies and construction techniques and draw on shallow groundwater sources which may make them vulnerable to contamination from human activities grönwall and danert 2020 however previous studies have found similarly widespread fib contamination for boreholes and protected wells generally bain et al 2014b and so these water quality risks are not necessarily unique to self supply the reviewed studies reported a range faecal contamination risks including on site sanitation systems and poor well condition however few studies rigorously assessed contamination pathways sanitary risk inspections are recommended by the who drinking water guidelines as a technique to identify poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation as potential risks of faecal contamination who 2011 less than half of the reviewed studies conducted sanitary inspections n 12 40 and only three of the reviewed studies conducted sanitary risk inspections according to the who guidelines kumpel et al 2017 luby et al 2008 vaccari et al 2010 limited data are available on the relationship between contamination of self supply and sanitary score suggesting more research is needed to identify important sanitary risk factors this study provides evidence that risk of faecal contamination of groundwater self supply varies across contexts microbial water quality was highly heterogeneous i2 90 9 between studies with higher risk of faecal contamination in low income settings or 3 85 95 ci 1 85 7 69 p 0 001 while bain et al 2014a found rural water sources were at higher risk of contamination between study analysis of self supply sources did not find a significant difference in the odds of contamination for rural versus urban locations the heterogeneity observed may reflect a diversity of environmental conditions and possible contamination sources including on site sanitation díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 kumpel et al 2017 2016 martínez santos et al 2017 ngasala et al 2019 or poor condition of wells and inadequate protection ali et al 2019 butterworth et al 2013 knappett et al 2013 maccarthy et al 2013 vaccari et al 2010 the variety of self supply sources in purpose and form along with the different risks and benefits in different contexts means that government policies regulation and support need to be designed to meet a range of local conditions sutton and butterworth 2021 meta analysis demonstrated that faecal contamination was less common in piped water even when self supply was improved piped water was still less likely to be contaminated fig 3 these results suggest that in general households should be encouraged and supported to switch to piped supply where possible however this differential does not always hold with ejechi and ejechi 2008 reporting significantly lower odds of e coli contamination in borehole water as compared to piped water in urban nigeria it should be considered that faecal contamination affects all types of water sources including piped water bain et al 2014a 2014b due to the limited number of studies that included both self supply and communal groundwater sources it was not possible to draw conclusions from the meta analysis on whether the likelihood of contamination differs between self supplied and communal groundwater sources notably some studies showed that in areas where piped systems provide safer water there were households that still preferred to self supply their drinking water further research is needed to understand why in some contexts households might prefer self supply over piped water and how these preferences vary across different contexts possible reasons why people may prefer self supply over piped water include convenience and reduced travel time to collect water compared with public taps increased water availability where piped systems provide an intermittent supply organoleptic properties and enhanced status and reputation capstick et al 2017 sutton and butterworth 2021 in areas where piped networks are not possible supporting households to invest in safer forms of self supply could reduce the risk of faecal contamination piped systems are not always feasible particularly in sparsely populated rural areas and self supply may provide a critical stepping stone or stopgap for households the meta analysis indicated significantly lower risk of contamination for improved sources compared with unimproved sources similarly boreholes were significantly less likely to be contaminated than both protected dug wells and unprotected wells where piped services remain infeasible policy and practice should look to support investments in safer forms of self supply for example an incremental approach to self supply source protection has been implemented in parts of rural africa butterworth et al 2013 sutton 2011 the results of the meta analysis may reflect socio economic inequalities on a broad scale the meta analysis reveals that the risk of contaminated self supply is higher in low income countries on a local scale self supply is often seen as a result of socio economic inequality linked to a lack of water service expansion or poor service quality for the poorest furlong and kooy 2017 hadipuro 2010 kooy et al 2018 kurniasih 2008 moreover the poorest may be less able to invest in safer forms of self supply and may be more reliant on shallow groundwater that is vulnerable to contamination thus there is a need for reliable provision of piped services and inclusive approaches to increase equity of access financing strategies for water quality improvements through source protection and household water treatment could also help address these inequalities sutton and butterworth 2021 notwithstanding water quality concerns availability and reliability of water is an important consideration when evaluating the role of self supply in securing water for domestic needs water from self supply can be used for different purposes beyond just drinking including productive uses and can supplement other sources that might provide higher quality water for drinking for example a study in kenya reports that residents use private hand dug wells that provide substantial volumes of water for purposes other than drinking and cooking okotto et al 2015 when considering to what extent self supply water is available in sufficient quantities when needed it is important to factor in different water uses there is also evidence to suggest in certain contexts self supply can be more reliable than public sources butterworth et al 2013 foster et al 2018 investing in self supply and being the primary beneficiary are seen as powerful motivators to ensure systems are sustained sutton and butterworth 2021 a limitation of the meta analysis is the variability in study design reported by the included papers studies were combined that used e coli and ttc as a faecal indicator and studies reported different handling and microbiological analytical methods meta analysis showed significantly higher odds of faecal contamination for studies measuring ttc as compared to e coli or 1 92 95 ci 1 09 3 38 p 0 025 moreover fib whether ttc or e coli are an indicator for faecal contamination and the presence or absence of fib does not definitively confirm the presence or absence of pathogens charles et al 2020 further only one third of the reviewed studies n 11 tested the water quality considering both seasons to ensure water safety infrequent testing of water for fib and subsequent interpretation of the health hazard is not sufficient to identify and manage risks the quality of the included studies was mixed in the included studies sample selection was often not described representative or randomized and quality control was not often mentioned method and sampling was mostly described however handling minimum criteria was only reported to be met by 63 of the studies studies with a lower quality ranking score reported significantly higher odds of faecal contamination and thus might have caused bias meta analysis resulted in significantly higher odds for fib positive samples in cross sectional studies or 4 22 95 ci 2 43 7 34 p 0 001 one possible explanation is that cross sectional studies were more likely to be conducted in low income countries it is also important to note that study sites may have been biased towards locations where faecal contamination of groundwater supplies is perceived to be a problem this could lead to an overestimation of the extent of faecal contamination in self supply sources the review revealed a relatively small number of studies that have examined microbial quality of self supplied groundwater in low and middle income countries within those studies that were identified very few have rigorously assessed the links between groundwater quality and contamination risks there is a need to understand water quality and associated contamination risks of self supply services specifically further studies included in this review focused on measuring water quality at source neglecting the point of use there is also a lack of information regarding management storage and treatment practices in households using groundwater self supply water services and how it relates to the water quality at point of use it is known that the quality of water from improved sources deteriorates significantly after collection due to different factors such as water storage conditions and post handling practices and is not necessarily safe at point of use clasen and bastable 2003 gundry et al 2006 lechevallier et al 1996 mcguinness et al 2020 meierhofer et al 2018 shaheed et al 2014 shields et al 2015 trevett et al 2005 wright et al 2004 considering water quality of self supply at point of use is crucial since self supply is on premises and transport distribution and storage practices might differ from other water supply types there is a need to understand water management and treatment practices of self supply users as well as assessing the microbial water quality at point of use during distribution storage and before consumption studies also rarely compared self supply sources with alternative public service delivery models which is crucial to evaluate risk and benefits of self supply as a potential service delivery model more research is needed in different contexts to understand how self supply compares to public water sources self supply is largely unmonitored and unregulated and hence the quality of self supplied water has been rarely if ever systematically tracked this has direct implications for monitoring progress towards sdg target 6 1 universal access to safely managed water services self supplied water is accessible on premises and hence may contribute to one part of a country s safely managed water statistic however in many countries the data used to inform the free from contamination dimension are derived from utilities providing a treated piped supply to households who unicef 2018 according to who and unicef 2018 water quality data for piped supplies is applied towards the entire population using improved supplies as long as the population to which the data relate is at least 80 of the population of interest when deriving national estimates the joint monitoring programme treats the safely managed water criteria independently with the minimum value across the three indicators used to estimate the proportion of the population using a safely managed water service who 2017 thus if self supply counts towards the on premises criterion but is excluded from the free from contamination calculation it could lead to an overestimation in the proportion of households that truly have access to safely managed water services the incorporation of water quality testing into nationally representative surveys e g multiple indicator cluster surveys that cover all types of water sources including self supply is one way in which this bias can be addressed policy and practice need to respond to water quality concerns of self supply government and non governmental support for household investment in safer forms of self supply can improve the quality and sustainability of self supply sutton and butterworth 2021 self supply should be considered in water safety planning including necessary parts such as promotion of household water treatment and hygienic practices where piped networks are feasible governments need to weigh the cost benefit of supporting self supply improvements with expansion and improvement of piped water supplies the scale of continued investment in self supply highlights the need for policymakers to consider regulatory and monitoring systems for self supply fischer et al 2020 5 conclusion this literature review and meta analysis demonstrated that groundwater self supply in lmics often contains fib with contamination in 36 of samples across the included studies unimproved self supply sources had more frequent and higher levels of faecal contamination than improved sources while faecal contamination was more likely in self supply than in piped water sources where piped systems are not feasible supporting households to invest in safer forms of self supply could reduce the risk of faecal contamination self supply

16827,self supply is a ubiquitous response by households to the public water supply inadequacies found worldwide self supply is invested in and managed by an individual household accessible on premises and unregulated vulnerability to faecal contamination is a concern due to reliance on low cost technologies and shallow groundwater this review aims to evaluate the evidence base on the safety of groundwater self supply in low and middle income countries in relation to faecal contamination differences in microbial water quality between source types settings countries and ownership were investigated a search of peer reviewed studies in low and middle income countries was conducted in online databases including pubmed web of science proquest and environmental complete studies were included if they had sufficient detail about the water samples to be related to groundwater self supply contained extractable data on faecal indicator bacteria fib including thermotolerant coliform or escherichia coli and were published in english between 1990 and april 2020 a total of 30 studies were included resulting in 100 datasets and 26 981 water samples across the studies fib were present in 36 self supply samples the odds of fib being detected was significantly higher for unimproved sources or 8 19 95 ci 4 04 16 59 p 0 001 and for sources in low income countries or 3 85

test found no evidence of small study publication bias for self supply compared to public supply no evidence of bias due to lack of randomization or season was found but study design and quality could

sdg 6 1 calls for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 to meet the criteria of a safely managed drinking water service households must use an improved water source that is accessible on premises sufficiently available when needed and free from faecal and chemical contamination who and unicef 2017 an improved water facility includes sources that are protected from outside contamination by nature of their construction such as boreholes protected dug wells or rainwater harvesting who and unicef 2017 although billions of people have gained access to basic water services and much progress has been made towards reaching sdg 6 1 more extensive efforts are needed to fully realize the sdg ambition to achieve universal access for all in 2017 more than 2 2 billion people still lacked access to a safely managed water service who and unicef 2021 the lack of access to safe drinking water is felt disproportionately by disadvantaged community groups who and unicef 2019 household self supply has become essential for people who are beyond the reach of utility or community managed water supplies and for those who need to complement an inadequate supply grönwall et al 2010 self supply is a service delivery model usually relying on groundwater or rainwater it is characterized as an on premises water supply that is invested in and maintained by a household and therefore based on affordable technologies grönwall and danert 2020 self supply exists all over the world in both rural and urban settings one third of the total urban population in continental africa are likely to rely on self supply chávez garcía silva et al 2020 in asia pacific over 700 million people depend on self supply across rural and urban areas foster et al 2021 rural areas with low population density are often difficult or expensive to reach with public or centralised water supply systems adeniji oloukoi et al 2013 allen et al 2006 sutton 2009 in urban areas cities are expanding rapidly so that individual households in outskirts choose to go off grid and organize their own drinking water access when there is no reliable and convenient public supply grönwall 2016 grönwall and danert 2020 komakech and de bont 2018 kulabako et al 2010 liddle et al 2016 self supply has the potential to provide a safely managed water service as it is located on the premises of a user household however self supply services are generally unregulated and unmonitored grönwall and danert 2020 grönwall et al 2010 therefore little is known about the extent to which self supply provides drinking water that is free from contamination and poor water quality and its associated health risks remain a prime concern sutton 2009 many self supply services rely on shallow groundwater sources which are highly vulnerable to contamination from human activities grönwall et al 2010 moreover groundwater self supply often relies on simple construction and lifting technologies faecal contamination from various sources such as sanitation systems solid waste dumps household sullage stormwater drains and animals also poses a risk argoss 2001 contamination of drinking water constitutes a major burden on public health in low income countries due to water related disease such as diarrhoeal diseases bain et al 2014b the world health organization who drinking water guidelines include criteria for assessing health risks and setting targets for improving water safety who 2011 the recommended measure for assessing faecal contamination by the who is the presence of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli or alternatively thermotolerant coliform ttc who and unicef 2010 the concentration of faecal indicator bacteria is suggested to be an indicator of health risks however fib are imperfect in representing risk and monitoring is required that goes beyond the single measurements of indicators or contaminants to interpreting health hazards charles et al 2020 nevertheless even using imperfect methods there is an urgent need to understand and address the risks and benefits related to self supply in order to guide policy and practice towards safely managed services that meet the needs of disadvantaged populations this systematic review with meta analysis aims to provide insight on the safety of groundwater self supply in lmic regarding faecal contamination amongst selected studies this study seeks to understand the extent to which groundwater self supply is free from faecal contamination and addresses three research questions 1 to what extent is groundwater self supply contaminated with fib in lmic 2 how does faecal contamination vary between source types countries rural and urban areas seasons and study designs 3 how does self supply compare to public supply in terms of faecal contamination the focus of the study is self supply based on groundwater sources further the literature review focuses on microbial water quality as reported by fib 2 methods the systematic review of studies including faecal contamination of groundwater self supply in lmics was conducted according to the prisma guidelines moher et al 2009 methods for search strategy study eligibility and data extraction were adapted from bain et al 2014b and are described in the protocol s1 2 1 search strategy studies were identified from peer reviewed literature online databases were searched including pubmed web of science proquest and environmental complete search terms regarding water quality were combined with self supply terms and restricted to lmics using a list of country names bain et al 2014b searches were conducted between april and june 2020 2 2 eligibility and selection studies were included in the review provided they i had sufficient detail about the water samples to be related to self supply groundwater sources ii contained extractable data on ttc or e coli iii were published between 1990 and april 2020 iv included at least 10 separate water samples v fell into the classification of lmic world bank 2020 and vi were published in english studies were selected by screening of titles and abstracts followed by screening of full texts for selected studies duplicates were identified and removed 2 3 data extraction and matching basic descriptive data from eligible studies e g author year of publication water quality information and additional study characteristics thought to influence water quality were extracted into a microsoft office excel 2016 spreadsheet s2 where possible the following water quality information for each source type in the studies were extracted non compliance presence of e coli or ttc mean geometric mean and or median level of contamination e coli or ttc per 100 ml standard

method used to detect faecal indicator bacteria to explore the influence of seasons those studies that refer to water quality during wet rainy or dry periods or equivalent were recorded the country income group was identified as low lower middle and upper middle income using the world bank classification world bank 2020 where possible level of urbanization was identified as urban or rural to investigate the influence of source type on water quality each type of water source was recorded and matched with the corresponding joint monitoring programme jmp source definition and classified as improved or unimproved who and unicef 2017 groundwater sources from studies that did not distinguish between protected and unprotected wells were categorised as unclassified dug well groundwater sources that did not distinguish between borehole and dug wells were categorised as unclassified 2 4 study quality and risk of bias each study was rated for quality based on a quality score between 0 and 10 for specified criteria table 1 quality criteria are based on those used by bain et al 2014b quality control criteria extracted included information on the selection selection described

and lower quality was determined by the median of quality scores of the studies no study was excluded based on a low quality score study designs were identified and categorized as either cross sectional longitudinal study 6 months cohort intervention or diagnostic study the influence of study design and quality on bias between studies was investigated using meta regression with study design type and quality criteria as subgroups as described in the analysis section 2 5 3 between study analysis 2 5 analysis 2 5 1 data for analysis only studies reporting noncompliance results were used for meta analysis measures of central tendency from studies were not included in the meta analysis because of limited reporting for studies reporting both e coli and ttc data only the e coli results were used for studies reporting summarised results from sub results only the sub results were used for studies which assessed water quality at both source and point of use only results from the water source were included in the analysis for the intervention study only the dataset several years after the emergency event and intervention was used for analysis ali et al 2019 2 5 2 qualitative synthesis to qualitatively assess the proportion of studies reporting frequent and high levels of microbial contamination cumulative density functions cdfs of the proportion of samples with 1 fib per 100 ml and 100 fib per 100 ml were plotted for each water source type using the ggplot2 function in the statistical analysis software rstudio version 1 2 5001 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria results of unclassified water sources were not included in the cdfs fib concentrations from datasets reporting results in risk classification were plotted using microsoft office excel 2016 the extent of fib contamination of self supply was calculated based on the included datasets used for meta analysis 2 5 3 between study analysis to investigate heterogeneity between studies in faecal contamination random effects meta regression was used to test a priori defined subgroups such as setting season source type and other study characteristics as possible explanations continuity correction of 0 5 was employed in microsoft office excel 2016 for proportions of 0 or 1 sweeting et al 2004 for studies with zero positive samples 0 5 was substituted for the number of positive samples and for studies where all samples were positive 0 5 was subtracted from the total number of positive samples the metafor package in the statistical analysis software r version 1 2 5001 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria was used for meta regression viechtbauer 2010 a logit transformation for the analysis of proportion was applied to the proportion of samples with 1 fib per 100 ml and 100 fib per 100 ml using the escalc function to compare the faecal contamination with the defined subgroups random effects pooled odds ratio were calculated using the rma function the dersimonian laird estimator was used to estimate the amount of heterogeneity dersimonian and laird 1986 2 5 4 within study analysis studies that included extractable water quality data from both self supply and public water sources were combined using meta analysis with the odds ratio as the effect measure to compare the faecal contamination based on the proportion of samples 1 fib per 100 ml pooled estimates were calculated using the escalc and rma function in the r metafor package heterogeneity was estimated using higgins i2 higgins and thompson 2002 here heterogeneity refers to the variation in faecal contamination levels between the studies forest plots were created using the forest function for self supply compared to public water sources self supply compared to public piped water sources and improved self supply water sources compared to improved public water sources the influence of small study bias was assessed with the funnel plot method and egger s regression test for odds ratio and standard error using the funnel rma and regtest functions egger et al 1997 3 results 3 1 search results in total 677 records were identified through database searches and additional three reports through snowball searching fig 1 most studies were excluded because water sources were not related to self supply or there were no extractable e coli or ttc data several studies did not mention the ownership of the water source or did not differentiate the fib results between public and self owned water sources an adequate description of the water source to allow them to be matched to the jmp source was missing in numerous studies for example some studies described water sources as wells but did not provide information about the construction e g protected or unprotected dug well

npos 5066 from self supply sources including 28 of samples npos 1973 from boreholes 77 of samples npos 143 from protected dug wells and 81 of samples npos 777 from unprotected wells studies reporting results in fib risk classifications showed that fib were detected in all datasets n 22 and exceeded levels of 50 and 100 fib per 100 ml in 95 of the datasets although the proportion of samples in which fib were detected were higher for unimproved sources such as unprotected dug wells samples from improved sources such as boreholes still exceeded levels of 100 fib per 100 ml in nine of ten datasets samples from protected dug wells exceeded levels of 50 fib per 100 ml in both of the datasets the results are in agreement with a comparison to cdfs by source type showing a similar pattern to those from the fib risk classification figs 2 and s6 fib were detected in a lower proportion of samples from boreholes and in a higher proportion of samples in unprotected and protected dug wells 3

classified as unimproved were significantly more likely to be contaminated with fib than improved sources or 8 19 95 ci 4 04 16 59 p 0 001 table 4 the odds of microbial contamination were 9 18 times

significantly higher likelihood of fib contamination was found for self supply water sources compared to public water sources meta analysis of studies containing water quality fib data from both self supply and alternative public sources showed that self supply is more likely to be contaminated pooled or 3 29 95 ci 1 79 6 04 p 0 001 fig 3 and table 5 heterogeneity was high i2 90 9 indicating that contamination varies across settings similarly comparing self supply with piped public sources indicated that self supply was more likely to be contaminated than public piped sources pooled or 3 45 95

other improved public sources and included only one unimproved water source for a small number of studies the or was smaller than one indicating that in some settings self supplied water is less likely to contain fib than the public water sources ejechi and ejechi 2008 when comparing improved self supply sources with improved public sources odds of faecal contamination were again higher for self supply or 3 55 95 ci 1 46 8 66 p 0 005 i2 77 8 fig 3 3 6 assessment of bias egger s test found no evidence of small study publication bias for the meta analysis of self supply compared to

significantly higher odds of fib detection for cross sectional studies or 4 22 95 ci 2 43 7 34 p 0 001 4 discussion this systematic review of studies shows groundwater self supply in lmics is commonly contaminated with fib meta analysis between studies demonstrated that unimproved groundwater self supply i e unprotected dug wells was more likely to be contaminated with fib than improved sources such as boreholes or protected dug wells or 8 19 95 ci 4 04 16 59 p 0 001 likewise cdfs and fib risk classification showed more frequent fib contamination for unimproved self supply sources these findings are consistent with previous analysis of microbial contamination in groundwater sources more broadly bain et al 2014b nonetheless faecal contamination was still frequently reported for self supply in the form of boreholes 28 of samples and protected dug wells 77 of samples suggesting well protection alone does not fully address water quality problems for self supply sources even with protection self supply systems often rely on low cost technologies and construction techniques and draw on shallow groundwater sources which may make them vulnerable to contamination from human activities grönwall and danert 2020 however previous studies have found similarly widespread fib contamination for boreholes and protected wells generally bain et al 2014b and so these water quality risks are not necessarily unique to self supply the reviewed studies reported a range faecal contamination risks including on site sanitation systems and poor well condition however few studies rigorously assessed contamination pathways sanitary risk inspections are recommended by the who drinking water guidelines as a technique to identify poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation as potential risks of faecal contamination who 2011 less than half of the reviewed studies conducted sanitary inspections n 12 40 and only three of the reviewed studies conducted sanitary risk inspections according to the who guidelines kumpel et al 2017 luby et al 2008 vaccari et al 2010 limited data are available on the relationship between contamination of self supply and sanitary score suggesting more research is needed to identify important sanitary risk factors this study provides evidence that risk of faecal contamination of groundwater self supply varies across contexts microbial water quality was highly heterogeneous i2 90 9 between studies with higher risk of faecal contamination in low income settings or 3 85 95 ci 1 85 7 69 p 0 001 while bain et al 2014a found rural water sources were at higher risk of contamination between study analysis of self supply sources did not find a significant difference in the odds of contamination for rural versus urban locations the heterogeneity observed may reflect a diversity of environmental conditions and possible contamination sources including on site sanitation díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 kumpel et al 2017 2016 martínez santos et al 2017 ngasala et al 2019 or poor condition of wells and inadequate protection ali et al 2019 butterworth et al 2013 knappett et al 2013 maccarthy et al 2013 vaccari et al 2010 the variety of self supply sources in purpose and form along with the different risks and benefits in different contexts means that government policies regulation and support need to be designed to meet a range of local conditions sutton and butterworth 2021 meta analysis demonstrated that faecal contamination was less common in piped water even when self supply was improved piped water was still less likely to be contaminated fig 3 these results suggest that in general households should be encouraged and supported to switch to piped supply where possible however this differential does not always hold with ejechi and ejechi 2008 reporting significantly lower odds of e coli contamination in borehole water as compared to piped water in urban nigeria it should be considered that faecal contamination affects all types of water sources including piped water bain et al 2014a 2014b due to the limited number of studies that included both self supply and communal groundwater sources it was not possible to draw conclusions from the meta analysis on whether the likelihood of contamination differs between self supplied and communal groundwater sources notably some studies showed that in areas where piped systems provide safer water there were households that still preferred to self supply their drinking water further research is needed to understand why in some contexts households might prefer self supply over piped water and how these preferences vary across different contexts possible reasons why people may prefer self supply over piped water include convenience and reduced travel time to collect water compared with public taps increased water availability where piped systems provide an intermittent supply organoleptic properties and enhanced status and reputation capstick et al 2017 sutton and butterworth 2021 in areas where piped networks are not possible supporting households to invest in safer forms of self supply could reduce the risk of faecal contamination piped systems are not always feasible particularly in sparsely populated rural areas and self supply may provide a critical stepping stone or stopgap for households the meta analysis indicated significantly lower risk of contamination for improved sources compared with unimproved sources similarly boreholes were significantly less likely to be contaminated than both protected dug wells and unprotected wells where piped services remain infeasible policy and practice should look to support investments in safer forms of self supply for example an incremental approach to self supply source protection has been implemented in parts of rural africa butterworth et al 2013 sutton 2011 the results of the meta analysis may reflect socio economic inequalities on a broad scale the meta analysis reveals that the risk of contaminated self supply is higher in low income countries on a local scale self supply is often seen as a result of socio economic inequality linked to a lack of water service expansion or poor service quality for the poorest furlong and kooy 2017 hadipuro 2010 kooy et al 2018 kurniasih 2008 moreover the poorest may be less able to invest in safer forms of self supply and may be more reliant on shallow groundwater that is vulnerable to contamination thus there is a need for reliable provision of piped services and inclusive approaches to increase equity of access financing strategies for water quality improvements through source protection and household water treatment could also help address these inequalities sutton and butterworth 2021 notwithstanding water quality concerns availability and reliability of water is an important consideration when evaluating the role of self supply in securing water for domestic needs water from self supply can be used for different purposes beyond just drinking including productive uses and can supplement other sources that might provide higher quality water for drinking for example a study in kenya reports that residents use private hand dug wells that provide substantial volumes of water for purposes other than drinking and cooking okotto et al 2015 when considering to what extent self supply water is available in sufficient quantities when needed it is important to factor in different water uses there is also evidence to suggest in certain contexts self supply can be more reliable than public sources butterworth et al 2013 foster et al 2018 investing in self supply and being the primary beneficiary are seen as powerful motivators to ensure systems are sustained sutton and butterworth 2021 a limitation of the meta analysis is the variability in study design reported by the included papers studies were combined that used e coli and ttc as a faecal indicator and studies reported different handling and microbiological analytical methods meta analysis showed significantly higher odds of faecal contamination for studies measuring ttc as compared to e coli or 1 92 95 ci 1 09 3 38 p 0 025 moreover fib whether ttc or e coli are an indicator for faecal contamination and the presence or absence of fib does not definitively confirm the presence or absence of pathogens charles et al 2020 further only one third of the reviewed studies n 11 tested the water quality considering both seasons to ensure water safety infrequent testing of water for fib and subsequent interpretation of the health hazard is not sufficient to identify and manage risks the quality of the included studies was mixed in the included studies sample selection was often not described representative or randomized and quality control was not often mentioned method and sampling was mostly described however handling minimum criteria was only reported to be met by 63 of the studies studies with a lower quality ranking score reported significantly higher odds of faecal contamination and thus might have caused bias meta analysis resulted in significantly higher odds for fib positive samples in cross sectional studies or 4 22 95 ci 2 43 7 34 p 0 001 one possible explanation is that cross sectional studies were more likely to be conducted in low income countries it is also important to note that study sites may have been biased towards locations where faecal contamination of groundwater supplies is perceived to be a problem this could lead to an overestimation of the extent of faecal contamination in self supply sources the review revealed a relatively small number of studies that have examined microbial quality of self supplied groundwater in low and middle income countries within those studies that were identified very few have rigorously assessed the links between groundwater quality and contamination risks there is a need to understand water quality and associated contamination risks of self supply services specifically further studies included in this review focused on measuring water quality at source neglecting the point of use there is also a lack of information regarding management storage and treatment practices in households using groundwater self supply water services and how it relates to the water quality at point of use it is known that the quality of water from improved sources deteriorates significantly after collection due to different factors such as water storage conditions and post handling practices and is not necessarily safe at point of use clasen and bastable 2003 gundry et al 2006 lechevallier et al 1996 mcguinness et al 2020 meierhofer et al 2018 shaheed et al 2014 shields et al 2015 trevett et al 2005 wright et al 2004 considering water quality of self supply at point of use is crucial since self supply is on premises and transport distribution and storage practices might differ from other water supply types there is a need to understand water management and treatment practices of self supply users as well as assessing the microbial water quality at point of use during distribution storage and before consumption studies also rarely compared self supply sources with alternative public service delivery models which is crucial to evaluate risk and benefits of self supply as a potential service delivery model more research is needed in different contexts to understand how self supply compares to public water sources self supply is largely unmonitored and unregulated and hence the quality of self supplied water has been rarely if ever systematically tracked this has direct implications for monitoring progress towards sdg target 6 1 universal access to safely managed water services self supplied water is accessible on premises and hence may contribute to one part of a country s safely managed water statistic however in many countries the data used to inform the free from contamination dimension are derived from utilities providing a treated piped supply to households who unicef 2018 according to who and unicef 2018 water quality data for piped supplies is applied towards the entire population using improved supplies as long as the population to which the data relate is at least 80 of the population of interest when deriving national estimates the joint monitoring programme treats the safely managed water criteria independently with the minimum value across the three indicators used to estimate the proportion of the population using a safely managed water service who 2017 thus if self supply counts towards the on premises criterion but is excluded from the free from contamination calculation it could lead to an overestimation in the proportion of households that truly have access to safely managed water services the incorporation of water quality testing into nationally representative surveys e g multiple indicator cluster surveys that cover all types of water sources including self supply is one way in which this bias can be addressed policy and practice need to respond to water quality concerns of self supply government and non governmental support for household investment in safer forms of self supply can improve the quality and sustainability of self supply sutton and butterworth 2021 self supply should be considered in water safety planning including necessary parts such as promotion of household water treatment and hygienic practices where piped networks are feasible governments need to weigh the cost benefit of supporting self supply improvements with expansion and improvement of piped water supplies the scale of continued investment in self supply highlights the need for policymakers to consider regulatory and monitoring systems for self supply fischer et al 2020 5 conclusion this literature review and meta analysis demonstrated that groundwater self supply in lmics often contains fib with contamination in 36 of samples across the included studies unimproved self supply sources had more frequent and higher levels of faecal contamination than improved sources while faecal contamination was more likely in self supply than in piped water sources where piped systems are not feasible supporting households to invest in safer forms of self supply could reduce the risk of faecal contamination self supply

16828,aquaculture industries are expanding worldwide and control of cryptosporidium is of great importance cryptosporidiosis is a serious waterborne foodborne disease responsible for infectious outbreaks globally current knowledge on the cryptosporidium species in the aquatic environment and their occurrence in piscine hosts is steadily increasing since the cryptosporidium species have been detected in marine freshwater cultured captive and ornamental fish in a wide range of geographical regions the zoonotic potential of these parasites and their pathological impact on piscine hosts have been increasingly reported and the fishborne zoonotic risk from cryptosporidium spp is of major importance from a public health point of view zoonotic subtypes in fish have been described in various studies and are probably related to water contamination from animal and human wastes this review critically evaluated existing scientific data related to cryptosporidium species in piscine hosts

administration 1 introduction fish and fish products count among the most traded food items worldwide they have a crucial role in human nutrition as they represent a valuable source of nutrients and micronutrients of fundamental importance in a diversified and healthy diet the significant growth of water industries such as fisheries and aquaculture in the past two decades has enhanced the world s capacity to consume diverse and nutritious food the food and agriculture organization estimated global fish production to have been about 178 5 million tons in 2018 88 of which was for direct human consumption exports of fish and fish products represent about 11 of the export value of agricultural products the contribution of capture fisheries and world aquaculture production to global fish production reached 54 and 46 respectively in 2018 the farming of aquatic animals was dominated by finfish 54 3 million ton usd 139 7 billion followed by molluscs 17 7 million ton usd 34 6 billion mainly bivalves namely mussels clams scallops and oysters aquaculture is expected to continue as the driving force behind the growth in global fish production and its production is projected to reach 109 million ton in 2030 an increase of 32 over 2018 fao 2020 the fisheries and the aquaculture sector are crucial for improving food security and human nutrition as people have never consumed as much fish as they do today the problem of human health risks due to fish ingestion is an important issue as seafood is responsible for foodborne infections worldwide caused by different pathogens shamsi 2019 accelerating global demand for proteins of animal origin and changes in consumer life style including increased consumption of fish and the trend for consumption of raw or minimally processed fish increase the possibilities for infections and water foodborne outbreaks due to emerging pathogens broglia and kapel 2011 the protozoan parasite cryptosporidium which can be found in aquatic environments and transmitted through fish consumption was recently highlighted as a potential fishborne risk factor moratal et al 2020 however there is no conclusive evidence for the parasite s transmission to humans considering that in fish cryptosporidium is located in the gut however cryptosporidium has been already found in fillets which probably became cross contaminated during the evisceration and cleaning process in addition some cryptosporidium fish hosts are frequently eaten uncooked or barely cooked and without gutting certad et al 2015 cryptosporidium spp is included in the top ten list of foodborne parasites of greatest global concern affecting people s health and causing clinical symptoms fao 2014 according to the global enteric multicenter study gems this parasite is identified as the second most common cause of diarrhoea and death in children worldwide following rotavirus kotloff et al 2013 levine et al 2020 it is also a common etiological agent responsible

zolfaghari et al 2018 the role of fish as hosts of the cryptosporidium species is of great significance as the zoonotic potential of these parasites and their pathological impact on piscine species has already been confirmed however the threat to public health from the zoonotic piscine cryptosporidium species remains unclear as there are no known reports of fishborne cryptosporidiosis in humans or animals yet there is a scarcity of law regulations for parasites present in food sources contributing to lack of information and control in the case of fishborne parasites analysis for nematodes of the anisakidae family is the only mandatory testing in europe regulation ec no 2074 2005 moratal et al 2020 over 40 species of parasites associated with seafood including protozoa cnidarians tapeworms flukes round worms and thorny headed worms have been reported in humans shamsi 2019 among the fishborne zoonotic parasitic infections diphyllobothrium spp seem to be associated with several disease outbreaks after consumption of salmonid fish robertson et al 2014 the problem of zoonoses like anisakiasis in fishery products has proven to be an emerging global issue concerning consumers official authorities and seafood industries parasites affect the quality and safety of fishery products reducing fish marketability and ultimately leading to negative socioeconomic impacts bao et al 2019 knowledge of the biology and taxonomy of the members of the genera responsible for disease will offer valuable information for the prevention of this infection the infectivity of zoonotic cryptosporidium species in edible fish is significant for a wide range of potential hosts and has to be determined the use of molecular methods is essential for the identification of species genotypes and subtypes responsible for infection and routes of transmission xiao and feng 2008 in cultured fish species piscine cryptosporidiosis causes a variety of clinical signs including poor growth rate and increased mortality alvarez pellitero et al 2004 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 as the aquaculture industry is expanding worldwide information regarding the biology pathogenesis and control of cryptosporidium is of great importance in humans and other animals the immune status of the host plays a critical role in determining susceptibility to infection as well as the severity and the outcome of cryptosporidiosis ryan and hijjawi 2015 therefore understanding host parasite interactions and the essential elements of immunity to cryptosporidium spp are critical to the development of effective immunotherapies or vaccines mead 2014 experimental transmission models will offer knowledge on the genetic basis of host specificity immunity potential infectivity and pathogenesis of the cryptosporidium species in a wide range of piscine hosts the development of experimental models for studying cryptosporidiosis in piscine hosts under controlled conditions will provide additional knowledge on the efficacy of different therapeutic treatments and health management protocols the limitations of in vitro culture for cryptosporidium are mainly responsible for slowing progress in developing anti cryptosporidial drugs karanis 2018 ryan and hijjawi 2015 the therapeutic options for cryptosporidiosis are limited and nitazoxanide is the only fda approved treatment for cryptosporidiosis checkley et al 2015 reducing mortality in non immunocompromised and malnourished patients amadi et al 2002 rossignol et al 2001 2006 a lot of drugs have been tested for prophylaxis and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in animals and humans however more effective drugs are urgently needed recently the piperazine derivative mmv665917 proved to be a promising anti cryptosporidial drug lead which could potentially form a basis for an effective treatment against cryptosporidiosis for humans lee et al 2019 as it rapidly eliminates parasites jumani et al 2018 considering the lack of treatment the ability to prevent and control the disease is based on prophylaxis for example water treatment is applied in the prevention of cryptosporidiosis according to sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 water turbidity and flow rate reduce the effectiveness of uv irradiation for killing the parasite while fine filtration of the water seems to reduce the prevalence and the intensity of contamination aquaculture and fisheries are considered important factors in supporting the economy especially for small scale fishing communities this factor may be threatened by large scale disease outbreaks according to the fao and world bank by 2030 more than 60 of consumed fish will be of aquaculture origin therefore the fast growing sector of aquaculture worldwide is a challenging issue in terms of foodborne diseases especially for asia where it is projected that 70 of global fish consumption will take place the world bank 2013 the introduction of parasites into primary production has proven to be the core parameter affecting the impact of foodborne parasites in public health robertson et al 2020 in the case of gastro intestinal parasites such as anisakis spp the presence of viable parasitic larvae in fish flesh is a major concern efsa 2010 to this end high standards of biosecurity and inspection in primary production should be established preventing the entrance of parasites from the food chain and ensuring their removal robertson et al 2020 the development and implementation of specific food safety management tools for the prevention and control of fishborne cryptosporidiosis will be important in the future an ecosystem based fishery management approach could target the reduction of the parasitic load in the sea this could be achieved by avoiding the re infestation produced by returning discards to the sea following the evisceration process on board gonzález et al 2018 aquaculture production systems offer unique opportunities for the prevention and control of infection by zoonotic parasitic vectors of diseases using tools that have the potential to assure the safety of edible fish lima dos santos and howgate 2011 although aquaculture has the potential to feed millions of people improper facility management may severely degrade aquatic ecosystems and pose health risks to consumers through contamination with natural and man made hazards as several pathogenic agents can affect both aquatic life and humans grigorakis and rigos 2011 quality management of the facilities and fish health management plans assure safety control in the aquaculture sector sitjà bobadilla and oidtmann 2017 modern management systems help minimize environmental impact and the distribution of unsafe or poor quality products while quality is being increasingly associated with certification standards schemes freitas et al 2020 for protozoa parasites in food there are no eu microbiological criteria chalmers et al 2020 while cryptosporidium spp oocysts detection based on standards of iso 18744 is limited only to leafy green vegetables and red berry fruits cryptosporidium spp infections emerging in new locations new fish populations and other new food sources raises the need for the development and application of standardized and validated detection methods i e based on international standard methods for testing food iso 18744 2016 and dna based analyses these methods will enhance understanding of the waterborne and foodborne routes of transmission improve risk assessments and help identify and verify critical control points efstratiou et al 2017 chalmers et al 2020 food safety is a responsibility shared by producers processors distributors and retailers several quality control programs have been applied as the awareness and concerns of consumers has increasing in the interest of safeguarding public health and providing proof of product origin from legal and sustainably managed aquaculture the application of basic quality principles in accordance with codes of best practices is becoming a common requirement for the main importer countries leal et al 2015 4 transmission of cryptosporidium in fish the transmission and circulation of cryptosporidium could potentially occur in the interfaces between human livestock and fish including both captured and aquaculture populations the three factors contributing significantly to the success of cryptosporidiosis are a the large numbers of oocysts excreted into the environment by infected hosts b the environmentally hardy oocysts which can survive for many months in temperate and moist conditions and c the very low number of oocysts that can initiate an infection even a single oocyst can be infectious and can initiate the development of disease karanis and schoenen 2001 ryan et al 2014 cryptosporidium oocysts can be transmitted through multiple routes oocysts from humans and animals are ubiquitous in the environment robertson and fayer 2013 agricultural practices can be a source of transmission as livestock is an important reservoir and crops can be contaminated from contact with manure irrigation water or by agricultural workers fish ponds rivers and seas could be contaminated from agriculture and rainwater run off humans or animals bathing and sewage discharge ryan et al 2014 in the case of fish the aquatic habitat of the host facilitates the frequent release of oocysts with mucus casts or faeces contributing to the distribution and transmission of the oocysts to other hosts biofilms also can act as biological reservoirs for waterborne protozoan pathogens by associating and protecting oo cysts within their matrices and surfaces masangkay et al 2020a a wide range of fish hosts in addition to a high oocyst output allows for a high degree of contamination of the aquatic environment ryan 2010 information regarding the prepatent periods of cryptosporidium in fish is limited direct transmission has been confirmed in the case of c molnari to gilthead seabream and seabass like other cryptosporidium species sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 the parasite enters the host as quickly as in other vertebrates and its subsequent spread depends on the host s response fish to fish transmission occurs mostly through the ingestion of fully developed oocysts released with the faeces which are immediately infectious alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 while frequent cannibalism and predation of infected fish by other carnivorous fish could be a potential source of infection fish are carriers of piscine and non piscine host specific species and genotypes including zoonotic species golomazou and karanis 2020 however the risk of transmission of piscine species and genotypes to other vertebrates including humans has not been confirmed an attempt of experimental transmission of the piscine c molnari non mammalian species to mammals scid mice was unsuccessful suggesting that these species may not be able to grow in the digestive tract of mammals certad et al 2010 the infectivity of oocysts and the susceptibility of the host are affected by different factors which facilitate the infectious stage transmission and determine the prevalence and intensity of the disease in host populations the age and size of the fish may affect the progress of the transmission in livestock infections are usually high in neonates and young animals and less prevalent in adults de graaf et al 1999 poulin 2000 in animal cryptosporidiosis the high susceptibility at a young age has been attributed to the immunological immaturity of the host which is host age dependent o donoghue 1995 in fish cryptosporidiosis higher prevalence rates are found in pre ongrowing and early on growing fish indicating the same tendency alvarez pellitero et al 2009 couso pérez et al 2018 murphy et al 2009 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 however this was not confirmed in the case of wild fish certad et al 2019 the unsuccessful transmission of enteric parasites to large size fish maybe related to the protective immunity against them after fish have recovered from the same pathogen as was reported in the case of myxosporeans gbankoto et al 2003 palenzuela et al 1999 golomazou et al 2006 this is in contrast to the pattern usually followed by the metazoan parasites in which the prevalence and intensity of infection increase with the age or size of the host due to prolonged exposure to the contaminated water and the accumulation of more parasites over time through the consumption of smaller fish poulin 2000 temperature is probably one of the major factors involved in the progress of transmission and seasonal distribution of piscine cryptosporidiosis as a high prevalence has been recorded during warm seasons in the case of c molnari in gilthead seabream and c scophthalmi in turbot alvarez pellitero et al 2009 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 the same pattern has also been described in another case of cryptosporidiosis in livestock and small wild animals sturdee et al 2003 and for myxosporidiosis in fish golomazou et al 2014 which recorded the highest prevalence during warm seasons different eukaryotic organisms present in the aquatic environment could serve as reservoirs of cryptosporidium species gómez couso et al 2003 live food such as artemia and rotifers may also act as a vehicle of infection for this parasitic infection fayer et al 2000 méndez hermida et al 2007 macro invertebrate communities are susceptible and can act as cryptosporidium reservoirs carrying the parasite to wild and cultured fish populations reboredo fernández et al 2014 other organisms which serve as food for fish can also constitute possible reservoirs as has been recently reported for c hominis isolated from a sponge of the genus spongilla masangkay et al 2020b 5 cryptosporidium species in piscine hosts cryptosporidium species have been found in a wide range of hosts including marine freshwater cultured captive and ornamental fish a list of worldwide reports on cryptosporidium species in fish is provided in tables 1a 1b 1c ten cryptosporidium species have been reported in fish c nasorum c molnari c scophthalmi c huwi c bollandi n sp c abrahamseni n sp c parvum c hominis c scrofarum c xiaoi the rat genotype iii and 22 additional piscine genotypes the identification and species definition of cryptosporidium isolates is mainly based on molecular tools including pcr based identification and dna sequencing of pcr products while several genetic markers have been used to characterize the isolates identified in fish infections according to hoover et al 1981 the first report of cryptosporidium in a piscine host was the nomen nudum species c nasorum identified in the tropical fish naso lituratus perciformes surgeon fish and cyprinformes carp were later mentioned as hosts o donoghue 1995 pavlásek 1983 while two cryptosporidium like nomina nuda species of the genus piscicryptosporidium p reichenbachklinkei and p cichlidaris had been described from cichlid fish of the genus oreochromis paperna and vilenkin 1996 currently five further species have been recognized as piscine host specific c molnari c scophthalmi c huwi c bollandi n sp c abrahamseni n sp and some genotypes table 1a c molnari has been genetically characterized in gilthead seabream sparus aurata and european seabass dicentrarchus labrax alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 palenzuela et al 2010 and c huwi in the ornamental guppy poecilia reticulata the golden tiger barb puntigrus tetrazona and the neon tetra paracheirodon innesi ryan et al 2015 paparini et al 2017 yang et al 2015 in the case of c scophthalmi molecular data is only available for a c scophthalmi like organism identified in scophthalmus maximus costa and saraiva 2015 as it was not genetically characterized when it was firstly reported in turbot alvarez pellitero et al 2004 the species name c bollandi n sp has been proposed for cryptosporidium piscine genotype 2 based on morphological biological and molecular characterization when described in oscar fish astronotus ocellatus bolland et al 2020 this parasite had been detected before in oscar fish in neon tetra paracheirodon innesi and in mullet mugil cephalus paparini et al 2017 ryan et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zanguee et al 2010 while it was proposed as a new species in freshwater angelfish pterophyllum scarale murphy et al 2009 recently the new species name c abrahamseni n sp has been proposed for cryptosporidium piscine genotype 7 when described in massive infection in three red eye tetras moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae zahedi et al 2021 this species had been detected before in three red eye tetras moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae morine et al 2012 bolland et al 2020 while a genotype 7 like organism had been reported in neon tetra paracheirodon innesi by yang et al 2015 molecular characterization has led to the identification of 19 additional piscine genotypes table 1b they include piscine genotypes 3 6 8 koinari et al 2013 morine et al 2012 paparini et al 2017 ryan et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zanguee et al 2010 genotype 9 couso pérez et al 2018 one novel genotype similar to c molnari in koi carp causing disseminated infection yang et al 2016 cryptofish 3 and 8 un named novel genotypes certad et al 2019 paparini et al 2017 reid et al 2010 yang et al 2015 recently the phylogenetic analyses at the actin locus of the previously described genotypes cryptofish1 cryptofish2 cryptofish4 cryptofish5 revealed their grouping in the novel marine genotype i and the genotype cryptofish 7 was renamed to novel marine genotype ii certad et al 2020 the 19 piscine genotypes described worldwide are grouped with the piscine host specific species figure 1 most of them are grouped with c bollandi n sp five genotypes are grouped with c molnari one is included in the c scophthalmi like species clade while c huwi is grouped with c abrahamseni additionally the contamination of the aquatic environment with pathogenic cryptosporidium species from agricultural runoff and discharged sewage is probably the reason for the presence of the non piscine host specific cryptosporidium species c parvum c hominis c scrofarum c xiaoi and the rat genotype iii in fish reid et al 2010 certad et al 2015 2019 couso pérez et al 2018 2019 gibson kueh et al 2011 koinari et al 2013 morine et al 2012 ryan et al 2014 table 1c cryptosporidium species have been reported in 23 freshwater and 24 marine fish species including edible fish the fish specific c huwi and c abrahamseni and the rat genotype have been reported only in freshwater fish species in the case of marine fish species the fish specific c scophthalmi and the non fish specific c scrofarum and c xiaoi have been exclusively reported furthermore the fish specific c molnari and c bollandi and the zoonotic cryptosporidium species are reported in both freshwater and marine fish according to current data which is based on a limited existing number of researches it seems that c molnari and c parvum are the most frequently reported parasites in both cases cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been detected in fish in a wide range of geographical regions table 2 in most cases the parasite has been reported in australia 57 followed by spain 15 and the north east atlantic near france 12 australia is the geographic region with the widest variety of species genotypes n 15 followed by spain and the north east atlantic n 5 israel n 4 the eastern english channel n 3 lac léman in france n 2 while in the mediterranean sea and the northern north sea france the netherlands the usa papua new guinea vietnam the czech republic england and portugal only single cryptosporidium species or genotypes have been reported the specific piscine cryptosporidium species have been reported in australia spain lac léman in france and the north east atlantic figure 2 in australia the reported species are c molnari and similar genotypes c huwi c bollandi and c abrahamseni in europe c molnari and similar genotypes and c scophthalmi have been reported in spain while c molnari and similar genotypes have been reported in lac léman and the north east atlantic respectively in the case of cultured fish the cryptosporidium species have been recorded in spain in gilthead seabream seabass turbot and rainbow trout alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 alvarez pellitero et al 2009 costa and saraiva 2015 couso pérez et al 2018 freire santos et al 1998 sitjà bobadilla and alvarez pellitero 2003 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 in australia in murray cod baragahare et al 2011 in vietnam in asian seabass gibson kueh et al 2011 in papua new guinea in nile tilapia koinari et al 2013 in israel in cichlids landsberg and paperna 1986 paperna and vilenkin 1996 and in louisiana usa in red drum camus and lopez 1996 a higher prevalence has been recorded in farmed fish compared to other hosts explaining the severity of piscine cryptosporidiosis causing serious pathological impacts on infected fish in cultured fish there is a high mortality among juveniles after cryptosporidium infection while they are exposed to high stocking densities temporarily unfavourable environmental conditions and husbandry practices this can induce a strong stress response in fish leading to poor animal welfare and severe infections as the immunocompetence of infected animals is decreased fotedar and evans 2011 macaulay et al 2020 6 fishborne zoonotic potential of cryptosporidium species among cryptosporidium spp c hominis and c parvum are the main species infecting humans globally dixon 2015 efstratiou et al 2017 robertson et al 2014 ryan et al 2016 xiao 2010 with the latter being divided into two branches one that corresponds to parasites that infect humans c parvum anthroponotic species and the other that is found in animals c parvum kissinger 2019 nader et al 2019 foodborne parasitic diseases associated with wild fish and aquaculture products are well documented and pose major public health problems as some of them are highly pathogenic lima dos santos and howgate 2011 who 2004 despite the fact that parasites are fish pathogens their zoonotic potential is not confirmed in all cases ichthyozoonoses have significantly increased in proportion to the increase of the consumption of raw or minimally processed fish in relation to the growth of the international fish market keiser and utzinger 2005 mccarthy and moore 2000 nawa et al 2005 robinson and dalton 2009 c parvum zoonotic subtypes represent the most common source of zoonotic infection and their presence in fish host samples is probably related to water contamination by animal and human wastes ryan et al 2014 they have been detected in a great range of hosts and in various geographic regions figure 3 certad et al 2015 couso pérez et al 2018 koinari et al 2013 reid et al 2010 c parvum was firstly observed in fish when rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss was fed with a commercial feed contaminated with bovine isolated c parvum oocysts but no data on genotyping is available freire santos et al 1998 from 2010 to 2021 it has been detected in 18 freshwater and marine fish species for the cryptosporidium genotyping and subtyping samples have been screened at the 18s rrna ssu rdna actin and gp60 locus and zoonotic iia subtypes family have been identified table 4 in most cases subtyping at the gp60 locus has identified parasites as c parvum similar to the 18s rrna gene except for one case involving mackerel scad where the parasite c hominis subtype ida15g1 was identified indicating a mixed infection koinari et al 2013 c parvum has been detected in edible fish both wild and farmed the prevalence of infection was low in most cases the highest prevalence has been recorded in a case of trout species brown trout couso pérez et al 2019 and european trout in nw spain couso pérez et al 2018 the presence of the parasite in cultured trout is very important as stressful conditions during intensive aquaculture practices related to high population densities facilitates transmission of pathogens alvarez pellitero et al 2004 this fact is enforced by the increased prevalence in pre ongrowing and early ongrowing stages when hosts are immunologically immature as it has been reported in a case of other cryptosporidium species sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 the presence of c molnari in european perch perca fluviatilis fillets clearly highlights the risk of cryptosporidium infection to humans certad et al 2015 however this finding is probably related to the preparation process of the infected fish and their contamination during evisceration and cleaning certad et al 2015 this fact indicates the potential zoonotic risk of cross contamination from the fish digestive tract to the fish fillet in a case of c parvum infecting edible fish the handling of fish carrying zoonotic cryptosporidium species is a potential source of infection for humans transmission of cryptosporidium spp can be achieved either by consumption of undercooked fish or by contact with fish during preparation and handling especially in immunosuppressed patients mcoliver et al 2009 according to roberts et al 2007 fishermen are at risk of cryptosporidiosis after fishing and consuming captured fish depending on a variety of confounding factors such as immunity pre existing illnesses and other host specific factors this probability indicated that on average one to eight out of ten anglers could become infected based on a probabilistic risk assessment of fish and hand wash samples transmission of c parvum through handling has also been proven in a case of blue crabs graczyk et al 2007 fishborne zoonotic potential risk from cryptosporidium species is of major importance from a public health point of view the presence of these parasites in edible fish which are commonly consumed as raw or slightly processed without evisceration may be the etiological agent responsible for outbreaks of fishborne foodborne cryptosporidiosis fish could be a new source of infection for people even as mechanical carriers as far as parasites are present in species of commercial interest the risk of infection due to cross contaminated fish flesh during evisceration and processing at the transport and warehouse level remains even if the gastrointestinal tract is not consumed moratal et al 2020 7 pathological effect of piscine cryptosporidiosis the pathology of cryptosporidiosis in fish is very important considering the significant impact of pathogens on farm production and the aquaculture industry intensive aquaculture practices stressful conditions high host density water supply and temperature combined with the immunological immaturity of the host increase the prevalence morbidity mortality rates and interactions with other pathogens in young fish alvarez pellitero et al 2004 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 piscine cryptosporidium species mainly infects the microvillus border of the gastrointestinal epithelium and sporulation takes place deep within the epithelium being intracellular in contrast to the epicellular location of cryptosporidium species in other vertebrates alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 palenzuela et al 2010 ryan et al 2004 2015 severe cryptosporidiosis is strongly related to heavy infection causing a variety of obvious clinical and pathological signs table 3 in these cases poor physical condition characterized by listlessness poor growth rate anorexia and increased mortality are recorded baragahare et al 2011 also muscle wasting and atrophy severe emaciation or swollen coelomic cavities and abdominal swelling ascites have been observed indigestion intestinal distension arising from mucous intestinal contents gas and whitish faeces are the main findings during necropsy alvarez pellitero et al 2004 hoover et al 1981 muench and white 1997 murphy et al 2009 zanguee et al 2010 mild to moderate gastritis is present in infected fish depending on the intensity of the parasitic disease sitjà bobadilla and alvarez pellitero 2003 necrosis vacuolisation degradation disaggregation and sloughing of epithelial cells are the main histopathological effects observed in infected tissues baragahare et al 2011 paperna and vilenkin 1996 in this case severe inflammation necrosis of gastric mucosal epithelial cells mucosal glandular atrophy and glandular loss may be present camus and lopez 1996 ryan et al 2004 in the lumen of severely infected fish wide vacuolated areas are occupied by clusters of oocysts and engulfed by hypertrophied cells probably macrophages alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 in moderately infected intestines mild intestinal lesions are observed while on the mucosal epithelium of infected fish displacement of the microvilli and focal indentation at attachment sites of the parasites is described hoover et al 1981 zahedi et al 2021 severe intestinal lesions are mentioned in massive infections and most of the epithelial surface is covered by oocysts the epithelial cells are distended by large vacuoles containing clusters of oocysts and the mucosal architecture is distorted a severe inflammatory response is mentioned and exocytosis of some lymphocytes into the epithelium an abundance of rodlet cells in infected epithelia and numerous goblet cells are also observed alvarez pellitero et al 2004 however in some cases no pathological changes have been observed alvarez pellitero et al 2009 certad et al 2015 landsberg and paperna 1986 which is probably related to the host s sensitivity and its response against the parasite the absence of pathological impact has been described in a case of seabass infected with c molnari in which the prevalence and intensity were low and oocysts appeared degenerated and surrounded by host cellular reaction alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 the gastrointestinal tract is not the only target organ for cryptosporidium spp the parasite stages have been detected in other tissues as in the case of turbot causing necrosis of adjacent hepatic cells and fibrosis of the bile ducts saraiva et al 2009 in the case of koi carp severe granulomatous inflammatory lesions have been observed in the pale brown liver yang et al 2016 the spleen was swollen irregularly granular and superficial haemorrhages and hyperaemia were present on the skin and gills severe granulomatosis and extensive inflammation were described in the kidneys the spleen the base of the secondary lamellae the cartilage of the gills and between the skeletal muscles yang et al 2016 8 conclusions the dispersion and transmission of zoonotic parasites would be facilitated by the aquatic habitat of the host that could release oocysts contributing to cryptosporidium circulation and transmission the importance of piscine cryptosporidiosis for fish and public health is currently documented cryptosporidium species have been described in various studies pertaining to a great range of fish hosts and geographic regions ichthyozoonoses have increased significantly through the consumption of raw or minimally processed fish in the ever growing international fish market taking into consideration i the worldwide distribution of cryptosporidium in piscine hosts ii its zoonotic potential iii the increasing rate of fish consumption and iv the pathological effect of cryptosporidiosis in fish combined with the seafood industries expansion prevention and control of fishborne cryptosporidiosis are of major concern for research on a global scale for all seafood industries cryptosporidiosis can be considered important in fish and aquaculture since these animals may act as carriers and may be a source of infection for other aquatic hosts and also for humans since aquaculture industries are expanding worldwide information regarding the transmission routes and the control of cryptosporidium distribution in aquatic ecosystems should be globally prioritized initiative allowing for more efficient collaboration and the transferring of skills and technology between countries it can be of particular benefit for every country to address specific needs for food and livelihoods declaration of competing interest the

16828,aquaculture industries are expanding worldwide and control of cryptosporidium is of great importance cryptosporidiosis is a serious waterborne foodborne disease responsible for infectious outbreaks globally current knowledge on the cryptosporidium species in the aquatic environment and their occurrence in piscine hosts is steadily increasing since the cryptosporidium species have been detected in marine freshwater cultured captive and ornamental fish in a wide range of geographical regions the zoonotic potential of these parasites and their pathological impact on piscine hosts have been increasingly reported and the fishborne zoonotic risk from cryptosporidium spp is of major importance from a public health point of view zoonotic subtypes in fish have been described in various studies and are probably related to water contamination from animal and human wastes this review critically evaluated existing scientific data related to cryptosporidium species in piscine hosts emphasizing transmission routes and the potential impact of piscine cryptosporidiosis in aquaculture this knowledge will facilitate consumers authorities and water industries such as fisheries and

administration 1 introduction fish and fish products count among the most traded food items worldwide they have a crucial role in human nutrition as they represent a valuable source of nutrients and micronutrients of fundamental importance in a diversified and healthy diet the significant growth of water industries such as fisheries and aquaculture in the past two decades has enhanced the world s capacity to consume diverse and nutritious food the food and agriculture organization estimated global fish production to have been about 178 5 million tons in 2018 88 of which was for direct human consumption exports of fish and fish products represent about 11 of the export value of agricultural products the contribution of capture fisheries and world aquaculture production to global fish production reached 54 and 46 respectively in 2018 the farming of aquatic animals was dominated by finfish 54 3 million ton usd 139 7 billion followed by molluscs 17 7 million ton usd 34 6 billion mainly bivalves namely mussels clams scallops and oysters aquaculture is expected to continue as the driving force behind the growth in global fish production and its production is projected to reach 109 million ton in 2030 an increase of 32 over 2018 fao 2020 the fisheries and the aquaculture sector are crucial for improving food security and human nutrition as people have never consumed as much fish as they do today the problem of human health risks due to fish ingestion is an important issue as seafood is responsible for foodborne infections worldwide caused by different pathogens shamsi 2019 accelerating global demand for proteins of animal origin and changes in consumer life style including increased consumption of fish and the trend for consumption of raw or minimally processed fish increase the possibilities for infections and water foodborne outbreaks due to emerging pathogens broglia and kapel 2011 the protozoan parasite cryptosporidium which can be found in aquatic environments and transmitted through fish consumption was recently highlighted as a potential fishborne risk factor moratal et al 2020 however there is no conclusive evidence for the parasite s transmission to humans considering that in fish cryptosporidium is located in the gut however cryptosporidium has been already found in fillets which probably became cross contaminated during the evisceration and cleaning process in addition some cryptosporidium fish hosts are frequently eaten uncooked or barely cooked and without gutting certad et al 2015 cryptosporidium spp is included in the top ten list of foodborne parasites of greatest global concern affecting people s health and causing clinical symptoms fao 2014 according to the global enteric multicenter study gems this parasite is identified as the second most common cause of diarrhoea and death in children worldwide following rotavirus kotloff et al 2013 levine et al 2020 it is also a common etiological agent responsible for more than 8 million cases of foodborne illness worldwide and 63 of waterborne outbreaks baldursson and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017 karanis et al 2007 moreira and bondelind 2017 rosado garcía et al 2017 diarrhoea vomiting nausea lack of appetite and cramps are included in the commonly mentioned symptoms of cryptosporidiosis in the case of immunocompetent individuals it is usually a self limiting disease however it can be chronic and life threatening in the case of immunocompromised people and young children ryan et al 2016 2018 the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis infects a large range of domestic animals wildlife population and humans o donoghue 1995 plutzer and karanis 2009 ryan 2010 ryan et al 2014 zahedi et al 2016 in recent years knowledge related to the cryptosporidium species on piscine hosts has increased as they have been detected in marine freshwater cultured captive or ornamental fish in a wide range of geographical regions certad et al 2020 golomazou and karanis 2020 the presence of zoonotic cryptosporidium species and subtypes in fisheries has previously been highlighted as a threat to public health certad et al 2015 2020 couso pérez et al 2018 koinari et al 2013 reid et al 2010 and fishborne cryptosporidiosis could be related to the consumption and handling of edible infected captured fish cryptosporidiosis can potentially have a negative economic impact on the aquaculture industry as it expands worldwide severe infections are related to poor fish growth serious pathological effects and increased mortality alvarez pellitero et al 2004 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 threatening the aquatic environment despite frequent reports concerning the potential risk to public health foodborne parasites deriving from wild and aquaculture fish remain neglected as a pathogen group omarova et al 2018 moratal et al 2020 the present article critically reviews available scientific knowledge related to the cryptosporidium species reported in piscine hosts it summarizes analyses and combines data revealing the current status research inadequacies in existing knowledge and offers a quantitative evaluation of the worldwide spread of the parasite reported outcomes are aimed at improving knowledge on transmission routes new outbreak locations fisheries and aquaculture populations pathological impacts of piscine cryptosporidiosis with emphasis on public health issues and the seafood industry are also considered 2 literature search an extensive search for articles relevant to the subject was carried out for this reason keywords related to the genus of the parasite cryptosporidium and the host of interest fish in combination with other terms such as aquaculture fisheries epidemiology pathology zoonosis and food safety were applied in databases of scopus pubmed and google scholar selected documents published between 1981 and 2021 have been used and useful scientific data has been summarized documents related to piscine hosts of cryptosporidium have been recorded in the reference list overall one hundred and eleven papers 111 were considered to be relevant to the research subject and finally evaluated thirty five 35 of these report piscine hosts in 11 countries australia 12 papers spain 9 papers france 3 papers the usa 4 papers the czech republic england israel the netherlands papua new guinea portugal and vietnam 1 paper 3 challenges for fisheries and aquaculture cryptosporidiosis is an important waterborne and foodborne disease responsible for disease outbreaks all over the world ahmed and karanis 2018 baldursson and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017 kotloff et al 2013 karanis et al 2007 mahmoudi et al 2017 moreira and bondelind 2017 rosado garcía et al 2017 ryan et al 2018 zhou et al 2008 zolfaghari et al 2018 the role of fish as hosts of the cryptosporidium species is of great significance as the zoonotic potential of these parasites and their pathological impact on piscine species has already been confirmed however the threat to public health from the zoonotic piscine cryptosporidium species remains unclear as there are no known reports of fishborne cryptosporidiosis in humans or animals yet there is a scarcity of law regulations for parasites present in food sources contributing to lack of information and control in the case of fishborne parasites analysis for nematodes of the anisakidae family is the only mandatory testing in europe regulation ec no 2074 2005 moratal et al 2020 over 40 species of parasites associated with seafood including protozoa cnidarians tapeworms flukes round worms and thorny headed worms have been reported in humans shamsi 2019 among the fishborne zoonotic parasitic infections diphyllobothrium spp seem to be associated with several disease outbreaks after consumption of salmonid fish robertson et al 2014 the problem of zoonoses like anisakiasis in fishery products has proven to be an emerging global issue concerning consumers official authorities and seafood industries parasites affect the quality and safety of fishery products reducing fish marketability and ultimately leading to negative socioeconomic impacts bao et al 2019 knowledge of the biology and taxonomy of the members of the genera responsible for disease will offer valuable information for the prevention of this infection the infectivity of zoonotic cryptosporidium species in edible fish is significant for a wide range of potential hosts and has to be determined the use of molecular methods is essential for the identification of species genotypes and subtypes responsible for infection and routes of transmission xiao and feng 2008 in cultured fish species piscine cryptosporidiosis causes a variety of clinical signs including poor growth rate and increased mortality alvarez pellitero et al 2004 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 as the aquaculture industry is expanding worldwide information regarding the biology pathogenesis and control of cryptosporidium is of great importance in humans and other animals the immune status of the host plays a critical role in determining susceptibility to infection as well as the severity and the outcome of cryptosporidiosis ryan and hijjawi 2015 therefore understanding host parasite interactions and the essential elements of immunity to cryptosporidium spp are critical to the development of effective immunotherapies or vaccines mead 2014 experimental transmission models will offer knowledge on the genetic basis of host specificity immunity potential infectivity and pathogenesis of the cryptosporidium species in a wide range of piscine hosts the development of experimental models for studying cryptosporidiosis in piscine hosts under controlled conditions will provide additional knowledge on the efficacy of different therapeutic treatments and health management protocols the limitations of in vitro culture for cryptosporidium are mainly responsible for slowing progress in developing anti cryptosporidial drugs karanis 2018 ryan and hijjawi 2015 the therapeutic options for cryptosporidiosis are limited and nitazoxanide is the only fda approved treatment for cryptosporidiosis checkley et al 2015 reducing mortality in non immunocompromised and malnourished patients amadi et al 2002 rossignol et al 2001 2006 a lot of drugs have been tested for prophylaxis and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in animals and humans however more effective drugs are urgently needed recently the piperazine derivative mmv665917 proved to be a promising anti cryptosporidial drug lead which could potentially form a basis for an effective treatment against cryptosporidiosis for humans lee et al 2019 as it rapidly eliminates parasites jumani et al 2018 considering the lack of treatment the ability to prevent and control the disease is based on prophylaxis for example water treatment is applied in the prevention of cryptosporidiosis according to sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 water turbidity and flow rate reduce the effectiveness of uv irradiation for killing the parasite while fine filtration of the water seems to reduce the prevalence and the intensity of contamination aquaculture and fisheries are considered important factors in supporting the economy especially for small scale fishing communities this factor may be threatened by large scale disease outbreaks according to the fao and world bank by 2030 more than 60 of consumed fish will be of aquaculture origin therefore the fast growing sector of aquaculture worldwide is a challenging issue in terms of foodborne diseases especially for asia where it is projected that 70 of global fish consumption will take place the world bank 2013 the introduction of parasites into primary production has proven to be the core parameter affecting the impact of foodborne parasites in public health robertson et al 2020 in the case of gastro intestinal parasites such as anisakis spp the presence of viable parasitic larvae in fish flesh is a major concern efsa 2010 to this end high standards of biosecurity and inspection in primary production should be established preventing the entrance of parasites from the food chain and ensuring their removal robertson et al 2020 the development and implementation of specific food safety management tools for the prevention and control of fishborne cryptosporidiosis will be important in the future an ecosystem based fishery management approach could target the reduction of the parasitic load in the sea this could be achieved by avoiding the re infestation produced by returning discards to the sea following the evisceration process on board gonzález et al 2018 aquaculture production systems offer unique opportunities for the prevention and control of infection by zoonotic parasitic vectors of diseases using tools that have the potential to assure the safety of edible fish lima dos santos and howgate 2011 although aquaculture has the potential to feed millions of people improper facility management may severely degrade aquatic ecosystems and pose health risks to consumers through contamination with natural and man made hazards as several pathogenic agents can affect both aquatic life and humans grigorakis and rigos 2011 quality management of the facilities and fish health management plans assure safety control in the aquaculture sector sitjà bobadilla and oidtmann 2017 modern management systems help minimize environmental impact and the distribution of unsafe or poor quality products while quality is being increasingly associated with certification standards schemes freitas et al 2020 for protozoa parasites in food there are no eu microbiological criteria chalmers et al 2020 while cryptosporidium spp oocysts detection based on standards of iso 18744 is limited only to leafy green vegetables and red berry fruits cryptosporidium spp infections emerging in new locations new fish populations and other new food sources raises the need for the development and application of standardized and validated detection methods i e based on international standard methods for testing food iso 18744 2016 and dna based analyses these methods will enhance understanding of the waterborne and foodborne routes of transmission improve risk assessments and help identify and verify critical control points efstratiou et al 2017 chalmers et al 2020 food safety is a responsibility shared by producers processors distributors and retailers several quality control programs have been applied as the awareness and concerns of consumers has increasing in the interest of safeguarding public health and providing proof of product origin from legal and sustainably managed aquaculture the application of basic quality principles in accordance with codes of best practices is becoming a common requirement for the main importer countries leal et al 2015 4 transmission of cryptosporidium in fish the transmission and circulation of cryptosporidium could potentially occur in the interfaces between human livestock and fish including both captured and aquaculture populations the three factors contributing significantly to the success of cryptosporidiosis are a the large numbers of oocysts excreted into the environment by infected hosts b the environmentally hardy oocysts which can survive for many months in temperate and moist conditions and c the very low number of oocysts that can initiate an infection even a single oocyst can be infectious and can initiate the development of disease karanis and schoenen 2001 ryan et al 2014 cryptosporidium oocysts can be transmitted through multiple routes oocysts from humans and animals are ubiquitous in the environment robertson and fayer 2013 agricultural practices can be a source of transmission as livestock is an important reservoir and crops can be contaminated from contact with manure irrigation water or by agricultural workers fish ponds rivers and seas could be contaminated from agriculture and rainwater run off humans or animals bathing and sewage discharge ryan et al 2014 in the case of fish the aquatic habitat of the host facilitates the frequent release of oocysts with mucus casts or faeces contributing to the distribution and transmission of the oocysts to other hosts biofilms also can act as biological reservoirs for waterborne protozoan pathogens by associating and protecting oo cysts within their matrices and surfaces masangkay et al 2020a a wide range of fish hosts in addition to a high oocyst output allows for a high degree of contamination of the aquatic environment ryan 2010 information regarding the prepatent periods of cryptosporidium in fish is limited direct transmission has been confirmed in the case of c molnari to gilthead seabream and seabass like other cryptosporidium species sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 the parasite enters the host as quickly as in other vertebrates and its subsequent spread depends on the host s response fish to fish transmission occurs mostly through the ingestion of fully developed oocysts released with the faeces which are immediately infectious alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 while frequent cannibalism and predation of infected fish by other carnivorous fish could be a potential source of infection fish are carriers of piscine and non piscine host specific species and genotypes including zoonotic species golomazou and karanis 2020 however the risk of transmission of piscine species and genotypes to other vertebrates including humans has not been confirmed an attempt of experimental transmission of the piscine c molnari non mammalian species to mammals scid mice was unsuccessful suggesting that these species may not be able to grow in the digestive tract of mammals certad et al 2010 the infectivity of oocysts and the susceptibility of the host are affected by different factors which facilitate the infectious stage transmission and determine the prevalence and intensity of the disease in host populations the age and size of the fish may affect the progress of the transmission in livestock infections are usually high in neonates and young animals and less prevalent in adults de graaf et al 1999 poulin 2000 in animal cryptosporidiosis the high susceptibility at a young age has been attributed to the immunological immaturity of the host which is host age dependent o donoghue 1995 in fish cryptosporidiosis higher prevalence rates are found in pre ongrowing and early on growing fish indicating the same tendency alvarez pellitero et al 2009 couso pérez et al 2018 murphy et al 2009 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 however this was not confirmed in the case of wild fish certad et al 2019 the unsuccessful transmission of enteric parasites to large size fish maybe related to the protective immunity against them after fish have recovered from the same pathogen as was reported in the case of myxosporeans gbankoto et al 2003 palenzuela et al 1999 golomazou et al 2006 this is in contrast to the pattern usually followed by the metazoan parasites in which the prevalence and intensity of infection increase with the age or size of the host due to prolonged exposure to the contaminated water and the accumulation of more parasites over time through the consumption of smaller fish poulin 2000 temperature is probably one of the major factors involved in the progress of transmission and seasonal distribution of piscine cryptosporidiosis as a high prevalence has been recorded during warm seasons in the case of c molnari in gilthead seabream and c scophthalmi in turbot alvarez pellitero et al 2009 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 the same pattern has also been described in another case of cryptosporidiosis in livestock and small wild animals sturdee et al 2003 and for myxosporidiosis in fish golomazou et al 2014 which recorded the highest prevalence during warm seasons different eukaryotic organisms present in the aquatic environment could serve as reservoirs of cryptosporidium species gómez couso et al 2003 live food such as artemia and rotifers may also act as a vehicle of infection for this parasitic infection fayer et al 2000 méndez hermida et al 2007 macro invertebrate communities are susceptible and can act as cryptosporidium reservoirs carrying the parasite to wild and cultured fish populations reboredo fernández et al 2014 other organisms which serve as food for fish can also constitute possible reservoirs as has been recently reported for c hominis isolated from a sponge of the genus spongilla masangkay et al 2020b 5 cryptosporidium species in piscine hosts cryptosporidium species have been found in a wide range of hosts including marine freshwater cultured captive and ornamental fish a list of worldwide reports on cryptosporidium species in fish is provided in tables 1a 1b 1c ten cryptosporidium species have been reported in fish c nasorum c molnari c scophthalmi c huwi c bollandi n sp c abrahamseni n sp c parvum c hominis c scrofarum c xiaoi the rat genotype iii and 22 additional piscine genotypes the identification and species definition of cryptosporidium isolates is mainly based on molecular tools including pcr based identification and dna sequencing of pcr products while several genetic markers have been used to characterize the isolates identified in fish infections according to hoover et al 1981 the first report of cryptosporidium in a piscine host was the nomen nudum species c nasorum identified in the tropical fish naso lituratus perciformes surgeon fish and cyprinformes carp were later mentioned as hosts o donoghue 1995 pavlásek 1983 while two cryptosporidium like nomina nuda species of the genus piscicryptosporidium p reichenbachklinkei and p cichlidaris had been described from cichlid fish of the genus oreochromis paperna and vilenkin 1996 currently five further species have been recognized as piscine host specific c molnari c scophthalmi c huwi c bollandi n sp c abrahamseni n sp and some genotypes table 1a c molnari has been genetically characterized in gilthead seabream sparus aurata and european seabass dicentrarchus labrax alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 palenzuela et al 2010 and c huwi in the ornamental guppy poecilia reticulata the golden tiger barb puntigrus tetrazona and the neon tetra paracheirodon innesi ryan et al 2015 paparini et al 2017 yang et al 2015 in the case of c scophthalmi molecular data is only available for a c scophthalmi like organism identified in scophthalmus maximus costa and saraiva 2015 as it was not genetically characterized when it was firstly reported in turbot alvarez pellitero et al 2004 the species name c bollandi n sp has been proposed for cryptosporidium piscine genotype 2 based on morphological biological and molecular characterization when described in oscar fish astronotus ocellatus bolland et al 2020 this parasite had been detected before in oscar fish in neon tetra paracheirodon innesi and in mullet mugil cephalus paparini et al 2017 ryan et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zanguee et al 2010 while it was proposed as a new species in freshwater angelfish pterophyllum scarale murphy et al 2009 recently the new species name c abrahamseni n sp has been proposed for cryptosporidium piscine genotype 7 when described in massive infection in three red eye tetras moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae zahedi et al 2021 this species had been detected before in three red eye tetras moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae morine et al 2012 bolland et al 2020 while a genotype 7 like organism had been reported in neon tetra paracheirodon innesi by yang et al 2015 molecular characterization has led to the identification of 19 additional piscine genotypes table 1b they include piscine genotypes 3 6 8 koinari et al 2013 morine et al 2012 paparini et al 2017 ryan et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zanguee et al 2010 genotype 9 couso pérez et al 2018 one novel genotype similar to c molnari in koi carp causing disseminated infection yang et al 2016 cryptofish 3 and 8 un named novel genotypes certad et al 2019 paparini et al 2017 reid et al 2010 yang et al 2015 recently the phylogenetic analyses at the actin locus of the previously described genotypes cryptofish1 cryptofish2 cryptofish4 cryptofish5 revealed their grouping in the novel marine genotype i and the genotype cryptofish 7 was renamed to novel marine genotype ii certad et al 2020 the 19 piscine genotypes described worldwide are grouped with the piscine host specific species figure 1 most of them are grouped with c bollandi n sp five genotypes are grouped with c molnari one is included in the c scophthalmi like species clade while c huwi is grouped with c abrahamseni additionally the contamination of the aquatic environment with pathogenic cryptosporidium species from agricultural runoff and discharged sewage is probably the reason for the presence of the non piscine host specific cryptosporidium species c parvum c hominis c scrofarum c xiaoi and the rat genotype iii in fish reid et al 2010 certad et al 2015 2019 couso pérez et al 2018 2019 gibson kueh et al 2011 koinari et al 2013 morine et al 2012 ryan et al 2014 table 1c cryptosporidium species have been reported in 23 freshwater and 24 marine fish species including edible fish the fish specific c huwi and c abrahamseni and the rat genotype have been reported only in freshwater fish species in the case of marine fish species the fish specific c scophthalmi and the non fish specific c scrofarum and c xiaoi have been exclusively reported furthermore the fish specific c molnari and c bollandi and the zoonotic cryptosporidium species are reported in both freshwater and marine fish according to current data which is based on a limited existing number of researches it seems that c molnari and c parvum are the most frequently reported parasites in both cases cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been detected in fish in a wide range of geographical regions table 2 in most cases the parasite has been reported in australia 57 followed by spain 15 and the north east atlantic near france 12 australia is the geographic region with the widest variety of species genotypes n 15 followed by spain and the north east atlantic n 5 israel n 4 the eastern english channel n 3 lac léman in france n 2 while in the mediterranean sea and the northern north sea france the netherlands the usa papua new guinea vietnam the czech republic england and portugal only single cryptosporidium species or genotypes have been reported the specific piscine cryptosporidium species have been reported in australia spain lac léman in france and the north east atlantic figure 2 in australia the reported species are c molnari and similar genotypes c huwi c bollandi and c abrahamseni in europe c molnari and similar genotypes and c scophthalmi have been reported in spain while c molnari and similar genotypes have been reported in lac léman and the north east atlantic respectively in the case of cultured fish the cryptosporidium species have been recorded in spain in gilthead seabream seabass turbot and rainbow trout alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 alvarez pellitero et al 2009 costa and saraiva 2015 couso pérez et al 2018 freire santos et al 1998 sitjà bobadilla and alvarez pellitero 2003 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 in australia in murray cod baragahare et al 2011 in vietnam in asian seabass gibson kueh et al 2011 in papua new guinea in nile tilapia koinari et al 2013 in israel in cichlids landsberg and paperna 1986 paperna and vilenkin 1996 and in louisiana usa in red drum camus and lopez 1996 a higher prevalence has been recorded in farmed fish compared to other hosts explaining the severity of piscine cryptosporidiosis causing serious pathological impacts on infected fish in cultured fish there is a high mortality among juveniles after cryptosporidium infection while they are exposed to high stocking densities temporarily unfavourable environmental conditions and husbandry practices this can induce a strong stress response in fish leading to poor animal welfare and severe infections as the immunocompetence of infected animals is decreased fotedar and evans 2011 macaulay et al 2020 6 fishborne zoonotic potential of cryptosporidium species among cryptosporidium spp c hominis and c parvum are the main species infecting humans globally dixon 2015 efstratiou et al 2017 robertson et al 2014 ryan et al 2016 xiao 2010 with the latter being divided into two branches one that corresponds to parasites that infect humans c parvum anthroponotic species and the other that is found in animals c parvum kissinger 2019 nader et al 2019 foodborne parasitic diseases associated with wild fish and aquaculture products are well documented and pose major public health problems as some of them are highly pathogenic lima dos santos and howgate 2011 who 2004 despite the fact that parasites are fish pathogens their zoonotic potential is not confirmed in all cases ichthyozoonoses have significantly increased in proportion to the increase of the consumption of raw or minimally processed fish in relation to the growth of the international fish market keiser and utzinger 2005 mccarthy and moore 2000 nawa et al 2005 robinson and dalton 2009 c parvum zoonotic subtypes represent the most common source of zoonotic infection and their presence in fish host samples is probably related to water contamination by animal and human wastes ryan et al 2014 they have been detected in a great range of hosts and in various geographic regions figure 3 certad et al 2015 couso pérez et al 2018 koinari et al 2013 reid et al 2010 c parvum was firstly observed in fish when rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss was fed with a commercial feed contaminated with bovine isolated c parvum oocysts but no data on genotyping is available freire santos et al 1998 from 2010 to 2021 it has been detected in 18 freshwater and marine fish species for the cryptosporidium genotyping and subtyping samples have been screened at the 18s rrna ssu rdna actin and gp60 locus and zoonotic iia subtypes family have been identified table 4 in most cases subtyping at the gp60 locus has identified parasites as c parvum similar to the 18s rrna gene except for one case involving mackerel scad where the parasite c hominis subtype ida15g1 was identified indicating a mixed infection koinari et al 2013 c parvum has been detected in edible fish both wild and farmed the prevalence of infection was low in most cases the highest prevalence has been recorded in a case of trout species brown trout couso pérez et al 2019 and european trout in nw spain couso pérez et al 2018 the presence of the parasite in cultured trout is very important as stressful conditions during intensive aquaculture practices related to high population densities facilitates transmission of pathogens alvarez pellitero et al 2004 this fact is enforced by the increased prevalence in pre ongrowing and early ongrowing stages when hosts are immunologically immature as it has been reported in a case of other cryptosporidium species sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 the presence of c molnari in european perch perca fluviatilis fillets clearly highlights the risk of cryptosporidium infection to humans certad et al 2015 however this finding is probably related to the preparation process of the infected fish and their contamination during evisceration and cleaning certad et al 2015 this fact indicates the potential zoonotic risk of cross contamination from the fish digestive tract to the fish fillet in a case of c parvum infecting edible fish the handling of fish carrying zoonotic cryptosporidium species is a potential source of infection for humans transmission of cryptosporidium spp can be achieved either by consumption of undercooked fish or by contact with fish during preparation and handling especially in immunosuppressed patients mcoliver et al 2009 according to roberts et al 2007 fishermen are at risk of cryptosporidiosis after fishing and consuming captured fish depending on a variety of confounding factors such as immunity pre existing illnesses and other host specific factors this probability indicated that on average one to eight out of ten anglers could become infected based on a probabilistic risk assessment of fish and hand wash samples transmission of c parvum through handling has also been proven in a case of blue crabs graczyk et al 2007 fishborne zoonotic potential risk from cryptosporidium species is of major importance from a public health point of view the presence of these parasites in edible fish which are commonly consumed as raw or slightly processed without evisceration may be the etiological agent responsible for outbreaks of fishborne foodborne cryptosporidiosis fish could be a new source of infection for people even as mechanical carriers as far as parasites are present in species of commercial interest the risk of infection due to cross contaminated fish flesh during evisceration and processing at the transport and warehouse level remains even if the gastrointestinal tract is not consumed moratal et al 2020 7 pathological effect of piscine cryptosporidiosis the pathology of cryptosporidiosis in fish is very important considering the significant impact of pathogens on farm production and the aquaculture industry intensive aquaculture practices stressful conditions high host density water supply and temperature combined with the immunological immaturity of the host increase the prevalence morbidity mortality rates and interactions with other pathogens in young fish alvarez pellitero et al 2004 sitjà bobadilla et al 2005 piscine cryptosporidium species mainly infects the microvillus border of the gastrointestinal epithelium and sporulation takes place deep within the epithelium being intracellular in contrast to the epicellular location of cryptosporidium species in other vertebrates alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 palenzuela et al 2010 ryan et al 2004 2015 severe cryptosporidiosis is strongly related to heavy infection causing a variety of obvious clinical and pathological signs table 3 in these cases poor physical condition characterized by listlessness poor growth rate anorexia and increased mortality are recorded baragahare et al 2011 also muscle wasting and atrophy severe emaciation or swollen coelomic cavities and abdominal swelling ascites have been observed indigestion intestinal distension arising from mucous intestinal contents gas and whitish faeces are the main findings during necropsy alvarez pellitero et al 2004 hoover et al 1981 muench and white 1997 murphy et al 2009 zanguee et al 2010 mild to moderate gastritis is present in infected fish depending on the intensity of the parasitic disease sitjà bobadilla and alvarez pellitero 2003 necrosis vacuolisation degradation disaggregation and sloughing of epithelial cells are the main histopathological effects observed in infected tissues baragahare et al 2011 paperna and vilenkin 1996 in this case severe inflammation necrosis of gastric mucosal epithelial cells mucosal glandular atrophy and glandular loss may be present camus and lopez 1996 ryan et al 2004 in the lumen of severely infected fish wide vacuolated areas are occupied by clusters of oocysts and engulfed by hypertrophied cells probably macrophages alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 in moderately infected intestines mild intestinal lesions are observed while on the mucosal epithelium of infected fish displacement of the microvilli and focal indentation at attachment sites of the parasites is described hoover et al 1981 zahedi et al 2021 severe intestinal lesions are mentioned in massive infections and most of the epithelial surface is covered by oocysts the epithelial cells are distended by large vacuoles containing clusters of oocysts and the mucosal architecture is distorted a severe inflammatory response is mentioned and exocytosis of some lymphocytes into the epithelium an abundance of rodlet cells in infected epithelia and numerous goblet cells are also observed alvarez pellitero et al 2004 however in some cases no pathological changes have been observed alvarez pellitero et al 2009 certad et al 2015 landsberg and paperna 1986 which is probably related to the host s sensitivity and its response against the parasite the absence of pathological impact has been described in a case of seabass infected with c molnari in which the prevalence and intensity were low and oocysts appeared degenerated and surrounded by host cellular reaction alvarez pellitero and sitjà bobadilla 2002 the gastrointestinal tract is not the only target organ for cryptosporidium spp the parasite stages have been detected in other tissues as in the case of turbot causing necrosis of adjacent hepatic cells and fibrosis of the bile ducts saraiva et al 2009 in the case of koi carp severe granulomatous inflammatory lesions have been observed in the pale brown liver yang et al 2016 the spleen was swollen irregularly granular and superficial haemorrhages and hyperaemia were present on the skin and gills severe granulomatosis and extensive inflammation were described in the kidneys the spleen the base of the secondary lamellae the cartilage of the gills and between the skeletal muscles yang et al 2016 8 conclusions the dispersion and transmission of zoonotic parasites would be facilitated by the aquatic habitat of the host that could release oocysts contributing to cryptosporidium circulation and transmission the importance of piscine cryptosporidiosis for fish and public health is currently documented cryptosporidium species have been described in various studies pertaining to a great range of fish hosts and geographic regions ichthyozoonoses have increased significantly through the consumption of raw or minimally processed fish in the ever growing international fish market taking into consideration i the worldwide distribution of cryptosporidium in piscine hosts ii its zoonotic potential iii the increasing rate of fish consumption and iv the pathological effect of cryptosporidiosis in fish combined with the seafood industries expansion prevention and control of fishborne cryptosporidiosis are of major concern for research on a global scale for all seafood industries cryptosporidiosis can be considered important in fish and aquaculture since these animals may act as carriers and may be a source of infection for other aquatic hosts and also for humans since aquaculture industries are expanding worldwide information regarding the transmission routes and the control of cryptosporidium distribution in aquatic ecosystems should be globally prioritized initiative allowing for more efficient collaboration and the transferring of skills and technology between countries it can be of particular benefit for every country to address specific needs for food and livelihoods declaration of competing interest the

16829,the introduction of sars cov 2 containing human stool and sewage into water bodies may raise public health concerns however assessment of public health risks by faecally contaminated water is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 in water in the present study the decay rates of viable infectious sars cov 2 and sars cov 2 rna were determined in river and seawater at 4 and 20 c these decay rates were compared to s typhimurium bacteriophage ms2 and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov persistence of viable sars cov 2 was temperature dependent remaining infectious for significantly longer periods of time in both freshwater and seawater at 4 c than at 20 c t90 for infectious sars cov 2 in river water was 2 3 days and 3 8 days at 20 c and 4 c respectively the t90 values were 1 1 days and 2 2 days in seawater at 20 c and 4 c respectively in contrast to the rapid inactivation of infectious sars cov 2 in river and sea water viral rna was relatively stable the rna decay rates were increased in non sterilised river and seawater presumably due to the presence of microbiota the decay rates of infectious ms2 ms2 rna and pmmov rna differed significantly from the decay rate of sars cov 2 rna suggesting that their use as surrogate markers for the persistence of sars cov 2 in the environment is limited graphical abstract image graphical

2020 sars cov 2 a positive sense single stranded rna coronavirus causes respiratory disease that varies in severity and may ultimately prove to be fatal although the majority of infected individuals exhibit mild symptoms or are asymptomatic gorbalenya et al 2020 wang horby et al 2020 to date there are over 119 million confirmed cases globally resulting in 2 6 million deaths who 2020 although sars cov 2 initially causes infection of the upper respiratory tract it subsequently disseminates to other parts of the body recent studies have shown that 27 to 89 of infected individuals shed sars cov 2

the first week after symptoms develop wang xu et al 2020 the presence of sars cov 2 rna in stool samples of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals implies that wastewater surveillance is a viable means to monitor the circulation of sars cov 2 in the population bivins et al 2020b kitajima et al 2020 indeed following initial reports of detection of viral rna in the influent of wastewater treatment plants it now has been firmly established that the levels of sars cov 2 rna are a valuable and robust indicator of the prevalence of the virus in the community haramoto et al 2020 medema et al 2020 patel et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 sars cov 2 rna is relatively stable in sewage and non chlorinated drinking water ahmed et al 2020 a subsequent study showed that viable sars cov 2 decays in dechlorinated tap water and in sewage with t90 ranging between 1 6 and 2 1 days bivins et al 2020a however the persistence of the infectious sars cov 2 particle in the natural aquatic environment remains unknown it therefore not clear to what extent environmental contamination with untreated human sewage poses a risk to public health due to transmission of sars cov 2 to individuals coming into contact with sewage contaminated water la rosa et al 2020 pepper mild mottle virus pmmov has been recently proposed as human pollution indicator since it is the most abundant rna virus in human faeces and is present in high relative concentrations in sewage kitajima et al 2018 furthermore it has been evaluated as a virus process indicator for drinking water and sewage treatments symonds et al 2019 f specific coliphages have been widely used as an indicator of water quality as well as an indicator for the of enteric viruses in water disinfection treatments jofre et al 2016

study evaluates their persistence and their usefulness in aquatic environments as compared to infectious sars cov 2 in this study we determined the decay rates of viable infectious sars cov 2 and sars cov 2 rna in river and seawater these decay rates are compared to s typhimurium bacteriophage ms2 and pmmov showing that the latter behave differently than sars cov 2 and may therefore not be potential surrogates we show that the presence of microbiota increases the decay rates of sars cov 2 rna at 20 c 2 materials and methods 2 1 virus stock preparation a clinical strain of sars cov 2

in the environment and to assess public health risks of sewage spills it is critically important to know the decay rates of infectious viral particles under environmental conditions we therefore set up microcosm experiments in which filter sterilised river water and seawater was spiked with infectious sars cov 2 and incubated at 4 and 20 c in addition bacteriophage ms2 and pmmov were added at the start of the experiment to evaluate their usefulness as a surrogate for sars cov 2 following inoculation at a titre of 3 16 104 tcid50 ml infectious sars cov 2 titres remained stable for 24 hours in river water at both 4 and 20 c and in seawater at 4 c in contrast sars cov 2 infectivity in seawater at 20 c started to decline after 4 hours fig 1 infectious sars cov 2 was more stable in river water than in seawater and more stable at 4 than at 20 c fig 2 the first order decay rates ranged from 0 61 to 2 02 day 1 table 2 interestingly the decay rates for infectious sars cov 2 in seawater at both temperatures were higher than those for river water at the either temperature the estimated decay rate in river water at 4 c was 0 61 day 1 t90 3 8 days and 1 01 day 1 t90 2 3 days at 20 c whereas in seawater the decay rates were 1 07 day 1 t90 2 2 days and 2 02 day 1 t90 1 1 days table 3 in contrast to the rapid inactivation of infectious sars cov 2 in river and sea water the n1 rna marker was relatively stable showing no decline in river water for the duration 20 days of the experiment at either 4 or 20 c fig 4a at 4 c in seawater a decline was observed however it did not achieve 1 log10 reduction although the levels of the n1 marker did decline in sea water at 20 c the decay rate 0 14 day 1 t90 16 6 days was lower than those of the infectious particle fig 4a table 4 3 2 decay of potential sars cov 2 surrogates ms2 and pmmov in filter sterilised sea and river water bacteriophages or viruses abundant in human faeces e g ms2 or pmmov are used to monitor the water quality and may be used as surrogates to evaluate the environmental persistence of human pathogenic viruses which is why these two potential surrogates were included in sars cov 2 microcosms using filter sterilised sea and river water water was filter sterilised to avoid any risk of bacterial contamination or non specific cytopathic effects in the veroe6 cells used in the infectivity assays of sars cov 2 viable ms2 particles were most stable at 4 c in river and sea water fig 3 a the highest inactivation rate was observed in river water at 20 c t90 3 2 day 1 the t90 values in seawater were 10 2 and 7 8 days at 4 and 20 c respectively table 2 3 under all microcosm conditions tested here viable ms2 particles were more stable than infectious sars 2 cov 2 fig 2 3a table 2 3 the largest difference in decay rates was observed in river water at 4 c where the decay rate for viable sars cov 2 was 0 61 day 1 and ms2 particles did not exceed 1 log10 reduction during the course of the experiment 20 days the decay rates of infectious sars cov 2 and ms2 were most similar in river water microcosms at 20 c with only a 1 4 fold difference between sars cov 2 and ms2 table 2 in sharp contrast sars cov 2 rna was more stable than ms2 rna under all conditions tested sars cov 2 and ms2 rna decay rates were determined with a first order decay model so that these could be compared to the decay rates of the infectious particle the difference was most notable in river water in which sars cov 2 rna but not ms2 rna was completely stable for the duration 20 days of the experiment at 20 c fig 4 a c table 4 the differences were less pronounced in sea water where the decay rate for ms 2 rna was 1 2 fold larger than for sars cov 2 rna at 20 c table 4 the pmmov rna decay profile was similar to that of sars cov 2 fig 4a e in both cases viral rna was stable in river water at 4 and 20 c for the duration 20 days of the experiment both sars cov 2 rna and pmmov rna levels decayed slightly in seawater at both temperatures however they did not exceed 1 log10 reduction for the duration of the experiment 20 days 3 3 water microbiota increases viral and phage decay we studied the decay of infectious sars cov 2 in filter sterilised sea and river water to avoid any risk of bacterial contamination or non specific cytopathic effects in the veroe6 cells used in the infectivity assays however this removes the microbial microbiota from the microcosm experiment we therefore repeated the microcosm experiments using non sterilised river and sea water to examine the impact of the microbiota on viral and phage decay the effect of non filtered sea and river water was pronounced for infectious ms2 the decay rates of infectious ms2 in non filter sterilised water were 1 4 to 4 1 fold higher than in filter sterilised water table 2 the decay rates of infectious ms2 in non filter sterilised river 1 17 day 1 t90 2 0 days and non filter sterilised seawater 1 23 day 1 t90 1 9 days were similar at 20 c at 4 c ms2 t90 was 6 7 days 0 34 day 1 in seawater in contrast ms2 in non filter sterilised river water was stable for the duration of the experiment 20 days similar observations were made for sars cov 2 ms2 and pmmov river water 20 c rna where greater decay rates were observed in non filter sterilised than in filter sterilised water table 4 sars cov 2 rna was more stable in non filter sterilised water at 4 c whereas rapid inactivation occurred at 20 c table 4 5 as was the case for non filter sterilised water sars cov 2 rna is more stable in sea water t90 8 9 days than in river water t90 5 2 days similar results were obtained for ms2 while pmmov rna at 4 c and seawater at 20 c was stable only between sars cov 2 rna and ms2 rna in non filter sterilised freshwater at 20 c were decay rates similar t90 values were 5 2 and 5 0 days for sars cov 2 rna and ms2 rna respectively 4 discussion in this paper we show that although sars cov 2 rna is relatively stable in both sea and river water infectious sars cov 2 decays rapidly in both water matrices with faster decay rates in sea than in river water and at 20 c than at 4 c this is in agreement with other studies investigating persistence of coronaviruses in water matrices sars cov 1 infectivity has been reported to persist for 3 5 days in river water duan et al 2003 wang et al 2005 and sars cov 2 infectivity in dechlorinated tap water had a t90 of 1 7 days bivins et al 2020a in contrast mouse hepatitis virus a β coronavirus persisted for more than 14 days in lake water incubated at 4 c and for 10 days at 25 c casanova et al 2009 sizun et al 2000 sars cov 2 and other coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and are unable to maintain infectivity in the environment including in water matrices as long as non enveloped viruses such as norovirus an enteric virus that is also shed in faeces and can persist for 61 days in water at room temperature seitz et al 2011 salinity has previously been demonstrated to have a negative effect on influenza virus stability which is an enveloped rna virus dublineau et al 2011 in contrast to non enveloped enteric viruses which maintain infectivity in salinated water lo et al 1976 shedding of infectious sars cov 2 in the stool and urine of infected covid 19 patients is extremely low or undetectable despite detection of viral rna in these samples and in sewage ahmed et al 2020 bivins et al 2020b wang xu et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 this together with the rapid inactivation of sars cov 2 in both river and seawater strongly indicates that the likelihood of viral transmission through contact with sewage contaminated waters is low in contrast to sars cov 2 ms2 phage infectivity persisted for longer periods of time in all matrices and at both temperatures evaluated our data are similar to previous reports investigating ms2 infectivity in river water and seawater governal and gerba 1997 muniesa et al 2009 ogorzaly et al 2010 and the decay rates for sars cov 2 and ms2 were significantly different in all conditions tested this indicates that ms2 does not represent a relevant surrogate for persistence of coronaviruses and other enveloped viruses in water interestingly ms2 infectivity decayed more rapidly in non filter sterilised than in filter sterilised water this has been reported previously where the presence of a microbial population in water has a negative effect on virus survival rzezutka and cook 2004 yang and griffiths 2013 and filtration of lake water significantly prolonged infectivity of duck plague virus wolf and burke 1982 this may be due to the production of enzymes such as lipases and proteases as well as predation by for example protozoa heat treatment of water resulted in similar removal of antiviral factors hawley and garver 2008 yang and griffiths 2013 it therefore seems likely that infectious sars cov 2 decays more rapidly in the presence of microbiota than reported here for filter sterilised water in contrast to infectious sars cov 2 and ms2 viral rna from sars cov 2 ms2 and pmmov remained detectable for the duration of the experiment 20 days in non filter sterilised water ms2 and sars cov 2 rna decayed at a faster rate than in filter sterilised water this was particularly evident in seawater and river water incubated at room temperature similar to our observations that ms2 infectivity decreased at a faster rate in non sterile compared to sterile water indigenous microbial populations in water have been shown to have a negative effect on viral rna stability rzezutka and cook 2004 the persistence of viral rna in water in the present study supports the use of nucleic acid detection methods including pcr in the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna in environmental water samples pmmov rna remained stable for the 20 day period measured in the current study and ms2 rna decay rates differed significantly from those of sars cov 2 rna with the exception of non filtered water at 20 c pmmov is stable and persist longer times in aquatic environments in previous studies no significant decline has been observed thus pmmov could be considered as a conservative marker with respect to virus reduction kitajima et al 2018 rachmadi et al 2016 in sewage a recent study demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus mhv rna decay rates were similar to that of sars cov 2 indicating that this β coronavirus may represent a suitable surrogate for studies investigating the persistence of sars cov 2 rna in sewage and other water matrices ahmed et al 2020 in contrast ms2 and pmmov rna persistence did not correlate with sars cov 2 rna in the present study 5 conclusion we demonstrated that infectivity of sars cov 2 decreases rapidly in filter sterilised river and seawater water particularly at higher temperatures the data therefore suggest that river water and seawater contaminated with sewage containing faecal matter from sars cov 2 infected individuals is unlikely to contain high levels of infectious virus due to the rapid inactivation of the virus in these matrices infectious ms2 persists longer than infectious sars cov 2 in both river and seawater and is therefore not an appropriate surrogate for the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 under these conditions the decay rates of infectious sars cov 2 in river and seawater at 4 and 20 c far exceeds those of sars cov 2 rna even when the decay rates of sars cov 2 rna were determined in the presence of microbiota although measurement of sars cov 2 rna therefore demonstrates that sea or river water has been contaminated with the virus at some point in time in the past it is not a valid methodology to assess the presence of infectious sars cov 2 in the environment the decay rates of sars cov 2 rna ms2 rna and pmmov rna differed indicating that their use as surrogates for sars cov 2 is limited declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16829,the introduction of sars cov 2 containing human stool and sewage into water bodies may raise public health concerns however assessment of public health risks by faecally contaminated water is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 in water in the present study the decay rates of viable infectious sars cov 2 and sars cov 2 rna were determined in river and seawater at 4 and 20 c these decay rates were compared to s typhimurium bacteriophage ms2 and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov persistence of viable sars cov 2 was temperature dependent remaining infectious for significantly longer periods of time in both freshwater and seawater at 4 c than at 20 c t90 for infectious sars cov 2 in river water was 2 3 days and 3 8 days at 20 c and 4 c respectively the t90 values were 1 1 days and 2 2 days in seawater at 20 c and 4 c respectively in contrast to the rapid inactivation of infectious sars cov 2 in river and sea water viral rna was relatively stable the rna decay rates were increased in non sterilised river and seawater presumably due to the presence of microbiota the decay rates of infectious ms2 ms2 rna and pmmov rna differed significantly from the decay rate of sars cov 2 rna suggesting that their use as surrogate markers for the persistence of sars cov 2 in the environment is limited graphical abstract image graphical

2020 sars cov 2 a positive sense single stranded rna coronavirus causes respiratory disease that varies in severity and may ultimately prove to be fatal although the majority of infected individuals exhibit mild symptoms or are asymptomatic gorbalenya et al 2020 wang horby et al 2020 to date there are over 119 million confirmed cases globally resulting in 2 6 million deaths who 2020 although sars cov 2 initially causes infection of the upper respiratory tract it subsequently disseminates to other parts of the body recent studies have shown that 27 to 89 of infected individuals shed sars cov 2

the first week after symptoms develop wang xu et al 2020 the presence of sars cov 2 rna in stool samples of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals implies that wastewater surveillance is a viable means to monitor the circulation of sars cov 2 in the population bivins et al 2020b kitajima et al 2020 indeed following initial reports of detection of viral rna in the influent of wastewater treatment plants it now has been firmly established that the levels of sars cov 2 rna are a valuable and robust indicator of the prevalence of the virus in the community haramoto et al 2020 medema et al 2020 patel et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 sars cov 2 rna is relatively stable in sewage and non chlorinated drinking water ahmed et al 2020 a subsequent study showed that viable sars cov 2 decays in dechlorinated tap water and in sewage with t90 ranging between 1 6 and 2 1 days bivins et al 2020a however the persistence of the infectious sars cov 2 particle in the natural aquatic environment remains unknown it therefore not clear to what extent environmental contamination with untreated human sewage poses a risk to public health due to transmission of sars cov 2 to individuals coming into contact with sewage contaminated water la rosa et al 2020 pepper mild mottle virus pmmov has been recently proposed as human pollution indicator since it is the most abundant rna virus in human faeces and is present in high relative concentrations in sewage kitajima et al 2018 furthermore it has been evaluated as a virus process indicator for drinking water and sewage treatments

study evaluates their persistence and their usefulness in aquatic environments as compared to infectious sars cov 2 in this study we determined the decay rates of viable infectious sars cov 2 and sars cov 2 rna in river and seawater these decay rates are compared to s typhimurium bacteriophage ms2 and pmmov showing that the latter behave differently than sars cov 2 and may therefore not be potential surrogates we show that the presence of microbiota increases the decay rates of sars cov 2 rna at 20 c 2 materials and methods 2 1 virus stock preparation a clinical strain of sars cov 2

seawater the decay rates were 1 07 day 1 t90 2 2 days and 2 02 day 1 t90 1 1 days table 3 in contrast to the rapid inactivation of infectious sars cov 2 in river and sea water the n1 rna marker was relatively stable showing no decline in river water for the duration 20 days of the experiment at either 4 or 20 c fig 4a at 4 c in seawater a decline was observed however it did not achieve 1 log10 reduction although the levels of the n1 marker did decline in sea water at 20 c the decay rate 0 14 day 1 t90 16 6 days was lower than those of the infectious particle fig 4a table 4 3 2 decay of potential sars cov 2 surrogates ms2 and pmmov in filter sterilised sea and river water bacteriophages or viruses abundant in human faeces e g ms2 or pmmov are used to monitor the water quality and may be used as surrogates to evaluate the environmental persistence of human pathogenic viruses which is why these two potential surrogates were included in sars cov 2 microcosms using filter sterilised sea and river water water was filter sterilised to avoid any risk of bacterial contamination or non specific cytopathic effects in the veroe6 cells used in the infectivity assays of sars cov 2 viable ms2 particles were most stable at 4 c in river and sea water fig 3 a the highest inactivation rate was observed in river water at 20 c t90 3 2 day 1 the t90 values in seawater were 10 2 and 7 8 days at 4 and 20 c respectively table 2 3 under all microcosm conditions tested here viable ms2 particles were more stable than infectious sars 2 cov 2 fig 2 3a table 2 3 the largest difference in decay rates was observed in river water at 4 c where the decay rate for viable sars cov 2 was 0 61 day 1 and ms2 particles did not exceed 1 log10 reduction during the course of the experiment 20 days the decay rates of infectious sars cov 2 and ms2 were most similar in river water microcosms at 20 c with only a 1 4 fold difference between sars cov 2 and ms2 table 2 in sharp contrast sars cov 2 rna was more stable than ms2 rna under all conditions tested sars cov 2 and ms2 rna decay rates were determined with a first order decay model so that these could be compared to the decay rates of the infectious particle the difference was most notable in river water in which sars cov 2 rna but not ms2 rna was completely stable for the duration 20 days of the experiment at 20 c fig 4 a c table 4 the differences were less pronounced in sea water where the decay rate for ms 2 rna was 1 2 fold larger than for sars cov 2 rna at 20 c table 4 the pmmov rna decay profile was similar to that of sars cov 2 fig 4a e in both cases viral rna was stable in river water at 4 and 20 c for the duration 20 days of the experiment both sars cov 2 rna and pmmov rna levels decayed slightly in seawater at both temperatures however they did not exceed 1 log10 reduction for the duration of the experiment 20 days 3 3 water microbiota increases viral and phage decay we studied the decay of infectious sars cov 2 in filter sterilised sea and river water to avoid any risk of bacterial contamination or non specific cytopathic effects in the veroe6 cells used in the infectivity assays however this removes the microbial microbiota from the microcosm experiment we therefore repeated the microcosm experiments using non sterilised river and sea water to examine the impact of the microbiota on viral and phage decay the effect of non filtered sea and river water was pronounced for infectious ms2 the decay rates of infectious ms2 in non filter sterilised water were 1 4 to 4 1 fold higher than in filter sterilised water table 2 the decay rates of infectious ms2 in non filter sterilised river 1 17 day 1 t90 2 0 days and non filter sterilised seawater 1 23 day 1 t90 1 9 days were similar at 20 c at 4 c ms2 t90 was 6 7 days 0 34 day 1 in seawater in contrast ms2 in non filter sterilised river water was stable for the duration of the experiment 20 days similar observations were made for sars cov 2 ms2 and pmmov river water 20 c rna where greater decay rates were observed in non filter sterilised than in filter sterilised water table 4 sars cov 2 rna was more stable in non filter sterilised water at 4 c whereas rapid inactivation occurred at 20 c table 4 5 as was the case for non filter sterilised water sars cov 2 rna is more stable in sea water t90 8 9 days than in river water t90 5 2 days similar results were obtained for ms2 while pmmov rna at 4 c and seawater at 20 c was stable only between sars cov 2 rna and ms2 rna in non filter sterilised freshwater at 20 c were decay rates similar t90 values were 5 2 and 5 0 days for sars cov 2 rna and ms2 rna respectively 4 discussion in this paper we show that although sars cov 2 rna is relatively stable in both sea and river water infectious sars cov 2 decays rapidly in both water matrices with faster decay rates in sea than in river water and at 20 c than at 4 c this is in agreement with other studies investigating persistence of coronaviruses in water matrices sars cov 1 infectivity has been reported to persist for 3 5 days in river water duan et al 2003 wang et al 2005 and sars cov 2 infectivity in dechlorinated tap water had a t90 of 1 7 days bivins et al 2020a in contrast mouse hepatitis virus a β coronavirus persisted for more than 14 days in lake water incubated at 4 c and for 10 days at 25 c casanova et al 2009 sizun et al 2000 sars cov 2 and other coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and are unable to maintain infectivity in the environment including in water matrices as long as non enveloped viruses such as norovirus an enteric virus that is also shed in faeces and can persist for 61 days in water at room temperature seitz et al 2011 salinity has previously been demonstrated to have a negative effect on influenza virus stability which is an enveloped rna virus dublineau et al 2011 in contrast to non enveloped enteric viruses which maintain infectivity in salinated water lo et al 1976 shedding of infectious sars cov 2 in the stool and urine of infected covid 19 patients is extremely low or undetectable despite detection of viral rna in these samples and in sewage ahmed et al 2020 bivins et al 2020b wang xu et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 this together with the rapid inactivation of sars cov 2 in both river and seawater strongly indicates that the likelihood of viral transmission through contact with sewage contaminated waters is low in contrast to sars cov 2 ms2 phage infectivity persisted for longer periods of time in all matrices and at both temperatures evaluated our data are similar to previous reports investigating ms2 infectivity in river water and seawater governal and gerba 1997 muniesa et al 2009 ogorzaly et al 2010 and the decay rates for sars cov 2 and ms2 were significantly different in all conditions tested this indicates that ms2 does not represent a relevant surrogate for persistence of coronaviruses and other enveloped viruses in water interestingly ms2 infectivity decayed more rapidly in non filter sterilised than in filter sterilised water this has been reported previously where the presence of a microbial population in water has a negative effect on virus survival rzezutka and cook 2004 yang and griffiths 2013 and filtration of lake water significantly prolonged infectivity of duck plague virus wolf and burke 1982 this may be due to the production of enzymes such as lipases and proteases as well as predation by for example protozoa heat treatment of water resulted in similar removal of antiviral factors hawley and garver 2008 yang and griffiths 2013 it therefore seems likely that infectious sars cov 2 decays more rapidly in the presence of microbiota than reported here for filter sterilised water in contrast to infectious sars cov 2 and ms2 viral rna from sars cov 2 ms2 and pmmov remained detectable for the duration of the experiment 20 days in non filter sterilised water ms2 and sars cov 2 rna decayed at a faster rate than in filter sterilised water this was particularly evident in seawater and river water incubated at room temperature similar to our observations that ms2 infectivity decreased at a faster rate in non sterile compared to sterile water indigenous microbial populations in water have been shown to have a negative effect on viral rna stability rzezutka and cook 2004 the persistence of viral rna in water in the present study supports the use of nucleic acid detection methods including pcr in the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna in environmental water samples pmmov rna remained stable for the 20 day period measured in the current study and ms2 rna decay rates differed significantly from those of sars cov 2 rna with the exception of non filtered water at 20 c pmmov is stable and persist longer times in aquatic environments in previous studies no significant decline has been observed thus pmmov could be considered as a conservative marker with respect to virus reduction kitajima et al 2018 rachmadi et al 2016 in sewage a recent study demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus mhv rna decay rates were similar to that of sars cov 2 indicating that this β coronavirus may represent a suitable surrogate for studies investigating the persistence of sars cov 2 rna in sewage and other water matrices ahmed et al 2020 in contrast ms2 and pmmov rna persistence did not correlate with sars cov 2 rna in the present study 5 conclusion we demonstrated that infectivity of sars cov 2 decreases rapidly in filter sterilised river and seawater water particularly at higher temperatures the data therefore suggest that river water and seawater contaminated with sewage containing faecal matter from sars cov 2 infected individuals is unlikely to contain high levels of infectious virus due to the rapid inactivation of the virus in these matrices infectious ms2 persists longer than infectious sars cov 2 in both river and seawater and is therefore not an appropriate surrogate for the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 under these conditions the decay rates of infectious sars cov 2 in river and seawater at 4 and 20 c far exceeds those of sars cov 2 rna even when the decay rates of sars cov 2 rna were determined in the presence of microbiota although measurement of sars cov 2 rna therefore demonstrates that sea or river water has been contaminated with the virus at some point in time in the past it is not a valid methodology to assess the presence of infectious sars cov 2 in the environment the decay rates of sars cov 2 rna ms2 rna and pmmov rna differed indicating that their use as surrogates for sars cov 2 is limited declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
