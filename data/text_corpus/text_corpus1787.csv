8935,the water application rate ar and droplet kinetic energy are considered the most important indicators of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation however little information is available relating sprinkler performance parameters to soil runoff infiltration and erosion in this study nelson r33lp and r33 sprinklers were used in soil container experiments to investigate the effects of the ar and droplet kinetic energy on the runoff occurrence time surface runoff rate infiltration depth prior to runoff infiltration rate sediment yield soil loss and bulk density of the crust during sprinkler irrigation in silty clay loam the kinetic energy per unit droplet volume ked specific power sp and kinetic energy per unit area kea were selected as indicators of the droplet kinetic energy applied by the sprinkler the results indicate that the runoff occurrence time and the water cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff were in a negative power function relationship with the ar sp and kea the final runoff rate and the bulk density of the surface crust increased linearly while the final infiltration rate decreased linearly with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy during the soil erosion processes the runoff sediment concentration decreased while the soil loss rate increased and then decreased cumulative soil loss increased in the form of power function as the sp ar and kea increased in short the ar and sp were critical indicators for predicting the runoff occurrence time final runoff rate and infiltration depth prior to runoff under sprinkler irrigation the sp and kea were key indicators that affected the final infiltration rate soil erosion and surface seal when the ar increased from 24 16 to 145 30 mm h 1 and the sp increased from 0 09 to 0 55 w m 2 the final runoff rate and cumulative soil loss increased by approximately 850 and 938 respectively while the final infiltration rate decreased by 63 an ar of less than 20 mm h 1 and an sp of less than 0 1 w m 2 are recommended in sprinkler irrigation systems to minimize the risk of soil runoff and erosion for silty clay loam it is necessary to reasonably select the sprinkler spacing sprinkler type nozzle diameter and operating pressure to reduce soil erosion when designing sprinkler irrigation systems keywords sprinkler irrigation specific power runoff infiltration depth soil loss data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sprinkler irrigation is one of the most effective water saving techniques for alleviating water shortages in agricultural production chen et al 2022 twenty one percent of irrigated land in china and 55 of the irrigated farmland in the united states are equipped with sprinkler irrigation systems dieter et al 2018 ministry of water resources people s republic of china 2013 to increase water use efficiency and reduce water loss in sprinkler irrigation systems researchers have extensively studied the distributions of water application rates and droplet diameters for sprinkler irrigation ge et al 2018 hui et al 2021 chen et al 2021 runoff is considered the greatest cause of potential water loss in sprinkler irrigation systems schneider 2000 luz and heermann 2005 which can also lead to the loss of soil and fertilizer from farmland li et al 2017 however little information is available relating sprinkler performance parameters to soil runoff infiltration and erosion the peak water application rate and droplet kinetic energy were identified as the leading causes of soil runoff and erosion in sprinkler irrigation systems king and bjorneberg 2011 when the kinetic energy of droplets impacts the soil surface soil particles are detached and the sheet flow transports soil particles these are the main processes causing soil erosion angulo martínez and barros 2015 young and wiersma 1973 kinnell 2020 reported that raindrop impact and surface water flow could be involved individually or together in causing erosion liu et al 2019 evaluated the interactive effects of raindrop impact and groundwater seepage on soil erosion through a rainfall simulation experiment they concluded that raindrop impact and its kinetic energy increased the runoff rate soil loss and sediment concentration by approximately 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively additionally raindrop impact can break the bonds that hold the soil particles together and the detached macro aggregates may then compact and clog the soil pores promoting the formation of soil surface seals ela et al 1992 due to the creation of soil surface seals droplet impact is a primary factor in determining the reduction in water infiltration rates thompson and james 1985 king 2016 agassi et al 1994 found that the final infiltration rate decreased exponentially with an increase in droplet kinetic energy in addition droplet impact may aggravate the disturbance of soil surface structure a deterioration in aggregate stability results in decreased soil hydraulic conductivity and soil aeration increased susceptibility to surface runoff and soil erosion problems mandal et al 2008 furthermore li et al 2017 revealed how farmland nitrogen loss is caused by surface runoff demonstrating how the process of raindrop splash erosion can exacerbate the loss of chemical fertilizer and surface runoff from agricultural fields which are significant non point sources of pollution however although much of the research on soil erosion and surface runoff has focused on natural rainfall the same processes occur under sprinkler irrigation king 2016 silva 2006 thus predicting potential runoff is quite useful in designing and managing sprinkler irrigation systems al kayssi and mustafa 2016 the water application rate and kinetic energy of sprinkler water are important indicators of sprinkler irrigation quality zhang et al 2013 ge et al 2018 moreover many energy indicators are used to evaluate the kinetic energy of sprinkler water for example king and bjorneberg 2010 used area weighted kinetic energy per unit drop volume ked j l 1 application volume weighted kinetic energy per unit drop volume kev j l 1 and specific power w m 2 to represent the impact of droplet kinetic energy on the soil surface thompson et al 2001 quantified the effect of raindrop kinetic energy on soil runoff sediment and infiltration from a silt loam claypan soil noting that the soil loss was related to droplet energy de flux thompson and james 1985 found that soil infiltration decreased with increasing rainfall intensity kinetic energy per water droplet and water droplet energy flux since the duration of an experiment influences the soil discharge rates in soil erosion experiments kinnell 2020 droplet kinetic energy per unit area kea j m 2 was considered to be a suitable indicator of the droplet impact on the soil surface crust yan et al 2011 studies have indicated that droplet kinetic energy affects water infiltration processes and soil erosion and influences the proper design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems however there are few models and little data relating energy indicators of water to performance on particular soil types in regard to runoff infiltration and erosion in farmland irrigation crop canopies can reduce rainfall energy and vegetation coverage positively impacts the reduction of runoff and soil loss zhang et al 2022 nevertheless if the vegetation cover density is low or not fully developed at a distance of 0 3 m from the soil surface soil erosion and runoff will still occur urgeghe et al 2021 ma et al 2014 consequently the effects of water application rate and kinetic energy on runoff and infiltration of bare soil should be evaluated silty clay loam and silt loam are widely distributed in the south of the yangtze river the loess plateau northeast china and other regions zhang et al 2022 liu et al 2019 the sand content of silty clay loam is less than that of sandy loam and loam which leads to lower hydraulic conductivity and a propensity to crusting bissonnais et al 1989 the risk of potential runoff by droplet impact is higher for silty clay loam therefore it is vital to identify the influence of the application rate and droplet kinetic energy on infiltration runoff and erosion of silty clay loam to determine the allowable application rate of sprinkler irrigation systems the objectives of this study are 1 to measure runoff and erosion on silty clay loam soil under different application rates and kinetic energies of sprinkler water 2 to quantify the effects of energy indicators and the application rate on the occurrence time of runoff runoff rate water infiltration depth prior to runoff infiltration rate runoff sediment concentration soil loss and bulk density of the soil surface crust and 3 to provide a risk assessment method for assessing potential runoff by sprinkler irrigation and the allowable application rate in sprinkler irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup indoor experiments designed to evaluate droplet kinetic energy and soil infiltration capacity under sprinkler irrigation were conducted at the irrigation laboratory of the research center of fluid machinery engineering and technology jiangsu university zhenjiang city jiangsu province p r china the test apparatus comprised a water supply system sprinklers catch cans a two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd joanneum research co graz styria austria soil containers bases of soil containers runoff collection bottles four graduated cylinders 10 100 500 and 1000 ml and an electronic scale fig 1 shows the experimental setup water was supplied from a reservoir and delivered to a variable frequency pump 5 m3 h 1 580 kpa via a water supply pipe with a control valve to regulate the operating pressure at the sprinkler s inlet a magnetic flow meter range 0 50 m3 h 1 accuracy of 0 5 was used to measure the sprinkler s discharge flow rate the sprinkler was placed 1 55 m above the ground and a pressure gauge range 0 600 kpa accuracy of 0 4 was placed 0 15 m upstream of the nozzle nelson r33 and r33lp sprinklers nelson irrigation co walla walla wa 99362 2271 usa were selected for the experiments of the tested sprinklers the r33 sprinkler has a long throw distance and uniform coverage and is widely used in solid set sprinkler irrigation systems the r33lp sprinkler is a low pressure version of the r33 the purpose of the study was not to test the hydraulic performance of the r33 and r33lp sprinklers but to use them to obtain various ar and sp values under different operating conditions the catch cans and soil containers were plastic containers with an opening diameter of 215 mm and a height of 280 mm fig 2 a and 2 b the 2dvd was used to measure the diameter and velocity of droplets applied by the sprinkler fig 2 c fig 2 d shows a schematic of measuring planes of the 2dvd two vertically disposed ccd cameras inside the instrument made linear scans of the droplets passing through the test area and recorded the individual droplet size and the vertical and horizontal velocity components ge et al 2018 the measurement area of the 2dvd was 100 mm 100 mm fig 2 d the height from the ground to the center of the measurement area was 330 mm 2 2 soil container the soil containers were transparent plastic buckets of the same size and material as the catch can as shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b presents a sketch of the soil container ten holes each 4 mm in diameter were made at the bottom of each soil container to facilitate water outflow after infiltration two layers of gauze with a thickness of 1 mm were placed at the bottom of the soil container to prevent soil leakage from the holes two runoff holes with a diameter of 10 mm were cut into the lateral wall of the soil container the distance between the lower edge of the runoff hole and the bottom of the container was 250 mm and the distance between the upper edge of the runoff hole and the upper brim of the container was 20 mm in the horizontal direction the two runoff holes were symmetrical with the center axis of the soil container the runoff hole was connected with an l shaped plastic elbow with an outer diameter of 10 mm and the joint between the runoff hole and the plastic elbow was sealed with silicone glue a flexible pipe with an inner diameter of 10 mm was used to connect the plastic elbow and conduct runoff water into a runoff collection bottle with a capacity of 500 ml the runoff collection bottles were plastic containers with an opening diameter of 32 mm and a height of 192 mm as shown in fig 2 a a transparent plastic film was wrapped around the soil container to prevent spray droplets from entering directly through the upper opening of the runoff collection bottle during the test the runoff collection device was covered with plastic film two bricks were used as a base for each soil container fig 2 a to facilitate the outflow of irrigation water after infiltration and to prevent the ground surface water from infiltrating the soil through the holes at the bottom of the soil container the base of the soil container was 100 mm high 2 3 soil packing and preparation the soil for the experiment was obtained from typical farmland in zhenjiang jiangsu china only the topsoil 0 50 cm was removed and air dried for two weeks all samples were passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve to standardize the soil and minimize spatial variability particle size distribution was measured by a laser particle size analyzer ms 2000 malvern united kingdom the soil texture was classified as silty clay loam according to the usda soil taxonomy 33 94 clay 61 72 silt and 4 34 sand with an initial soil water content of 0 11 cm3 cm 3 the soil was added to the soil container in successive 5 cm layers with an average soil bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 for each layer the soil was manually compacted to a previously calculated height using a circular steel pad to achieve the density after compaction a roughening process was conducted to ensure that the upper surface of each layer was sufficiently rough to prevent the occurrence of soil stratification cai et al 2018 five total layers were used the depth of soil loading was 25 cm and this depth ensured that the soil surface was flushed with the lower edge of the runoff holes fig 2 b the ground of the irrigation laboratory had a slope of 1 to facilitate floor drainage 2 4 experimental procedures the r33lp sprinklers were equipped with two nozzles with diameters of 4 8 and 5 2 mm and operated at the working pressures of 100 150 and 200 kpa under rotating working conditions in practice multiple sprinklers are combined in rectangular or triangular spacings for irrigation zhang et al 2013 the overlapped application rate was greater than that of a single sprinkler due to the space limitation of the laboratory it was difficult to conduct combined sprinkler irrigation tests the orifice nozzle of the r33 sprinkler was fixed non rotating during the experiments to obtain greater application rates from a single r33 sprinkler the working pressures of the r33 sprinkler were 200 300 and 400 kpa with a nozzle diameter of 4 4 mm according to the research on distribution patterns of water application and kinetic energy for the r33 and r33lp sprinklers in the radial direction the water application rate and kinetic energy differ at varying distances from the sprinkler chen et al 2022 additionally the specific power of the spray droplet is low near the sprinkler which is unlikely to lead to surface runoff ge et al 2020 therefore sampling locations within 5 11 m of the sprinkler were selected for the test the experiment comprised four parts 1 determinations of the water application rate and droplet kinetic energy of the sprinkler at the sampling location 2 an experiment on the soil runoff rate under sprinkler irrigation at the sampling location 3 tests of sediment concentration in runoff collection bottle and soil loss during the sheet erosion and 4 a test to measure the bulk density of the soil surface crust in the test of the water application rate the catch cans were placed at 0 5 m intervals within 5 11 m of the sprinkler in the radial direction at each sampling location the catch can was placed at the base of the soil container to ensure that the height of the catch can was the same as that of the soil container in the experiment for each combination of sprinkler and working pressure the test was 1 h in duration the water volume from each catch can was manually measured using graduated cylinders water volume was recorded immediately after each test to reduce evaporation losses the depth of the water in each catch can was calculated based on the catch can s opening area and the water volume during the test the indoor temperature of the laboratory was 22 c and the water temperature in the reservoir was 16 c the relative humidity was 75 and the daily evaporation was 1 2 mm the 2dvd was used to measure the diameter and velocity of the droplets applied by the sprinkler the 2dvd was moved along the radial direction of the spray jet and the testing locations were set at 0 5 m increments within the range of 5 11 m from the sprinkler measurements were taken by the 2dvd at each testing location at least every 10 min ensuring that more than 5000 water droplets were collected at each testing location after the tests of the water application rate and droplet kinetic energy of the sprinkler at the sampling location the soil container and runoff collection bottles were placed at the base of the soil container in the sampling location as presented in fig 2 a simultaneously the time at which the soil container began to be irrigated was recorded when water runoff occurred in the collection bottles the bottle was replaced by an empty collection bottle meanwhile the time at which the runoff occurred was recorded the runoff collection bottles were then replaced every 3 min for the soil container the runoff volume was measured using graduated cylinders the irrigation continued until a generally steady surface runoff rate was obtained as there were various water application rates and droplet kinetic energies the irrigation time varied for different sampling locations in this test the irrigation time ranged from 1 05 to 5 0 h for the sampling locations the collected runoff water was placed indoors for 24 h to let the suspended sediment settle the clear supernatant was decanted and the remaining sediment was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine the soil loss and calculate the sediment concentration after each irrigation test the soil container was placed in an indoor ventilated place for 48 h to ensure the soil surface was slightly dry for each soil container three clods of soil surface crust with a thickness of 5 mm were sampled the bulk density of the soil surface crust was measured by the film method yan et al 2011 the soil crust was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h it was then weighed and put into a film solution containing polyolefin resin and gasoline 1 1 by volume for 5 20 s and taken out for air drying for 24 h next the soil crust was put into another film solution containing polyolefin resin and gasoline 1 4 by volume for 5 s and taken out for air drying for another 24 h the volume of the soil crust was then measured using the archimedes method the bulk density of soil surface crust data was averaged for the three samples for each sampling location 2 5 data processing 2 5 1 water application rate the water application rate from the sprinklers at a given location was calculated using eq 1 1 ar v w a t w where ar is the water application rate from sprinklers mm h 1 v w

was computed for each sprinkler as follows king and bjorneberg 2010 king 2016 4 sp ke d ar 3600 kea was calculated using eq 5 5 ke a ke d ar t where t is the irrigation time in the test of runoff h 2 5 3 runoff and infiltration the soil surface runoff rate δr mm h was calculated using eq 6 which incorporated the runoff water volume δv mm3 soil surface area and runoff duration 6 r v a t c where t c

the amount of soil lost per unit area in unit time which is an important indicator of the degree of soil erosion liu et al 2019 sl was calculated using the following formula 10 s l m s a t c 2 5 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using sigmaplot 10 0 systat software inc an independent samples t test was used to test the significant difference in the occurrence time of

application rate droplet kinetic energy and other parameters of the sampling locations for the experiment thirty six sampling locations with various application rates and kinetic energies were selected in the runoff test the sampling locations with r33 sprinklers under fixed working conditions were denoted by f1 f21 and those with r33lp sprinklers under rotating working conditions by r1 r15 fig 3 shows the average soil surface runoff rate water application rate and specific power of sampling locations r1 r15 during the 5 h of the runoff test it shows that the runoff rate increased with the increasing water application rate and specific power the droplet energy was transferred by the water during sprinkler irrigation although the ked values of r1 r15 were high at 10 19 33 97 j l 1 the low ar values of 1 41 11 35 mm h 1 resulted in low runoff rates the runoff rates of r1 r15 were below 1 0 mm h 1 when the ar values were less than 4 mm h 1 the runoff rates were less than 0 16 mm h 1 in fact when the ar was less than 2 mm h 1 runoff did not occur in the first 4 h of the runoff test when the ar was less than 11 35 mm h 1 it was difficult to generate runoff and soil erosion therefore the impact of droplet kinetic energy on runoff and soil erosion for sampling locations r1 r15 was not considered in further analysis the data from sampling locations f1 f21 was used to further analyze the effects of the water application rate and droplet kinetic energy on runoff and soil erosion additionally the test data on droplet velocity by the 2dvd shows that the values of mean droplet trajectory angle ranged from 72 to 86 for sampling locations f1 f21 although the droplet impact angle and shear stress were considered important indicators of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation hui et al 2022 they were ignored in this study because of the minor difference in droplet trajectory angle 3 2 surface runoff fig 4 represents the relationships between the occurrence time of runoff and the sprinkler irrigation parameters it shows that the occurrence time of runoff has a negative power function relationship with the ar sp and kea with increases in the ar sp and kea the occurrence time of runoff decreased fig 4 also shows the fitting curves of the data on the runoff occurrence time and sprinkler irrigation parameters the fitting degree between the occurrence time of runoff and the ar was highest with an r 2 of 0 967 as shown in fig 4 a when the ar increased from 0 mm h 1 to 60 mm h 1 the runoff occurrence time decreased when the ar was greater than 60 mm h 1 the trend of degression of the runoff occurrence time slowed with the increasing ar when the ar was greater than 150 mm h 1 the surface runoff occurred 4 min after the start of irrigation which meant that the higher the ar the greater the risk of surface runoff by sprinkler irrigation in practical irrigation the duration of one irrigation event depends primarily on crop water demand and the sprinkler s ar if the irrigation time is less than the occurrence time of runoff corresponding to the ar there is no runoff loss in the irrigation process fig 4 shows that the fitting degree between the occurrence time of runoff and sp was good with an r 2 of 0 920 the runoff time was negatively related to sp and their relationship can be fitted using the power function some research has indicated that sp is an important parameter for studying and predicting potential runoff reflecting the distribution of precipitation energy of the sprinkler irrigation system bautista capetillo et al 2012 king and bjorneberg 2012 thompson et al 2001 as shown in figs 4 b and 4 d the fitting coefficient of the runoff occurrence time of ked was 0 105 and that of kea was 0 680 the regression analysis indicated no significant relationship between ked and runoff occurrence p 0 186 this result was consistent with the findings of yan et al 2011 from their runoff experiment with sandy loam the hydraulic conductivity of silty clay loam compared with that of sandy loam was lower under the same soil bulk density therefore the silty clay loam was more likely to produce surface runoff when the ar was greater than the soil water infiltration rate in light of the analysis above predictive models of the runoff occurrence time t r min based on the ar and sp were derived using the following equations 12 t r 9258 949 ar 1 506 r 2 0 967 13 t r 1 060 sp 1 534 r 2 0 920 the statistical analysis found that the rmse values were 3 07 and 4 75 for eqs 12 and 13 respectively the values of r 2 were greater than 0 92 which indicated a good agreement between the test data and the model outputs the relationships between the runoff rate and irrigation time under different water application rates and variations in the droplet kinetic energy of the sprinkler are shown in fig 5 after an occurrence of surface runoff the runoff rate increased rapidly as time passed the increasing trend in the runoff rate became slower and gradually became stable when the runoff finally approached a stable rate the rate fluctuated in a narrow range this was because for most sprays the jet from the nozzle finally broke into small droplets through oscillation and air drag chen et al 2021 the oscillation in the process of jet breakup caused fluctuation in the ar from the sprinkler mandating that the test duration of the rotating sprinkler be no less than 1 h and that of the fixed sprinkler be no less than 0 5 h during the water application rate test iso 15886 3 2016 in this study the interval of runoff collection was 3 min and the fluctuation in the ar over a short period led to a fluctuation in the runoff rate therefore the final runoff rate was taken as the average of the runoff rate after it became almost stable as shown in fig 5 with the increase in the ar and droplet kinetic energy the growth in the runoff rate became more rapid after runoff had occurred in addition the greater the ar and kinetic energy the higher the runoff rate fig 6 shows the relationships between the final runoff rate and sprinkler irrigation parameters the final runoff rate increased with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy the final runoff rate was linearly correlated with the ar sp and kea and the fitting coefficients were greater than 0 654 the regression analysis revealed that the ar sp and kea had significant influences on the final runoff rate p values 0 001 while the effect of ked on the final runoff rate was not significant p 0 055 as illustrated in fig 6 the final runoff rate was positively related to the ar and the fitting degree between them was the highest with an r 2 of 0 919 silva 2017 noted that sprinkler irrigation systems applied water with high application rates leading to significant surface runoff as shown in fig 6 when the ar was greater than 60 mm h 1 the final runoff rate was approximately 80 of the ar at this point 80 of the irrigation water was lost in the form of runoff king and bjorneberg 2011 found that a 50 reduction in the sprinkler flow rate reduced runoff by 60 80 under the same irrigation amount thus it is necessary to avoid using sprinklers with great flow rates and high ars when designing sprinkler irrigation systems in light of the influences of the ar and droplet kinetic energy on the final runoff rate δr f mm h 1 two empirical equations were developed to estimate the δrf value 14 r f 0 807 ar 0 227 r 2 0 919 15 r f 173 090 sp 23 290 r 2 0 755 statistical analysis showed that the rmse was 8 96 and r 2 was 0 92 for eq 14 and the rmse was 15 56 and r 2 was 0 76 for eq 15 the validation results confirmed that the final runoff rate was well predicted by the ar 3 3 infiltration fig 7 presents the relationships between water cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff and sprinkler irrigation parameters with the increase in the ar and kinetic energy the cumulative infiltration depth decreased as with the occurrence time of runoff the infiltration depth prior to runoff was found to have a negative power function relationship with the ar sp and kea the regression analysis revealed that the ar sp and kea had significant influences on the cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff p values 0 001 while the effect of ked on infiltration depth was not significant p 0 051 as shown in fig 7 the cumulative infiltration depth was negatively related to the sp and the fitting degree between them was the highest with an r 2 of 0 755 when the sp increased from 0 20 to 0 55 w m 2 the infiltration depth prior to runoff decreased from 17 12 to 10 27 mm this result was different from that of yan et al 2011 who reported that the infiltration depth prior to runoff was relatively stable at 21 mm for the sandy loam soil as the sp was between 0 27 and 0 71 w m 2 since the hydraulic conductivity of sandy loam was higher than that of the silty clay loam the infiltration depths obtained by this study were smaller than those of yan under the same sp values three equations for estimating the cumulative infiltration depth i mm were developed on the basis of the different values of the ar sp and kea eqs 16 17 and 18 16 i 7 594 sp 0 505 r 2 0 755 17 i 201 696 ar 0 577 r 2 0 695 18 i 1127 617 ke a 0 614 r 2 0 669 the statistical analysis showed that the values of rmse for eqs 16 17 and 18 were 3 14 3 50 and 3 65 respectively fig 8 shows the variation in infiltration rates with the irrigation time under different ars and droplet kinetic energies at the beginning of the irrigation the soil infiltration rate was relatively high equivalent to the sprinkler s water application rate as time passed surface runoff occurred and the soil water infiltration rate decreased rapidly and gradually stabilized this trend was similar to that obtained by al kayssi and mustafa 2016 in this study the soil water infiltration rate was calculated by subtracting the runoff rate from the sprinkler s application rate similar to the runoff rate due to the fluctuation in the ar the infiltration rate fluctuated in a narrow range and tended to be stable as shown in fig 8 with the increases in the ar and kinetic energy the decreasing trend in the infiltration rate was accelerated during sprinkler irrigation the impact of the droplets broke down the macro aggregates which sealed the soil surface by compacting and clogging the soil pores resulting in runoff and low infiltration ela et al 1992 with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy the disturbance of the soil surface structure was aggravated the process of soil surface compaction became shorter the occurrence time of runoff decreased the growth of runoff rate became more rapid and the decreasing trend of infiltration rate was accelerated the final infiltration rate was taken as the average of the infiltration rate after it became almost stable fig 9 shows the relationships between the final infiltration rate and sprinkler irrigation parameters the final infiltration rate decreased with the increasing ar ked sp and kea the values of the ar ked sp and kea were in a linear correlation with the final infiltration as shown in fig 9 with r 2 values of 0 89 and 0 88 respectively kea and sp had a better fit to the final infiltration rate agassi et al 1994 found that the final infiltration rate decreased exponentially with an increase in droplet kinetic energy because of the soil surface seal formation this conclusion was not supported by the results of this study as the soil textures were different agassi et al 1994 tested two types of kaolin ustochrepts and paleudalf the differences in soil texture and soil bulk density led to the differences in the soil water infiltration characteristics in light of the influence of droplet kinetic energy on the final infiltration rate ir f mm h 1 two empirical equations for predicting irf were derived eqs 19 and 20 19 ir f 23 035 sp 18 487 r 2 0 878 20 ir f 0 006 ke a 19 298 r 2 0 886 3 4 sediment and soil erosion the variations in the runoff sediment concentration with irrigation time under different ars and droplet kinetic energies are shown in fig 10 the sediment concentration was higher when runoff was first observed sediment concentration then decreased as the irrigation continued and finally tended toward a stable value fig 10 shows that with the increase in the ar and kinetic energy the sediment concentration at the start of the runoff increased while the final sediment concentration decreased regarding sampling locations f15 ar 62 08 mm h 1 sp 0 11 w m 2 f12 ar 113 90 mm h 1 sp 0 36 w m 2 and f21 ar 153 89 mm h 1 sp 0 53 w m 2 the sediment concentrations of these locations were 2 55 4 40 and 11 07 g l 1 respectively at the start of runoff and the average sediment concentrations of f15 f12 and f21 were 0 99 0 66 and 0 74 g l 1 respectively after sediment yield became stable fig 11 shows that the soil loss rates changed with irrigation time during the erosion processes under different ars and kinetic energies as the kinetic energy of droplets impacted the soil surface soil particles were detached and overland flow transported the soil particles these were the main processes causing soil erosion young and wiersma 1973 angulo martínez and barros 2015 as shown in fig 11 after the runoff occurred the soil loss rate increased and then decreased with a peak value at a certain time during soil erosion some of the detached soil particles flowed away along the runoff while the rest sealed the soil surface by compacting and clogging the soil pores the formation of the soil seal somewhat alleviated the separation of the soil particles caused by the impact of the droplets therefore the soil loss rate decreased after it had reached a peak value however the variation amplitudes of soil loss rate were different under various ars and sps as shown in fig 11 the soil loss rates for f15 and f16 changed slightly with irrigation time whereas those for f17 and f18 decreased rapidly and eventually tend to stabilize after the peak soil loss rates additionally the peak soil loss rates of f17 and f18 157 00 and 317 31 g m 2 h 1 were greater than those of f15 and f16 61 70 and 80 43 g m 2 h 1 meaning that as the ar and sp increased the disturbance of the soil surface structure increased resulting in a rapid increase in soil loss rate after runoff occurred the impact of the droplets promoted the formation of the soil seal the soil seal formed faster with the greater ar and sp the bulk density of the surface crust increased with the increasing sp yan et al 2011 greater sp led to a stabler soil surface seal the formation of soil seal alleviated the separation of soil particles produced by droplet impact thus for f17 and f18 after the soil loss rate climbed to the peak value it decreased rapidly and eventually tended to stabilize fig 12 shows the relationships between sprinkler irrigation parameters and cumulative soil loss during the runoff test cumulative soil loss increased with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy applied by the sprinkler a power function relationship was observed between the cumulative soil loss and the ar sp and kea and the fitting coefficients were 0 76 0 80 and 0 72 respectively the regression analysis revealed that the effects of the sp ar and kea on cumulative soil loss were significant p values 0 001 the impact of the droplet kinetic energy on the soil surface was a primary factor in determining the soil surface seal the formation of the surface soil seal leads to lower infiltration and more runoff ela et al 1992 to evaluate the effect of the sprinkler ar and droplet kinetic energy on the surface soil structure fig 13 shows the relationships between the irrigation parameters and the bulk density of the surface soil crust after the runoff test as shown in fig 13 the bulk density of the surface crust was positively correlated with the ar sp kea and ked when the ar increased from 24 16 mm h 1 to 153 89 mm h 1 the bulk density of the surface crust increased from 1 42 mg m 3 to 1 58 mg m 3 it then increased from 1 42 mg m 3 to 1 63 mg m 3 when the sp increased from 0 07 w m 2 to 0 55 w m 2 this observation indicated that the greater the ar and droplet kinetic energy the denser the surface seal formed and the greater the bulk density of the surface crust after the sprinkler irrigation event it explains why with the increasing ar and kinetic energy the final infiltration rate decreased and the final runoff rate increased in addition compared with the packed soil bulk density of 1 35 mg m 3 the bulk density of the surface crust increased by 3 70 22 22 when the ar increased from 24 16 mm h 1 to 153 89 mm h 1 it means that the increase in the ar and droplet kinetic energy aggravated the disturbance of the soil surface structure which was accompanied by an increase in the peak value of the runoff sediment concentration and cumulative soil loss as shown in fig 13 the sp and kea fitted well with the bulk density of the surface crust with fitting coefficients of 0 89 and 0 88 meaning that compared with the ar and ked the sp and kea better reflect the disturbance of the soil surface due to the droplets impact in previous studies the sp has been regarded as an energy index of soil erosion king and bjorneberg 2010 ge et al 2018 liu et al 2019 also found that the kinetic energy of the droplets better reflected the droplet impact on soil erosion than the ar did their experiment on silt loam found that the kinetic energy of the droplets increased soil losses and sediment concentrations by approximately 74 696 and 64 560 respectively under the same irrigation ar in addition yan et al 2011 noted that irrigation time should be considered an important factor affecting the development of the soil crust as the soil seal formation depends on successive droplets impacts as illustrated in eqs 3 4 and 5 compared with sp and ked the kea considered the influence of irrigation time on droplet kinetic energy two empirical equations were developed to estimate the bulk density of the surface crust bd s mg m 3 based on the sp and kea 21 bd s 0 421 sp 1 401 r 2 0 886 22 bd s 0 0001 ke a 1 387 r 2 0 876 the impact of the droplets broke down the macro aggregates of the soil surface part of the detached soil particles sealed the soil surface by compacting and clogging the soil pores and the other particles were transported by the overland flow these were the main processes causing the soil surface seal and soil erosion young and wiersma 1973 ela et al 1992 angulo martínez and barros 2015 the runoff sediment concentration and soil loss rate increased and then decreased with the irrigation time figs 10 and 11 which indicates that the formation of the soil surface seal could alleviate soil erosion and soil loss to some extent however the surface seal would lead to an increase in the bulk density of the surface soil and a decrease in soil porosity resulting in a decrease in the soil water infiltration rate and an increase in the surface runoff rate luz and heermann 2005 reported that the surface crust formation significantly affected the estimation of potential runoff in center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems additionally when a crust developed on the soil surface the water and fertilizer applied by sprinklers would not entirely infiltrate the soil and become absorbed by the roots of the crop plants instead fertilizers would flow away in the form of surface runoff which would not only reduce the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer in sprinkler irrigation but would also pollute the environment when the runoff containing fertilizer flowed into rivers meanwhile the surface seal would promote soil compaction which negatively influences the root respiration of crop plants oxygen limitation can easily occur in crop roots resulting in slowed growth of the crops and reduced crop yield therefore when the soil crust is formed soil permeability should be improved through timely shallow tillage 4 conclusions runoff is considered the largest cause of potential water loss in sprinkler irrigation which leads to decreased water application efficiency using soil container experiments this study quantified the effects of water application rate and droplet kinetic energy on soil runoff infiltration and erosion under sprinkler irrigation the ar and sp were found to be critical indicators for predicting the occurrence time of runoff final runoff rate and water cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff under sprinkler irrigation whereas the sp and kea were key indicators that affected the final infiltration rate soil erosion and soil surface seal the runoff occurrence time and cumulative infiltration depth were negatively related to the ar and sp and their relationships can be fitted using power functions when the ar was less than 30 mm h 1 and the sp was lower than 0 1 w m 2 the runoff occurrence time would be longer than 36 min and the cumulative infiltration depth would be greater than 24 mm the predictions for the runoff occurrence time and cumulative infiltration depth can be used to determine the duration and irrigation amount for one sprinkler irrigation event the final runoff rate amount of soil loss and bulk density of the surface crust linearly increased while the final infiltration rate linearly decreased as the ar sp and kea increased an ar of less than 20 mm h 1 and an sp of less than 0 1 w m 2 are recommended in sprinkler irrigation systems to minimize the risk of soil runoff and erosion for silty clay loam in designing sprinkler irrigation systems soil runoff and erosion can be reduced by reasonably selecting the sprinkler spacing sprinkler type nozzle diameter and operating pressure the empirical models proposed in this study which describe the relationships between sprinkler performance parameters and soil erosion were focused on solid set sprinkler irrigation systems in addition since only one soil with one initial soil water content and one soil bulk density was used in this study the effects of the ar sp and kea on different soil types initial soil water contents and soil bulk densities need to be investigated in future research declaration of competing interest the

8935,the water application rate ar and droplet kinetic energy are considered the most important indicators of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation however little information is available relating sprinkler performance parameters to soil runoff infiltration and erosion in this study nelson r33lp and r33 sprinklers were used in soil container experiments to investigate the effects of the ar and droplet kinetic energy on the runoff occurrence time surface runoff rate infiltration depth prior to runoff infiltration rate sediment yield soil loss and bulk density of the crust during sprinkler irrigation in silty clay loam the kinetic energy per unit droplet volume ked specific power sp and kinetic energy per unit area kea were selected as indicators of the droplet kinetic energy applied by the sprinkler the results indicate that the runoff occurrence time and the water cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff were in a negative power function relationship with the ar sp and kea the final runoff rate and the bulk density of the surface crust increased linearly while the final infiltration rate decreased linearly with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy during the soil erosion processes the runoff sediment concentration decreased while the soil loss rate increased and then decreased cumulative soil loss increased in the form of power function as the sp ar and kea increased in short the ar and sp were critical indicators for predicting the runoff occurrence time final runoff rate and infiltration depth prior to runoff under sprinkler irrigation the sp and kea were key indicators that affected the final infiltration rate soil erosion and surface seal when the ar increased from 24 16 to 145 30 mm h 1 and the sp increased from 0 09 to 0 55 w m 2 the final runoff rate and cumulative soil loss increased by approximately 850 and 938 respectively while the final infiltration rate decreased by 63 an ar of less than 20 mm h 1 and an sp of less than 0 1 w m 2 are recommended in sprinkler irrigation systems to minimize the risk of soil runoff and erosion for silty clay loam it is necessary to reasonably select the sprinkler spacing sprinkler type nozzle diameter and operating pressure to reduce soil erosion when designing sprinkler irrigation systems keywords sprinkler irrigation specific power runoff infiltration depth soil loss data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sprinkler irrigation is one of the most effective water saving techniques for alleviating water shortages in agricultural production chen et al 2022 twenty one percent of irrigated land in china and 55 of the irrigated farmland in the united states are equipped with sprinkler irrigation systems dieter et al 2018 ministry of water resources people s republic of china 2013 to increase water use efficiency and reduce water loss in sprinkler irrigation systems researchers have extensively studied the distributions of water application rates and droplet diameters for sprinkler irrigation ge et al 2018 hui et al 2021 chen et al 2021 runoff is considered the greatest cause of potential water loss in sprinkler irrigation systems schneider 2000 luz and heermann 2005 which can also lead to the loss of soil and fertilizer from farmland li et al 2017 however little information is available relating sprinkler performance parameters to soil runoff infiltration and erosion the peak water application rate and droplet kinetic energy were identified as the leading causes of soil runoff and erosion in sprinkler irrigation systems king and bjorneberg 2011 when the kinetic energy of droplets impacts the soil surface soil particles are detached and the sheet flow transports soil particles these are the main processes causing soil erosion angulo martínez and barros 2015 young and wiersma 1973 kinnell 2020 reported that raindrop impact and surface water flow could be involved individually or together in causing erosion liu et al 2019 evaluated the interactive effects of raindrop impact and groundwater seepage on soil erosion through a rainfall simulation experiment they concluded that raindrop impact and its kinetic energy increased the runoff rate soil loss and sediment concentration by approximately 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively additionally raindrop impact can break the bonds that hold the soil particles together and the detached macro aggregates may then compact and clog the soil pores promoting the formation of soil surface seals ela et al 1992 due to the creation of soil surface seals droplet impact is a primary factor in determining the reduction in water infiltration rates thompson and james 1985 king 2016 agassi et al 1994 found that the final infiltration rate decreased exponentially with an increase in droplet kinetic energy in addition droplet impact may aggravate the disturbance of soil surface structure a deterioration in aggregate stability results in decreased soil hydraulic conductivity and soil aeration increased susceptibility to surface runoff and soil erosion problems mandal et al 2008 furthermore li et al 2017 revealed how farmland nitrogen loss is caused by surface runoff demonstrating how the process of raindrop splash erosion can exacerbate the loss of chemical fertilizer and surface runoff from agricultural fields which are significant non point sources of pollution however although much of the research on soil erosion and surface runoff has focused on natural rainfall the same processes occur under sprinkler irrigation king 2016 silva 2006 thus predicting potential runoff is quite useful in designing and managing sprinkler irrigation systems al kayssi and mustafa 2016 the water application rate and kinetic energy of sprinkler water are important indicators of sprinkler irrigation quality zhang et al 2013 ge et al 2018 moreover many energy indicators are used to evaluate the kinetic energy of sprinkler water for example king and bjorneberg 2010 used area weighted kinetic energy per unit drop volume ked j l 1 application volume weighted kinetic energy per unit drop volume kev j l 1 and specific power w m 2 to represent the impact of droplet kinetic energy on the soil surface thompson et al 2001 quantified the effect of raindrop kinetic energy on soil runoff sediment and infiltration from a silt loam claypan soil noting that the soil loss was related to droplet energy de flux thompson and james 1985 found that soil infiltration decreased with increasing rainfall intensity kinetic energy per water droplet and water droplet energy flux since the duration of an experiment influences the soil discharge rates in soil erosion experiments kinnell 2020 droplet kinetic energy per unit area kea j m 2 was considered to be a suitable indicator of the droplet impact on the soil surface crust yan et al 2011 studies have indicated that droplet kinetic energy affects water infiltration processes and soil erosion and influences the proper design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems however there are few models and little data relating energy indicators of water to performance on particular soil types in regard to runoff infiltration and erosion in farmland irrigation crop canopies can reduce rainfall energy and vegetation coverage positively impacts the reduction of runoff and soil loss zhang et al 2022 nevertheless if the vegetation cover density is low or not fully developed at a distance of 0 3 m from the soil surface soil erosion and runoff will still occur urgeghe et al 2021 ma et al 2014 consequently the effects of water application rate and kinetic energy on runoff and infiltration of bare soil should be evaluated silty clay loam and silt loam are widely distributed in the south of the yangtze river the loess plateau northeast china and other regions zhang et al 2022 liu et al 2019 the sand content of silty clay loam is less than that of sandy loam and loam which leads to lower hydraulic conductivity and a propensity to crusting bissonnais et al 1989 the risk of potential runoff by droplet impact is higher for silty clay loam therefore it is vital to identify the influence of the application rate and droplet kinetic energy on infiltration runoff and erosion of silty clay loam to determine the allowable application rate of sprinkler irrigation systems the objectives of this study are 1 to measure runoff and erosion on silty clay loam soil under different application rates and kinetic energies of sprinkler water 2 to quantify the effects of energy indicators and the application rate on the occurrence time of runoff runoff rate water infiltration depth prior to runoff infiltration rate runoff sediment concentration soil loss and bulk density of the soil surface crust and 3 to provide a risk assessment method for assessing potential runoff by sprinkler irrigation and the allowable application rate in sprinkler irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup indoor experiments designed to evaluate droplet kinetic energy and soil infiltration capacity under sprinkler irrigation were conducted at the irrigation laboratory of the research center of fluid machinery engineering and technology jiangsu university zhenjiang city jiangsu province p r china the test apparatus comprised a water supply system sprinklers catch cans a two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd joanneum research co graz styria austria soil containers bases of soil containers runoff collection bottles four graduated cylinders 10 100 500 and 1000 ml and an electronic scale fig 1 shows the experimental setup water was supplied from a reservoir and delivered to a variable frequency pump 5 m3 h 1 580 kpa via a water supply pipe with a control valve to regulate the operating pressure at the sprinkler s inlet a magnetic flow meter range 0 50 m3 h 1 accuracy of 0 5 was used to measure the sprinkler s discharge flow rate the sprinkler was placed 1 55 m above the ground and a pressure gauge range 0 600 kpa accuracy of 0 4 was placed 0 15 m upstream of the nozzle nelson r33 and r33lp sprinklers nelson irrigation co walla walla wa 99362 2271 usa were selected for the experiments of the tested sprinklers the r33 sprinkler has a long throw distance and uniform coverage and is widely used in solid set sprinkler irrigation systems the r33lp sprinkler is a low pressure version of the r33 the purpose of the study was not to test the hydraulic performance of the r33 and r33lp sprinklers but to use them to obtain various ar and sp values under different operating conditions the catch cans and soil containers were plastic containers with an opening diameter of 215 mm and a height of 280 mm fig 2 a and 2 b the 2dvd was used to measure the diameter and velocity of droplets applied by the sprinkler fig 2 c fig 2 d shows a schematic of measuring planes of the 2dvd two vertically disposed ccd cameras inside the instrument made linear scans of the droplets passing through the test area and recorded the individual droplet size and the vertical and horizontal velocity components ge et al 2018 the measurement area of the 2dvd was 100 mm 100 mm fig 2 d the height from the ground to the center of the measurement area was 330 mm 2 2 soil container the soil containers were transparent plastic buckets of the same size and material as the catch can as shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b presents a sketch of the soil container ten holes each 4 mm in diameter were made at the bottom of each soil container to facilitate water outflow after infiltration two layers of gauze with a thickness of 1 mm were placed at the bottom of the soil container to prevent soil leakage from the holes two runoff holes with a diameter of 10 mm were cut into the lateral wall of the soil container the distance between the lower edge of the runoff hole and the bottom of the container was 250 mm and the distance between the upper edge of the runoff hole and the upper brim of the container was 20 mm in the horizontal direction the two runoff holes were symmetrical with the center axis of the soil container the runoff hole was connected with an l shaped plastic elbow with an outer diameter of 10 mm and the joint between the runoff hole and the plastic elbow was sealed with silicone glue a flexible pipe with an inner diameter of 10 mm was used to connect the plastic elbow and conduct runoff water into a runoff collection bottle with a capacity of 500 ml the runoff collection bottles were plastic containers with an opening diameter of 32 mm and a height of 192 mm as shown in fig 2 a a transparent plastic film was wrapped around the soil container to prevent spray droplets from entering directly through the upper opening of the runoff collection bottle during the test the runoff collection device was covered with plastic film two bricks were used as a base for each soil container fig 2 a to facilitate the outflow of irrigation water after infiltration and to prevent the ground surface water from infiltrating the soil through the holes at the bottom of the soil container the base of the soil container was 100 mm high 2 3 soil packing and preparation the soil for the experiment was obtained from typical farmland in zhenjiang jiangsu china only the topsoil 0 50 cm was removed and air dried for two weeks all samples were passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve to standardize the soil and minimize spatial variability particle size distribution was measured by a laser particle size analyzer ms 2000 malvern united kingdom the soil texture was classified as silty clay loam according to the usda soil taxonomy 33 94 clay 61 72 silt and 4 34 sand with an initial soil water content of 0 11 cm3 cm 3 the soil was added to the soil container in successive 5 cm layers with an average soil bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 for each layer the soil was manually compacted to a previously calculated height using a circular steel pad to achieve the density after compaction a roughening process was conducted to ensure that the upper surface of each layer was sufficiently rough to prevent the occurrence of soil stratification cai et al 2018 five total layers were used the depth of soil loading was 25 cm and this depth ensured that the soil surface was flushed with the lower edge of the runoff holes fig 2 b the ground of the irrigation laboratory had a slope of 1 to facilitate floor drainage 2 4 experimental procedures the r33lp sprinklers were equipped with two nozzles with diameters of 4 8 and 5 2 mm and operated at the working pressures of 100 150 and 200 kpa under rotating working conditions in practice multiple sprinklers are combined in rectangular or triangular spacings for irrigation zhang et al 2013 the overlapped application rate was greater than that of a single sprinkler due to the space limitation of the laboratory it was difficult to conduct combined sprinkler irrigation tests the orifice nozzle of the r33 sprinkler was fixed non rotating during the experiments to obtain greater application rates from a single r33 sprinkler the working pressures of the r33 sprinkler were 200 300 and 400 kpa with a nozzle diameter of 4 4 mm according to the research on distribution patterns of water application and kinetic energy for the r33 and r33lp sprinklers in the radial direction the water application rate and kinetic energy differ at varying distances from the sprinkler chen et al 2022 additionally the specific power of the spray droplet is low near the sprinkler which is unlikely to lead to surface runoff ge et al 2020 therefore sampling locations within 5 11 m of the sprinkler were selected for the test the experiment comprised four parts 1 determinations of the water application rate and droplet kinetic energy of the sprinkler at the sampling location 2 an experiment on the soil runoff rate under sprinkler irrigation at the sampling location 3 tests of sediment concentration in runoff collection bottle and soil loss during the sheet erosion and 4 a test to measure the bulk density of the soil surface crust in the test of the water application rate the catch cans were placed at 0 5 m intervals within 5 11 m of the sprinkler in the radial direction at each sampling location the catch can was placed at the base of the soil container to ensure that the height of the catch can was the same as that of the soil container in the experiment for each combination of sprinkler and working pressure the test was 1 h in duration the water volume from each catch can was manually measured using graduated cylinders water volume was recorded immediately after each test to reduce evaporation losses the depth of the water in each catch can was calculated based on the catch can s opening area and the water volume during the test the indoor temperature of the laboratory was 22 c and the water temperature in the reservoir was 16 c the relative humidity was 75 and the daily evaporation was 1 2 mm the 2dvd was used to measure the diameter and velocity of the droplets applied by the sprinkler the 2dvd was moved along the radial direction of the spray jet and the testing locations were set at 0 5 m increments within the range of 5 11 m from the sprinkler measurements were taken by the 2dvd at each testing location at least every 10 min ensuring that more than 5000 water droplets were collected at each testing location after the tests of the water application rate and droplet kinetic energy of the sprinkler at the sampling location the soil container and runoff collection bottles were placed at the base of the soil container in the sampling location as presented in fig 2 a simultaneously the time at which the soil container began to be irrigated was recorded when water runoff occurred in the collection bottles the bottle was replaced by an empty collection bottle meanwhile the time at which the runoff occurred was recorded the runoff collection bottles were then replaced every 3 min for the soil container the runoff volume was measured using graduated cylinders the irrigation continued until a generally steady surface runoff rate was obtained as there were various water application rates and droplet kinetic energies the irrigation time varied for different sampling locations in this test the irrigation time ranged from 1 05 to 5 0 h for the sampling locations the collected runoff water was placed indoors for 24 h to let the suspended sediment settle the clear supernatant was decanted and the remaining sediment was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine the soil loss and calculate the sediment concentration after each irrigation test the soil container was placed in an indoor ventilated place for 48 h to ensure the soil surface was slightly dry for each soil container three clods of soil surface crust with a thickness of 5 mm were sampled the bulk density of the soil surface crust was measured by the film method yan et al 2011 the soil crust was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h it was then weighed and put into a film solution containing polyolefin resin and gasoline 1 1 by volume for 5 20 s and taken out for air drying for 24 h next the soil crust was put into another film solution containing polyolefin resin and gasoline 1 4 by volume for 5 s and taken out for air drying for another 24 h the volume of the soil crust was then measured using the archimedes method the bulk density of soil surface crust data was averaged for the three samples for each sampling location 2 5 data processing 2 5

runoff water s y g l 1 was determined using the following equation 9 s y m s 1000 v where m s is the net weight of sediment in runoff water after drying g the soil loss rate s l g m 2 h 1 represents the amount of soil lost per unit area in unit time which is an important indicator of the degree of soil erosion liu et al 2019 sl was calculated using the following formula 10 s l m s a t c 2 5 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using sigmaplot 10 0 systat software inc an independent samples t test was used to test the significant difference in the occurrence time of

application rate droplet kinetic energy and other parameters of the sampling locations for the experiment thirty six sampling locations with various application rates and kinetic energies were selected in the runoff test the sampling locations with r33 sprinklers under fixed working conditions were denoted by f1 f21 and those with r33lp sprinklers under rotating working conditions by r1 r15 fig 3 shows the average soil surface runoff rate water application rate and specific power of sampling locations r1 r15 during the 5 h of the runoff test it shows that the runoff rate increased with the increasing water application rate and specific power the droplet energy was transferred by the water during sprinkler irrigation although the ked values of r1 r15 were high at 10 19 33 97 j l 1 the low ar values of 1 41 11 35 mm h 1 resulted in low runoff rates the runoff rates of r1 r15 were below 1 0 mm h 1 when the ar values were less than 4 mm h 1 the runoff rates were less than 0 16 mm h 1 in fact when the ar was less than 2 mm h 1 runoff did not occur in the first 4 h of the runoff test when the ar was less than 11 35 mm h 1 it was difficult to generate runoff and soil erosion therefore the impact of droplet kinetic energy on runoff and soil erosion for sampling locations r1 r15 was not considered in further analysis the data from sampling locations f1 f21 was used to further analyze the effects of the water application rate and droplet kinetic energy on runoff and soil erosion additionally the test data on droplet velocity by the 2dvd shows that the values of mean droplet trajectory angle ranged from 72 to 86 for sampling locations f1 f21 although the droplet impact angle and shear stress were considered important indicators of soil erosion in sprinkler irrigation hui et al 2022 they were ignored in this study because of the minor difference in droplet trajectory angle 3 2 surface runoff fig 4 represents the relationships between the occurrence time of runoff and the sprinkler irrigation parameters it shows that the occurrence time of runoff has a negative power function relationship with the ar sp and kea with increases in the ar sp and kea the occurrence time of runoff decreased fig 4 also shows the fitting curves of the data on the runoff occurrence time and sprinkler irrigation parameters the fitting degree between the occurrence time of runoff and the ar was highest with an r 2 of 0 967 as shown in fig 4 a when the ar increased from 0 mm h 1 to 60 mm h 1 the runoff occurrence time decreased when the ar was greater than 60 mm h 1 the trend of degression of the runoff occurrence time slowed with the increasing ar when the ar was greater than 150 mm h 1 the surface runoff occurred 4 min after the start of irrigation which meant that the higher the ar the greater the risk of surface runoff by sprinkler irrigation in practical irrigation the duration of one irrigation event depends primarily on crop water demand and the sprinkler s ar if the irrigation time is less than the occurrence time of runoff corresponding to the ar there is no runoff loss in the irrigation process fig 4 shows that the fitting degree between the occurrence time of runoff and sp was good with an r 2 of 0 920 the runoff time was negatively related to sp and their relationship can be fitted using the power function some research has indicated that sp is an important parameter for studying and predicting potential runoff reflecting the distribution of precipitation energy of the sprinkler irrigation system bautista capetillo et al 2012 king and bjorneberg 2012 thompson et al 2001 as shown in figs 4 b and 4 d the fitting coefficient of the runoff occurrence time of ked was 0 105 and that of kea was 0 680 the regression analysis indicated no significant relationship between ked and runoff occurrence p 0 186 this result was consistent with the findings of yan et al 2011 from their runoff experiment with sandy loam the hydraulic conductivity of silty clay loam compared with that of sandy loam was lower under the same soil bulk density therefore the silty clay loam was more likely to produce surface runoff when the ar was greater than the soil water infiltration rate in light of the analysis above predictive models of the runoff occurrence time t r min based on the ar and sp were derived using the following equations 12 t r 9258 949 ar 1 506 r 2 0 967 13 t r 1 060 sp 1 534 r 2 0 920 the statistical analysis found that the rmse values were 3 07 and 4 75 for eqs 12 and 13 respectively the values of r 2 were greater than 0 92 which indicated a good agreement between the test data and the model outputs the relationships between the runoff rate and irrigation time under different water application rates and variations in the droplet kinetic energy of the sprinkler are shown in fig 5 after an occurrence of surface runoff the runoff rate increased rapidly as time passed the increasing trend in the runoff rate became slower and gradually became stable when the runoff finally approached a stable rate the rate fluctuated in a narrow range this was because for most sprays the jet from the nozzle finally broke into small droplets through oscillation and air drag chen et al 2021 the oscillation in the process of jet breakup caused fluctuation in the ar from the sprinkler mandating that the test duration of the rotating sprinkler be no less than 1 h and that of the fixed sprinkler be no less than 0 5 h during the water application rate test iso 15886 3 2016 in this study the interval of runoff collection was 3 min and the fluctuation in the ar over a short period led to a fluctuation in the runoff rate therefore the final runoff rate was taken as the average of the runoff rate after it became almost stable as shown in fig 5 with the increase in the ar and droplet kinetic energy the growth in the runoff rate became more rapid after runoff had occurred in addition the greater the ar and kinetic energy the higher the runoff rate fig 6 shows the relationships between the final runoff rate and sprinkler irrigation parameters the final runoff rate increased with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy the final runoff rate was linearly correlated with the ar sp and kea and the fitting coefficients were greater than 0 654 the regression analysis revealed that the ar sp and kea had significant influences on the final runoff rate p values 0 001 while the effect of ked on the final runoff rate was not significant p 0 055 as illustrated in fig 6 the final runoff rate was positively related to the ar and the fitting degree between them was the highest with an r 2 of 0 919 silva 2017 noted that sprinkler irrigation systems applied water with high application rates leading to significant surface runoff as shown in fig 6 when the ar was greater than 60 mm h 1 the final runoff rate was approximately 80 of the ar at this point 80 of the irrigation water was lost in the form of runoff king and bjorneberg 2011 found that a 50 reduction in the sprinkler flow rate reduced runoff by 60 80 under the same irrigation amount thus it is necessary to avoid using sprinklers with great flow rates and high ars when designing sprinkler irrigation systems in light of the influences of the ar and droplet kinetic energy on the final runoff rate δr f mm h 1 two empirical equations were developed to estimate the δrf value 14 r f 0 807 ar 0 227 r 2 0 919 15 r f 173 090 sp 23 290 r 2 0 755 statistical analysis showed that the rmse was 8 96 and r 2 was 0 92 for eq 14 and the rmse was 15 56 and r 2 was 0 76 for eq 15 the validation results confirmed that the final runoff rate was well predicted by the ar 3 3 infiltration fig 7 presents the relationships between water cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff and sprinkler irrigation parameters with the increase in the ar and kinetic energy the cumulative infiltration depth decreased as with the occurrence time of runoff the infiltration depth prior to runoff was found to have a negative power function relationship with the ar sp and kea the regression analysis revealed that the ar sp and kea had significant influences on the cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff p values 0 001 while the effect of ked on infiltration depth was not significant p 0 051 as shown in fig 7 the cumulative infiltration depth was negatively related to the sp and the fitting degree between them was the highest with an r 2 of 0 755 when the sp increased from 0 20 to 0 55 w m 2 the infiltration depth prior to runoff decreased from 17 12 to 10 27 mm this result was different from that of yan et al 2011 who reported that the infiltration depth prior to runoff was relatively stable at 21 mm for the sandy loam soil as the sp was between 0 27 and 0 71 w m 2 since the hydraulic conductivity of sandy loam was higher than that of the silty clay loam the infiltration depths obtained by this study were smaller than those of yan under the same sp values three equations for estimating the cumulative infiltration depth i mm were developed on the basis of the different values of the ar sp and kea eqs 16 17 and 18 16 i 7 594 sp 0 505 r 2 0 755 17 i 201 696 ar 0 577 r 2 0 695 18 i 1127 617 ke a 0 614 r 2 0 669 the statistical analysis showed that the values of rmse for eqs 16 17 and 18 were 3 14 3 50 and 3 65 respectively fig 8 shows the variation in infiltration rates with the irrigation time under different ars and droplet kinetic energies at the beginning of the irrigation the soil infiltration rate was relatively high equivalent to the sprinkler s water application rate as time passed surface runoff occurred and the soil water infiltration rate decreased rapidly and gradually stabilized this trend was similar to that obtained by al kayssi and mustafa 2016 in this study the soil water infiltration rate was calculated by subtracting the runoff rate from the sprinkler s application rate similar to the runoff rate due to the fluctuation in the ar the infiltration rate fluctuated in a narrow range and tended to be stable as shown in fig 8 with the increases in the ar and kinetic energy the decreasing trend in the infiltration rate was accelerated during sprinkler irrigation the impact of the droplets broke down the macro aggregates which sealed the soil surface by compacting and clogging the soil pores resulting in runoff and low infiltration ela et al 1992 with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy the disturbance of the soil surface structure was aggravated the process of soil surface compaction became shorter the occurrence time of runoff decreased the growth of runoff rate became more rapid and the decreasing trend of infiltration rate was accelerated the final infiltration rate was taken as the average of the infiltration rate after it became almost stable fig 9 shows the relationships between the final infiltration rate and sprinkler irrigation parameters the final infiltration rate decreased with the increasing ar ked sp and kea the values of the ar ked sp and kea were in a linear correlation with the final infiltration as shown in fig 9 with r 2 values of 0 89 and 0 88 respectively kea and sp had a better fit to the final infiltration rate agassi et al 1994 found that the final infiltration rate decreased exponentially with an increase in droplet kinetic energy because of the soil surface seal formation this conclusion was not supported by the results of this study as the soil textures were different agassi et al 1994 tested two types of kaolin ustochrepts and paleudalf the differences in soil texture and soil bulk density led to the differences in the soil water infiltration characteristics in light of the influence of droplet kinetic energy on the final infiltration rate ir f mm h 1 two empirical equations for predicting irf were derived eqs 19 and 20 19 ir f 23 035 sp 18 487 r 2 0 878 20 ir f 0 006 ke a 19 298 r 2 0 886 3 4 sediment and soil erosion the variations in the runoff sediment concentration with irrigation time under different ars and droplet kinetic energies are shown in fig 10 the sediment concentration was higher when runoff was first observed sediment concentration then decreased as the irrigation continued and finally tended toward a stable value fig 10 shows that with the increase in the ar and kinetic energy the sediment concentration at the start of the runoff increased while the final sediment concentration decreased regarding sampling locations f15 ar 62 08 mm h 1 sp 0 11 w m 2 f12 ar 113 90 mm h 1 sp 0 36 w m 2 and f21 ar 153 89 mm h 1 sp 0 53 w m 2 the sediment concentrations of these locations were 2 55 4 40 and 11 07 g l 1 respectively at the start of runoff and the average sediment concentrations of f15 f12 and f21 were 0 99 0 66 and 0 74 g l 1 respectively after sediment yield became stable fig 11 shows that the soil loss rates changed with irrigation time during the erosion processes under different ars and kinetic energies as the kinetic energy of droplets impacted the soil surface soil particles were detached and overland flow transported the soil particles these were the main processes causing soil erosion young and wiersma 1973 angulo martínez and barros 2015 as shown in fig 11 after the runoff occurred the soil loss rate increased and then decreased with a peak value at a certain time during soil erosion some of the detached soil particles flowed away along the runoff while the rest sealed the soil surface by compacting and clogging the soil pores the formation of the soil seal somewhat alleviated the separation of the soil particles caused by the impact of the droplets therefore the soil loss rate decreased after it had reached a peak value however the variation amplitudes of soil loss rate were different under various ars and sps as shown in fig 11 the soil loss rates for f15 and f16 changed slightly with irrigation time whereas those for f17 and f18 decreased rapidly and eventually tend to stabilize after the peak soil loss rates additionally the peak soil loss rates of f17 and f18 157 00 and 317 31 g m 2 h 1 were greater than those of f15 and f16 61 70 and 80 43 g m 2 h 1 meaning that as the ar and sp increased the disturbance of the soil surface structure increased resulting in a rapid increase in soil loss rate after runoff occurred the impact of the droplets promoted the formation of the soil seal the soil seal formed faster with the greater ar and sp the bulk density of the surface crust increased with the increasing sp yan et al 2011 greater sp led to a stabler soil surface seal the formation of soil seal alleviated the separation of soil particles produced by droplet impact thus for f17 and f18 after the soil loss rate climbed to the peak value it decreased rapidly and eventually tended to stabilize fig 12 shows the relationships between sprinkler irrigation parameters and cumulative soil loss during the runoff test cumulative soil loss increased with the increasing ar and droplet kinetic energy applied by the sprinkler a power function relationship was observed between the cumulative soil loss and the ar sp and kea and the fitting coefficients were 0 76 0 80 and 0 72 respectively the regression analysis revealed that the effects of the sp ar and kea on cumulative soil loss were significant p values 0 001 the impact of the droplet kinetic energy on the soil surface was a primary factor in determining the soil surface seal the formation of the surface soil seal leads to lower infiltration and more runoff ela et al 1992 to evaluate the effect of the sprinkler ar and droplet kinetic energy on the surface soil structure fig 13 shows the relationships between the irrigation parameters and the bulk density of the surface soil crust after the runoff test as shown in fig 13 the bulk density of the surface crust was positively correlated with the ar sp kea and ked when the ar increased from 24 16 mm h 1 to 153 89 mm h 1 the bulk density of the surface crust increased from 1 42 mg m 3 to 1 58 mg m 3 it then increased from 1 42 mg m 3 to 1 63 mg m 3 when the sp increased from 0 07 w m 2 to 0 55 w m 2 this observation indicated that the greater the ar and droplet kinetic energy the denser the surface seal formed and the greater the bulk density of the surface crust after the sprinkler irrigation event it explains why with the increasing ar and kinetic energy the final infiltration rate decreased and the final runoff rate increased in addition compared with the packed soil bulk density of 1 35 mg m 3 the bulk density of the surface crust increased by 3 70 22 22 when the ar increased from 24 16 mm h 1 to 153 89 mm h 1 it means that the increase in the ar and droplet kinetic energy aggravated the disturbance of the soil surface structure which was accompanied by an increase in the peak value of the runoff sediment concentration and cumulative soil loss as shown in fig 13 the sp and kea fitted well with the bulk density of the surface crust with fitting coefficients of 0 89 and 0 88 meaning that compared with the ar and ked the sp and kea better reflect the disturbance of the soil surface due to the droplets impact in previous studies the sp has been regarded as an energy index of soil erosion king and bjorneberg 2010 ge et al 2018 liu et al 2019 also found that the kinetic energy of the droplets better reflected the droplet impact on soil erosion than the ar did their experiment on silt loam found that the kinetic energy of the droplets increased soil losses and sediment concentrations by approximately 74 696 and 64 560 respectively under the same irrigation ar in addition yan et al 2011 noted that irrigation time should be considered an important factor affecting the development of the soil crust as the soil seal formation depends on successive droplets impacts as illustrated in eqs 3 4 and 5 compared with sp and ked the kea considered the influence of irrigation time on droplet kinetic energy two empirical equations were developed to estimate the bulk density of the surface crust bd s mg m 3 based on the sp and kea 21 bd s 0 421 sp 1 401 r 2 0 886 22 bd s 0 0001 ke a 1 387 r 2 0 876 the impact of the droplets broke down the macro aggregates of the soil surface part of the detached soil particles sealed the soil surface by compacting and clogging the soil pores and the other particles were transported by the overland flow these were the main processes causing the soil surface seal and soil erosion young and wiersma 1973 ela et al 1992 angulo martínez and barros 2015 the runoff sediment concentration and soil loss rate increased and then decreased with the irrigation time figs 10 and 11 which indicates that the formation of the soil surface seal could alleviate soil erosion and soil loss to some extent however the surface seal would lead to an increase in the bulk density of the surface soil and a decrease in soil porosity resulting in a decrease in the soil water infiltration rate and an increase in the surface runoff rate luz and heermann 2005 reported that the surface crust formation significantly affected the estimation of potential runoff in center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems additionally when a crust developed on the soil surface the water and fertilizer applied by sprinklers would not entirely infiltrate the soil and become absorbed by the roots of the crop plants instead fertilizers would flow away in the form of surface runoff which would not only reduce the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer in sprinkler irrigation but would also pollute the environment when the runoff containing fertilizer flowed into rivers meanwhile the surface seal would promote soil compaction which negatively influences the root respiration of crop plants oxygen limitation can easily occur in crop roots resulting in slowed growth of the crops and reduced crop yield therefore when the soil crust is formed soil permeability should be improved through timely shallow tillage 4 conclusions runoff is considered the largest cause of potential water loss in sprinkler irrigation which leads to decreased water application efficiency using soil container experiments this study quantified the effects of water application rate and droplet kinetic energy on soil runoff infiltration and erosion under sprinkler irrigation the ar and sp were found to be critical indicators for predicting the occurrence time of runoff final runoff rate and water cumulative infiltration depth prior to runoff under sprinkler irrigation whereas the sp and kea were key indicators that affected the final infiltration rate soil erosion and soil surface seal the runoff occurrence time and cumulative infiltration depth were negatively related to the ar and sp and their relationships can be fitted using power functions when the ar was less than 30 mm h 1 and the sp was lower than 0 1 w m 2 the runoff occurrence time would be longer than 36 min and the cumulative infiltration depth would be greater than 24 mm the predictions for the runoff occurrence time and cumulative infiltration depth can be used to determine the duration and irrigation amount for one sprinkler irrigation event the final runoff rate amount of soil loss and bulk density of the surface crust linearly increased while the final infiltration rate linearly decreased as the ar sp and kea increased an ar of less than 20 mm h 1 and an sp of less than 0 1 w m 2 are recommended in sprinkler irrigation systems to minimize the risk of soil runoff and erosion for silty clay loam in designing sprinkler irrigation systems soil runoff and erosion can be reduced by reasonably selecting the sprinkler spacing sprinkler type nozzle diameter and operating pressure the empirical models proposed in this study which describe the relationships between sprinkler performance parameters and soil erosion were focused on solid set sprinkler irrigation systems in addition since only one soil with one initial soil water content and one soil bulk density was used in this study the effects of the ar sp and kea on different soil types initial soil water contents and soil bulk densities need to be investigated in future research declaration of competing interest the

8936,climate variability and insufficient irrigation are primary constraints to stable and higher agricultural productivity and food security in nepal agriculture is the largest global freshwater user and integration of surface and ground water use is frequently presented as an strategy for increasing efficiency as well as climate change adaptation however conjunctive management cm planning often ignores demand side requirements and a broader set of sustainable development considerations including ecosystem health and economics of different development strategies while there is generic understanding of conjunctive use detailed technical knowhow to realize the cm is lacking in nepal this article presents a holistic framework through literature reviews stakeholders consultations and expert interviews for assessing cm and implementation prospects from a systems level perspective we demonstrate the framework through a case study in western nepal where climatic variability and a lack of irrigation are key impediments to increased agricultural productivity and sustainable development results show that knowledge of water resources availability is good and that of water demand low in the western terai additional and coordinated investments are required to improve knowledge gaps as well as access to irrigation there is therefore a need to assess water resources availability water access use and productivity to fill the knowledge gaps in order to pave pathways for cm this paper also discusses some strategies to translate prospects of conjunctive management into implementation keywords climate change conjunctive use conjunctive management groundwater water policy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction global climate change adaptation in low income nations hinges on finding profitable and resilient water management methods for agriculture miralles wilhelm 2021 agricultural transformation can help move low income nations to middle income by 2030 as the agricultural sector in such countries accounts for more than 25 of gross domestic product gdp world bank 2021 nepal s net farmed land is 48 irrigated while only 39 has year round irrigation imp 2019 iirrigated agriculture can contribute in achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs medici and de wrachien 2016 such as sdg 1 sdg 2 and sdg 13 as irrigation can be associated with inclusive growth food security and climate resilience for example irrigating rain fed systems can enhance wheat 34 9 and maize 22 13 yields worldwide wang et al 2021 buffering production against dry spells and drought thus affecting food availability and costs namara et al 2010 irrigation s year round benefits dwarf the prior statistics namara et al 2010 however increasing physical and economic water shortages challenge to sustainable and equitable access to water in agriculture tran and weger 2018 among others with arid areas facing severe difficulties in response to these pressures the conjunctive use cu and conjunctive management cm of surface and ground water resources is a frequently cited principle for adapting agricultural water management to climatic change foster et al 2010 evans et al 2014 van der gun 2020 cm refers to coordinated surface and ground water management and cu refers to the efficient use of both resources van steenbergen 2015 following the definition of van steenbergen 2015 this paper uses the term cm to discuss the co management of both the resources within its context although ample evidence exists of integrated impact assessments on the one hand bejranonda 2013 afshar et al 2021 and some governance guidelines on the other hand hamamouche 2017 foster et al 2010 the appropriate framework for assessing and implementing cm remains largely absent this paper presents an integrated framework for assessing and implementing cm in agriculture to address this knowledge gap through a case study approach to irrigation development in western nepal the region has significant irrigation development projects underway for surface and ground water highlighting its importance for achieving sdg6 and sdg13 all four priority irrigation projects in nepal designated as national pride projects are located in western nepal npc 2021 significant ongoing private investments in groundwater irrigation highlight the need for better access to water among the region s farmers urfels 2020 in the context of a lack of a comprehensive methodology for evaluating cm practice this study aims to answer following questions 1 how has cm planning literature evolved over time and what might be an appropriate conceptual framework for assessing status of cm in an area 2 what is the status of cm in western nepal as reflected by appling the newly developed framework 3 what considerations or strategies are required to implement the cm framework in practice 2 development of a methodological framework for cm planning and implementation 2 1 evolution of cm as an irrigation policy tool consumptive use has been a water management approach to achieving socio economic benefits since the 1960s bhattarai and shakya 2019 vincent and dempsey 1993 described how since then cm has developed as a tool for water resources planning and irrigation scheme management joining the world bank s irrigation policy in the early 1980s after pakistan s agricultural productivity increased by 20 china liu hu and chen 2020 algeria hamamouche kuper riaux and leduc 2017 australia ticehurst and curtis 2019 spain escalante and sauto 2018 and india dillon et al 2009 all use cm for irrigation however different sectors stakeholders interpret cm differently this paper defines cm as a planned and coordinated integration of surface and ground water use management over time and space in order to facilitate irrigation applicable to all scales of management to optimize productivity and achieve environmental sustainability and equity bhattarai and shakya 2019 evans evans and holland 2014 fao 1995 foster van steenbergen zuleta and garduño 2010 hamamouche et al 2017 vincent and dempsey 1993 the basic principle of cm is to regulate surface and ground water use based on needs and objectives and to optimize the distribution of both surface and ground water in a command area at a time liu et al 2020 hedging reduces environmental externalities e g energy for deep pumping non attainment of ecosystem flow requirements with surface water diversions and hazards such as crop failure or yield loss instead of developing one source to make up for the mismanagement of another cm seeks to maximize water use s by pumping groundwater during the dry season it creates additional subterranean room to store surface water arising from infiltration during high flows for use in the next season cm has many benefits that may improve socioeconomic results foster et al 2010 but it depends on hydrological and hydrogeological conditions it can buffer high flow in surface water supply systems in order to adjust to climate change and provide irrigation foster et al 2010 rao et al 2004 ticehurst and curtis 2019 it also lowers flood hazards improves health and sanitation and boosts environmental flows however the cm approach demands the co existence and economic availability of both surface and ground water resources a surface water distribution system requires significant capital and operating costs with its management demanding strong social organization the cm related interventions have varied advantages determined by governance infrastructure and water management evans et al 2014 these can be engineered aquifer storage and or recovery involve integrated water planning and be bottom up farmer led at the farm level or top down a more strategic approach where inputs of both resources are managed planned centrally by the government holley et al 2016 2 2 conjunctive management in practice nepal and most of south asia have yet to fully implement cm planning meeting national and global goals such as the sdgs is hindered by the lack of a strategic vision for cm planning to support socio economic outcomes foster et al 2010 optimizing surface and ground water use management depending on the situation requires major financial investment infrastructure and institutional conversion the cm s hydrological cycle connectivity is appealing holley et al 2016 however joint use in irrigation projects mobilizes groundwater for many purposes rather than methodically optimising water use and conservation vincent and dempsey 1993 though literature exists on the effects of joint use on farmers and water management by significantly modifying irrigation system reliability while minimizing externalities the technique comes at a cost expenses which are reasonable if dependability and externalities improve these factors rely on context both resources have cm concerns and information gaps including irrigation command areas need to move from spontaneous cu to cm however an upper limit on groundwater abstraction should be recognized for cm in irrigation which varies with the scenario of surface water delivery and hydrogeological setting of an area foster and van steenbergen 2011 although farmers use groundwater to supplement surface water deficit by default where the possibility exists the cm needs to be considered at the system scale rather than only at the farm scale it requires a realistic estimate of water demand and availability the constraints for planned and coordinated cm are related to various aspects such as water resource availability and physical characteristics of water resources cleaver 2012 physical infrastructure and operational institutions foster and van steenbergen 2011 in addition to environmental and social equity issues hamamouche et al 2017 failure to characterize existing and potential irrigation institutions critical assessment of their functioning and exploring their linkages and information exchange mechanisms is not only a fundamental limitation for planned and coordinated management of surface and ground water resources but also for exploring prospects for improved policies addressing this challenge requires efforts to coordinate across actors and sectors e g individuals distinct water sources potentially governed by different authorities etc blomquist schlager and heikkila 2004 there are equity issues in cm with difficulty in securing equal equitable access rights to and ownership for to all sections of society over surce and ground water resources khadka et al 2021 not all areas have equal prospects of achieving cm characterizing current cm practices synthesizing learnings and assessing the prospects for planned cm provides an adequate basis for workable plans to achieve it achieving effective cm requires various strategies such as planned investments in hardware e g modernization software digitized and real time resources monitoring and improved databases and planning and management capacities it may entail institutional reform shah et al 2006 optimizing cm also requires providing equal attention to the capacity building of irrigation system managers and farmers 2 3 a framework for cm planning and implementation the overall framework that is a basic structure underlying the concept for assessing the prospects for cm planning and implementation was developed based on literature review stakeholder consultation and expert interviews it consists of components of assessing prospects as well as identifying potential strategies for realizing the prospects for the planned cm fig 1 each of the components is elaborated in the following sub chapters 2 3 1 assessing prospects for cm planning based on insights from the literature and engagement with stakeholders through virtual workshops a five component and 17 indicator methodological framework fig 2 has been developed to assess prospects of the cm in the study area and address knowledge gaps identified in the earlier section most of the accessible literature across the globe was reviewed rigorously to characterize various aspects of the cm to be considered in identifying the prospects the relevant literature was collected screened and examined to synthesize such initiatives a google search using selected key words e g hydropower project irrigation project water supply project western nepal karnali basin water development programme found existing and proposed water development projects in usaid s feed the future zone of influence ftf zoi area in sudurpashchim and lumbini provinces the websites of the following government departments provided project information department of energy development doed bheri babai diversion multipurpose project water resources project preparatory facility water and energy commission secretariat wecs nepal electricity authority and department of water supply and sanitation management dwssm for project updates project related websites e g digo jal bikas the rising nepal prime minister agriculture modernization project my republica etc in nepali and english language were searched irrigation water use and inventory 2018 and irrigation master plan 2019 were also reviewed this identified 35 articles papers reviewing abstracts and paper contents was the first step to screen the literature then literature on existing and proposed projects news updates and evidence of a report providing crucial information on the water project were chosen screening the literature yielded 28 studies eight were then removed because they provided general information for a small area or a thorough engineering design some material was perception based or review based therefore original and latest reports were followed finally 19 items of literature were chosen for extensive review and synthesis a preliminary framework was shared with stakeholders during a virtual workshop with more than 25 participants including a mix of representatives of government agencies policymakers and implementing departments non government agencies the private sector research academic sector and local government and community representatives well ahead of the workshop the draft methodology was shared with the participants who were briefed over the phone about the framework and their consent obtained for paraticipation in the workshop on the day of the workshop the methodology was presented briefly after which each stakeholder in turn was requested to share their thoughts turn by turn on suitability of indicators availability of data and ways of implementing the framework the methodology framework was finalized after incorporating the stakeholder inputs although the climate crisis is not explicitly spelled out in the indicators and components they are already embedded in the components and indicators related to water resource availability and water demand as climate change can affect both of these e g pandey et al 2019 2020b future water demand is associated with both climatic and non climatic factors such as land use cover change economic growth potential changes in agricultural and food security policies both primary and secondary data were collected pre processed and analysed results were validated in consultation with stakeholders following the approach suggested in ticehurst and curtis 2019 secondary data include hydrological and meteorological data collected from the hydro met department of nepal and published literature primary data includes situation assessment on various aspects of cm e g status of monitoring prospects for augmentation water use practices human resources and technical capacity through engagement with a well mixed group of stakeholders 2 3 2 identifying workable strategies to realize the prospects the western plains the terai of nepal was selected as a case study area for operationalising the framework and after a rigoous literature review the current status of all the indicators was synthesized and potential strategies identified for realizing the prospects for the cm these were further streamlined and finalized in consultation with various stakeholders and taking into consideration suitability for the study area 3 context and description of the case study area western nepal s southern plain the southern plain in western nepal part of the south asia s indo gangetic plain is among nepal s most impoverished and food insecure regions and is thus crucial for progress towards sdg1 and sdg2 at the same time this region has already experienced climate change impacts on water availability pandey et al 2019 2020b and is prone to drought 3 1 agriculture and water management in nepal agriculture production is a decisive factor in the sustainable development of nepal s socio economy it engages more than 60 of the population and is the second largest contributor to gdp 27 however the sector s productivity is poor ifad 2020 nepal has a relatively abundant amount of water resources 99 3 mm3 ha of irrigable land 7707 m3 capita year data source irrigable land area from irrigation master plan water resources availability from moewri 2020 population from cbs 2021 however according to government statistics only 48 of the net cultivated area has some sort of irrigation facility and only 39 has year round irrigation yri imp 2019 furthermore economic development and population growth increase the water demand of agriculture and other sectors in turn increasing the demand for water overall at the same time climate change is expected to lead to a more erratic water supply wecs 2011 enhancing access to irrigation has therefore become a key challenge for the sustainable development of agriculture in nepal and this can be addressed through the integrated use of surface and ground water resources or through cm although cu is happening by default in southern nepal because it is a surface water rich country cm is typically left out of the picture or marginalized in policy and plans upadhyay and gaudel 2018 in this context cm can be considered as an important pathway for enhancing access to irrigation and prioritizing investments because of its prospects to enhance water use efficiency improve water security and ultimately result in better water productivity along with several other benefits e g flood management pandey et al 2021 furthermore cm can effectively maximize water use benefits through augmenting supply increasing productivity avoiding aquifer mining and integrating surface and ground water management mattiuzi marques and medellín azuara 2019 the irrigation master plan of nepal imp 2019 mentions that out of 48 of irrigated land in nepal 19 is irrigated by cu not cm which is primarily spontaneous unplanned unregulated and unmanaged foster and van steenbergen 2011 pandey et al 2021 however cm which focuses on government led initiatives on groundwater development and use for a larger area ideally with community participation is still not receiving enough attention in nepal in general and western nepal in particular nevertheless the imp 2019 established a bold goal to increase yri from the current 39 55 by 2025 66 by 2030 and 100 by 2045 similarly nearly 60 of cultivated land in the southern plain of nepal also known as the food basket of the country has access to irrigation most of it from groundwater urfels mcdonald krupnik and van oel 2020 still groundwater resources in terai s alluvial aquifers are underutilized for various reasons including energy constraints access or affordability that limit the farmers ability for groundwater pumping nepal neupane belbase pandey and mukherji 2021 under these circumstances in the southern plain of the country targets for yri can be achieved only through cm 3 2 description of the study area this case study focuses primarily on the ftf zoi which spans 237 palikas in 21 districts in three provinces in western nepal six of those districts are in the terai fig 3 which accounts for an area of approximately 1 22 million hectares mha ftf zoi is considered as one of the important areas in the nation with the ability to contribute to doubling growth through productivity improvement about 6 9 million people live in this region and roughly 21 are considered poor ftf 2016 both surface and ground water resources exist in terai five river systems i e west rapti mahakali karnali mohana and babai in the region provide surface water resources while other rivers from the chure or mahabharat mountains are rain or spring fed the mahakali and karnali are snow fed perennial rivers climatic factors such as drought and heat stress impact the ftf zoi in the terai which lowers the productivity of the local farming systems utilizing available water resources sustainably through cm may be a feasible approach to the problem however this will be determined by the economics of canal development operation and maintenance the ftf zoi has a diverse socio economy and culture more than half of the population in the study area are smallholder farmers 0 5 ha landholding or are landless with the major source of income being a seasonal migration and rain fed agriculture khadka et al 2021 4 prospects for planned cm in southern plain of western nepal in various irrigation systems in the terai region of nepal spontaneous unplanned cu is already in practice water managers and other essential stakeholders have not had enough policy conversations on cm however the ftf zoi areas offer a wealth of options and prospects for cm because of their high recharge capacity accessibility to surface water supplies and potential for high agricultural productivity due to their fertile fields this section is divided into five sub sections each defined by a set of indicators as per the framework for analysing prospects fig 3 the overall status of each indicator is summarized in tabular form in sm 1 4 1 water resources availability and understanding 4 1 1 surface water availability there are five river systems in the ftf zoi region fig 4 the largest is the karnali which has several sub basins that is west seti bheri tila humla karnali and mugu karnali and drains around 50 000 km2 of land up to the indian border many southern rivers are seasonal but during the rainy season they constitute a significant water source for cultivation these flow levels of those rivers can decrease dramatically during the non monsoon season as they mostly depends on monsoon precipitation shrestha et al 2018 due to their seasonal nature and low flow during the dry season the rivers are not ideal for an irrigation supply without surface storage according to observations the terai s numerous tiny southern rivers provide 13 of the nation s average flow compared to 9 from the medium basins and 78 from the large ones wecs 2011 studies specifically on southern rivers of western nepal are not accessible key hydrological features and surface water availability both current and future of the major basins sub basins are reported in several literature e g wecs 2011 dhami et al 2018 tripathee 2018 mishra et al 2018 bhatta et al 2020 dahal et al 2020 pandey et al 2010 2019 2020a 2020b etc and provided in sm 2a specific discharge of the basins sub basins vary from 18 8 l s m2 in upper karnali above the lalighat hydrological station to 52 1 l s m2 in mohana sm 2b as tabulated in sm 2a average annual water availability in the karnali river basin above chisapani hydrological station a approx 42 500 km2 is projected to increase by 8 4 and 10 9 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively in far future 2070 2099 the current level of understanding of surface water availability is relatively good although the total amount of surface water passing through the ftf zoi is abundant strong seasonality spatial distribution and topographical differences between river reach and agricultural areas have posed challenges for various beneficial uses using groundwater available in the indo gangetic alluvial aquifer system in conjunction with surface water could be an appropriate strategy for the study area 4 1 2 groundwater availability within the ftf zoi all the terai districts except dang have flat topography due to its abundance and high quality groundwater is the terai region s most significant water source nepal s terai and inner terai regions are thought to have abundant groundwater resources although they are underdeveloped pathak 2018 it is predicted that 88 of the groundwater that might be extracted sustainably is not being used leaving plenty of room to increase groundwater use for productivity growth urfels et al 2020 understanding aquifer systems their hydrogeologic properties and the availability and distribution both spatial and temporal of groundwater is essential for the sustainable exploitation and management of groundwater resources to characterize groundwater availability in the ftf zoi in western terai this study discovered screened and ultimately reviewed 11 items of literature as detailed in pandey et al 2021 there are primarily two types of aquifer systems in nepal s terai shallow aquifers 0 46 m depth and deep aquifers 46 m depth gdc 1994 the aquifer characteristics and groundwater quality are provided in sm 3 the maximum aquifer yield from those aquifers vary from 167 to 2592 m3 day see sm 3 recharge from the terai s northern boundary the bhabar zone along the siwalik foothills results in the terai s renewable groundwater supplies shrestha et al 2018 with rainfall and lateral inflows from the bhabar zone directly infiltrating the terai s aquifers recharging them subsurface inflow and seepage losses through streams and rivers also provide significant inputs to the groundwater recharge the terai region of nepal still lacks a clear delineation of groundwater recharge regions analysis of data presented in imp 2019 estimated based on projections of net groundwater recharge from a swat model indicates that renewable groundwater availability m yr across the ftf zoi districts varies from 0 11 dang to 0 26 kailali 0 33 banke 0 38 bardiya 0 42 kapilbastu and 0 48 kanchanpur the calculations also consider the relative contributions from the terai bhabar and seepage zones according to wecs 2011 dang s shallow aquifer alone has an estimated 130 140 mcm yr groundwater availability while groundwater abstraction for domestic use alone is estimated to be 7 43 mcm year sapkota 2003 calculated the safe yield from the groundwater aquifers in the southern portion of dang valley to be 31 6 mcm year indicating stress on the groundwater system the actual volume of groundwater abstraction would be significantly larger after incorporating abstraction for irrigation this shows that adequate planning and management are required to sustainably manage and use groundwater resources in the ftf zoi few studies describe groundwater quality in the ftf zoi but there are issues with it as indicated in sm 2 for example of six terai districts in nepal including kailali and kanchanpur in the ftf zoi yadav et al 2012 analyzed the susceptibility of arsenic pollution out of the six study districts the kailali district has the highest mean arsenic concentration 6270 ppb followed by kanchanpur 4980 ppb 4 1 3 monitoring and scientific understanding of water availability eighty two hydrological stations 41 precipitation stations and 23 climatic stations monitor hydro climatic conditions within and around the watershed i e in three provinces in the ftf zoi area within the terai districts of ftf zoi alone there are 13 precipitation stations and seven climatic stations daily average values of hydro met parameters are available at those stations and data length and quality vary across the stations the wmo guidelines suggest having one station every 600 900 km2 in the plain area as an ideal condition and every 900 3000 km2 as an acceptable condition cited in subramanya 2013 an observation of just the terai area of the ftf zoi indicates an adequate number of stations for monitoring precipitation in all terai ftf districts except kailali i e rainguage density of kapilbastu 1656 km2 dang 1507 km2 banke 473 km2 bardiya 504 km2 kailali 3312 km2 kanchanpur 1633 km2 due to insufficient thorough hydrological modelling scientific understanding of surface water resources is lacking for various basins including west rapti and babai including all water balance components and their spatio temporal distribution over historical periods in addition these watersheds lack information on predicted future climatic changes and their effects on water supply despite the abundance of information the spatio temporal distribution of groundwater resources storage recharge across various locations and depths in aquifers is not sufficiently described in the literature which lacks an estimate of the aquifers sustainable output at various sites and depths most groundwater quality investigations with sizable sample sizes are carried out in kailali kanchanpur and dang districts but similar studies are also necessary for other regional districts to properly define the spatial distribution of groundwater quality in the ftf zoi region as vital as evaluating the existing state of groundwater resources is understanding the recharge process and prospects for recharge augmentation are equally important to ensure a continued supply of groundwater for the projected cm it calls for knowledge of recharge trends and seasonality groundwater storage and availability and evaluating various strategies for recharge augmentation and water sources protection eventhough this information is extremely significant it is not commonly known because of lack of relevant studies in nepal or the study area 4 1 4 prospects for augmentation being a part of a large alluvial aquifer of the indo gangetic plain the groundwater aquifers are recharged relatively faster in the terai region of nepal this argument is also supported by the fact that less than a quarter of 8 8 bcm average annual groundwater recharge is utilized extracted in the terai nepal et al 2021 however given the heterogeneity of the aquifer system there is spatio temporal variability in groundwater availability with prospects therefore for augmenting water resource availability through rainwater harvesting and managed aquifer recharge however no studies or practical experiences of this have been documented this means that a detailed scientific study is needed to identify an appropriate location sizing rainwater harvesting and recharge systems and workable technologies for that specific geography similarly inter basin water transfer for bringing water to water deficit basins from water surplus basins is already under progress in the ftf zoi region under the bheri babi diversion project the bheri river is being transferred to irrigate the command area of the babai irrigation project several such types of projects with multiple purposes can be conceptualized and planned to address water and energy security issues simultaneously 4 2 water access and productivity 4 2 1 total water demand designing systems for simultaneous use of surface and ground water resources requires the understanding of water needs and their spatio temporal distribution to develop and execute conjunctive water usage systems it is essential to identify water demand hotspots evaluate the availability of water there and investigate potential water sources based on a thorough analysis of 11 items of literature found and screened using a method described by pandey et al 2021 the current state of knowledge about water demand was summarized the review found that there had not been a thorough investigation into the estimates of water demand within the ftf zoi a few studies have approximated both domestic and irrigation water demand but none completely cover the ftf zoi for instance pandey et al 2010 reported irrigation and domestic water demand across the basins revealing that babai uses the most water 77 of the water resources available mahakali uses the least water 2 6 and karnali and mahakali both have significant potential for new water development projects sm 4 information on district profiles released by moald sm 5a and updated information available in the irrigation master plan imp 2019 and other sources sm 5b have helped to calculate irrigation water demand in three terai districts inside the ftf zoi area finally sm 5c summarizes pertinent data for evaluating water consumption including total agricultural area area under main cereal crops such as rice and wheat and areas under surface irrigation systems furthermore probable groundwater hotspots mapped as distribution of deep tubewells throughout nepal s terai districts and published in a study by pathak 2018 can also be considered as a proxy for spatial distribution of water demand 4 2 2 water access status and constraints the ftf zoi region has a long history of water development activities aimed at improving water access and gon implements numerous water resource development initiatives and programs in coordination with international aid organizations and academic institutions many involve small scale irrigation hydropower sanitation and water supply some of which pandey et al 2021 summarise with a particular focus on water resources and irrigation as irrigation accounts for most water consumption only irrigation related schemes are included in this article the irrigation and water resources management project iwrmp non conventional irrigation technology project nitp medium irrigation project mip and community managed irrigation agriculture project cmiasp are some noteworthy efforts in essence nitp supports micro irrigation technologies and creates effective irrigation systems for them table 1 provides an overview of key irrigation development factors in the ftf zoi districts terai only despite availability of water resources and several initiatives access to irrigation is still a problem as stated in section 3 a major part of this is more due to economic water scarcity than physical scarcity the anticipated shift in hydrology and streamflow brought on by climate change is likely to further affect water availability pandey et al 2020b the majority of the ftf zoi districts have access to both surface and ground water with the latter supplying irrigation to 28 of the total irrigated land proper handling of the issue of economic water scarcity by reducing energy costs means that groundwater has strategic importance in the satisfying spatio temporal distribution of water demand due to its availability in aquifers in the terai please refer to sm 6 for the overall status of access to surface and ground water irrigation 4 2 3 water use practices preferences and efficiencies according to hydrogeological mapping the terai has enough renewable groundwater resources to provide effective irrigation of agricultural farmlands nepal et al 2021 with only about 22 of its dynamic groundwater recharge capacity have been used thus far shrestha et al 2018 although a thorough scientific investigation is needed to map the spatio temporal distribution of groundwater and safe sustainable yield in connection to irrigated land and cropping systems sustainable solutions could be implemented to better manage groundwater resources preferences for using one water source over another also have implications for the success of cm making an understanding people s preferences over the selection of source selection of irrigation method for efficiency awareness of water related issues and benefits of cm and behaviourial factors such as inclination towards compliance with the rule of law highly valuable information for assessing the prospects for cm in an area however as no such information is available in the existing literature further research is required to characterize these aspects 4 2 4 water productivity status and constraints water productivity for the crop can be defined as crop yield per cubic meter of water consumed cai and rosegrant 2003 increasing the water productivity in agriculture reduces the need for additional irrigation water and is a critical response to increasing water scarcity there are many promising pathways to increase water productivity in developing countries including supplemental irrigation soil fertility maintenance deficit irrigation small scale affordable management practices for water storage delivery and application modern irrigation technologies such as pressured systems and drip irrigation and soil water conservation through zero or minimum tillage molden et al 2007 there have been several experiments to measure the water productivity for different crop establishment and irrigation methods to increase the water productivity and hence profitability of the rice wheat crop systems in nepal devkota et al 2019 mandal et al 2009 devkota et al 2019 compared direct seeded rice dsr with puddled transplanted rice tpr which is the traditional method of rice cultivation similarly it compared zero tillage wheat ztw with conventional tillage wheat ctw devkota et al 2019 concluded that the alternative crop establishment methods for rice and wheat are not only commercially viable options but can also produce similar or higher yields while saving water and labour reducing costs increasing net profit and b c ratio experiments by mandal et al 2009 found similar results regarding water savings and increase in water productivity for alternative crop establishment methods compared to the traditional crop establishment and irrigation methods it also concluded that conventional tillage crop establishment and water management practices in rice tpr and wheat ctw required a large amount of irrigation water and labour compared to the water wise and cost effective alternatives for rice dsr and wheat ztw establishment 4 3 energy access and affordability 4 3 1 availability of energy sources and status of access energy is required to pump water from the groundwater table meaning that access to energy is of prime concern to introduce groundwater to cm depending upon location different energy sources are accessible such as grid based energy solar based energy and diesel based energy for pumps a vast majority of users use diesel pumps due to their flexibility at the location time of interest and availability for hiring solar based and grid based energy is also being used for pumping groundwater however an unreliable power supply and inadequate rural electrification are the challenges in the area moreover comprehensive data information with quantitative information on access to different energy sources is unavailable a knowledge gap therefore exists 4 3 2 cost of various sources of energy and affordability diesel water pumps dominate the water pumping sectors in nepal followed by electric water pumps consolidated management services nepal pvt ltd 2013 the rising cost of diesel and the increasing rental charge of pump sets have consistently been a cause of disappointment among farmers of all categories urfels et al 2020 listed key factors that limit shallow tubewell use in areas with a predominance of diesel pumps they include poor coordination among water users delays in pump and tubewell availability financial constraints and risk aversion towards cash investment it was also suggested that the electric grid permits lower cost pumps and solar powered irrigation systems could reduce operating costs the aversion to cash investments can be overcome at the farm level by raising awareness of the importance of timely irrigation coupled with efforts to increase operational efficiency e g pump maintenance pump sizing and forecast based irrigation scheduling urfels et al 2020 the gon has introduced policies and mechanisms subsidies and credit financing to encourage renewable energy in the irrigation sector to improve agricultural productivity and production renewable world and aciar 2018 thapa et al 2020 solar technology is one of the new technologies able to reach farmers who do not have access to grid power and who are ready to switch from fossil fuel based to clean energy technologies comparative studies of the cost per unit of water in different pumping technologies show that the cost of the electric pump is comparatively the lowest followed by the solar water pump when capacity utilization factor cuf is above 50 renewable world and aciar 2018 thapa et al 2020 the comparative cost for different pumping technologies is shown in table 2 while solar pumping seems an attractive option when used at about 50 cuf the high upfront cost inaccessibility to technology and after sales services are hindering to popularization and flourishing the system among smallholder farmers the rising cost of diesel and increasing rental charge of pump sets have consistently been a cause of disappointment among farmers of all categories 4 4 water governance landscape khadka et al 2021 provided a summary of the overall governance environment relating to the development of water resources in the ftf zoi there are restrictions and issues with groundwater based irrigation due to numerous legislative institutional investment and governance issues sugden et al 2020 urfels and foster 2020 scaling farmer led irrigation as well as cm of surface water and groundwater resources is systematically hampered by inadequate consideration of the local socio economic context the larger enabling environment and governance aspects of irrigation as well as by a greater focus on large physical infrastructures and engineering centered approaches khadka et al 2021 overcoming those obstacles will need inclusive and sustainable irrigation development and multi actor participation in irrigation planning decision making and investment minh et al 2020 khadka et al 2021 4 4 1 policy landscape regarding cm cm has been emphasized and prioritized in policy documents since the early 1990 s thus providing ample space for its promotion however translating the policy and strategies into action is yet to achieve momentum nepal s irrigation policy 1992 mentioned the need for promoting cm to optimize the use and management of available water resources to increase irrigated agriculture while the agricultural perspective plan 1995 emphasized the use of groundwater and the intensification of shallow tube wells implying the idea to introducing groundwater use into the system where irrigation was predominantly gained from surface water thus promoting cm of both resources similarly activities under the fourth output of water resources strategy 2002 mention developing yri and improving groundwater development and management implying prioritization of cm policy principles adopted in national water plan 2005 mention that water resource development and management shall be undertaken in a holistic and systematic manner relying on iwrm it also implies that both surface water and groundwater should be developed and managed in an integrated way providing space for planned cm although it did not spell out cm in the action programs it focused on expanding groundwater development nevertheless targets for increasing yri and irrigation efficiency imply a focus on the planned cm also irrigation policy 2013 mentions cm in the suggestions bullet of conception abadharana section similarly section 1 6 2 of the policy mentions considering prospects for cm as one of the criteria for selecting an irrigation project furthermore strategy 2 and its first policy karyaniti 1 of the water resources policy 2020 highlight on integrated management of water resources the sixth policy karyaniti of the seccond strategy mentions prioritizing cm based on prospects and needs 4 4 2 institutional settings to promote cm an enabling environment to facilitate cm can be created by setting up a single institution with the mandate authority to look after the development and management of both surface and ground water resources however in the context of this study area in particular and the entire nepal in general the authority to manage surface and ground water lies with different institutions thus creating a barrier to promoting planned cm ten sectoral ministries are also involved in water resources watershed management and irrigation services and development even though moewri is the primary line ministry at the federal level setting water resources and irrigation policies khadka et al 2021 if moewri does not create and implement an institutional water cooperation and development system there is a greater likelihood that strategies and programs will be duplicated at the federal level 4 4 3 social and equity aspects of cm gender and social equity issues of water access management and use in the ftf zoi are complex and institutional mechanisms policies and programs of the state and non state actors must integrate these issues in cm the gon has implemented several private irrigation subsidies to assist smallholders and boost technology adoption however irrigation technology subsidies mostly benefit better off farmers due to a lack of inclusive criteria and application processes khadka et al 2021 in addition although women provide the main source of labour for irrigated agricultural production and value chains they have limited access to technologies and information regarding multiple use water services and skills or knowledge of the impacts of the climate crisis on the water and food systems moreover irrigation technology and infrastructure are not gender friendly khadka et al 2021 the implementation of inclusive principles outlined in national policies has been constrained by the persistence of the interest of water professionals and institutions in the technical aspects of irrigation development and the dearth of social science expertise knowledge and effort in water intervention shrestha and clement 2019 this scenario reveals that nepal s water and irrigation sectors need to approach water development differently and water interventions should focus on empowering smallholder farmers and women in order to capitalize on the potential positive impacts of cm on people s livelihoods the environment and water security khadka et al 2021 as the constitution of nepal 2015 has devolved more roles and responsibility for local water supply irrigation and watershed conservation to local governments there is a need for policy and institutional capacity development at the local level to implement gender equitable and socially inclusive water resource management and use khadka et al 2021 4 4 4 environmental aspects cm aims at maximizing water productivity and minimizing environmental externalities relevant regulations for limiting groundwater extraction penalties for over extraction of groundwater and guidelines for minimizing groundwater pollution contamination should therefore be in place to support the implementation of cm however these aspects are yet to gain attention in the ftf zoi area 4 5 capacity and awareness 4 5 1 human resources or technical capacity a generic understanding of cm exists among stakeholders in the ftf zoi however detailed technical knowhow on realizing the cm is lacking among farmers and the government s implementing agencies it is primarily because cm is neither prioritized in the university curriculum nor in various capacity building programs organized over time as skilled human resources in relevant agencies are the key to the successful design and implementation of cm tailored training programs with a specific focus on its various aspects are certainly essential for stakeholders related to water and irrigation and working in the ftf zoi area 4 5 2 financial capacity for investment in cm the government s spending on irrigation is continuing to increase however investment is not properly focused cm does not need significant extra investment but rather strategizing and reorienting current investments better as revealed by interaction with relevant stakeholders financial capacity is therefore not a key constraint for cm in the study area 4 5 3 understanding of various stakeholders and practices of cm various types of stakeholder are aware of the cu cm concept and consider it a good one but remark on its lack of demonstration until the 5th periodic plan 1975 80 the focus was on providing adequate irrigation for paddy the concept of yri started to gain attention from the 6th periodic plan 1980 85 this concept then attracted the idea of cm although it is referred to as cu in these policies and planning documents for many years however nepal has been unable to present a successful case of cm though cu is in default in many cases there is no evidence of successful cm cases in nepal the arjun khola irrigation system located in deupur in lamahi dang was designed probably as the first case for cm back in 1994 to irrigate 475 ha of command area the arjun khola had adequate water for the wet season but no water for the dry season and so three deep and three shallow tubewells were constructed to supplement the dry season water deficit initial results were good but it failed for various reasons one being the rigidity of the distribution system as the conveyance system designed for the surface water system is not appropriate for the groundwater system for example in the case of deep tubewells the field channel sizes required for dry and winter seasons are entirely different this is because larger conveyance systems in the dry season would result in more losses and costs for water pumped from the groundwater system other potential reasons include but are not limited to i differential cost for surface water and groundwater i e a greater cost for groundwater use than for surface water use ii lack of exposure and therefore capacity in the planning of cm system iii unavailability of technical expertise for o m in the locality iv institutional aspect i e the working culture withboth surface and ground water personnel enjoying working independently v operation and maintenance aspect e g demand charge potential risk of failure of the system while not working for six months or so during the wet season etc vi unequal access to groundwater based on gender and socio economic conditions and vii difference in the subsidy technical assistance provided by the government for surface and ground water 5 strategies to implement cm in western nepal 5 1 challenges and impediments the development of a cm system faces constraints in the ftf zoi areas terai of nepal inadequate technical capabilities and organizational structure socio political realities a lack of emphasis on research based development approaches data information shortages and a lack of encouraging and disseminating research are some of its underlying causes some of the barriers that foster et al 2010 outlined also apply to this research area some of the constraints are limited availability of adequate and reliable data on groundwater availability annual seasonal consumption and recharge patterns within the study area and lack of an inventory of groundwater abstraction wells in the entire study area inadequate knowledge of the limits of groundwater development and its spatio temporal dispersion lack of integrated modelling of water systems both surface and ground water canal supplies irrigation water needs and agricultural output to produce empirical evidence of the effects of various combinations and scenarios of cm systems on social and economic consequences for cm planning lack of demonstration cases reliable information and suitable communication product s on cm communication opportunities prospects with various stakeholders the spatio temporal advantages of cm vs nothing under various water and food security situations must be determined only sporadic scientific studies exist on water availability assessment e g pandey et al 2019 2020 dahal et al 2020 inundation modelling and flood risk assessment prioritizing river basins for flood risk management dwri wrppf 2020a b c studies that consider water withdrawal patterns for agricultural applications and the maintenance of environmental flows are scarce similar to how groundwater irrigation command areas are referenced in literature there is no information about cm of surface and ground water across the study area there is a void in the literature about the current state of cm its limits lessons learned and empirical data supporting its widespread promotion such a discrepancy in focus and information availability is brought on by inadequate financial allocation emphasis on research for development projects as foster et al 2010 stated the frequent division of labour between surface and ground water production and or management frequently makes it difficult to recognize and engineer opportunities for planned cm it is vital therefore to have a single entity with the mandate and power to manage both surface and ground water resources lack of understanding of the importance of moving beyond an operationally easy self supply system to a more secure and resilient cm solution due to various factors including inadequate instruction in academic courses an unreliable power supply and insufficient rural electrification for groundwater pumping in canal command regions this can however be overcome using well designed solar irrigation pump programs which provide universal access to energy under developed institutional and policy ability at the local level needed to undertake management and use of water resources which are gender equitable and socially inclusive the great majority of pumps currently used to power irrigation in the study districts terai are run on diesel which contributes to climate crisis however these can be replaced with solar irrigation pumps 5 2 potential strategies to realize the prospects of cm strategies resources and commitments to overcoming these hurdles section 5 1 must be implemented to turn the prospect of cm in the study districts terai in western nepal into a reality the following subsections focus on appropriate tactics as well as areas of investment identified for the study districts in the terai 5 2 1 realign institutional mechanisms existing policies plans and strategies adequately emphasize cm however nepal s institutional mechanisms have not been realigned in line with their spirit in order to put it into effect an enabling environment for promoting cm can be created by realigning institutional mechanisms where surface and ground water in a command area and or basin are managed and developed through a single entity such as a river basin authority a starting point could be piloting this concept in a particular catchment and scaling it up based on the learnings the main concept is to encourage integrated use and management of surface and ground water resources while considering command areas as sub units and river basins as units removing the fragmented structure of governmental institutions including water management institutions charged with various water management functions may be necessary to effect reform on several fronts to attract the private sector to the anticipated cm irrigation schemes institutions must create an environment conducive to public private partnerships and community based investment engaging the private sector in cost recovery particularly in operation and maintenance may be difficult however institutions can develop an appropriate model through a few pilot projects in various contexts to ensure more return with less expenditure of public funds to achieve gender equitable and socially inclusive water resource management and use the institution should also support policy and institutional capacity development at the local level they can then work to improve energy and water use while also advocating for a reliable power supply in the command areas to support cm this can be done by encouraging solar irrigation programs in areas where grid connection has not yet been reached or there is an unreliable power supply 5 2 2 strengthen data assets prioritizing investments will help improve the monitoring of both surface and ground water resources the initial strategic interventions needed to achieve the intended cm project are appropriate monitoring both quantity and quality and use as well as building related mechanisms systems for database maintenance analysis and dissemination access a geographic database containing numerous factors including cropping patterns evapotranspiration water demands groundwater levels canal alignments and groundwater abstraction may be included in the routine monitoring in the end the monitoring will help determine which investments should be prioritized for hardware system modernization and improved infrastructure software improved database planning and management capabilities and institutional reforms in addition it will offer insights into designing interventions to increase water use efficiency through various paths such as crop diversity to control water demand to reduce irrigation system losses and encourage micro irrigation systems where suitable in addition initiatives for improving recharge and spring source protection must be designed and implemented to support cm 5 2 3 research awareness and capacity strengthening investments in research for development initiatives are advised to prioritize cm interventions according to the available data with changes in levels of groundwater usage in space and time and in surface water distribution this also incorporates integrated numerical modelling of irrigation canal flows groundwater use and aquifer response and soil water status several models have been proposed and used to maximize the benefits of water use e g paudyal and gupta 1990 onta et al 1991 however an integrated modelling approach such as that proposed by foster et al 2010 would be more suitable as it simultaneously integrates groundwater flow processes runoff canal inflows crop water requirements and crop yield as sustainable development and water resource management involve awareness of biophysical and socio institutional components research on the social and institutional aspects of cm and its translation into development are equally vital ultimately this would increase cm efficiency sustainability and gender equitable and socially inclusive access to and use of water resources in addition long term assistance for the agricultural economy can come from research on sustainable agriculture water use efficiency soil erosion control water quality quantity restoration and environmental risk assessment furthermore a major problem that needs to be solved through suitable study is how to translate legislative provisions on cm into actual practices and activities it is advised to conduct a thorough investigation into the terai aquifer a portion of the gangetic plain with a focus on integrated modelling of the whole surface and groundwater system including the chure region and evaluate the effects of various types of interventions on terai s groundwater system in the case of hills studies targeting defining recharge regions and evaluating the efficacy of various types of interventions in these recharge areas in recharge source area protection would be a good method to ensure groundwater supply for sustaining cm evidence for these interventions must be derived from monitoring data and subsequent analysis finally evidence based communication materials must be created to launch a long term campaign for raising awareness of effective water use conservation of available water sources and education focusing on various risks and costs associated with water mismanagement as well as the advantages of cm and methods for its planning and implementation 6 conclusions and recommendations access to irrigation is considered a primary constraint for optimal and stable crop yield and therefore a threat to food security in nepal the cm of surface and ground water can be considered an adaptation strategy however an integrated framework for assessing the prospects for cm and its implementation is lacking in the literature in this context this study developed a five component and 17 indicator framework for cm through literature review stakeholder consultation and expert interviews as elaborated in section 2 this was then applied to synthesize the overall prospects of cm in nepal s western terai first by providing the context of the region s importance in national food security section 3 and then discussing the status of each indicator section 4 finally potential strategies for realizing these prospects were highlighted along with their implementation challenges section 5 key conclusions are highlighted below water resource availability is relatively abundant the understanding of surfacewater availability and its spatio temporal distribution is good for example with surfacewater information is available for nine basins sub basins in the area albeit with varying levels of detail on essential hydrological features such as catchment area amount of water and water balance components specific discharge varies from 18 8 l s m2 upper karnali to 52 1 l s m2 mohana across the river systems however an integrated framework that looks at the overall water availability holistically across the entire region an adequate monitoring framework for both surface and ground water resources and prospects for augmenting water availability and developing water resources is lacking an integrated modelling of the entire hydrological system and its regular updating is crucial because adequate and integrated cm and water resources planning will not be achievable without tools processes and data that drive scenario development to support policy prioritizing and decision making despite availability access and productivity of water resources is low for various reasons such as lack of focus on estimating and monitoring water availability and use inadequate efforts to understand water use practices and preferences and low prioritization of systematic and continuous efforts towards enhancing water productivity energy is a key input for enhancing access to water in the context of western terai given the flat nature of terrain its access is relatively good with availability of different sources of energy however cost and affordability is an issue in some instances particularly for smallholder farmers water governance landscape capacity and awareness are key to creating an enabling environment for promoting cm in an area of interest overall assessment of the water governance landscape reveals that the policy landscape is conducive for promoting cm in the southern plain region of western nepal however emphasis on translating the policy into an action plan setting up an appropriate institutional framework internalizing the importance of social and equity aspects of cm and raising awareness of ensuring environmental health while optimizing agricultural productivity still need a significant attention one reason for this could be the lack of literature on cm and of demonstration projects in nepal in addition awareness capacity gaps basically re orienting already competent human resources towards cm focused concentrated investments and regular engagement with stakeholders to understand their concerns and share learnings are equally important aspects for achieving the goal of cm in the context of the study region however these are yet to be prioritized adequate prospects exist for cm to enable year round irrigation in the ftf zoi districts the terai due to the co existence of surface water and groundwater underutilization of groundwater resources and unreliable or insufficient water supply from surface water systems which draw water from rain fed and spring fed rivers although challenges and impediments exist on various fronts three strategies are recommended to translate the prospects for cm into implementation 1 re aligning institutional mechanisms in such a way that both surface and ground water are dealt with together by a single unit entity 2 strengthening data assets through regular monitoring and evaluation of the data and 3 investment in research awareness and capacity strengthening programs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8936,climate variability and insufficient irrigation are primary constraints to stable and higher agricultural productivity and food security in nepal agriculture is the largest global freshwater user and integration of surface and ground water use is frequently presented as an strategy for increasing efficiency as well as climate change adaptation however conjunctive management cm planning often ignores demand side requirements and a broader set of sustainable development considerations including ecosystem health and economics of different development strategies while there is generic understanding of conjunctive use detailed technical knowhow to realize the cm is lacking in nepal this article presents a holistic framework through literature reviews stakeholders consultations and expert interviews for assessing cm and implementation prospects from a systems level perspective we demonstrate the framework through a case study in western nepal where climatic variability and a lack of irrigation are key impediments to increased agricultural productivity and sustainable development results show that knowledge of water resources availability is good and that of water demand low in the western terai additional and coordinated investments are required to improve knowledge gaps as well as access to irrigation there is therefore a need to assess water resources availability water access use and productivity to fill the knowledge gaps in order to pave pathways for cm this paper also discusses some strategies to translate prospects of conjunctive management into implementation keywords climate change conjunctive use conjunctive management groundwater water policy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction global climate change adaptation in low income nations hinges on finding profitable and resilient water management methods for agriculture miralles wilhelm 2021 agricultural transformation can help move low income nations to middle income by 2030 as the agricultural sector in such countries accounts for more than 25 of gross domestic product gdp world bank 2021 nepal s net farmed land is 48 irrigated while only 39 has year round irrigation imp 2019 iirrigated agriculture can contribute in achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs medici and de wrachien 2016 such as sdg 1 sdg 2 and sdg 13 as irrigation can be associated with inclusive growth food security and climate resilience for example irrigating rain fed systems can enhance wheat 34 9 and maize 22 13 yields worldwide wang et al 2021 buffering production against dry spells and drought thus affecting food availability and costs namara et al 2010 irrigation s year round benefits dwarf the prior statistics namara et al 2010 however increasing physical and economic water shortages challenge to sustainable and equitable access to water in agriculture tran and weger 2018 among others with arid areas facing severe difficulties in response to these pressures the conjunctive use cu and conjunctive management cm of surface and ground water resources is a frequently cited principle for adapting agricultural water management to climatic change foster et al 2010 evans et al 2014 van der gun 2020 cm refers to coordinated surface and ground water management and cu refers to the efficient use of both resources van steenbergen 2015 following the definition of van steenbergen 2015 this paper uses the term cm to discuss the co management of both the resources within its context although ample evidence exists of integrated impact assessments on the one hand bejranonda 2013 afshar et al 2021 and some governance guidelines on the other hand hamamouche 2017 foster et al 2010 the appropriate framework for assessing and implementing cm remains largely absent this paper presents an integrated framework for assessing and implementing cm in agriculture to address this knowledge gap through a case study approach to irrigation development in western nepal the region has significant irrigation development projects underway for surface and ground water highlighting its importance for achieving sdg6 and sdg13 all four priority irrigation projects in nepal designated as national pride projects are located in western nepal npc 2021 significant ongoing private investments in groundwater irrigation highlight the need for better access to water among the region s farmers urfels 2020 in the context of a lack of a comprehensive methodology for evaluating cm practice this study aims to answer following questions 1 how has cm planning literature evolved over time and what might be an appropriate conceptual framework for assessing status of cm in an area 2 what is the status of cm in western nepal as reflected by appling the newly developed framework 3 what considerations or strategies are required to implement the cm framework in practice 2 development of a methodological framework for cm planning and implementation 2 1 evolution of cm as an irrigation policy tool consumptive use has been a water management approach to achieving socio economic benefits since the 1960s bhattarai and shakya 2019 vincent and dempsey 1993 described how since then cm has developed as a tool for water resources planning and irrigation scheme management joining the world bank s irrigation policy in the early 1980s after pakistan s agricultural productivity increased by 20 china liu hu and chen 2020 algeria hamamouche kuper riaux and leduc 2017 australia ticehurst and curtis 2019 spain escalante and sauto 2018 and india dillon et al 2009 all use cm for irrigation however different sectors stakeholders interpret cm differently this paper defines cm as a planned and coordinated integration of surface and ground water use management over time and space in order to facilitate irrigation applicable to all scales of management to optimize productivity and achieve environmental sustainability and equity bhattarai and shakya 2019 evans evans and holland 2014 fao 1995 foster van steenbergen zuleta and garduño 2010 hamamouche et al 2017 vincent and dempsey 1993 the basic principle of cm is to regulate surface and ground water use based on needs and objectives and to optimize the distribution of both surface and ground water in a command area at a time liu et al 2020 hedging reduces environmental externalities e g energy for deep pumping non attainment of ecosystem flow requirements with surface water diversions and hazards such as crop failure or yield loss instead of developing one source to make up for the mismanagement of another cm seeks to maximize water use s by pumping groundwater during the dry season it creates additional subterranean room to store surface water arising from infiltration during high flows for use in the next season cm has many benefits that may improve socioeconomic results foster et al 2010 but it depends on hydrological and hydrogeological conditions it can buffer high flow in surface water supply systems in order to adjust to climate change and provide irrigation foster et al 2010 rao et al 2004 ticehurst and curtis 2019 it also lowers flood hazards improves health and sanitation and boosts environmental flows however the cm approach demands the co existence and economic availability of both surface and ground water resources a surface water distribution system requires significant capital and operating costs with its management demanding strong social organization the cm related interventions have varied advantages determined by governance infrastructure and water management evans et al 2014 these can be engineered aquifer storage and or recovery involve integrated water planning and be bottom up farmer led at the farm level or top down a more strategic approach where inputs of both resources are managed planned centrally by the government holley et al 2016 2 2 conjunctive management in practice nepal and most of south asia have yet to fully implement cm planning meeting national and global goals such as the sdgs is hindered by the lack of a strategic vision for cm planning to support socio economic outcomes foster et al 2010 optimizing surface and ground water use management depending on the situation requires major financial investment infrastructure and institutional conversion the cm s hydrological cycle connectivity is appealing holley et al 2016 however joint use in irrigation projects mobilizes groundwater for many purposes rather than methodically optimising water use and conservation vincent and dempsey 1993 though literature exists on the effects of joint use on farmers and water management by significantly modifying irrigation system reliability while minimizing externalities the technique comes at a cost expenses which are reasonable if dependability and externalities improve these factors rely on context both resources have cm concerns and information gaps including irrigation command areas need to move from spontaneous cu to cm however an upper limit on groundwater abstraction should be recognized for cm in irrigation which varies with the scenario of surface water delivery and hydrogeological setting of an area foster and van steenbergen 2011 although farmers use groundwater to supplement surface water deficit by default where the possibility exists the cm needs to be considered at the system scale rather than only at the farm scale it requires a realistic estimate of water demand and availability the constraints for planned and coordinated cm are related to various aspects such as water resource availability and physical characteristics of water resources cleaver 2012 physical infrastructure and operational institutions foster and van steenbergen 2011 in addition to environmental and social equity issues hamamouche et al 2017 failure to characterize existing and potential irrigation institutions critical assessment of their functioning and exploring their linkages and information exchange mechanisms is not only a fundamental limitation for planned and coordinated management of surface and ground water resources but also for exploring prospects for improved policies addressing this challenge requires efforts to coordinate across actors and sectors e g individuals distinct water sources potentially governed by different authorities etc blomquist schlager and heikkila 2004 there are equity issues in cm with difficulty in securing equal equitable access rights to and ownership for to all sections of society over surce and ground water resources khadka et al 2021 not all areas have equal prospects of achieving cm characterizing current cm practices synthesizing learnings and assessing the prospects for planned cm provides an adequate basis for workable plans to achieve it achieving effective cm requires various strategies such as planned investments in hardware e g modernization software digitized and real time resources monitoring and improved databases and planning and management capacities it may entail institutional reform shah et al 2006 optimizing cm also requires providing equal attention to the capacity building of irrigation system managers and farmers 2 3 a framework for cm planning and implementation the overall framework that is a basic structure underlying the concept for assessing the prospects for cm planning and implementation was developed based on literature review stakeholder consultation and expert interviews it consists of components of assessing prospects as well as identifying potential strategies for realizing the prospects for the planned cm fig 1 each of the components is elaborated in the following sub chapters 2 3 1 assessing prospects for cm planning based on insights from the literature and engagement with stakeholders through virtual workshops a five component and 17 indicator methodological framework fig 2 has been developed to assess prospects of the cm in the study area and address knowledge gaps identified in the earlier section most of the accessible literature across the globe was reviewed rigorously to characterize various aspects of the cm to be considered in identifying the prospects the relevant literature was collected screened and examined to synthesize such initiatives a google search using selected key words e g hydropower project irrigation project water supply project western nepal karnali basin water development programme found existing and proposed water development projects in usaid s feed the future zone of influence ftf zoi area in sudurpashchim and lumbini provinces the websites of the following government departments provided project information department of energy development doed bheri babai diversion multipurpose project water resources project preparatory facility water and energy commission secretariat wecs nepal electricity authority and department of water supply and sanitation management dwssm for project updates project related websites e g digo jal bikas the rising nepal prime minister agriculture modernization project my republica etc in nepali and english language were searched irrigation water use and inventory 2018 and irrigation master plan 2019 were also reviewed this identified 35 articles papers reviewing abstracts and paper contents was the first step to screen the literature then literature on existing and proposed projects news updates and evidence of a report providing crucial information on the water project were chosen screening the literature yielded 28 studies eight were then removed because they provided general information for a small area or a thorough engineering design some material was perception based or review based therefore original and latest reports were followed finally 19 items of literature were chosen for extensive review and synthesis a preliminary framework was shared with stakeholders during a virtual workshop with more than 25 participants including a mix of representatives of government agencies policymakers and implementing departments non government agencies the private sector research academic sector and local government and community representatives well ahead of the workshop the draft methodology was shared with the participants who were briefed over the phone about the framework and their consent obtained for paraticipation in the workshop on the day of the workshop the methodology was presented briefly after which each stakeholder in turn was requested to share their thoughts turn by turn on suitability of indicators availability of data and ways of implementing the framework the methodology framework was finalized after incorporating the stakeholder inputs although the climate crisis is not explicitly spelled out in the indicators and components they are already embedded in the components and indicators related to water resource availability and water demand as climate change can affect both of these e g pandey et al 2019 2020b future water demand is associated with both climatic and non climatic factors such as land use cover change economic growth potential changes in agricultural and food security policies both primary and secondary data were collected pre processed and analysed results were validated in consultation with stakeholders following the approach suggested in ticehurst and curtis 2019 secondary data include hydrological and meteorological data collected from the hydro met department of nepal and published literature primary data includes situation assessment on various aspects of cm e g status of monitoring prospects for augmentation water use practices human resources and technical capacity through engagement with a well mixed group of stakeholders 2 3 2 identifying workable strategies to realize the prospects the western plains the terai of nepal was selected as a case study area for operationalising the framework and after a rigoous literature review the current status of all the indicators was synthesized and potential strategies identified for realizing the prospects for the cm these were further streamlined and finalized in consultation with various stakeholders and taking into consideration suitability for the study area 3 context and description of the case study area western nepal s southern plain the southern plain in western nepal part of the south asia s indo gangetic plain is among nepal s most impoverished and food insecure regions and is thus crucial for progress towards sdg1 and sdg2 at the same time this region has already experienced climate change impacts on water availability pandey et al 2019 2020b and is prone to drought 3 1 agriculture and water management in nepal agriculture production is a decisive factor in the sustainable development of nepal s socio economy it engages more than 60 of the population and is the second largest contributor to gdp 27 however the sector s productivity is poor ifad 2020 nepal has a relatively abundant amount of water resources 99 3 mm3 ha of irrigable land 7707 m3 capita year data source irrigable land area from irrigation master plan water resources availability from moewri 2020 population from cbs 2021 however according to government statistics only 48 of the net cultivated area has some sort of irrigation facility and only 39 has year round irrigation yri imp 2019 furthermore economic development and population growth increase the water demand of agriculture and other sectors in turn increasing the demand for water overall at the same time climate change is expected to lead to a more erratic water supply wecs 2011 enhancing access to irrigation has therefore become a key challenge for the sustainable development of agriculture in nepal and this can be addressed through the integrated use of surface and ground water resources or through cm although cu is happening by default in southern nepal because it is a surface water rich country cm is typically left out of the picture or marginalized in policy and plans upadhyay and gaudel 2018 in this context cm can be considered as an important pathway for enhancing access to irrigation and prioritizing investments because of its prospects to enhance water use efficiency improve water security and ultimately result in better water productivity along with several other benefits e g flood management pandey et al 2021 furthermore cm can effectively maximize water use benefits through augmenting supply increasing productivity avoiding aquifer mining and integrating surface and ground water management mattiuzi marques and medellín azuara 2019 the irrigation master plan of nepal imp 2019 mentions that out of 48 of irrigated land in nepal 19 is irrigated by cu not cm which is primarily spontaneous unplanned unregulated and unmanaged foster and van steenbergen 2011 pandey et al 2021 however cm which focuses on government led initiatives on groundwater development and use for a larger area ideally with community participation is still not receiving enough attention in nepal in general and western nepal in particular nevertheless the imp 2019 established a bold goal to increase yri from the current 39 55 by 2025 66 by 2030 and 100 by 2045 similarly nearly 60 of cultivated land in the southern plain of nepal also known as the food basket of the country has access to irrigation most of it from groundwater urfels mcdonald krupnik and van oel 2020 still groundwater resources in terai s alluvial aquifers are underutilized for various reasons including energy constraints access or affordability that limit the farmers ability for groundwater pumping nepal neupane belbase pandey and mukherji 2021 under these circumstances in the southern plain of the country targets for yri can be achieved only through cm 3 2 description of the study area this case study focuses primarily on the ftf zoi which spans 237 palikas in 21 districts in three provinces in western nepal six of those districts are in the terai fig 3 which accounts for an area of approximately 1 22 million hectares mha ftf zoi is considered as one of the important areas in the nation with the ability to contribute to doubling growth through productivity improvement about 6 9 million people live in this region and roughly 21 are considered poor ftf 2016 both surface and ground water resources exist in terai five river systems i e west rapti mahakali karnali mohana and babai in the region provide surface water resources while other rivers from the chure or mahabharat mountains are rain or spring fed the mahakali and karnali are snow fed perennial rivers climatic factors such as drought and heat stress impact the ftf zoi in the terai which lowers the productivity of the local farming systems utilizing available water resources sustainably through cm may be a feasible approach to the problem however this will be determined by the economics of canal development operation and maintenance the ftf zoi has a diverse socio economy and culture more than half of the population in the study area are smallholder farmers 0 5 ha landholding or are landless with the major source of income being a seasonal migration and rain fed agriculture khadka et al 2021 4 prospects for planned cm in southern plain of western nepal in various irrigation systems in the terai region of nepal spontaneous unplanned cu is already in practice water managers and other essential stakeholders have not had enough policy conversations on cm however the ftf zoi areas offer a wealth of options and prospects for cm because of their high recharge capacity accessibility to surface water supplies and potential for high agricultural productivity due to their fertile fields this section is divided into five sub sections each defined by a set of indicators as per the framework for analysing prospects fig 3 the overall status of each indicator is summarized in tabular form in sm 1 4 1 water resources availability and understanding 4 1 1 surface water availability there are five river systems in the ftf zoi region fig 4 the largest is the karnali which has several sub basins that is west seti bheri tila humla karnali and mugu karnali and drains around 50 000 km2 of land up to the indian border many southern rivers are seasonal but during the rainy season they constitute a significant water source for cultivation these flow levels of those rivers can decrease dramatically during the non monsoon season as they mostly depends on monsoon precipitation shrestha et al 2018 due to their seasonal nature and low flow during the dry season the rivers are not ideal for an irrigation supply without surface storage according to observations the terai s numerous tiny southern rivers provide 13 of the nation s average flow compared to 9 from the medium basins and 78 from the large ones wecs 2011 studies specifically on southern rivers of western nepal are not accessible key hydrological features and surface water availability both current and future of the major basins sub basins are reported in several literature e g wecs 2011 dhami et al 2018 tripathee 2018 mishra et al 2018 bhatta et al 2020 dahal et al 2020 pandey et al 2010 2019 2020a 2020b etc and provided in sm 2a specific discharge of the basins sub basins vary from 18 8 l s m2 in upper karnali above the lalighat hydrological station to 52 1 l s m2 in mohana sm 2b as tabulated in sm 2a average annual water availability in the karnali river basin above chisapani hydrological station a approx 42 500 km2 is projected to increase by 8 4 and 10 9 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively in far future 2070 2099 the current level of understanding of surface water availability is relatively good although the total amount of surface water passing through the ftf zoi is abundant strong seasonality spatial distribution and topographical differences between river reach and agricultural areas have posed challenges for various beneficial uses using groundwater available in the indo gangetic alluvial aquifer system in conjunction with surface water could be an appropriate strategy for the study area 4 1 2 groundwater availability within the ftf zoi all the terai districts except dang have flat topography due to its abundance and high quality groundwater is the terai region s most significant water source nepal s terai and inner terai regions are thought to have abundant groundwater resources although they are underdeveloped pathak 2018 it is predicted that 88 of the groundwater that might be extracted sustainably is not being used leaving plenty of room to increase groundwater use for productivity growth urfels et al 2020 understanding aquifer systems their hydrogeologic properties and the availability and distribution both spatial and temporal of groundwater is essential for the sustainable exploitation and management of groundwater resources to characterize groundwater availability in the ftf zoi in western terai this study discovered screened and ultimately reviewed 11 items of literature as detailed in pandey et al 2021 there are primarily two types of aquifer systems in nepal s terai shallow aquifers 0 46 m depth and deep aquifers 46 m depth gdc 1994 the aquifer characteristics and groundwater quality are provided in sm 3 the maximum aquifer yield from those aquifers vary from 167 to 2592 m3 day see sm 3 recharge from the terai s northern boundary the bhabar zone along the siwalik foothills results in the terai s renewable groundwater supplies shrestha et al 2018 with rainfall and lateral inflows from the bhabar zone directly infiltrating the terai s aquifers recharging them subsurface inflow and seepage losses through streams and rivers also provide significant inputs to the groundwater recharge the terai region of nepal still lacks a clear delineation of groundwater recharge regions analysis of data presented in imp 2019 estimated based on projections of net groundwater recharge from a swat model indicates that renewable groundwater availability m yr across the ftf zoi districts varies from 0 11 dang to 0 26 kailali 0 33 banke 0 38 bardiya 0 42 kapilbastu and 0 48 kanchanpur the calculations also consider the relative contributions from the terai bhabar and seepage zones according to wecs 2011 dang s shallow aquifer alone has an estimated 130 140 mcm yr groundwater availability while groundwater abstraction for domestic use alone is estimated to be 7 43 mcm year sapkota 2003 calculated the safe yield from the groundwater aquifers in the southern portion of dang valley to be 31 6 mcm year indicating stress on the groundwater system the actual volume of groundwater abstraction would be significantly larger after incorporating abstraction for irrigation this shows that adequate planning and management are required to sustainably manage and use groundwater resources in the ftf zoi few studies describe groundwater quality in the ftf zoi but there are issues with it as indicated in sm 2 for example of six terai districts in nepal including kailali and kanchanpur in the ftf zoi yadav et al 2012 analyzed the susceptibility of arsenic pollution out of the six study districts the kailali district has the highest mean arsenic concentration 6270 ppb followed by kanchanpur 4980 ppb 4 1 3 monitoring and scientific understanding of water availability eighty two hydrological stations 41 precipitation stations and 23 climatic stations monitor hydro climatic conditions within and around the watershed i e in three provinces in the ftf zoi area within the terai districts of ftf zoi alone there are 13 precipitation stations and seven climatic stations daily average values of hydro met parameters are available at those stations and data length and quality vary across the stations the wmo guidelines suggest having one station every 600 900 km2 in the plain area as an ideal condition and every 900 3000 km2 as an acceptable condition cited in subramanya 2013 an observation of just the terai area of the ftf zoi indicates an adequate number of stations for monitoring precipitation in all terai ftf districts except kailali i e rainguage density of kapilbastu 1656 km2 dang 1507 km2 banke 473 km2 bardiya 504 km2 kailali 3312 km2 kanchanpur 1633 km2 due to insufficient thorough hydrological modelling scientific understanding of surface water resources is lacking for various basins including west rapti and babai including all water balance components and their spatio temporal distribution over historical periods in addition these watersheds lack information on predicted future climatic changes and their effects on water supply despite the abundance of information the spatio temporal distribution of groundwater resources storage recharge across various locations and depths in aquifers is not sufficiently described in the literature which lacks an estimate of the aquifers sustainable output at various sites and depths most groundwater quality investigations with sizable sample sizes are carried out in kailali kanchanpur and dang districts but similar studies are also necessary for other regional districts to properly define the spatial distribution of groundwater quality in the ftf zoi region as vital as evaluating the existing state of groundwater resources is understanding the recharge process and prospects for recharge augmentation are equally important to ensure a continued supply of groundwater for the projected cm it calls for knowledge of recharge trends and seasonality groundwater storage and availability and evaluating various strategies for recharge augmentation and water sources protection eventhough this information is extremely significant it is not commonly known because of lack of relevant studies in nepal or the study area 4 1 4 prospects for augmentation being a part of a large alluvial aquifer of the indo gangetic plain the groundwater aquifers are recharged relatively faster in the terai region of nepal this argument is also supported by the fact that less than a quarter of 8 8 bcm average annual groundwater recharge is utilized extracted in the terai nepal et al 2021 however given the heterogeneity of the aquifer system there is spatio temporal variability in groundwater availability with prospects therefore for augmenting water resource availability through rainwater harvesting and managed aquifer recharge however no studies or practical experiences of this have been documented this means that a detailed scientific study is needed to identify an appropriate location sizing rainwater harvesting and recharge systems and workable technologies for that specific geography similarly inter basin water transfer for bringing water to water deficit basins from water surplus basins is already under progress in the ftf zoi region under the bheri babi diversion project the bheri river is being transferred to irrigate the command area of the babai irrigation project several such types of projects with multiple purposes can be conceptualized and planned to address water and energy security issues simultaneously 4 2 water access and productivity 4 2 1 total water demand designing systems for simultaneous use of surface and ground water resources requires the understanding of water needs and their spatio temporal distribution to develop and execute conjunctive water usage systems it is essential to identify water demand hotspots evaluate the availability of water there and investigate potential water sources based on a thorough analysis of 11 items of literature found and screened using a method described by pandey et al 2021 the current state of knowledge about water demand was summarized the review found that there had not been a thorough investigation into the estimates of water demand within the ftf zoi a few studies have approximated both domestic and irrigation water demand but none completely cover the ftf zoi for instance pandey et al 2010 reported irrigation and domestic water demand across the basins revealing that babai uses the most water 77 of the water resources available mahakali uses the least water 2 6 and karnali and mahakali both have significant potential for new water development projects sm 4 information on district profiles released by moald sm 5a and updated information available in the irrigation master plan imp 2019 and other sources sm 5b have helped to calculate irrigation water demand in three terai districts inside the ftf zoi area finally sm 5c summarizes pertinent data for evaluating water consumption including total agricultural area area under main cereal crops such as rice and wheat and areas under surface irrigation systems furthermore probable groundwater hotspots mapped as distribution of deep tubewells throughout nepal s terai districts and published in a study by pathak 2018 can also be considered as a proxy for spatial distribution of water demand 4 2 2 water access status and constraints the ftf zoi region has a long history of water development activities aimed at improving water access and gon implements numerous water resource development initiatives and programs in coordination with international aid organizations and academic institutions many involve small scale irrigation hydropower sanitation and water supply some of which pandey et al 2021 summarise with a particular focus on water resources and irrigation as irrigation accounts for most water consumption only irrigation related schemes are included in this article the irrigation and water resources management project iwrmp non conventional irrigation technology project nitp medium irrigation project mip and community managed irrigation agriculture project cmiasp are some noteworthy efforts in essence nitp supports micro irrigation technologies and creates effective irrigation systems for them table 1 provides an overview of key irrigation development factors in the ftf zoi districts terai only despite availability of water resources and several initiatives access to irrigation is still a problem as stated in section 3 a major part of this is more due to economic water scarcity than physical scarcity the anticipated shift in hydrology and streamflow brought on by climate change is likely to further affect water availability pandey et al 2020b the majority of the ftf zoi districts have access to both surface and ground water with the latter supplying irrigation to 28 of the total irrigated land proper handling of the issue of economic water scarcity by reducing energy costs means that groundwater has strategic importance in the satisfying spatio temporal distribution of water demand due to its availability in aquifers in the terai please refer to sm 6 for the overall status of access to surface and ground water irrigation 4 2 3 water use practices preferences and efficiencies according to hydrogeological mapping the terai has enough renewable groundwater resources to provide effective irrigation of agricultural farmlands nepal et al 2021 with only about 22 of its dynamic groundwater recharge capacity have been used thus far shrestha et al 2018 although a thorough scientific investigation is needed to map the spatio temporal distribution of groundwater and safe sustainable yield in connection to irrigated land and cropping systems sustainable solutions could be implemented to better manage groundwater resources preferences for using one water source over another also have implications for the success of cm making an understanding people s preferences over the selection of source selection of irrigation method for efficiency awareness of water related issues and benefits of cm and behaviourial factors such as inclination towards compliance with the rule of law highly valuable information for assessing the prospects for cm in an area however as no such information is available in the existing literature further research is required to characterize these aspects 4 2 4 water productivity status and constraints water productivity for the crop can be defined as crop yield per cubic meter of water consumed cai and rosegrant 2003 increasing the water productivity in agriculture reduces the need for additional irrigation water and is a critical response to increasing water scarcity there are many promising pathways to increase water productivity in developing countries including supplemental irrigation soil fertility maintenance deficit irrigation small scale affordable management practices for water storage delivery and application modern irrigation technologies such as pressured systems and drip irrigation and soil water conservation through zero or minimum tillage molden et al 2007 there have been several experiments to measure the water productivity for different crop establishment and irrigation methods to increase the water productivity and hence profitability of the rice wheat crop systems in nepal devkota et al 2019 mandal et al 2009 devkota et al 2019 compared direct seeded rice dsr with puddled transplanted rice tpr which is the traditional method of rice cultivation similarly it compared zero tillage wheat ztw with conventional tillage wheat ctw devkota et al 2019 concluded that the alternative crop establishment methods for rice and wheat are not only commercially viable options but can also produce similar or higher yields while saving water and labour reducing costs increasing net profit and b c ratio experiments by mandal et al 2009 found similar results regarding water savings and increase in water productivity for alternative crop establishment methods compared to the traditional crop establishment and irrigation methods it also concluded that conventional tillage crop establishment and water management practices in rice tpr and wheat ctw required a large amount of irrigation water and labour compared to the water wise and cost effective alternatives for rice dsr and wheat ztw establishment 4 3 energy access and affordability 4 3 1 availability of energy sources and status of access energy is required to pump water from the groundwater table meaning that access to energy is of prime concern to introduce groundwater to cm depending upon location different energy sources are accessible such as grid based energy solar based energy and diesel based energy for pumps a vast majority of users use diesel pumps due to their flexibility at the location time of interest and availability for hiring solar based and grid based energy is also being used for pumping groundwater however an unreliable power supply and inadequate rural electrification are the challenges in the area moreover comprehensive data information with quantitative information on access to different energy sources is unavailable a knowledge gap therefore exists 4 3 2 cost of various sources of energy and affordability diesel water pumps dominate the water pumping sectors in nepal followed by electric water pumps consolidated management services nepal pvt ltd 2013 the rising cost of diesel and the increasing rental charge of pump sets have consistently been a cause of disappointment among farmers of all categories urfels et al 2020 listed key factors that limit shallow tubewell use in areas with a predominance of diesel pumps they include poor coordination among water users delays in pump and tubewell availability financial constraints and risk aversion towards cash investment it was also suggested that the electric grid permits lower cost pumps and solar powered irrigation systems could reduce operating costs the aversion to cash investments can be overcome at the farm level by raising awareness of the importance of timely irrigation coupled with efforts to increase operational efficiency e g pump maintenance pump sizing and forecast based irrigation scheduling urfels et al 2020 the gon has introduced policies and mechanisms subsidies and credit financing to encourage renewable energy in the irrigation sector to improve agricultural productivity and production renewable world and aciar 2018 thapa et al 2020 solar technology is one of the new technologies able to reach farmers who do not have access to grid power and who are ready to switch from fossil fuel based to clean energy technologies comparative studies of the cost per unit of water in different pumping technologies show that the cost of the electric pump is comparatively the lowest followed by the solar water pump when capacity utilization factor cuf is above 50 renewable world and aciar 2018 thapa et al 2020 the comparative cost for different pumping technologies is shown in table 2 while solar pumping seems an attractive option when used at about 50 cuf the high upfront cost inaccessibility to technology and after sales services are hindering to popularization and flourishing the system among smallholder farmers the rising cost of diesel and increasing rental charge of pump sets have consistently been a cause of disappointment among farmers of all categories 4 4 water governance landscape khadka et al 2021 provided a summary of the overall governance environment relating to the development of water resources in the ftf zoi there are restrictions and issues with groundwater based irrigation due to numerous legislative institutional investment and governance issues sugden et al 2020 urfels and foster 2020 scaling farmer led irrigation as well as cm of surface water and groundwater resources is systematically hampered by inadequate consideration of the local socio economic context the larger enabling environment and governance aspects of irrigation as well as by a greater focus on large physical infrastructures and engineering centered approaches khadka et al 2021 overcoming those obstacles will need inclusive and sustainable irrigation development and multi actor participation in irrigation planning decision making and investment minh et al 2020 khadka et al 2021 4 4 1 policy landscape regarding cm cm has been emphasized and prioritized in policy documents since the early 1990 s thus providing ample space for its promotion however translating the policy and strategies into action is yet to achieve momentum nepal s irrigation policy 1992 mentioned the need for promoting cm to optimize the use and management of available water resources to increase irrigated agriculture while the agricultural perspective plan 1995 emphasized the use of groundwater and the intensification of shallow tube wells implying the idea to introducing groundwater use into the system where irrigation was predominantly gained from surface water thus promoting cm of both resources similarly activities under the fourth output of water resources strategy 2002 mention developing yri and improving groundwater development and management implying prioritization of cm policy principles adopted in national water plan 2005 mention that water resource development and management shall be undertaken in a holistic and systematic manner relying on iwrm it also implies that both surface water and groundwater should be developed and managed in an integrated way providing space for planned cm although it did not spell out cm in the action programs it focused on expanding groundwater development nevertheless targets for increasing yri and irrigation efficiency imply a focus on the planned cm also irrigation policy 2013 mentions cm in the suggestions bullet of conception abadharana section similarly section 1 6 2 of the policy mentions considering prospects for cm as one of the criteria for selecting an irrigation project furthermore strategy 2 and its first policy karyaniti 1 of the water resources policy 2020 highlight on integrated management of water resources the sixth policy karyaniti of the seccond strategy mentions prioritizing cm based on prospects and needs 4 4 2 institutional settings to promote cm an enabling environment to facilitate cm can be created by setting up a single institution with the mandate authority to look after the development and management of both surface and ground water resources however in the context of this study area in particular and the entire nepal in general the authority to manage surface and ground water lies with different institutions thus creating a barrier to promoting planned cm ten sectoral ministries are also involved in water resources watershed management and irrigation services and development even though moewri is the primary line ministry at the federal level setting water resources and irrigation policies khadka et al 2021 if moewri does not create and implement an institutional water cooperation and development system there is a greater likelihood that strategies and programs will be duplicated at the federal level 4 4 3 social and equity aspects of cm gender and social equity issues of water access management and use in the ftf zoi are complex and institutional mechanisms policies and programs of the state and non state actors must integrate these issues in cm the gon has implemented several private irrigation subsidies to assist smallholders and boost technology adoption however irrigation technology subsidies mostly benefit better off farmers due to a lack of inclusive criteria and application processes khadka et al 2021 in addition although women provide the main source of labour for irrigated agricultural production and value chains they have limited access to technologies and information regarding multiple use water services and skills or knowledge of the impacts of the climate crisis on the water and food systems moreover irrigation technology and infrastructure are not gender friendly khadka et al 2021 the implementation of inclusive principles outlined in national policies has been constrained by the persistence of the interest of water professionals and institutions in the technical aspects of irrigation development and the dearth of social science expertise knowledge and effort in water intervention shrestha and clement 2019 this scenario reveals that nepal s water and irrigation sectors need to approach water development differently and water interventions should focus on empowering smallholder farmers and women in order to capitalize on the potential positive impacts of cm on people s livelihoods the environment and water security khadka et al 2021 as the constitution of nepal 2015 has devolved more roles and responsibility for local water supply irrigation and watershed conservation to local governments there is a need for policy and institutional capacity development at the local level to implement gender equitable and socially inclusive water resource management and use khadka et al 2021 4 4 4 environmental aspects cm aims at maximizing water productivity and minimizing environmental externalities relevant regulations for limiting groundwater extraction penalties for over extraction of groundwater and guidelines for minimizing groundwater pollution contamination should therefore be in place to support the implementation of cm however these aspects are yet to gain attention in the ftf zoi area 4 5 capacity and awareness 4 5 1 human resources or technical capacity a generic understanding of cm exists among stakeholders in the ftf zoi however detailed technical knowhow on realizing the cm is lacking among farmers and the government s implementing agencies it is primarily because cm is neither prioritized in the university curriculum nor in various capacity building programs organized over time as skilled human resources in relevant agencies are the key to the successful design and implementation of cm tailored training programs with a specific focus on its various aspects are certainly essential for stakeholders related to water and irrigation and working in the ftf zoi area 4 5 2 financial capacity for investment in cm the government s spending on irrigation is continuing to increase however investment is not properly focused cm does not need significant extra investment but rather strategizing and reorienting current investments better as revealed by interaction with relevant stakeholders financial capacity is therefore not a key constraint for cm in the study area 4 5 3 understanding of various stakeholders and practices of cm various types of stakeholder are aware of the cu cm concept and consider it a good one but remark on its lack of demonstration until the 5th periodic plan 1975 80 the focus was on providing adequate irrigation for paddy the concept of yri started to gain attention from the 6th periodic plan 1980 85 this concept then attracted the idea of cm although it is referred to as cu in these policies and planning documents for many years however nepal has been unable to present a successful case of cm though cu is in default in many cases there is no evidence of successful cm cases in nepal the arjun khola irrigation system located in deupur in lamahi dang was designed probably as the first case for cm back in 1994 to irrigate 475 ha of command area the arjun khola had adequate water for the wet season but no water for the dry season and so three deep and three shallow tubewells were constructed to supplement the dry season water deficit initial results were good but it failed for various reasons one being the rigidity of the distribution system as the conveyance system designed for the surface water system is not appropriate for the groundwater system for example in the case of deep tubewells the field channel sizes required for dry and winter seasons are entirely different this is because larger conveyance systems in the dry season would result in more losses and costs for water pumped from the groundwater system other potential reasons include but are not limited to i differential cost for surface water and groundwater i e a greater cost for groundwater use than for surface water use ii lack of exposure and therefore capacity in the planning of cm system iii unavailability of technical expertise for o m in the locality iv institutional aspect i e the working culture withboth surface and ground water personnel enjoying working independently v operation and maintenance aspect e g demand charge potential risk of failure of the system while not working for six months or so during the wet season etc vi unequal access to groundwater based on gender and socio economic conditions and vii difference in the subsidy technical assistance provided by the government for surface and ground water 5 strategies to implement cm in western nepal 5 1 challenges and impediments the development of a cm system faces constraints in the ftf zoi areas terai of nepal inadequate technical capabilities and organizational structure socio political realities a lack of emphasis on research based development approaches data information shortages and a lack of encouraging and disseminating research are some of its underlying causes some of the barriers that foster et al 2010 outlined also apply to this research area some of the constraints are limited availability of adequate and reliable data on groundwater availability annual seasonal consumption and recharge patterns within the study area and lack of an inventory of groundwater abstraction wells in the entire study area inadequate knowledge of the limits of groundwater development and its spatio temporal dispersion lack of integrated modelling of water systems both surface and ground water canal supplies irrigation water needs and agricultural output to produce empirical evidence of the effects of various combinations and scenarios of cm systems on social and economic consequences for cm planning lack of demonstration cases reliable information and suitable communication product s on cm communication opportunities prospects with various stakeholders the spatio temporal advantages of cm vs nothing under various water and food security situations must be determined only sporadic scientific studies exist on water availability assessment e g pandey et al 2019 2020 dahal et al 2020 inundation modelling and flood risk assessment prioritizing river basins for flood risk management dwri wrppf 2020a b c studies that consider water withdrawal patterns for agricultural applications and the maintenance of environmental flows are scarce similar to how groundwater irrigation command areas are referenced in literature there is no information about cm of surface and ground water across the study area there is a void in the literature about the current state of cm its limits lessons learned and empirical data supporting its widespread promotion such a discrepancy in focus and information availability is brought on by inadequate financial allocation emphasis on research for development projects as foster et al 2010 stated the frequent division of labour between surface and ground water production and or management frequently makes it difficult to recognize and engineer opportunities for planned cm it is vital therefore to have a single entity with the mandate and power to manage both surface and ground water resources lack of understanding of the importance of moving beyond an operationally easy self supply system to a more secure and resilient cm solution due to various factors including inadequate instruction in academic courses an unreliable power supply and insufficient rural electrification for groundwater pumping in canal command regions this can however be overcome using well designed solar irrigation pump programs which provide universal access to energy under developed institutional and policy ability at the local level needed to undertake management and use of water resources which are gender equitable and socially inclusive the great majority of pumps currently used to power irrigation in the study districts terai are run on diesel which contributes to climate crisis however these can be replaced with solar irrigation pumps 5 2 potential strategies to realize the prospects of cm strategies resources and commitments to overcoming these hurdles section 5 1 must be implemented to turn the prospect of cm in the study districts terai in western nepal into a reality the following subsections focus on appropriate tactics as well as areas of investment identified for the study districts in the terai 5 2 1 realign institutional mechanisms existing policies plans and strategies adequately emphasize cm however nepal s institutional mechanisms have not been realigned in line with their spirit in order to put it into effect an enabling environment for promoting cm can be created by realigning institutional mechanisms where surface and ground water in a command area and or basin are managed and developed through a single entity such as a river basin authority a starting point could be piloting this concept in a particular catchment and scaling it up based on the learnings the main concept is to encourage integrated use and management of surface and ground water resources while considering command areas as sub units and river basins as units removing the fragmented structure of governmental institutions including water management institutions charged with various water management functions may be necessary to effect reform on several fronts to attract the private sector to the anticipated cm irrigation schemes institutions must create an environment conducive to public private partnerships and community based investment engaging the private sector in cost recovery particularly in operation and maintenance may be difficult however institutions can develop an appropriate model through a few pilot projects in various contexts to ensure more return with less expenditure of public funds to achieve gender equitable and socially inclusive water resource management and use the institution should also support policy and institutional capacity development at the local level they can then work to improve energy and water use while also advocating for a reliable power supply in the command areas to support cm this can be done by encouraging solar irrigation programs in areas where grid connection has not yet been reached or there is an unreliable power supply 5 2 2 strengthen data assets prioritizing investments will help improve the monitoring of both surface and ground water resources the initial strategic interventions needed to achieve the intended cm project are appropriate monitoring both quantity and quality and use as well as building related mechanisms systems for database maintenance analysis and dissemination access a geographic database containing numerous factors including cropping patterns evapotranspiration water demands groundwater levels canal alignments and groundwater abstraction may be included in the routine monitoring in the end the monitoring will help determine which investments should be prioritized for hardware system modernization and improved infrastructure software improved database planning and management capabilities and institutional reforms in addition it will offer insights into designing interventions to increase water use efficiency through various paths such as crop diversity to control water demand to reduce irrigation system losses and encourage micro irrigation systems where suitable in addition initiatives for improving recharge and spring source protection must be designed and implemented to support cm 5 2 3 research awareness and capacity strengthening investments in research for development initiatives are advised to prioritize cm interventions according to the available data with changes in levels of groundwater usage in space and time and in surface water distribution this also incorporates integrated numerical modelling of irrigation canal flows groundwater use and aquifer response and soil water status several models have been proposed and used to maximize the benefits of water use e g paudyal and gupta 1990 onta et al 1991 however an integrated modelling approach such as that proposed by foster et al 2010 would be more suitable as it simultaneously integrates groundwater flow processes runoff canal inflows crop water requirements and crop yield as sustainable development and water resource management involve awareness of biophysical and socio institutional components research on the social and institutional aspects of cm and its translation into development are equally vital ultimately this would increase cm efficiency sustainability and gender equitable and socially inclusive access to and use of water resources in addition long term assistance for the agricultural economy can come from research on sustainable agriculture water use efficiency soil erosion control water quality quantity restoration and environmental risk assessment furthermore a major problem that needs to be solved through suitable study is how to translate legislative provisions on cm into actual practices and activities it is advised to conduct a thorough investigation into the terai aquifer a portion of the gangetic plain with a focus on integrated modelling of the whole surface and groundwater system including the chure region and evaluate the effects of various types of interventions on terai s groundwater system in the case of hills studies targeting defining recharge regions and evaluating the efficacy of various types of interventions in these recharge areas in recharge source area protection would be a good method to ensure groundwater supply for sustaining cm evidence for these interventions must be derived from monitoring data and subsequent analysis finally evidence based communication materials must be created to launch a long term campaign for raising awareness of effective water use conservation of available water sources and education focusing on various risks and costs associated with water mismanagement as well as the advantages of cm and methods for its planning and implementation 6 conclusions and recommendations access to irrigation is considered a primary constraint for optimal and stable crop yield and therefore a threat to food security in nepal the cm of surface and ground water can be considered an adaptation strategy however an integrated framework for assessing the prospects for cm and its implementation is lacking in the literature in this context this study developed a five component and 17 indicator framework for cm through literature review stakeholder consultation and expert interviews as elaborated in section 2 this was then applied to synthesize the overall prospects of cm in nepal s western terai first by providing the context of the region s importance in national food security section 3 and then discussing the status of each indicator section 4 finally potential strategies for realizing these prospects were highlighted along with their implementation challenges section 5 key conclusions are highlighted below water resource availability is relatively abundant the understanding of surfacewater availability and its spatio temporal distribution is good for example with surfacewater information is available for nine basins sub basins in the area albeit with varying levels of detail on essential hydrological features such as catchment area amount of water and water balance components specific discharge varies from 18 8 l s m2 upper karnali to 52 1 l s m2 mohana across the river systems however an integrated framework that looks at the overall water availability holistically across the entire region an adequate monitoring framework for both surface and ground water resources and prospects for augmenting water availability and developing water resources is lacking an integrated modelling of the entire hydrological system and its regular updating is crucial because adequate and integrated cm and water resources planning will not be achievable without tools processes and data that drive scenario development to support policy prioritizing and decision making despite availability access and productivity of water resources is low for various reasons such as lack of focus on estimating and monitoring water availability and use inadequate efforts to understand water use practices and preferences and low prioritization of systematic and continuous efforts towards enhancing water productivity energy is a key input for enhancing access to water in the context of western terai given the flat nature of terrain its access is relatively good with availability of different sources of energy however cost and affordability is an issue in some instances particularly for smallholder farmers water governance landscape capacity and awareness are key to creating an enabling environment for promoting cm in an area of interest overall assessment of the water governance landscape reveals that the policy landscape is conducive for promoting cm in the southern plain region of western nepal however emphasis on translating the policy into an action plan setting up an appropriate institutional framework internalizing the importance of social and equity aspects of cm and raising awareness of ensuring environmental health while optimizing agricultural productivity still need a significant attention one reason for this could be the lack of literature on cm and of demonstration projects in nepal in addition awareness capacity gaps basically re orienting already competent human resources towards cm focused concentrated investments and regular engagement with stakeholders to understand their concerns and share learnings are equally important aspects for achieving the goal of cm in the context of the study region however these are yet to be prioritized adequate prospects exist for cm to enable year round irrigation in the ftf zoi districts the terai due to the co existence of surface water and groundwater underutilization of groundwater resources and unreliable or insufficient water supply from surface water systems which draw water from rain fed and spring fed rivers although challenges and impediments exist on various fronts three strategies are recommended to translate the prospects for cm into implementation 1 re aligning institutional mechanisms in such a way that both surface and ground water are dealt with together by a single unit entity 2 strengthening data assets through regular monitoring and

8937,the choice of irrigation water sources is crucial in rice farming as water availability and cost can vary across water sources groundwater caters three quarters of the total irrigated land in bangladesh where rice area alone occupies 80 of the total irrigated land the present study compares productivity and efﬁciency differences and determinants of surface and groundwater irrigation users based on a sample of 6947 dry winter rice growing plots from the nationally representative bangladesh integrated household survey 2018 database a range of methods was adopted to correct for heterogeneity in irrigation water source choice decision self selection and observable biases this involved an estimation of a stochastic production frontier spf model with the pooled sample first then an application of propensity score matching psm to remove self selection and observable biases then a test of heterogeneity in irrigation source choices was conducted and finally estimated two spf separately for matched samples of groundwater and surface water irrigation users results revealed a robust effect of groundwater irrigation in enhancing rice productivity and efficiency seed and its quality fertilizer and soil type are also significant drivers of rice productivity the significant drivers of efficiency are plot ownership irrigation frequency subsidy and family size large farms with groundwater irrigated plots are relatively more efficient significantly lower efficiency exists in areas vulnerable to drought these results raise sustainability concerns owing to the high level of groundwater extraction and falling water table policymakers need to devise innovative strategies to increase use of surface water irrigation without sacrificing productivity and efficiency which has been a priority policy drive in bangladesh keywords irrigation rice production technical efficiency propensity score matching stochastic production frontier self selection bias data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many developing countries including bangladesh have followed the cereal based green revolution gr technology path since 1960 s and were successful in coping with food population imbalance khush 2001 but despite gr s significant impact on food production and socio economic development in developing economies a notable portion of the global population still lives with hunger and nutritional insecurity pingali 2012 moreover there are rising environmental concerns regarding biodiversity loss greenhouse gas emissions and reduced availability of fertile soils and clean water amidst widespread adoption of gr technologies in food production across the globe foley et al 2005 tyagi 2016 during the last four decades there have been reduced returns from different inputs which was singh 2000 termed as a high input use and decelerating productivity growth phase for indian agriculture in the future more challenges are anticipated as the global food demand in 2050 will double compared to that of 2010 godfray et al 2010 this increased demand will be accompanied by increasing competition for land water and energy as both population and size of the economies are growing oecd 2012 the existing groundwater based irrigation system raises severe sustainability concern since demand for water beyond agriculture will also rise substantially csiro 2014 meanwhile the impacts of climate change have reached critical tipping points masson delmotte et al 2021 along with an accelerating concern about the loss of global biodiversity due to exploitation pollution and habitat destruction from the conversion of unmanaged land for food production oecd 2012 hence increasing productivity of finite resources such as land and water through the adoption of productivity enhancing technologies are important to address future challenges of food production pingali 2012 along with varietal improvements chemical inputs and modern management practices irrigation was another important component of the gr package groundwater irrigation especially the adoption of shallow tube wells during the dry season has played an undisputed role in the growth of the crop sector csiro 2014 the country s irrigated land increased from 7056 to 7685 thousand hectares from 2011 to 2018 bbs 2021 currently in the country around 93 of the total water demand comes from agriculture of which more than 80 is met from groundwater csiro 2014 wrg 2021 over the years there has been a gradual decline in the surface water irrigation area fig 1 in bangladesh around 1 43 million and 0 32 million irrigation pumps are operated by diesel and electricity respectively and they annually emit around 7 million tons of carbon dioxide islam et al 2017 whereas groundwater overexploitation has led to depletion of groundwater estimated to be in the range of 0 5 to 0 8 km3 year between 2003 and 2007 which accelerated in recent years and is more severe in water stressed regions shamsudduha et al 2012 rahman and mahbub 2012 in the water stressed northern districts the groundwater table in a period of one year 2015 2016 has dropped by 15 fig 2 while the geology of the area is no longer suitable for extensive exploitation of groundwater asad uz zaman and rushton 2006 shahid and hazarika 2010 deeper groundwater extraction increases irrigation costs and ultimately affects the livelihoods of farmers the stress is more for those dependent on groundwater particularly in the absence of appropriate adaptation measures dey et al 2013 it is noteworthy to mention that compared to other countries in the indo gangetic region bangladesh has lower irrigation efficiency and higher irrigation costs wrg 2021 overexploitation changes in land use and cropping patterns upstream river flow and reduction in wetland areas all contribute to groundwater decline rahman et al 2021 thus a substantial concern remains regarding the sustainability of groundwater dependent farming systems given such challenges surface water irrigation is prescribed particularly to counter problems resulting from groundwater overexploitation the bangladesh government has prioritized surface water irrigation and documented this in several policy documents but there has been a concern as to whether surface water availability is sufficient to fulfill the irrigation requirement needed to produce and meet continuously increasing food demand watto and mugera 2015 importantly bangladesh has a skewed distribution of rainfall as well as availability of surface water during the year mukherjee et al 2015 despite this policy thrust surface water in bangladesh supplies only one fourth of the country s total irrigated area fpmu 2021 on the contrary compared to that of 1982 83 the proportion of groundwater irrigated area total area doubled badc 2020 in 2019 20 surface water area was estimated to be 30 05 thousand hectares which is an increase of only 1 76 thousand hectares from its 2018 19 level but effectively a significant reduction from the level observed in 2017 18 fpmu 2021 bangladesh made massive investments in the form of re excavating canals setting up dams and installing pumps for ensuring availability of surface water for irrigation alam 2015 fpmu 2021 however the desired expansion in its coverage for irrigation remains low actual adoption of any particular technology is subject to several factors including farmers socio economic circumstances and technology domain and protection of the environment may not be always a farmer s prime concern particularly since gr technology has motivated and trained farmers to use groundwater for irrigation for decades the trend is quite unlikely to change in the foreseeable future the government is trying to work out a solution by diverting the need for supplementary irrigation from groundwater sources to surface water while ensuring that productivity of crop and total food grain production are not adversely affected and continues to improve instead given these challenges it is necessary to judge the merit of the choice of irrigation water source in rice production by farmers and its impact on productivity and efficiency using an in depth analysis at a large scale e g a nationally representative sample from bangladesh the specific objectives of this study are to a estimate the share of cropped area irrigated by surface and ground water sources at the plot level b determine the range of socio economic factors influencing a farmer s irrigation water source decision c determine the impact of the chosen irrigation water source on crop productivity and d estimate production efficiency of the chosen irrigation source by farmers we chose rice because it is the second most produced and staple crop consumed by approximately 50 of the global population fao 1947 in bangladesh rice is the major staple grown in 80 of the total cultivable land also the boro season dry winter rice which provides the bulk of total foodgrain production of the country is highly dependent on supplementary irrigation which has been met by mainly groundwater sources for decades our work enriches the existing pool of knowledge in multiple ways first we explicitly considered the issue of heterogeneity in irrigation water source choice and subsequently tested its existence second we also accounted for self selection and observable biases arising from the choice of irrigation source so that the net effect of the merit of chosen source i e albeit surface water or groundwater by farmers on crop productivity and efficiency can be confirmed third we used a large number of plot level data which is a more specific source and most suitable to address the stated research objectives with authenticity and validity fourth we have utilized a large number of samples from a nationally representative bangladesh integrated household survey bihs which makes our results not only generalizable for bangladesh but also for a wider range of economies with similar agricultural sectors characterized by widespread use of irrigation methods and socio economic circumstances and fifth we explicitly analyzed both surface and ground water source for irrigation in details which is usually ignored in bangladesh focused literature csiro 2014 rahman et al 2021 2 materials and methods 2 1 the data this study uses international food policy research institute s ifpri bihs 18 19 database which is representative of rural bangladesh as a whole the database contains information on 9143 households belonging to 325 primary sampling units psu from seven administrative divisions of bangladesh which were selected through a two stage stratified sampling procedure using the sampling frame based on the national population census the detailed sampling procedure is available at https www ifpri org publication bangladesh integrated household survey bihs 2018 2019 among the surveyed households 4262 cultivated rice in 16 868 plots during december 2017 to november 2018 we considered only plots growing dry winter rice since the season supplies more than half 53 7 of the country s annual rice production bbs 2021 and groundwater is the dominant water source in the season in other seasons rice farming mainly depends on natural rainfall and only provides supplementary irrigation when rainfall is inadequate among the plots growing dry winter rice 1570 were irrigated by surface water and 5377 were irrigated by groundwater finally after applying the propensity score matching psm technique we could match 1108 households 699 surface water and 409 groundwater who cultivated rice in 3140 plots 1570 surface water and 1570 groundwater for our analysis 2 2 measuring productivity and efficiency of irrigation sources the stochastic frontier analysis following mayen et al 2010 and anang et al 2017 the stochastic production frontier spf function that incorporates both the stochastic and technical inefﬁciency effects in the frontier as functions of observable variables can be expressed as 1 ln q i x i β v i u i where q i is the observed rice yield by the i th plot i 1 2 3 4 5 n x i denotes the inputs vector that applied in the i th plot and β indicate the vector of the parameters to be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle technique the error v i is the statistical noise that is identically and independently distributed i e iid n 0 σ v 2 the non negative and half normally distributed stochastic error term denoted by u i n 0 σ u 2 represents technical inefficiency in production table 1 shows a detailed description of both the production and efficiency explaining variables along with their measurement procedures both the stochastic terms are uncorrelated with each other the proportion of the variance is explained by inefficiency λ i σ ui 2 σ vi 2 battese and coelli 1995 the density function for ε i v i u i ln q i x i β is 2 f i ε i 2 σ i ϕ ε i σ i 1 φ λ i ε i σ i for ε i where ϕ indicates the standard normal density function and φ denotes the standard normal cumulative distribution function the technical efficiency te is calculated by the ratio of observed yield to the corresponding stochastic frontier yield and can be estimated as 3 te i q i exp x i β v i exp x i β v i u i exp x i β v i exp u i where 0 te 1 table 2 briefly presents the analytical techniques followed in the study 2 3 self selection into farmer s decision to choose irrigation source homogenous technology across farms is an assumption required while estimating a production function elias et al 2013 however heterogeneity may exist across farms as some use surface water for irrigation while others do not as has already been mentioned we suspect that the production frontiers between surface and groundwater irrigated farms may vary as there are potential self selection issues into irrigation source choices and the environmental or biophysical conditions apply restrictions on production gebregziabher et al 2012 stated that since biophysical settings affect production by impacting farming decisions it is necessary to consider the differences in surrounding environmental settings between farms otherwise the estimated results might be biased we therefore perform a formal test with the assumption of homogeneous production technology by allowing production technologies to vary between surface and groundwater irrigated plots by including a dummy variable for groundwater irrigation source that interacts with the conventional input vector in the production function elias et al 2013 following ahmed and melesse 2018 we have performed a likelihood ratio lr test and rejected the null hypothesis of farms using homogenous technology for the psm subsamples lr 268 41 χ 2 43 70 df 25 which confirms that the two groups use different technologies and therefore require separate spf models to be estimated for each group some earlier studies used spf approach for comparing differences in te between the participants and non participants of a program or intervention where the endogeneity problem was addressed by following heckman s two step approach however this approach is less applicable when nonlinear models like spf are employed elias et al 2013 following bravo ureta et al 2020 elias et al 2013 and mayen et al 2010 we have employed the propensity score matching psm technique and estimated the technical efﬁciency of groundwater and surface water irrigated plots separately on the matched sample mayen et al 2010 noted that matching models generate experiments that permit for random assignment of the production type groundwater versus surface water irrigation and consequently allow a direct linking between groundwater irrigation and te again the production frontier and parameters of the production function β s differ between the groundwater and surface water irrigated plots due to restrictions on the production process executed by the groundwater irrigated farmers it also comprises the indicator variable for groundwater irrigation that relates to the input vector x i the farmers who use surface water irrigation generate a propensity p i a model based on observable characteristics m i and can be expressed as follows 4 p i m i α δ i where α represents unknown parameters to be estimated and δ i is a random disturbance term when the variables in the selection model m i impact rice productivity and we fail to include them in eq 1 the self selection indicator variable in eq 1 becomes correlated with the error ε i eq 2 consequently our estimated β s become biased as there is endogeneity resulting from the farmer s surface water irrigation decision though it is argued that psm may not be an appropriate technique if unobserved variables affect the outcome variable ahmed and melesse 2018 khonje et al 2015 particularly when the undetected variables may affect surface water choice but are not considered directly mayen et al 2010 we assume that the distributions of such undetected variables are the same between the groups e g mayen et al 2010 furthermore following villano et al 2015 and salam et al 2021 the balancing property was tested to ensure that the samples within the common support area have the same distribution of observable characteristics irrespective of irrigation water sources the average treatment effect on the treated atet is computed by matching 1 1 matching refers to the process of pairing individuals in a treatment group with individuals in a comparison group based on their propensity scores each surface water irrigated plot with the groundwater irrigated plot having closest propensity scores the atet is estimated as 5 atet e q 1 s 1 e q 0 s 0 where s 1 and s 0 are rice yield from groundwater and surface water irrigated plots respectively the dummy variable denoted by s equals to 1 for farmers using groundwater for irrigation and otherwise zero 3 results and discussion 3 1 proportion of plot and area under surface and groundwater irrigation a total of 77 4 of plots occupying 75 77 of total paddy area in the dry winter season were irrigated using groundwater whereas the remaining plots and area were irrigated by surface water table 3 thereby reflecting the dominant role of groundwater as the main irrigation source to produce rice in bangladesh 3 2 summary statistics summary statistics of the variables used in the econometric analysis are presented in table 1 the number of variables with a significant difference between the two groups was reduced after matching samples i e after psm variances in the mentioned variables between groups were reduced compared to the surface water irrigated plots yield in groundwater irrigated plots is 6 7 and 5 4 higher for the unmatched and matched sample respectively in the group of the matched sample the groundwater irrigated plots use 1 62 and 6 09 less labor and seed but pay 26 9 higher fertilizer cost compared to the plots irrigated by surface water number of irrigations applied in groundwater irrigated plots is around 1 5 times higher than that of surface water irrigated plot while the associated cost is almost double in case of groundwater irrigated plots in accordance with the national statistics bbs 2021 more than 70 of farmers own less than 1 hectare of land in case of the unmatched sample relatively higher proportion of plots in the southern region used surface water because of the abundance of open and close water bodies in the region wrg 2021 3 3 finding a proper counterfactual group for groundwater users 3 3 1 econometric analysis for correcting self selection bias first we checked whether there is self selection bias for groundwater irrigation choice for this purpose durbin wu hausman dwh test is conducted to identify whether the dummy for groundwater in equation 7 is endogenous the test is conducted through estimating equation 6 as a linear probability model and rejects the null hypothesis that farmer s groundwater irrigation choice decision is exogenous table 5 3 3 2 determinants of irrigation water source choice decision table 4 shows that among the fourteen explanatory variables used in the probit model twelve have a significant role in explaining farmers irrigation water source choice decision the farmers who experienced drought risk in the dry winter season are less likely to irrigate their plots with surface water than their counterparts who did not face the risk this is because average rainfall is low in the drought affected region especially in winter season which depletes the amount and source of surface water prodhan et al 2020 compared to the northern region plots located in southern region have higher probability to be irrigated with surface water the southern region has more availability of water bodies which increases the probability of using surface water krupnik et al 2017 the bangladesh government has also emphasized shifting to less costly surface water irrigation from highly subsidized and energy intensive groundwater irrigation in southern bangladesh moa and fao 2013 plots with higher flood depth are likely to have nearby water sources and hence are more likely to utilize the available surface water for irrigation members of agricultural cooperatives are more likely to adopt surface water irrigation having nearby surface water sources can motivate farmers to form cooperatives for irrigation while individual sellers dominate the groundwater irrigation market moreover cooperatives are a good source of information about sustainable irrigation and conservative water use ultimately farmers become aware about water usage and feel motivated for sustainable surface water irrigation ghazouani et al 2012 argued that farmers cooperatives can be more effective than the conventionally prescribed water user associations in irrigation and groundwater management the positive coefficient with the variable extension service argues that extension service recipient farmers have higher probability to adopt groundwater irrigation this is coherent with literature arguing importance of extension service in technology dissemination but to some extent contradicts with the literature highlighting importance of extension service for up scaling sustainable agriculture practices please see begho et al 2022 for a recent review on related literature since environmental sustainability in extension policy comes after food security through enhancing productivity an extension agent may prioritize groundwater over surface water since the former ensures higher yield the ownership and access of farmers to types of irrigation machinery is important to explain their choice of irrigation water source farmers who use diesel and manually operated irrigation machines have higher probability to utilize surface water while their counterparts who use electricity operated irrigation machines are more likely to use groundwater since irrigation is a major cost component in bangladesh government provides subsidy on irrigation and the rate is comparatively higher for the electrically powered irrigation machines moa and fao 2013 hence cost as a barrier is more likely to motivate a diesel operated machine owner to explore the available surface water sources moreover around 92 of the deep tube wells which are used to extract groundwater are operated by electricity while around 94 of the small scale irrigation machineries such as low lift pumps mainly used for surface water irrigation are operated by diesel badc 2015 manual irrigation system is used for surface water from nearby sources cost differences across irrigation machineries using different types of fuels is noted as an important factor defining farmers irrigation decisions sharma and sharma 2006 along with price and cost differences literature also noted that transactional issues such as reliability security and fast transfer can affect a farmer s irrigation decisions bjornlund 2003 since in all these aspects an owner will certainly have an upper hand a farmer is more likely to extract groundwater which is depicted by the positive sign with the dummy variable for the machine owner in the indian context some literature argued that the irrigation machineries are mostly owned by the large farmers whereas the small and marginal farmers participate more in the water market to access water for irrigation sharma and sharma 2006 the positive sign associated with the variable wage work argues that farmers participating in wage earning activities are less likely to choose surface water as a source of irrigation over groundwater this contradicts with manjunatha et al 2014 who observed farmers with significant income from non crop activities such as dairy have less interest in farming and ultimately practice less intensive farming using surface water as the cost is relatively lower wage earning activities are stressful laborious and uncertain and less gainful it is quite possible for a farmer to use earnings from wage working activities to ease financial constraints of farming 3 3 3 propensity score matching for finding the proper counterfactual group to develop a counterfactual group for the farmers using groundwater irrigation we utilize the probit estimates and produce a propensity score ps for each plot based on the common support region afterward we match each plot using surface water irrigation with a plot using groundwater irrigation with the closest ps the density distribution of the ps for both surface and groundwater irrigated plots both with and without a common support area is presented in fig 3 furthermore to check the reliability of the matching quality of the data we have conducted multiple tests to ensure that our data satisfies the balancing requirements of the psm the kernel density matching balancing test 2 2 the test is a statistical technique used in observational studies to assess the balance of covariates between treatment groups this test is typically used to evaluate the effectiveness of propensity score matching a commonly used method to control for confounding variables in observational studies shows that both surface water and groundwater irrigation adopters have identical characteristics after matching as opposed to the unmatched sample fig 4 the standardized differences bias for the mean values of almost all covariates between surface water and groundwater irrigation are less than 10 this reconfirms that the balancing requirement is ensured and there are significant overlaps in their propensity score distributions of the two groups 3 4 spf analysis to explain productivity and efficiency differences in rice production 3 4 1 hypothesis testing and variance parameters for the spf model the results of several hypothesis tests that were necessary to establish that the chosen model is suitable to explain the impact of irrigation water source choice on farming are presented in table 5 we begin with the log likelihood ratio lr test which conﬁrms that the selection of the translog functional form to be more suitable than the cobb douglas one many past studies also claimed that the flexible translog production function is a better fit for describing the production system for both bangladesh e g rahman 2003 alam et al 2011 and global agriculture e g bravo ureta et al 2020 second is the test of third moment m 3 t m 3 6 m 2 3 n where m 2 and m 3 are the 2nd and 3rd sample moments of the ols residuals respectively which checks the null hypothesis that there is no skewness of the ols residual schmidt and lin 1984 the estimated test statistic for both models is negative and confirms the rejection of the null hypothesis of the presence of inefficiency effects rejection of the third hypothesis h 0 δ 1 δ 2 δ 15 0 argues that the combined eﬀects of factors involved in the technical ineﬃciency model are critical for understanding the production variations rejection of the fourth hypothesis h 0 δ 0 δ 1 δ 15 0 argues in favor of incorporating the exogenous variables into the mean output function the estimated coefficient of γ is close to 1 and significantly different from zero table 6 confirming high level of inefficiency is present in the production process 3 4 2 explaining productivity differences in rice production table 6 presents the results of the spf function for the matched sample labor fertilizer and irrigation significantly enhance yield in the groundwater irrigated plots while yield in a surface water irrigated plot increases significantly when farmers apply more fertilizer irrigation and seed the estimated elasticity of labor fertilizer and irrigation in the model for groundwater irrigation implies that a 1 increase in labor fertilizer and irrigation will contribute to rice yield by 0 062 0 039 and 0 059 respectively in surface water irrigated plots a 1 increase in fertilizer irrigation and seed will increase rice yield by around 0 069 0 070 and 0 037 respectively the estimates of relatively smaller elasticities for all the input variables for both the groups are coherent with the literature arguing that in the context of land constrained countries like bangladesh land has a higher elasticity almost close to unity compared to other inputs rahman 2003 asadullah and rahman 2009 selim 2012 the hybrid rice growers irrespective of the choice of irrigation sources obtained significantly higher yields than their counterparts cultivating hyv varieties in the model for surface water irrigation soil type dummy variables have a more dominant role in explaining yield differences than in the model for groundwater irrigation in surface water irrigated plots yield is significantly higher in plots with loam soil than that of sandy loam soil in surface water irrigated plots with sandy loam soil the yield is significantly lower compared to plots with clay soil but significantly higher than plots with sandy and clay loam soil 3 4 3 determinants of inefficiency in the production process around 73 and 87 of the inefficiency explaining variables have significant effects in the models for surface water and groundwater respectively in both models dummies for farm size plot ownership irrigation frequency family size drought risk and location of the plot have significant roles in explaining efficiency in rice production though the direction of effects varies across the models additionally variables such as age extension service and subsidy card play a significant role in the groundwater irrigation model while education plays a significant role in the surface water irrigation model farm size is important in explaining technical efficiency differences in rice production for both groups compared to farmers with smaller land holdings the large farmers are more efficient in plots using groundwater which is consistent with literature stating large farmers capabilities to derive economies of scale and use agricultural innovations ram et al 1999 alam et al 2011 in contrast pioneered by the influential thoughts of balogh and schultz 1964 many authors observed small farmers are able to use available resources at the optimal level and attain higher productivity carter 1984 chand et al 2011 all these may explain the negative correlation between farm area and efficiency in the model for surface water irrigation where the landless marginal small and medium farmers attained higher efficiency level than the large farmers the estimated higher efficiency for owned plots than rented plots is in line with earlier literature reporting relatively less fertile or low quality of land that landowners generally prefer to rent out to tenants rahman 2003 anik and bauer 2015 in accordance with literature narrating the productivity and efficiency improving role of education in bangladesh asadullah and rahman 2009 we observe that the education variable has a positive coefficient in the model for surface water irrigation having a larger family positively influences the inefficiency of surface water irrigators while the opposite is true for farmers using groundwater for irrigation with increasing head of household age we find farms gain efficiency in plots using groundwater consistent with wilson et al 2001 who reported a positive correlation between experience and efficiency literature also reports older farmers reluctance to change their years old practices while younger farmers are usually keen to explore beyond farming ainembabazi and mugisha 2014 nyangena 2008 subsidy card owners in groundwater irrigated plots operate with a higher level of efficiency than their counterparts who do not have subsidy cards our findings support kumbhakar and lien 2010 who argued that as subsidy reduces the utility of time the farmer might spend more time in farming operations however the authors cautioned about drawing firm conclusions regarding this issue as some researchers observed that this may also demotivate farmers to work efficiently karagiannis and sarris 2005 additionally subsidy may enable farmers to purchase inputs required for maximizing production or profit by reducing their budget constraints irrigation frequency is significantly and inversely associated with technical inefficiency of both surface water and groundwater irrigated plots farmers applying more numbers of irrigation are likely to maintain the water required at different stages of rice production along with increased yield and irrigation efficiency literature reports many other benefits of irrigation rescheduling including reduced irrigation cost and the opportunity cost of water and less chances of crop failure and run off of chemical fertilizers adeniran et al 2010 contradicting our general expectation extension service is inversely correlated with efficiency in the model for groundwater irrigation and is likely to be an outcome of inefficiency in the extension service which is mentioned in several instances in the literature however it is important to mention the institutional constraints that conventional extension services face regarding the limited budget manpower and workload however one should carefully draw any firm conclusion regarding this issue the variable off farm income has a negative sign in both models implying that increasing off farm income reduces inefficiency farmers particularly those with limited land holdings can use income from off farm sources to compensate for their scale disadvantages fernandez cornejo et al 2010 the role of off farm income in overcoming credit constraints barrett et al 2001 and enabling farmers purchasing productivity enhancing inputs mishra et al 2015 is well documented in the literature the positive sign associated with the dummy for the northern region indicates that both the surface water and groundwater irrigated plots located in the southern region are more efficient than those in the northern region drought is prominent in the northern part of the country which results in water and nutrient depletion in the soil prodhan et al 2020 the declining trend in groundwater level caused by groundwater irrigation and other purposes is a major concern for farming in the north western region alauddin and sharma 2013 dey et al 2017 rahman et al 2021 for the same reason plots in the drought prone region are significantly less efficient in both models 3 4 4 technical efficiency in dry winter season rice production by irrigation water sources the descriptive statistics of the computed te scores for the surface and groundwater irrigated rice plots are presented in table 7 the mean efficiency scores for the surface and groundwater irrigated plots are 71 5 and 76 4 respectively and are equivalent to many past studies conducted with bangladeshi rice growers e g rahman 2003 asadullah and rahman 2009 selim 2012 the computed mean te scores indicate that controlling technical inefficiency related factors may increase yield by around 39 5 100 71 5 71 5 and 30 9 100 76 4 76 4 in surface and groundwater irrigated plots respectively in accordance with earlier studies on rice farming in bangladesh the computed te scores show a wide range of variation rahman 2003 rahman and rahman 2009 a relatively higher te score and lower variation for the groundwater irrigated plots is not surprising since groundwater reduces risks and uncertainty related to the availability of water furthermore the kernel density of the estimated te scores shows that the density of plots with higher te is relatively higher among the groundwater irrigated plots fig 3 fig 5 3 4 5 impact of irrigation water source on yield the results of the estimated atet presented in table 8 support the existence of a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the yields of surface and groundwater irrigated plots all the signs of the atets in different matching approaches are positive and significant indicating that yield in surface water irrigated plots is significantly lower than those irrigated by groundwater 4 conclusions the purpose of this study was to investigate productivity and efficiency of surface and groundwater irrigated dry winter rice growing plots in bangladesh the spf model was applied to the nationally representative bihs 2018 19 dataset which contains information from 6947 dry winter rice growing plots after correcting for heterogeneity arising from irrigation water source choice decisions and biases arising from self selection and observable factors rice production is dominated by groundwater irrigation accounting for three fourths of irrigated plots and rice areas farmers experiencing drought risk are less likely to choose surface water for irrigation choice of surface water irrigation is positively associated with farm size family size plots with higher flood depth membership in cooperative societies and users of diesel and manually operated irrigation machines on the other hand ownership of irrigation machines working as wage labor and contact with extension services are positively associated with the likelihood of choosing groundwater farmers in the southern region are more likely to choose surface water for irrigation groundwater irrigated plots attained significantly higher yield and efficiency than surface water irrigated plots since yield and efficiency differences are lucrative incentives for farmers to adopt groundwater irrigation there are implications for sustainability and the national budget moreover several policy documents e g national water policy national agricultural policy integrated minor irrigation policy national agriculture extension policy national water management plan development strategy and bangladesh water act emphasize increasing surface water irrigation coverage which seems difficult to achieve given these results our results reveal the presence of significant inefficiency in the rice production system of bangladesh the estimated spf models show robust effects of irrigation seed and its quality fertilizer and soil type on rice production the major factors explaining inefficiency are farm size land ownership irrigation frequency off farm income education extension and subsidy several policy options can be proposed from this research however these are not straightforward as there is a dilemma between enhancing rice productivity and efficiency achieved mainly through groundwater irrigation while tackling the falling water table in many areas of bangladesh first since dry winter rice farming requires substantial supplementary irrigation primarily from groundwater policymakers must devise innovative strategies to encourage surface water irrigation which is less productive and efficient at present rebalancing subsidies toward surface water irrigation may be an effective strategy since we observed a negative correlation between subsidy and efficiency second information on surface water irrigation should be provided to the farmers through cooperatives and extension services while acknowledging the efficiency reducing role of extension which in turn requires redressing the existing extension system in the country third farmers in the drought prone northern region require special attention since they operate at a lower efficiency level irrespective of the irrigation water source fourth lower efficiency in rented in plots would require long term rental arrangements so that farmers have incentives to invest in efficiency enhancement measures the security of tenure will incentivize farmers to adopt yield enhancing measures e g better soil fertility management options other production enhancing inputs etc we did not outright provide support for further investment in groundwater irrigation infrastructure although the evidence presented a robust positive effect of groundwater irrigation on rice yield and efficiency this is mainly due to the sustainability concern regarding the falling groundwater table resulting from the high level of groundwater extraction for agriculture and other domestic and industrial uses we realize that it is unconventional not to suggest policies that were dominant in the results i e to vigorously promote groundwater irrigation sources further however if we address the other structural causes identified in the results outlined above bangladesh may be able to tip the balance of irrigation for rice production from groundwater to surface water sources without sacrificing production the present study is based on a nationally representative plot level cross sectional data which can provide in depth information about the existing scenario at a point in time farmers choices of irrigation sources may change over time based on changes in socioeconomic conditions and or knowledge of declining water table levels this will require using panel data from similar nationally representative surveys to track such changes results obtained from this study and policy implications drawn thereof can be generalized for other regions depicting similar rice production and farming practices socio economic circumstances of farmers incidences of falling water tables overexploitation of groundwater as well as declining availability of surface water for irrigation this is because we have used a quantitative approach to a large set of nationally representative plot level data which provided insight into the underlying structural relationships of the regressors used in the econometric model which was largely independent of the study location and or data collection period therefore we are confident that our results and derived policy implications have wider appeal for policymakers and relevant stakeholders concerned with options and or mechanisms to address similar challenges in other regions and areas beyond our study location declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8937,the choice of irrigation water sources is crucial in rice farming as water availability and cost can vary across water sources groundwater caters three quarters of the total irrigated land in bangladesh where rice area alone occupies 80 of the total irrigated land the present study compares productivity and efﬁciency differences and determinants of surface and groundwater irrigation users based on a sample of 6947 dry winter rice growing plots from the nationally representative bangladesh integrated household survey 2018 database a range of methods was adopted to correct for heterogeneity in irrigation water source choice decision self selection and observable biases this involved an estimation of a stochastic production frontier spf model with the pooled sample first then an application of propensity score matching psm to remove self selection and observable biases then a test of heterogeneity in irrigation source choices was conducted and finally estimated two spf separately for matched samples of groundwater and surface water irrigation users results revealed a robust effect of groundwater irrigation in enhancing rice productivity and efficiency seed and its quality fertilizer and soil type are also significant drivers of rice productivity the significant drivers of efficiency are plot ownership irrigation frequency subsidy and family size large farms with groundwater irrigated plots are relatively more efficient significantly lower efficiency exists in areas vulnerable to drought these results raise sustainability concerns owing to the high level of groundwater extraction and falling water table policymakers need to devise innovative strategies to increase use of surface water irrigation without sacrificing productivity and efficiency which has been a priority policy drive in bangladesh keywords irrigation rice production technical efficiency propensity score matching stochastic production frontier self selection bias data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many developing countries including bangladesh have followed the cereal based green revolution gr technology path since 1960 s and were successful in coping with food population imbalance khush 2001 but despite gr s significant impact on food production and socio economic development in developing economies a notable portion of the global population still lives with hunger and nutritional insecurity pingali 2012 moreover there are rising environmental concerns regarding biodiversity loss greenhouse gas emissions and reduced availability of fertile soils and clean water amidst widespread adoption of gr technologies in food production across the globe foley et al 2005 tyagi 2016 during the last four decades there have been reduced returns from different inputs which was singh 2000 termed as a high input use and decelerating productivity growth phase for indian agriculture in the future more challenges are anticipated as the global food demand in 2050 will double compared to that of 2010 godfray et al 2010 this increased demand will be accompanied by increasing competition for land water and energy as both population and size of the economies are growing oecd 2012 the existing groundwater based irrigation system raises severe sustainability concern since demand for water beyond agriculture will also rise substantially csiro 2014 meanwhile the impacts of climate change have reached critical tipping points masson delmotte et al 2021 along with an accelerating concern about the loss of global biodiversity due to exploitation pollution and habitat destruction from the conversion of unmanaged land for food production oecd 2012 hence increasing productivity of finite resources such as land and water through the adoption of productivity enhancing technologies are important to address future challenges of food production pingali 2012 along with varietal improvements chemical inputs and modern management practices irrigation was another important component of the gr package groundwater irrigation especially the adoption of shallow tube wells during the dry season has played an undisputed role in the growth of the crop sector csiro 2014 the country s irrigated land increased from 7056 to 7685 thousand hectares from 2011 to 2018 bbs 2021 currently in the country around 93 of the total water demand comes from agriculture of which more than 80 is met from groundwater csiro 2014 wrg 2021 over the years there has been a gradual decline in the surface water irrigation area fig 1 in bangladesh around 1 43 million and 0 32 million irrigation pumps are operated by diesel and electricity respectively and they annually emit around 7 million tons of carbon dioxide islam et al 2017 whereas groundwater overexploitation has led to depletion of groundwater estimated to be in the range of 0 5 to 0 8 km3 year between 2003 and 2007 which accelerated in recent years and is more severe in water stressed regions shamsudduha et al 2012 rahman and mahbub 2012 in the water stressed northern districts the groundwater table in a period of one year 2015 2016 has dropped by 15 fig 2 while the geology of the area is no longer suitable for extensive exploitation of groundwater asad uz zaman and rushton 2006 shahid and hazarika 2010 deeper groundwater extraction increases irrigation costs and ultimately affects the livelihoods of farmers the stress is more for those dependent on groundwater particularly in the absence of appropriate adaptation measures dey et al 2013 it is noteworthy to mention that compared to other countries in the indo gangetic region bangladesh has lower irrigation efficiency and higher irrigation costs wrg 2021 overexploitation changes in land use and cropping patterns upstream river flow and reduction in wetland areas all contribute to groundwater decline rahman et al 2021 thus a substantial concern remains regarding the sustainability of groundwater dependent farming systems given such challenges surface water irrigation is prescribed particularly to counter problems resulting from groundwater overexploitation the bangladesh government has prioritized surface water irrigation and documented this in several policy documents but there has been a concern as to whether surface water availability is sufficient to fulfill the irrigation requirement needed to produce and meet continuously increasing food demand watto and mugera 2015 importantly bangladesh has a skewed distribution of rainfall as well as availability of surface water during the year mukherjee et al 2015 despite this policy thrust surface water in bangladesh supplies only one fourth of the country s total irrigated area fpmu 2021 on the contrary compared to that of 1982 83 the proportion of groundwater irrigated area total area doubled badc 2020 in 2019 20 surface water area was estimated to be 30 05 thousand hectares which is an increase of only 1 76 thousand hectares from its 2018 19 level but effectively a significant reduction from the level observed in 2017 18 fpmu 2021 bangladesh made massive investments in the form of re excavating canals setting up dams and installing pumps for ensuring availability of surface water for irrigation alam 2015 fpmu 2021 however the desired expansion in its coverage for irrigation remains low actual adoption of any particular technology is subject to several factors including farmers socio economic circumstances and technology domain and protection of the environment may not be always a farmer s prime concern particularly since gr technology has motivated and trained farmers to use groundwater for irrigation for decades the trend is quite unlikely to change in the foreseeable future the government is trying to work out a solution by diverting the need for supplementary irrigation from groundwater sources to surface water while ensuring that productivity of crop and total food grain production are not adversely affected and continues to improve instead given these challenges it is necessary to judge the merit of the choice of irrigation water source in rice production by farmers and its impact on productivity and efficiency using an in depth analysis at a large scale e g a nationally representative sample from bangladesh the specific objectives of this study are to a estimate the share of cropped area irrigated by surface and ground water sources at the plot level b determine the range of socio economic factors influencing a farmer s irrigation water source decision c determine the impact of the chosen irrigation water source on crop productivity and d estimate production efficiency of the chosen irrigation source by farmers we chose rice because it is the second most produced and staple crop consumed by approximately 50 of the global population fao 1947 in bangladesh rice is the major staple grown in 80 of the total cultivable land also the boro season dry winter rice which provides the bulk of total foodgrain production of the country is highly dependent on supplementary irrigation which has been met by mainly groundwater sources for decades our work enriches the existing pool of knowledge in multiple ways first we explicitly considered the issue of heterogeneity in irrigation water source choice and subsequently tested its existence second we also accounted for self selection and observable biases arising from the choice of irrigation source so that the net effect of the merit of chosen source i e albeit surface water or groundwater by farmers on crop productivity and efficiency can be confirmed third we used a large number of plot level data which is a more specific source and most suitable to address the stated research objectives with authenticity and validity fourth we have utilized a large number of samples from a nationally representative bangladesh integrated household survey bihs which makes our results not only generalizable for bangladesh but also for a wider range of economies with similar agricultural sectors characterized by widespread use of irrigation methods and socio economic circumstances and fifth we explicitly analyzed both surface and ground water source for irrigation in details which is usually ignored in bangladesh focused literature csiro 2014 rahman et al 2021 2 materials and methods 2 1 the data this study uses international food policy research institute s ifpri bihs 18 19 database which is representative of rural bangladesh as a whole the database contains information on 9143 households belonging to 325 primary sampling units psu from seven administrative divisions of bangladesh which were selected through a two stage stratified sampling procedure using the sampling frame based on the national population census the detailed sampling procedure is available at https www ifpri org publication bangladesh integrated household survey bihs 2018 2019 among the surveyed households 4262 cultivated rice in 16 868 plots during december 2017 to november 2018 we considered only plots growing dry winter rice since the season supplies more than half 53 7 of the country s annual rice production bbs 2021 and groundwater is the dominant water source in the season in other seasons rice farming mainly depends on natural rainfall and only provides supplementary irrigation when rainfall is inadequate among the plots growing dry winter rice 1570 were irrigated by surface water and 5377 were irrigated by groundwater finally after applying the propensity score matching psm technique we could match 1108 households 699 surface water and 409 groundwater who cultivated rice in 3140 plots 1570 surface water and 1570 groundwater for our analysis 2 2 measuring productivity and efficiency of irrigation sources the stochastic frontier analysis following mayen et al 2010 and anang et al 2017 the stochastic production frontier spf function that incorporates both the stochastic and technical inefﬁciency effects in the frontier as functions of observable variables can be expressed as 1 ln q i x i β v i u i where q i is the observed rice yield by the i th plot i 1 2 3 4 5 n x i denotes the inputs vector that applied in the i th plot and β indicate the vector of the parameters to be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle technique the error v i is the statistical noise that is identically and independently distributed i e iid n 0 σ v 2 the non negative and half normally distributed stochastic error term denoted by u i n 0 σ u 2 represents technical inefficiency in production table 1 shows a detailed description of both the production and efficiency explaining variables along with their measurement procedures both the stochastic terms are uncorrelated with each other the proportion of the variance is explained by inefficiency λ i σ ui 2 σ vi 2 battese and coelli 1995 the density function for ε i v i u i ln q i x i β is 2 f i ε i 2 σ i ϕ ε i σ i 1 φ λ i ε i σ i for ε i where ϕ indicates the standard normal density function and φ denotes the standard normal cumulative distribution function the technical efficiency te is calculated by the ratio of observed yield to the corresponding stochastic frontier yield and can be estimated as 3 te i q i exp x i β v i exp x i β v i u i exp x i β v i exp u i where 0 te 1 table 2 briefly presents the analytical techniques followed in the study 2 3 self selection into farmer s decision to choose irrigation source homogenous technology across farms is an assumption required while estimating a production function elias et al 2013 however heterogeneity may exist across farms as some use surface water for irrigation while others do not as has already been mentioned we suspect that the production frontiers between surface and groundwater irrigated farms may vary as there are potential self selection issues into irrigation source choices and the environmental or biophysical conditions apply restrictions on production gebregziabher et al 2012 stated that since biophysical settings affect production by impacting farming decisions it is necessary to consider the differences in surrounding environmental settings between farms otherwise the estimated results might be biased we therefore perform a formal test with the assumption of homogeneous production technology by allowing production technologies to vary between surface and groundwater irrigated plots by including a dummy variable for groundwater irrigation source that interacts with the conventional input vector in the production function elias et al 2013 following ahmed and melesse 2018 we have performed a likelihood ratio lr test and rejected the null hypothesis of farms using homogenous technology for the psm subsamples lr 268 41 χ 2 43 70 df 25 which confirms that the two groups use different technologies and therefore require separate spf models to be estimated for each group some earlier studies used spf approach for comparing differences in te between the participants and non participants of a program or intervention where the endogeneity problem was addressed by following heckman s two step approach however this approach is less applicable when nonlinear models like spf are employed elias et al 2013 following bravo ureta et al 2020 elias et al 2013 and mayen et al 2010 we have employed the propensity score matching psm technique and estimated the technical efﬁciency of groundwater and surface water irrigated plots separately on the matched sample mayen et al 2010 noted that matching models generate experiments that permit for random assignment of the production type groundwater versus surface water irrigation and consequently allow a direct linking between groundwater irrigation and te again the production frontier and parameters of the production function β s differ between the groundwater and surface water irrigated plots due to restrictions on the production process executed by the groundwater irrigated farmers it also comprises the indicator variable for groundwater irrigation that relates to the input vector x i the farmers who use surface water irrigation generate a propensity p i a model based on observable characteristics m i and can be expressed as follows 4 p i m i α δ i where α represents unknown parameters to be estimated and δ i is a random disturbance term when the variables in the selection model m i impact rice productivity and we fail to include them in eq 1 the self selection indicator variable in eq 1 becomes correlated with the error ε i eq 2 consequently our estimated β s become biased as there is endogeneity resulting from the farmer s surface water irrigation decision though it is argued that psm may not be an appropriate technique if unobserved variables affect the outcome variable ahmed and melesse 2018 khonje et al 2015 particularly when the undetected variables may affect surface water choice but are not considered directly mayen et al 2010 we assume that the distributions of such undetected variables are the same between the groups e g mayen et al 2010 furthermore following villano et al 2015 and salam et al 2021 the balancing property was tested to ensure that the samples within the common support area have the same distribution of observable characteristics irrespective of irrigation water sources the average treatment effect on the treated atet is computed by matching 1 1 matching refers to the process of pairing individuals in a treatment group with individuals in a comparison group based on their propensity scores each surface water irrigated plot with the groundwater irrigated plot having closest propensity scores the atet is estimated as 5 atet e q 1 s 1 e q 0 s 0 where s 1 and s 0 are rice yield from groundwater and surface water irrigated plots respectively the dummy variable denoted by s equals to 1 for farmers using groundwater for irrigation and otherwise zero 3 results and discussion 3 1 proportion of plot and area under surface and groundwater irrigation a total of 77 4 of plots occupying 75 77 of total paddy area in the dry winter season were irrigated using groundwater whereas the remaining plots and area were irrigated by surface water table 3 thereby reflecting the dominant role of groundwater as the main irrigation source to produce rice in bangladesh 3 2 summary statistics summary statistics of the variables used in the econometric analysis are presented in table 1 the number of variables with a significant difference between the two groups was reduced after matching samples i e after psm variances in the mentioned variables between groups were reduced compared to the surface water irrigated plots yield in groundwater irrigated plots is 6 7 and 5 4 higher for the unmatched and matched sample respectively in the group of the matched sample the groundwater irrigated plots use 1 62 and 6 09 less labor and seed but pay 26 9 higher fertilizer cost compared to the plots irrigated by surface water number of irrigations applied in groundwater irrigated plots is around 1 5 times higher than that of surface water irrigated plot while the associated cost is almost double in case of groundwater irrigated plots in accordance with the national statistics bbs 2021 more than 70 of farmers own less than 1 hectare of land in case of the unmatched sample relatively higher proportion of plots in the southern region used surface water because of the abundance of open and close water bodies in the region wrg 2021 3 3 finding a proper counterfactual group for groundwater users 3 3 1 econometric analysis for correcting self selection bias first we checked whether there is self selection bias for groundwater irrigation choice for this purpose durbin wu hausman dwh test is conducted to identify whether the dummy for groundwater in equation 7 is endogenous the test is conducted through estimating equation 6 as a linear probability model and rejects the null hypothesis that farmer s groundwater irrigation choice decision is exogenous table 5 3 3 2 determinants of irrigation water source choice decision table 4 shows that among the fourteen explanatory variables used in the probit model twelve have a significant role in explaining farmers irrigation water source choice decision the farmers who experienced drought risk in the dry winter season are less likely to irrigate their plots with surface water than their counterparts who did not face the risk this is because average rainfall is low in the drought affected region especially in winter season which depletes the amount and source of surface water prodhan et al 2020 compared to the northern region plots located in southern region have higher probability to be irrigated with surface water the southern region has more availability of water bodies which increases the probability of using surface water krupnik et al 2017 the bangladesh government has also emphasized shifting to less costly surface water irrigation from highly subsidized and energy intensive groundwater irrigation in southern bangladesh moa and fao 2013 plots with higher flood depth are likely to have nearby water sources and hence are more likely to utilize the available surface water for irrigation members of agricultural cooperatives are more likely to adopt surface water irrigation having nearby surface water sources can motivate farmers to form cooperatives for irrigation while individual sellers dominate the groundwater irrigation market moreover cooperatives are a good source of information about sustainable irrigation and conservative water use ultimately farmers become aware about water usage and feel motivated for sustainable surface water irrigation ghazouani et al 2012 argued that farmers cooperatives can be more effective than the conventionally prescribed water user associations in irrigation and groundwater management the positive coefficient with the variable extension service argues that extension service recipient farmers have higher probability to adopt groundwater irrigation this is coherent with literature arguing importance of extension service in technology dissemination but to some extent contradicts with the literature highlighting importance of extension service for up scaling sustainable agriculture practices please see begho et al 2022 for a recent review on related literature since environmental sustainability in extension policy comes after food security through enhancing productivity an extension agent may prioritize groundwater over surface water since the former ensures higher yield the ownership and access of farmers to types of irrigation machinery is important to explain their choice of irrigation water source farmers who use diesel and manually operated irrigation machines have higher probability to utilize surface water while their counterparts who use electricity operated irrigation machines are more likely to use groundwater since irrigation is a major cost component in bangladesh government provides subsidy on irrigation and the rate is comparatively higher for the electrically powered irrigation machines moa and fao 2013 hence cost as a barrier is more likely to motivate a diesel operated machine owner to explore the available surface water sources moreover around 92 of the deep tube wells which are used to extract groundwater are operated by electricity while around 94 of the small scale irrigation machineries such as low lift pumps mainly used for surface water irrigation are operated by diesel badc 2015 manual irrigation system is used for surface water from nearby sources cost differences across irrigation machineries using different types of fuels is noted as an important factor defining farmers irrigation decisions sharma and sharma 2006 along with price and cost differences literature also noted that transactional issues such as reliability security and fast transfer can affect a farmer s irrigation decisions bjornlund 2003 since in all these aspects an owner will certainly have an upper hand a farmer is more likely to extract groundwater which is depicted by the positive sign with the dummy variable for the machine owner in the indian context some literature argued that the irrigation machineries are mostly owned by the large farmers whereas the small and marginal farmers participate more in the water market to access water for irrigation sharma and sharma 2006 the positive sign associated with the variable wage work argues that farmers participating in wage earning activities are less likely to choose surface water as a source of irrigation over groundwater this contradicts with manjunatha et al 2014 who observed farmers with significant income from non crop activities such as dairy have less interest in farming and ultimately practice less intensive farming using surface water as the cost is relatively lower wage earning activities are stressful laborious and uncertain and less gainful it is quite possible for a farmer to use earnings from wage working activities to ease financial constraints of farming 3 3 3 propensity score matching for finding the proper counterfactual group to develop a counterfactual group for the farmers using groundwater irrigation we utilize the probit estimates and produce a propensity score ps for each plot based on the common support region afterward we match each plot using surface water irrigation with a plot using groundwater irrigation with the closest ps the density distribution of the ps for both surface and groundwater irrigated plots both with and without a common support area is presented in fig 3 furthermore to check the reliability of the matching quality of the data we have conducted multiple tests to ensure that our data satisfies the balancing requirements of the psm the kernel density matching balancing test 2 2 the test is a statistical technique used in observational studies to assess the balance of covariates between treatment groups this test is typically used to evaluate the effectiveness of propensity score matching a commonly used method to control for confounding variables in observational studies shows that both surface water and groundwater irrigation adopters have identical characteristics after matching as opposed to the unmatched sample fig 4 the standardized differences bias for the mean values of almost all covariates between surface water and groundwater irrigation are less than 10 this reconfirms that the balancing requirement is ensured and there are significant overlaps in their propensity score distributions of the two groups 3 4 spf analysis to explain productivity and efficiency differences in rice production 3 4 1 hypothesis testing and variance parameters for the spf model the results of several hypothesis tests that were necessary to establish that the chosen model is suitable to explain the impact of irrigation water source choice on farming are presented in table 5 we begin with the log likelihood ratio lr test which conﬁrms that the selection of the translog functional form to be more suitable than the cobb douglas one many past studies also claimed that the flexible translog production function is a better fit for describing the production system for both bangladesh e g rahman 2003 alam et al 2011 and global agriculture e g bravo ureta et al 2020 second is the test of third moment m 3 t m 3 6 m 2 3 n where m 2 and m 3 are the 2nd and 3rd sample moments of the ols residuals respectively which checks the null hypothesis that there is no skewness of the ols residual schmidt and lin 1984 the estimated test statistic for both models is negative and confirms the rejection of the null hypothesis of the presence of inefficiency effects rejection of the third hypothesis h 0 δ 1 δ 2 δ 15 0 argues that the combined eﬀects of factors involved in the technical ineﬃciency model are critical for understanding the production variations rejection of the fourth hypothesis h 0 δ 0 δ 1 δ 15 0 argues in favor of incorporating the exogenous variables into the mean output function the estimated coefficient of γ is close to 1 and significantly different from zero table 6 confirming high level of inefficiency is present in the production process 3 4 2 explaining productivity differences in rice production table 6 presents the results of the spf function for the matched sample labor fertilizer and irrigation significantly enhance yield in the groundwater irrigated plots while yield in a surface water irrigated plot increases significantly when farmers apply more fertilizer irrigation and seed the estimated elasticity of labor fertilizer and irrigation in the model for groundwater irrigation implies that a 1 increase in labor fertilizer and irrigation will contribute to rice yield by 0 062 0 039 and 0 059 respectively in surface water irrigated plots a 1 increase in fertilizer irrigation and seed will increase rice yield by around 0 069 0 070 and 0 037 respectively the estimates of relatively smaller elasticities for all the input variables for both the groups are coherent with the literature arguing that in the context of land constrained countries like bangladesh land has a higher elasticity almost close to unity compared to other inputs rahman 2003 asadullah and rahman 2009 selim 2012 the hybrid rice growers irrespective of the choice of irrigation sources obtained significantly higher yields than their counterparts cultivating hyv varieties in the model for surface water irrigation soil type dummy variables have a more dominant role in explaining yield differences than in the model for groundwater irrigation in surface water irrigated plots yield is significantly higher in plots with loam soil than that of sandy loam soil in surface water irrigated plots with sandy loam soil the yield is significantly lower compared to plots with clay soil but significantly higher than plots with sandy and clay loam soil 3 4 3 determinants of inefficiency in the production process around 73 and 87 of the inefficiency explaining variables have significant effects in the models for surface water and groundwater respectively in both models dummies for farm size plot ownership irrigation frequency family size drought risk and location of the plot have significant roles in explaining efficiency in rice production though the direction of effects varies across the models additionally variables such as age extension service and subsidy card play a significant role in the groundwater irrigation model while education plays a significant role in the surface water irrigation model farm size is important in explaining technical efficiency differences in rice production for both groups compared to farmers with smaller land holdings the large farmers are more efficient in plots using groundwater which is consistent with literature stating large farmers capabilities to derive economies of scale and use agricultural innovations ram et al 1999 alam et al 2011 in contrast pioneered by the influential thoughts of balogh and schultz 1964 many authors observed small farmers are able to use available resources at the optimal level and attain higher productivity carter 1984 chand et al 2011 all these may explain the negative correlation between farm area and efficiency in the model for surface water irrigation where the landless marginal small and medium farmers attained higher efficiency level than the large farmers the estimated higher efficiency for owned plots than rented plots is in line with earlier literature reporting relatively less fertile or low quality of land that landowners generally prefer to rent out to tenants rahman 2003 anik and bauer 2015 in accordance with literature narrating the productivity and efficiency improving role of education in bangladesh asadullah and rahman 2009 we observe that the education variable has a positive coefficient in the model for surface water irrigation having a larger family positively influences the inefficiency of surface water irrigators while the opposite is true for farmers using groundwater for irrigation with increasing head of household age we find farms gain efficiency in plots using groundwater consistent with wilson et al 2001 who reported a positive correlation between experience and efficiency literature also reports older farmers reluctance to change their years old practices while younger farmers are usually keen to explore beyond farming ainembabazi and mugisha 2014 nyangena 2008 subsidy card owners in groundwater irrigated plots operate with a higher level of efficiency than their counterparts who do not have subsidy cards our findings support kumbhakar and lien 2010 who argued that as subsidy reduces the utility of time the farmer might spend more time in farming operations however the authors cautioned about drawing firm conclusions regarding this issue as some researchers observed that this may also demotivate farmers to work efficiently karagiannis and sarris 2005 additionally subsidy may enable farmers to purchase inputs required for maximizing production or profit by reducing their budget constraints irrigation frequency is significantly and inversely associated with technical inefficiency of both surface water and groundwater irrigated plots farmers applying more numbers of irrigation are likely to maintain the water required at different stages of rice production along with increased yield and irrigation efficiency literature reports many other benefits of irrigation rescheduling including reduced irrigation cost and the opportunity cost of water and less chances of crop failure and run off of chemical fertilizers adeniran et al 2010 contradicting our general expectation extension service is inversely correlated with efficiency in the model for groundwater irrigation and is likely to be an outcome of inefficiency in the extension service which is mentioned in several instances in the literature however it is important to mention the institutional constraints that conventional extension services face regarding the limited budget manpower and workload however one should carefully draw any firm conclusion regarding this issue the variable off farm income has a negative sign in both models implying that increasing off farm income reduces inefficiency farmers particularly those with limited land holdings can use income from off farm sources to compensate for their scale disadvantages fernandez cornejo et al 2010 the role of off farm income in overcoming credit constraints barrett et al 2001 and enabling farmers purchasing productivity enhancing inputs mishra et al 2015 is well documented in the literature the positive sign associated with the dummy for the northern region indicates that both the surface water and groundwater irrigated plots located in the southern region are more efficient than those in the northern region drought is prominent in the northern part of the country which results in water and nutrient depletion in the soil prodhan et al 2020 the declining trend in groundwater level caused by groundwater irrigation and other purposes is a major concern for farming in the north western region alauddin and sharma 2013 dey et al 2017 rahman et al 2021 for the same reason plots in the drought prone region are significantly less efficient in both models 3 4 4 technical efficiency in dry winter season rice production by irrigation water sources the descriptive statistics of the computed te scores for the surface and groundwater irrigated rice plots are presented in table 7 the mean efficiency scores for the surface and groundwater irrigated plots are 71 5 and 76 4 respectively and are equivalent to many past studies conducted with bangladeshi rice growers e g rahman 2003 asadullah and rahman 2009 selim 2012 the computed mean te scores indicate that controlling technical inefficiency related factors may increase yield by around 39 5 100 71 5 71 5 and 30 9 100 76 4 76 4 in surface and groundwater irrigated plots respectively in accordance with earlier studies on rice farming in bangladesh the computed te scores show a wide range of variation rahman 2003 rahman and rahman 2009 a relatively higher te score and lower variation for the groundwater irrigated plots is not surprising since groundwater reduces risks and uncertainty related to the availability of water furthermore the kernel density of the estimated te scores shows that the density of plots with higher te is relatively higher among the groundwater irrigated plots fig 3 fig 5 3 4 5 impact of irrigation water source on yield the results of the estimated atet presented in table 8 support the existence of a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the yields of surface and groundwater irrigated plots all the signs of the atets in different matching approaches are positive and significant indicating that yield in surface water irrigated plots is significantly lower than those irrigated by groundwater 4 conclusions the purpose of this study was to investigate productivity and efficiency of surface and groundwater irrigated dry winter rice growing plots in bangladesh the spf model was applied to the nationally representative bihs 2018 19 dataset which contains information from 6947 dry winter rice growing plots after correcting for heterogeneity arising from irrigation water source choice decisions and biases arising from self selection and observable factors rice production is dominated by groundwater irrigation accounting for three fourths of irrigated plots and rice areas farmers experiencing drought risk are less likely to choose surface water for irrigation choice of surface water irrigation is positively associated with farm size family size plots with higher flood depth membership in cooperative societies and users of diesel and manually operated irrigation machines on the other hand ownership of irrigation machines working as wage labor and contact with extension services are positively associated with the likelihood of choosing groundwater farmers in the southern region are more likely to choose surface water for irrigation groundwater irrigated plots attained significantly higher yield and efficiency than surface water irrigated plots since yield and efficiency differences are lucrative incentives for farmers to adopt groundwater irrigation there are implications for sustainability and the national budget moreover several policy documents e g national water policy national agricultural policy integrated minor irrigation policy national agriculture extension policy national water management plan development strategy and bangladesh water act emphasize increasing surface water irrigation coverage which seems difficult to achieve given these results our results reveal the presence of significant inefficiency in the rice production system of bangladesh the estimated spf models show robust effects of irrigation seed and its quality fertilizer and soil type on rice production the major factors explaining inefficiency are farm size land ownership irrigation frequency off farm income education extension and subsidy several policy options can be proposed from this research however these are not straightforward as there is a dilemma between enhancing rice productivity and efficiency achieved mainly through groundwater irrigation while tackling the falling water table in many areas of bangladesh first since dry winter rice farming requires substantial supplementary irrigation primarily from groundwater policymakers must devise innovative strategies to encourage surface water irrigation which is less productive and efficient at present rebalancing subsidies toward surface water irrigation may be an effective strategy since we observed a negative correlation between subsidy and efficiency second information on surface water irrigation should be provided to the farmers through cooperatives and extension services while acknowledging the efficiency reducing role of extension which in turn requires redressing the existing extension system in the country third farmers in the drought prone northern region require special attention since they operate at a lower efficiency level irrespective of the irrigation water source fourth lower efficiency in rented in plots would require long term rental arrangements so that farmers have incentives to invest in efficiency enhancement measures the security of tenure will incentivize farmers to adopt yield enhancing measures e g better soil fertility management options other production enhancing inputs etc we did not outright provide support for further investment in groundwater irrigation infrastructure although the evidence presented a robust positive effect of groundwater irrigation on rice yield and efficiency this is mainly due to the sustainability concern regarding the falling groundwater table resulting from the high level of groundwater extraction for agriculture and other domestic and industrial uses we realize that it is unconventional not to suggest policies that were dominant in the results i e to vigorously promote groundwater irrigation sources further however if we address the other structural causes identified in the results outlined above bangladesh may be able to tip the balance of irrigation for rice production from groundwater to surface water sources without sacrificing production the present study is based on a nationally representative plot level cross sectional data which can provide in depth information about the existing scenario at a point in time farmers choices of irrigation sources may change over time based on changes in socioeconomic conditions and or knowledge of declining water table levels this will require using panel data from similar nationally representative surveys to track such changes results obtained from this study and policy implications drawn thereof can be generalized for other regions depicting similar rice production and farming practices socio economic circumstances of farmers incidences of falling water tables overexploitation of groundwater as well as declining availability of surface water for irrigation this is because we have used a quantitative approach to a large set of nationally representative plot level data which provided insight into the underlying structural relationships of the regressors used in the econometric model which was largely independent of the study location and or data collection period therefore we are confident that our results and derived policy implications have wider appeal for policymakers and relevant stakeholders concerned with options and or mechanisms to address similar challenges in other regions and areas beyond our study location declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8938,optimizing mulched drip irrigation mdi with brackish water which would benefit both soil and cotton yields is crucial for arid areas lacking fresh water fw resources and having shallow brackish groundwater bw the hydrus 3d model simulating three dimensional soil water and salinity movement was used to understand better mdi s effects on the soil environment with shallow groundwater and optimize its operations optimized irrigation water amounts varied from 478 5 to 669 9 mm when salt concentrations of irrigation water were 1 01 g l for fw and 3 0 g l for bw reflecting local surface water and groundwater qualities irrigation water consumption was evaluated and compared with literature results the results showed that increasing irrigation frequency reduces water stress more than increasing irrigation water amounts the low salinity area under the dripper expanded with an increase in the irrigation water amount and decreased with an increase in water salinity cotton water and salt stress could be avoided when 66 mm of freshwater was used at the seedling stage when the soil salinity threshold c e1 was 2 58 g l and 412 9 mm of brackish water was used during the other growth stages when c e2 was 6 62 g l irrigation intervals of 3 days during the flowering and boll setting stages and 6 days during the other growth stages were recommended compared with earlier published results 1190 m3 ha of surface water and 495 m3 ha of groundwater could be saved in xinjiang when the above recommended irrigation strategy is used finally hydrus 3d is a valuable and efficient tool for evaluating farmland water and salinity management keywords mulched brackish drip irrigation hydrus 3d soil water and salt movement water and salt stress optimize irrigation scheme data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction saving water and improving water use efficiency are essential goals for avoiding regional ecological degradation in dry regions zhang et al 2016 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 mulched drip irrigation mdi with brackish water which is used widely in cotton fields is one of the critical technologies to solve the shortage of fresh water in southern xinjiang northwest china hu et al 2020 tan et al 2018 qi et al 2018 liu et al 2012 however several studies have shown that the accumulation of salts in the root zone when saline water is used for irrigation inhibits cotton root growth and reduces fertilizers uptake and crop yield as well as the irrigation water use efficiency wang et al 2018 feike et al 2017 leogrande et al 2016 min et al 2014 kang et al 2010 chen et al 2010 bowman et al 2007 hence it is essential to explore proper mdi strategies that benefit both the soil environment and cotton yields field experiments have been widely used to research the effects of irrigation on crop growth the experimental results have shown that film mulching drip tapes fertilization and irrigation water quantity and quality were the most important factors li et al 2018 chen et al 2018 min et al 2017 wang et al 2014 complete film mulching can significantly reduce salt accumulation in the top 0 70 cm soil profile compared to partial film mulching by further retarding the soil salts upward movement qi et al 2018 while drip irrigation with partial film mulching can save water there is still an unavoidable soil water loss and excessive salt accumulation in the bare strips due to soil evaporation tan et al 2017 both soil water content and salinity increased significantly when irrigation water salinity increased zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 salt accumulation occurs mainly at the soil surface within the top 0 10 cm and on the bare surface between mulching films no salinization occurs within the root zone 40 60 cm soil depth where abundant lateral roots germinate and extend horizontally wang et al 2019 li et al 2015 additionally using double irrigation tapes instead of a single tape can further reduce salt accumulation in the root zone without a yield decrease when the same irrigation water quality is used liu et al 2012 li et al 2018 suggested that smaller distances between drippers with short but more frequent irrigation cycles would be much more helpful in satisfying temporal and spatial plant water demands cotton biomass nitrogen n uptake and yield increased with an increase in the irrigation and n application amounts min et al 2017 singh et al 2010 shenker et al 2003 however excessive salinity could cause osmotic stress inhibiting n uptake and causing nutritional imbalance and specific ion toxicity munns and tester 2008 aslam et al 1984 moreover salt accumulation in the root zone reduces evapotranspiration et jiang et al 2012 under such conditions leaching soil salts with fresh water is necessary the flood leaching is always carried out in the winter and spring following the local xinjiang traditional cotton irrigation patterns when there is no plastic mulching hu et al 2012 wang et al 2014 2022 and when the flood irrigation can leach soil salts more uniformly using both brackish and freshwaters rotational or intermittent irrigations were superior ways to leach soil salts zeng et al 2014 heng et al 2018 confirmed that sub surface tile drainage combined with drip irrigation significantly increased the desalination rate of the 0 200 cm soil profile and maintained the mean soil salt content below 10 g kg numerical modeling is a practical approach to predicting soil water and solute distributions in drip irrigated fields the hydrus software is one of the most powerful simulating tools widely used for this purpose šimůnek et al 2008 2012 2016 for example grecco et al 2019 used hydrus 2d to simulate water flow and potassium movement in containers packed with tropical soil irrigated by a subsurface drip and cultivated with sugarcane mekala et al 2016 and guo et al 2022 simulated the nitrogen dynamics in variably saturated soils using hydrus 2d qi et al 2018 used the hydrus 2d model to explore soil water flow and salt transport in field experiments to understand processes under mdi better chen et al 2018 evaluated two dimensional distributions of soil water contents and soil ec1 5 the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water suspension during different crop growth stages under mulched drip irrigation with fresh and brackish waters however there were some differences between the two dimensional 2d model and the 2d cross sections of the three dimensional 3d model karandish et al 2019 stated that a 3d model could achieve higher accuracy when simulating soil water and solute transport in field soils with a drip irrigation system than a 2d model honari et al 2017 found that soil water content values simulated using hydrus 3d were highly consistent with the experimental observations finally li et al 2018 simulated individual drippers as nodal discharge sources using the 3d model and could effectively describe the overlap of wetting fronts along the drip lines the use of hydrus 2d 3d as an excellent and accurate tool for irrigation management simulations is justified by available literature see an extensive list in šimůnek et al 2016 nevertheless using the 3d module of hydrus 2d 3d for comprehensive evaluation of environmental impacts plant water and salinity stresses and irrigation water savings of various irrigation management schemes has been relatively rare hence this study aims to use hydrus 3d to simulate three dimensional soil water and salinity movement for mdi with different irrigation water amounts and salinities irrigation water consumption is also simulated and compared with the results from the literature the two objectives of this study are thus as follows first to evaluate three year 3d soil water movement and salt transport for different modeling scenarios second to assess various mdi schemes in terms of their impacts on the soil environment and irrigation water savings while considering the cotton soil water and salinity stress thresholds this study contributes to optimizing mdi strategies for arid regions which are much needed for regional sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments the experiments were carried out in a cotton field between june and september 2010 the experimental site is located in the tarim basin in the arid southern part of xinjiang northwest china 41º35 14 n 86º10 24 e the area is classified as having a continental desert climate with annual precipitation of 53 3 62 7 mm and annual evaporation of 2273 2788 mm the average elevation is 901

brackish water bw used to irrigate cotton has a salinity between 2 98 and 4 19 g l with the mean salinity of 3 0 g l following traditional cotton irrigation patterns brackish water was used for drip irrigation the actual amount of irrigation water was 420 mm and the irrigation frequency was set every six days 18 times irrigation 1 18 the irrigation water quantities were 9 35 mm 1 2 19 mm 3 5 36

drip irrigation experiments with brackish water and mulched soil surface were conducted in one randomly selected cotton plot of the size of 10 m 24 8 m 248 m2 fig 1 a seventeen drip lines were installed in a pattern of one mulch strip two drip lines and four crop rows fig 1 b two irrigation lines were installed for four cotton rows the soil surface was mulched with degradable plastic sheeting the distance between the drip lines was 55 cm and the drip spacing was 30 cm the cotton plants along a narrow row were spaced 10 cm apart the non mulched area of the bare zone was 40 cm this pattern was expected to provide irrigation water for roots and reduce deep percolation li et al 2015 2 2 measurements the soil volumetric water content θ soil salinity ec 1 5 cotton leaf area index

at a regular grid and measured using dt scan wang et al 2014 root distribution parameters i e temporal variations in root zone depths and widths were input into the hydrus model for various cotton growth stages 2 3 et c under mulched drip irrigation except for dripper fluxes the surface fluxes were calculated using meteorological data the water fluxes at drippers i e the irrigation amounts were determined considering potential evapotranspiration rates calculated using the penman monteith equation the standard fao penman monteith equation eq 16 was used to calculate the reference

crop coefficient approach is appropriate for irrigation scheduling of high frequency water applications the basal crop coefficient k cb describes plant transpiration and the soil water evaporation coefficient k e describes evaporation from the soil surface the crop coefficients for conditions without mulch are given by fao allen et al 1998 the k c coefficient increases gradually during the early and middle growth stages reaches the maximum during the vigorous growth stages and then decreases slowly in the later growth stages it is larger under arid conditions when the agricultural crop has a large leaf area and roughness height k c may be larger than one since evaporation from the soil surface is considerable when the soil is wet due to irrigation or rain areas with a more arid climate and larger wind speeds will have higher values of k c many scholars have researched mulched conditions e g battikhi and hill 1988 the crop coefficient is reduced due to a decreased crop water demand under mulched drip irrigation soil evaporation from bare zones gradually declines during later cotton growth stages and the influence of the mulch is thus steadily reduced as a result k c is slowly approaching the conditions without mulch the recommended values of k c for our experimental field were 0 13 early and 0 27 late during the seedling stage 0 91 during the budding stage 1 15 early and 1 08 late during the flowering and boll setting stage 0 61 early and 0 27 late during the boll opening stage respectively evaporation from the exposed soil mainly depends on the water

management systems we refer to the hydrus technical manual šimůnek et al 2018 for a detailed description of the governing equations describing variably saturated flow using the richards equation solute transport using the advection dispersion equation and root water uptake as well as various initial and boundary conditions that can be implemented the conceptual model used for the calculations is shown in fig 1b the transport domain was 150 cm 90 cm 160 cm the surface soil area associated with transpiration was 150 90 13 500 cm2 the governing water flow equation is given by the following

hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 2018 in our simulations we considered the irrigation water concentrations to be 3 0 g l brackish water bw and 1 01 g l freshwater fw there was no water flux under the mulched zone except for the drippers table 3 provides information about irrigation scheduling q d the total brackish irrigation water amounts were as follows 1 0 q 478 5 mm 1 2 q 574 2 mm and 1 4 q 669 9 mm where q is the reference irrigation amount while freshwater fw was used at the beginning of the experiment 1st may to wash out the salts brackish water was used for subsequent irrigations 3 experimental results and validation 3 1 measured soil water contents and salt concentrations the average soil water contents θ and soil salt concentration c for different growth stages were calculated for various locations bare narrow and wide zone of the cotton field the θ at all three locations decreased due to root water uptake as follows flowering and boll setting seedling the mean value budding boll opening fig 2 the θ increased gradually with soil depth due to the effects of groundwater the θ during the flowering and boll setting stages in the narrow and wide zones were higher than in the bare zone indicating that mulch was beneficial in conserving soil water the c values increased with depth in the narrow and wide zones upper layer then decreased with depth in the lower part of the soil profile the c peaked at a depth of 30 40 cm mainly due to the root uptake water the c values in the three zones decreased as follows bare wide narrow the c values visibly fluctuated in both wide and bare zones but varied only slightly in the narrow zone indicating that soil salt distributed more uniformly because of an abundant water supply under irrigation drippers 3 2 model validation the soil hydraulic properties were described using the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 van genuchten and leij 1991 the hysteresis model of lenhard et al lenhard et al 1991 lenhard and parker 1992 which avoids the pumping effect during multiple drying and wetting cycles was used initial soil hydraulic parameters were adopted from the literature li et al 2018 guo et al 2022 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities d l and d t were selected based on the d l d t ratio for different textural classes given in the literature table 4 the initial diffusion coefficient was set equal to the average value found in the literature 1 60 cm2 day table 6 kadyampakeni et al 2018 mazloomi and jalali 2019 yang et al 2017 the root water uptake parameters of the water stress response function were based on the literature values and were set at 10 cm 25 cm 200 cm 800 cm 1000 cm 0 5 cm day and 0 1 cm day feddes et al 1978 wang et al 2014 li et al 2018 a database of suggested values for different plants for the threshold slope salinity stress model is provided by maas 1990 the salinity threshold and slope values for cotton were suggested to be 15 4 ds m and 2 6 respectively we converted the threshold value to the concentration units as 13 24 g l the hydrus simulation results were obtained using the adjusted soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 5 the soil parameters for water flow and solute transport were calibrated using the observed values of soil water contents and salt concentrations at multiple locations the final diffusion coefficient was set to 1 58 cm2 day fig 3 shows observed and simulated water content distributions at various depths in the narrow zone for the experimental irrigation scenario while similar plots for c it shows a generally good agreement between observed and calculated water contents the simulated values showed much more variation versus time in response to irrigation than the observed values due to the lower measuring accuracy of field water content similarly 3 d simulation results showed more obvious fluctuations than 1 d wang et al 2014 and 2 d li et al 2018 guo et al 2022 modeling results data not shown observed and simulated c values showed similar variations during the crop growth stage the model could better display soil water content and salinity dynamics during irrigation events overall simulated values of the soil water content and the c matched the observed values well table 6 to better evaluate the accuracy of the model simulations the following statistical performance indexes were calculated the root mean square error rmse the willmott index d the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficients of determination r 2 involving the values of θ and c observed and those estimated by the model moriasi et al 2015 arraes et al 2019 al mayahi et al 2020 wen et al 2022 table 7 the d values were 0 852 and 0 970 indicating that the model s accuracy is sufficient table 7 4 modeling results and discussion to better understand the soil water and salt concentration dynamics we display below θ and salt concentrations in the cross sectional views through the 3 d transport domain 4 1 soil water distributions fig 4 shows the simulated θ values for the 1 0 q 478 5 mm scenario during three years the θ values in the soil profile s upper layer 0 50 cm fluctuated but changed only slightly in the deeper layer 50 160 cm due to restricted evaporation the θ values under the mulched zone were higher than those under the bare zone the θ values in the root zone within depths of 0 50 cm reached 0 35 0 4 one day after irrigation with fw and gradually decreased until the next irrigation event five days 35th 59th 77th 101st 119th after irrigation with bw during cotton growth stages the θ values in the top soil layer within depths of 0 10 cm of the bare zone decreased to 0 05 0 15 and at depths of 10 50 cm to 0 15 0 203 which was lower than field capacity 0 271 when irrigation was terminated the θ values in the root zone within depths of 0 50 cm dropped to 0 10 0 15 fig 5 shows the temporal and spatial variations in simulated θ one day after irrigation for different irrigation scenarios with varying amounts of irrigation during growth stages when six ellipsoids θ 0 34 with a dripper at the center were formed murat 2020 the ellipsoids expand wider and deeper for larger irrigation water amounts i e for the 1 2 q and 1 4 q scenarios for the 1 0 q scenario the ellipsoid expanded 4 cm horizontally and 2 cm vertically in the seedling stage 16 5 mm which is in the same range as in the boll opening stage in the budding stage 27 5 mm six mutually independent ellipsoids about 9 cm horizontally and 16 cm vertically were formed under two drip lines in the late flowering and boll setting stage 33 0 mm the ellipsoids expanded 14 cm horizontally and 20 vertically the ellipsoids under two drip lines overlapped during the early flowering and boll setting stage 49 5 mm the overlapped ellipsoids under each drip line were observed during the budding stage for scenario 1 4q when the irrigation amount was 38 5 mm the ellipsoidal regions were the largest at the early flowering and boll setting stages and the soil was almost saturated the ellipsoids expanded beyond the x direction boundary when the irrigation water amount was higher than 59 4 mm which means that the ellipsoids of two adjacent conceptual models overlapped the 3 d results could well show the spatial distribution of soil water 4 2 soil salts distributions the spatial and temporal variations of c for the 1 0q scenario are shown in fig 6 the salts concentrations decreased during the washing salt stage and increased during the cotton growth stages soil salts were leached with fw during the washing salt stage which provided a low salt environment for planted cotton seedlings low salinity 2 8 g l regions 17 cm deep and 13 cm wide radially with a dripper at the center were formed during the seedling stage the green region with salinities between 3 00 and 3 44 g l increased to a depth of 100 cm the low salinity green region disappeared during the budding stage and the c values reached 3 44 6 62 g l the salinity values increased at later stages especially under the bare zone 96th day 114th day 126th day salt accumulation occurred at the soil profile s depths of 50 160 cm and the c values increased from 3 44 to 5 30 g l soil salinity fluctuations mainly occurred at upper depths of 0 50 cm due to evaporation irrigation and root water uptake 4 3 water stress analysis the appropriate strategy of drip irrigation with brackish water and mulching should fulfill the cotton water demand without salt stress while minimizing the impact on the soil environment and water resources the regulated deficit irrigation index rdi was used to evaluate whether the soil water meets the water requirements of cotton meng 2008 the rdi and cotton root length rl during the growth period are given in table 8 the water stress moisture contents determined using rdi for cotton were 0 136 in the seedling stage 0 163 in the budding stage 0 203 in the flowering and boll setting stage and 0 136 in the boll opening stage fig 7 shows the variations in θ under the root zone within depths of 0 50 cm the θ values fluctuated from 0 174 to 0 20 on the 6th day after irrigation during the seedling stage in the 1 0 q scenario these values were higher than 0 136 and thus met the cotton water demand similarly to during the budding and boll opening stages fig 7a the θ values fluctuated from 0 171 to 0 020 during the early flowering and boll setting stages in the 1 0 q scenario and were lower than 0 203 on the 6th day after irrigation the θ values fluctuated from 0 168 to 0 20 during the late flowering and boll setting stages in the 1 0 q scenario and were lower than 0 203 on the 6th day after irrigation these values were lower than 0 203 and thus could not meet the cotton water demand fig 7b shows that all θ values were lower than 0 271 on the 3rd day and lower than 0 203 on the 4th day after irrigation during the flowering and boll setting stage in the 1 4 q scenario the cotton water demand could not be fully met even in the 1 4 q scenario therefore we adjusted irrigations to one event per 3 days during the early and late flowering and boll setting stages and split the total irrigation amount into two fig 8 shows the variations in θ before and after adjusting irrigation amounts during the flowering and boll setting stages the optimized water amount of one irrigation event was reduced to 24 8 mm and 16 5 mm during the early and late flowering and boll setting stages respectively with the total irrigation amount of the two events the same as in the 1 0 q scenario 49 6 mm and 33 0 mm the θ values in the root zone were higher than 0 203 during both the early and late flowering and boll setting stages hence the soil water could meet the cotton water demand 4 4 salt stress and soil environment analysis the reported soil salinity threshold for cotton is ec e 7 7 ds m min et al 2017 beltrán et al 1999 and maas et al 1977 suggested that the threshold value for the saturation extract electric conductivity at the seedling stage is ece 1 3 0 ds m soil salinity levels were inferred based on the measured values of salt concentrations c and electrical conductivities of the 1 5 soil water suspension and it was calculated using c 0 8598 ec chen et al 2018 slavich and petterson 1993 wang et al 2014 hence the threshold value in the c units was calculated to be c e1 2 58 g l and c e2 6 62 g l ec e values were used to classify soil salinization stresses into mild 2 4 ds m moderate 4 8 ds m severe 8 15 ds m and extremely severe 15 ds m akça et al 2020 fitzpatrick 1980 similarly we calculated the soil salinity c classifications as 1 72 3 44 g l 3 44 6 88 g l 6 88 12 90 g l 12 90 g l fig 9 shows the variations in c under the root zone at depths of 0 50 cm on the 1st day after drip irrigation at different growth stages for the 1 0 q and 1 4 q scenarios y 45 cm the c values at 0 50 cm depths under the mulched zone were below the c e2 limit in both 1 0 q and 1 4 q scenarios meanwhile the soil salinization stresses were mild and moderate soil salinization stress is mild in the low salinity 2 23 3 44 g l region at depths of 0 100 cm when fw is used for irrigation fig 6 soil salinization stress is mild 3 19 3 44 g l at depths of 0 80 cm when bw is used for irrigation which would fail to meet the requirements of c e1 2 58 g l during the seedling stages fig 9 soil salinization stress was moderate 4 02 6 20 g l 6 62 g l at depths of 0 50 cm under the mulched zone during 55 126 days hence we changed irrigation from brackish water to fresh water 1 01 g l for irrigation events 2 4 fig 10 shows the variations in salinity before and after irrigation adjustment during the seedling stage the c values in the root zone under mulch were lower than 2 58 g l during the seedling stage which meets the salt stress demand 4 5 evaluation of water resources we recommend an optimized irrigation scheme table 9 based on the results discussed in sections 4 3 and 4 4 which is as follows fresh water is applied in may of each year 1 30 days when counting from may 1 and the water amount is set to 40 mm after sowing and installing the plastic mulch drip irrigation with fresh water is applied again to avoid the salt stress in the topsoil at depths of 0 15 cm during the seedling stage 31 54 days and the water amount is set to 33 0 mm brackish water is used during the later growth stages the water amounts are set to 27 5 mm and 16 5 mm for the budding and boll opening stages respectively during the flowering and boll setting stages the irrigation frequency is set to 3 days 73 114 days to avoid water stress and the water amounts are set to 24 8 mm during the early stage and 16 5 mm during the late stage to optimize the water saving irrigation system we compared and analyzed previously published irrigation schemes and our recommended optimal scheme fig 11 we calculated the theoretical volume of saved water using the irrigation area demand for 2 2 106 ha of cotton fields in the xinjiang province china statistical yearbook 2018 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2014 hu et al 2020 and guo et al 2022 showed that field mdi experiments required 49 5 108 m3 of surface freshwater wang et al 2014 used 101 7 108 m3 of brackish groundwater chen et al 2014 121 44 108 m3 hu et al 2020 110 108 m3 and guo et al 2022 125 84 108 m3 our recommended irrigation strategy could save 26 18 108 m3 of surface freshwater and 10 89 108 m3 30 60 108 m3 19 16 108 m3 and 35 00 108 m3 of brackish groundwater compared to the field mdi studies discussed above respectively 5 conclusions three dimensional distributions of soil water contents and soil salinities were simulated for different irrigation water amounts and salinities using hydrus 3d the 3 d model could better describe the spatial distributions of soil water contents and soil salts due to restricted evaporation the soil volumetric water content θ in the mulched zone was higher than in the bare zone variations in soil water contents in the root zone within the depth of 0 50 cm due to irrigation events were apparent and less so in the deeper layers the soil water content response to irrigation events lasted about three days the soil salinity substantially decreased after freshwater was applied during the washing salt stage and then gradually increased after irrigation with brackish water during the cotton growth stages the highest soil salt concentration c values were observed in the upper layer of the bare zone the cotton drought tolerance values in terms of θ were calculated to be 0 136 0 163 0 203 0 136 during the seedling budding flowering and boll setting boll opening stages respectively the soil salinity should not exceed the soil salinity threshold c e1 2 579 g l during the seedling stage and c e2 6 620 g l during later growth stages to avoid water and salt stresses we suggest that 132 mm of freshwater irrigation be used during the seedling stage and 412 9 mm of brackish water irrigation during the other growth stages the first freshwater irrigation amount was 40 mm after sowing and mulching 33 0 mm of fresh water fw was used to avoid the salt stress in the root zone s 0 15 cm depth during the seedling growth stage an additional 27 5 mm 16 5 mm 24 8 mm and 16 5 mm of brackish groundwater bw were used during the budding boll opening early and late flowering and boll setting stages respectively the irrigation interval of 3 days was recommended during the flowering and boll setting stages and 6 days during the other stages compared with the earlier literature results this irrigation strategy could save 26 18 108 m3 of surface fresh water and 10 89 108 m3 of brackish groundwater in xinjiang considering the cotton farmland was about 2 2 106 ha hydrus 3d is an efficient tool for assessing and optimizing farmland water and salinity management salt migration processes were simulated for three years for conditions with a shallow groundwater table the gradually increasing groundwater use resulted in a groundwater table decline considering the interactions between saturated and unsaturated zones and related mechanisms is very important under such conditions the water and solute transport characteristics in the unsaturated saturated zone would be more complicated and computationally intensive which would be worthy of further research and discussion similarly this irrigation strategy also needs to consider macroscopic mechanisms mutually affecting the soil environment and crops to manage agricultural water usage

8938,optimizing mulched drip irrigation mdi with brackish water which would benefit both soil and cotton yields is crucial for arid areas lacking fresh water fw resources and having shallow brackish groundwater bw the hydrus 3d model simulating three dimensional soil water and salinity movement was used to understand better mdi s effects on the soil environment with shallow groundwater and optimize its operations optimized irrigation water amounts varied from 478 5 to 669 9 mm when salt concentrations of irrigation water were 1 01 g l for fw and 3 0 g l for bw reflecting local surface water and groundwater qualities irrigation water consumption was evaluated and compared with literature results the results showed that increasing irrigation frequency reduces water stress more than increasing irrigation water amounts the low salinity area under the dripper expanded with an increase in the irrigation water amount and decreased with an increase in water salinity cotton water and salt stress could be avoided when 66 mm of freshwater was used at the seedling stage when the soil salinity threshold c e1 was 2 58 g l and 412 9 mm of brackish water was used during the other growth stages when c e2 was 6 62 g l irrigation intervals of 3 days during the flowering and boll setting stages and 6 days during the other growth stages were recommended compared with earlier published results 1190 m3 ha of surface water and 495 m3 ha of groundwater could be saved in xinjiang when the above recommended irrigation strategy is used finally hydrus 3d is a valuable and efficient tool for evaluating farmland water and salinity management keywords mulched brackish drip irrigation hydrus 3d soil water and salt movement water and salt stress optimize irrigation scheme data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction saving water and improving water use efficiency are essential goals for avoiding regional ecological degradation in dry regions zhang et al 2016 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 mulched drip irrigation mdi with brackish water which is used widely in cotton fields is one of the critical technologies to solve the shortage of fresh water in southern xinjiang northwest china hu et al 2020 tan et al 2018 qi et al 2018 liu et al 2012 however several studies have shown that the accumulation of salts in the root zone when saline water is used for irrigation inhibits cotton root growth and reduces fertilizers uptake and crop yield as well as the irrigation water use efficiency wang et al 2018 feike et al 2017 leogrande et al 2016 min et al 2014 kang et al 2010 chen et al 2010 bowman et al 2007 hence it is essential to explore proper mdi strategies that benefit both the soil environment and cotton yields field experiments have been widely used to research the effects of irrigation on crop growth the experimental results have shown that film mulching drip tapes fertilization and irrigation water quantity and quality were the most important factors li et al 2018 chen et al 2018 min et al 2017 wang et al 2014 complete film mulching can significantly reduce salt accumulation in the top 0 70 cm soil profile compared to partial film mulching by further retarding the soil salts upward movement qi et al 2018 while drip irrigation with partial film mulching can save water there is still an unavoidable soil water loss and excessive salt accumulation in the bare strips due to soil evaporation tan et al 2017 both soil water content and salinity increased significantly when irrigation water salinity increased zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 salt accumulation occurs mainly at the soil surface within the top 0 10 cm and on the bare surface between mulching films no salinization occurs within the root zone 40 60 cm soil depth where abundant lateral roots germinate and extend horizontally wang et al 2019 li et al 2015 additionally using double irrigation tapes instead of a single tape can further reduce salt accumulation in the root zone without a yield decrease when the same irrigation water quality is used liu et al 2012 li et al 2018 suggested that smaller distances between drippers with short but more frequent irrigation cycles would be much more helpful in satisfying temporal and spatial plant water demands cotton biomass nitrogen n uptake and yield increased with an increase in the irrigation and n application amounts min et al 2017 singh et al 2010 shenker et al 2003 however excessive salinity could cause osmotic stress inhibiting n uptake and causing nutritional imbalance and specific ion toxicity munns and tester 2008 aslam et al 1984 moreover salt accumulation in the root zone reduces evapotranspiration et jiang et al 2012 under such conditions leaching soil salts with fresh water is necessary the flood leaching is always carried out in the winter and spring following the local xinjiang traditional cotton irrigation patterns when there is no plastic mulching hu et al 2012 wang et al 2014 2022 and when the flood irrigation can leach soil salts more uniformly using both brackish and freshwaters rotational or intermittent irrigations were superior ways to leach soil salts zeng et al 2014 heng et al 2018 confirmed that sub surface tile drainage combined with drip irrigation significantly increased the desalination rate of the 0 200 cm soil profile and maintained the mean soil salt content below 10 g kg numerical modeling is a practical approach to predicting soil water and solute distributions in drip irrigated fields the hydrus software is one of the most powerful simulating tools widely used for this purpose šimůnek et al 2008 2012 2016 for example grecco et al 2019 used hydrus 2d to simulate water flow and potassium movement in containers packed with tropical soil irrigated by a subsurface drip and cultivated with sugarcane mekala et al 2016 and guo et al 2022 simulated the nitrogen dynamics in variably saturated soils using hydrus 2d qi et al 2018 used the hydrus 2d model to explore soil water flow and salt transport in field experiments to understand processes under mdi better chen et al 2018 evaluated two dimensional distributions of soil water contents and soil ec1 5 the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water suspension during different crop growth stages under mulched drip irrigation with fresh and brackish waters however there were some differences between the two dimensional 2d model and the 2d cross sections of the three dimensional 3d model karandish et al 2019 stated that a 3d model could achieve higher accuracy when simulating soil water and solute transport in field soils with a drip irrigation system than a 2d model honari et al 2017 found that soil water content values simulated using hydrus 3d were highly consistent with the experimental observations finally li et al 2018 simulated individual drippers as nodal discharge sources using the 3d model and could effectively describe the overlap of wetting fronts along the drip lines the use of hydrus 2d 3d as an excellent and accurate tool for irrigation management simulations is justified by available literature see an extensive list in šimůnek et al 2016 nevertheless using the 3d module of hydrus 2d 3d for comprehensive evaluation of environmental impacts plant water and salinity stresses and irrigation water savings of various irrigation management schemes has been relatively rare hence this study aims to use hydrus 3d to simulate three dimensional soil water and salinity movement for mdi with different irrigation water amounts and salinities irrigation water consumption is also simulated and compared with the results from the literature the two objectives of this study are thus as follows first to evaluate three year 3d soil water movement and salt transport for different modeling scenarios second to assess various mdi schemes in terms of their impacts on the soil environment and irrigation water savings while considering the cotton soil water and salinity stress thresholds this study contributes to optimizing mdi strategies for arid regions which are much needed for regional sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments the experiments were carried out in a cotton field between june and september 2010 the experimental site is located in the tarim basin in the arid southern part of xinjiang northwest china 41º35 14 n 86º10 24 e the area is classified as having a continental desert climate with annual precipitation of 53 3 62 7 mm and annual evaporation of 2273 2788 mm the average elevation is 901 m above the mean sea level and the average annual minimum and maximum temperatures range from 5 c to 18 c freshwater fw used for irrigation comes from the peacock river whose mean salinity is 1 01 g l brackish water bw used to irrigate cotton has a salinity between 2 98 and 4 19 g l with the mean salinity of 3 0 g l following traditional cotton irrigation patterns brackish water was used for drip irrigation the actual amount of irrigation water was 420 mm and the irrigation frequency was set every six days 18 times irrigation 1 18 the irrigation water quantities were 9 35 mm 1 2 19 mm 3 5 36 mm 6 10 24 1 mm 11 16 and 9 75 17 18 from the seedling to boll opening stages the soil profile consisted of four soil layers of sandy loam and sand the properties of which are shown in table 1 the drip irrigation experiments with brackish water and mulched soil surface were conducted in one randomly selected cotton plot of the size of 10 m 24 8 m 248 m2 fig 1 a seventeen drip lines were installed in a pattern of one mulch strip two drip lines and four crop rows fig 1 b two irrigation lines were installed for four cotton rows the soil surface was mulched with degradable plastic sheeting the distance between the drip lines was 55 cm and the drip spacing was 30 cm the cotton plants along a narrow row were spaced 10 cm apart the non mulched area of the bare zone was 40 cm this pattern was expected to provide irrigation water for roots and reduce deep percolation li et al 2015 2 2 measurements the soil volumetric water content θ soil salinity ec 1 5 cotton leaf area index

institute for application of atomic energy jaas nanjing china in the wide narrow and bare zone fig 1c the soil water samples were extracted using a rhizon soil moisture sampler eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment co giesbeek the netherlands and their ec 1 5 was measured using a conductivity meter dds 307 inesa scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china in the on site laboratory the lai of cotton during all growth stages was measured using a wdy 500a micro electron leaf area instrument harbin optical instrument factory harbin china the groundwater table depth was monitored using the electronic digital water level gauges and was 1 37 2 47 m fig 1d the cotton root distributions at different growth stages were measured by soil sampling table 2 the spatial cotton root distributions were sampled at a regular grid and measured using dt scan wang et al 2014 root distribution parameters i e temporal variations in root zone depths and widths were input into the hydrus model for various cotton growth stages 2 3 et c under mulched drip irrigation except for dripper fluxes the surface fluxes were calculated using meteorological data the water fluxes at drippers i e the irrigation amounts were determined considering potential evapotranspiration rates calculated using the penman monteith equation the standard fao penman monteith equation eq 16 was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration rate et 0 from meteorological data allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 μ 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 μ 2 where et 0 is evapotranspiration of the reference grass mm day r n is

and reference grass evapotranspiration et 0 can be integrated into a single crop coefficient k c or separated into two coefficients i e a basal crop coefficient k cb and a soil evaporation coefficient k e 2 et c k c et 0 3 k c k cb k e where et c is cotton evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient for cotton dimensionless and et 0 is reference crop evapotranspiration mm day the dual crop coefficient approach is appropriate for irrigation scheduling of high frequency water applications the basal crop coefficient k cb describes plant transpiration and the soil water evaporation coefficient k e describes evaporation from the soil surface the crop coefficients for conditions without mulch are given by fao allen et al 1998 the k c coefficient increases gradually during the early and middle growth stages reaches the maximum during the vigorous growth stages and then decreases slowly in the later growth stages it is larger under arid conditions when the agricultural crop has a large leaf area and roughness height k c may be larger than one since evaporation from the soil surface is considerable when the soil is wet due to irrigation or rain areas with a more arid climate and larger wind speeds will have higher values of k c many scholars have researched mulched conditions e g battikhi and hill 1988 the crop coefficient is reduced due to a decreased crop water demand under mulched drip irrigation soil evaporation from bare zones gradually declines during later cotton growth stages and the influence of the mulch is thus steadily reduced as a result k c is slowly approaching the conditions without mulch the recommended values of k c for our experimental field were 0 13 early and 0 27 late during the seedling stage 0 91 during the budding stage 1 15 early and 1 08 late during the flowering and boll setting stage 0 61 early and 0 27 late during the boll opening stage respectively evaporation from the exposed soil mainly depends on the water content in the surface soil when the soil surface is wet following rain or irrigation the soil evaporation reduction coefficient k r is 1 when soil water that can be evaporated from the topsoil is depleted k r decreases and becomes 0 fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 4 k r t e w d e i 1 t e w r e w f o r d e i 1 r e w where k r is the evaporation reduction coefficient which depends on the

2022 the cumulative depth of readily evaporable water was recommended as rew 20 cm the cotton evapotranspiration rate et c measured precipitation and soil evaporation from unmulched soil surface are shown in the supplementary electronic file 2 4 3 d conceptual model the hydrus 2d 3d software šimůnek et al 2018 was selected for the simulations to evaluate the effects of various irrigation management systems we refer to the hydrus technical manual šimůnek et al 2018 for a detailed description of the governing equations describing variably saturated flow using the richards equation solute transport using the advection dispersion equation and root water uptake as well as various initial and boundary conditions that can be implemented the conceptual model used for the calculations is shown in fig 1b the transport domain was 150 cm 90 cm 160 cm the surface soil area associated with transpiration was 150 90 13 500 cm2 the governing water flow equation is given by the following

pressure head h and total concentration c of soil salts measured on july 15th 2010 one day before the irrigation day are used as the initial conditions the initial conditions were given as follows 9 h

variable flux time variable pressure head atmospheric and no flux boundary conditions a third type cauchy boundary condition with different indexes is used for soil salt transport along all domain boundaries the time variable flux boundary conditions are used for the drippers var fl 1 and the soil surface under the mulch except for the drippers var fl 2 the bare soil on the sides of the transport domain was represented using an atmospheric boundary condition we designed the maximum dripper water amount based on the volume which could saturate the root zone soil 0 50 cm so irrigation impact on the groundwater level was negligible therefore a time variable pressure head specifying the groundwater table position was assigned along the bottom boundary var h 1 no flow boundary

hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 2018 in our simulations we considered the irrigation water concentrations to be 3 0 g l brackish water bw and 1 01 g l freshwater fw there was no water flux under the mulched zone except for the drippers table 3 provides information about irrigation scheduling q d the total brackish irrigation water amounts were as follows 1 0 q 478 5 mm 1 2 q 574 2 mm and 1 4 q 669 9 mm where q is the reference irrigation amount while freshwater fw was used at the beginning of the experiment 1st may to wash out the salts brackish water was used for subsequent irrigations 3 experimental results and validation 3 1 measured soil water contents and salt concentrations the average soil water contents θ and soil salt concentration c for different growth stages were calculated for various locations bare narrow and wide zone of the cotton field the θ at all three locations decreased due to root water uptake as follows flowering and boll setting seedling the mean value budding boll opening fig 2 the θ increased gradually with soil depth due to the effects of groundwater the θ during the flowering and boll setting stages in the narrow and wide zones were higher than in the bare zone indicating that mulch was beneficial in conserving soil water the c values increased with depth in the narrow and wide zones upper layer then decreased with depth in the lower part of the soil profile the c peaked at a depth of 30 40 cm mainly due to the root uptake water the c values in the three zones decreased as follows bare wide narrow the c values visibly fluctuated in both wide and bare zones but varied only slightly in the narrow zone indicating that soil salt distributed more uniformly because of an abundant water supply under irrigation drippers 3 2 model validation the soil hydraulic properties were described using the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 van genuchten and leij 1991 the hysteresis model of lenhard et al lenhard et al 1991 lenhard and parker 1992 which avoids the pumping effect during multiple drying and wetting cycles was used initial soil hydraulic parameters were adopted from the literature li et al 2018 guo et al 2022 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities d l and d t were selected based on the d l d t ratio for different textural classes given in the literature table 4 the initial diffusion coefficient was set equal to the average value found in the literature 1 60 cm2 day table 6 kadyampakeni et al 2018 mazloomi and jalali 2019 yang et al 2017 the root water uptake parameters of the water stress response function were based on the literature values and were set at 10 cm 25 cm 200 cm 800 cm 1000 cm 0 5 cm day and 0 1 cm day feddes et al 1978 wang et al 2014 li et al 2018 a database of suggested values for different plants for the threshold slope salinity stress model is provided by maas 1990 the salinity threshold and slope values for cotton were suggested to be 15 4 ds m and 2 6 respectively we converted the threshold value to the concentration units as 13 24 g l the hydrus simulation results were obtained using the adjusted soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 5 the soil parameters for water flow and solute transport were calibrated using the observed values of soil water contents and salt concentrations at multiple locations the final diffusion coefficient was set to 1 58 cm2 day fig 3 shows observed and simulated water content distributions at various depths in the narrow zone for the experimental irrigation scenario while similar plots for c it shows a generally good agreement between observed and calculated water contents the simulated values showed much more variation versus time in response to irrigation than the observed values due to the lower measuring accuracy of field water content similarly 3 d simulation results showed more obvious fluctuations than 1 d wang et al 2014 and 2 d li et al 2018 guo et al 2022 modeling results data not shown observed and simulated c values showed similar variations during the crop growth stage the model could better display soil water content and salinity dynamics during irrigation events overall simulated values of the soil water content and the c matched the observed values well table 6 to better evaluate the accuracy of the model simulations the following statistical performance indexes were calculated the root mean square error rmse the willmott index d the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficients of determination r 2 involving the values of θ and c observed and those estimated by the model moriasi et al 2015 arraes et al 2019 al mayahi et al 2020 wen et al 2022 table 7 the d values were 0 852 and 0 970 indicating that the model s accuracy is sufficient table 7 4 modeling results and discussion to better understand the soil water and salt concentration dynamics we display below θ and salt concentrations in the cross sectional views through the 3 d transport domain 4 1 soil water distributions fig 4 shows the simulated θ values for the 1 0 q 478 5 mm scenario during three years the θ values in the soil profile s upper layer 0 50 cm fluctuated but changed only slightly in the deeper layer 50 160 cm due to restricted evaporation the θ values under the mulched zone were higher than those under the bare zone the θ values in the root zone within depths of 0 50 cm reached 0 35 0 4 one day after irrigation with fw and gradually decreased until the next irrigation event five days 35th 59th 77th 101st 119th after irrigation with bw during cotton growth stages the θ values in the top soil layer within depths of 0 10 cm of the bare zone decreased to 0 05 0 15 and at depths of 10 50 cm to 0 15 0 203 which was lower than field capacity 0 271 when irrigation was terminated the θ values in the root zone within depths of 0 50 cm dropped to 0 10 0 15 fig 5 shows the temporal and spatial variations in simulated θ one day after irrigation for different irrigation scenarios with varying amounts of irrigation during growth stages when six ellipsoids θ 0 34 with a dripper at the center were formed murat 2020 the ellipsoids expand wider and deeper for larger irrigation water amounts i e for the 1 2 q and 1 4 q scenarios for the 1 0 q scenario the ellipsoid expanded 4 cm horizontally and 2 cm vertically in the seedling stage 16 5 mm which is in the same range as in the boll opening stage in the budding stage 27 5 mm six mutually independent ellipsoids about 9 cm horizontally and 16 cm vertically were formed under two drip lines in the late flowering and boll setting stage 33 0 mm the ellipsoids expanded 14 cm horizontally and 20 vertically the ellipsoids under two drip lines overlapped during the early flowering and boll setting stage 49 5 mm the overlapped ellipsoids under each drip line were observed during the budding stage for scenario 1 4q when the irrigation amount was 38 5 mm the ellipsoidal regions were the largest at the early flowering and boll setting stages and the soil was almost saturated the ellipsoids expanded beyond the x direction boundary when the irrigation water amount was higher than 59 4 mm which means that the ellipsoids of two adjacent conceptual models overlapped the 3 d results could well show the spatial distribution of soil water 4 2 soil salts distributions the spatial and temporal variations of c for the 1 0q scenario are shown in fig 6 the salts concentrations decreased during the washing salt stage and increased during the cotton growth stages soil salts were leached with fw during the washing salt stage which provided a low salt environment for planted cotton seedlings low salinity 2 8 g l regions 17 cm deep and 13 cm wide radially with a dripper at the center were formed during the seedling stage the green region with salinities between 3 00 and 3 44 g l increased to a depth of 100 cm the low salinity green region disappeared during the budding stage and the c values reached 3 44 6 62 g l the salinity values increased at later stages especially under the bare zone 96th day 114th day 126th day salt accumulation occurred at the soil profile s depths of 50 160 cm and the c values increased from 3 44 to 5 30 g l soil salinity fluctuations mainly occurred at upper depths of 0 50 cm due to evaporation irrigation and root water uptake 4 3 water stress analysis the appropriate strategy of drip irrigation with brackish water and mulching should fulfill the cotton water demand without salt stress while minimizing the impact on the soil environment and water resources the regulated deficit irrigation index rdi was used to evaluate whether the soil water meets the water requirements of cotton meng 2008 the rdi and cotton root length rl during the growth period are given in table 8 the water stress moisture contents determined using rdi for cotton were 0 136 in the seedling stage 0 163 in the budding stage 0 203 in the flowering and boll setting stage and 0 136 in the boll opening stage fig 7 shows the variations in θ under the root zone within depths of 0 50 cm the θ values fluctuated from 0 174 to 0 20 on the 6th day after irrigation during the seedling stage in the 1 0 q scenario these values were higher than 0 136 and thus met the cotton water demand similarly to during the budding and boll opening stages fig 7a the θ values fluctuated from 0 171 to 0 020 during the early flowering and boll setting stages in the 1 0 q scenario and were lower than 0 203 on the 6th day after irrigation the θ values fluctuated from 0 168 to 0 20 during the late flowering and boll setting stages in the 1 0 q scenario and were lower than 0 203 on the 6th day after irrigation these values were lower than 0 203 and thus could not meet the cotton water demand fig 7b shows that all θ values were lower than 0 271 on the 3rd day and lower than 0 203 on the 4th day after irrigation during the flowering and boll setting stage in the 1 4 q scenario the cotton water demand could not be fully met even in the 1 4 q scenario therefore we adjusted irrigations to one event per 3 days during the early and late flowering and boll setting stages and split the total irrigation amount into two fig 8 shows the variations in θ before and after adjusting irrigation amounts during the flowering and boll setting stages the optimized water amount of one irrigation event was reduced to 24 8 mm and 16 5 mm during the early and late flowering and boll setting stages respectively with the total irrigation amount of the two events the same as in the 1 0 q scenario 49 6 mm and 33 0 mm the θ values in the root zone were higher than 0 203 during both the early and late flowering and boll setting stages hence the soil water could meet the cotton water demand 4 4 salt stress and soil environment analysis the reported soil salinity threshold for cotton is ec e 7 7 ds m min et al 2017 beltrán et al 1999 and maas et al 1977 suggested that the threshold value for the saturation extract electric conductivity at the seedling stage is ece 1 3 0 ds m soil salinity levels were inferred based on the measured values of salt concentrations c and electrical conductivities of the 1 5 soil water suspension and it was calculated using c 0 8598 ec chen et al 2018 slavich and petterson 1993 wang et al 2014 hence the threshold value in the c units was calculated to be c e1 2 58 g l and c e2 6 62 g l ec e values were used to classify soil salinization stresses into mild 2 4 ds m moderate 4 8 ds m severe 8 15 ds m and extremely severe 15 ds m akça et al 2020 fitzpatrick 1980 similarly we calculated the soil salinity c classifications as 1 72 3 44 g l 3 44 6 88 g l 6 88 12 90 g l 12 90 g l fig 9 shows the variations in c under the root zone at depths of 0 50 cm on the 1st day after drip irrigation at different growth stages for the 1 0 q and 1 4 q scenarios y 45 cm the c values at 0 50 cm depths under the mulched zone were below the c e2 limit in both 1 0 q and 1 4 q scenarios meanwhile the soil salinization stresses were mild and moderate soil salinization stress is mild in the low salinity 2 23 3 44 g l region at depths of 0 100 cm when fw is used for irrigation fig 6 soil salinization stress is mild 3 19 3 44 g l at depths of 0 80 cm when bw is used for irrigation which would fail to meet the requirements of c e1 2 58 g l during the seedling stages fig 9 soil salinization stress was moderate 4 02 6 20 g l 6 62 g l at depths of 0 50 cm under the mulched zone during 55 126 days hence we changed irrigation from brackish water to fresh water 1 01 g l for irrigation events 2 4 fig 10 shows the variations in salinity before and after irrigation adjustment during the seedling stage the c values in the root zone under mulch were lower than 2 58 g l during the seedling stage which meets the salt stress demand 4 5 evaluation of water resources we recommend an optimized irrigation scheme table 9 based on the results discussed in sections 4 3 and 4 4 which is as follows fresh water is applied in may of each year 1 30 days when counting from may 1 and the water amount is set to 40 mm after sowing and installing the plastic mulch drip irrigation with fresh water is applied again to avoid the salt stress in the topsoil at depths of 0 15 cm during the seedling stage 31 54 days and the water amount is set to 33 0 mm brackish water is used during the later growth stages the water amounts are set to 27 5 mm and 16 5 mm for the budding and boll opening stages respectively during the flowering and boll setting stages the irrigation frequency is set to 3 days 73 114 days to avoid water stress and the water amounts are set to 24 8 mm during the early stage and 16 5 mm during the late stage to optimize the water saving irrigation system we compared and analyzed previously published irrigation schemes and our recommended optimal scheme fig 11 we calculated the theoretical volume of saved water using the irrigation area demand for 2 2 106 ha of cotton fields in the xinjiang province china statistical yearbook 2018 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2014 hu et al 2020 and guo et al 2022 showed that field mdi experiments required 49 5 108 m3 of surface freshwater wang et al 2014 used 101 7 108 m3 of brackish groundwater chen et al 2014 121 44 108 m3 hu et al 2020 110 108 m3 and guo et al 2022 125 84 108 m3 our recommended irrigation strategy could save 26 18 108 m3 of surface freshwater and 10 89 108 m3 30 60 108 m3 19 16 108 m3 and 35 00 108 m3 of brackish groundwater compared to the field mdi studies discussed above respectively 5 conclusions three dimensional distributions of soil water contents and soil salinities were simulated for different irrigation water amounts and salinities using hydrus 3d the 3 d model could better describe the spatial distributions of soil water contents and soil salts due to restricted evaporation the soil volumetric water content θ in the mulched zone was higher than in the bare zone variations in soil water contents in the root zone within the depth of 0 50 cm due to irrigation events were apparent and less so in the deeper layers the soil water content response to irrigation events lasted about three days the soil salinity substantially decreased after freshwater was applied during the washing salt stage and then gradually increased after irrigation with brackish water during the cotton growth stages the highest soil salt concentration c values were observed in the upper layer of the bare zone the cotton drought tolerance values in terms of θ were calculated to be 0 136 0 163 0 203 0 136 during the seedling budding flowering and boll setting boll opening stages respectively the soil salinity should not exceed the soil salinity threshold c e1 2 579 g l during the seedling stage and c e2 6 620 g l during later growth stages to avoid water and salt stresses we suggest that 132 mm of freshwater irrigation be used during the seedling stage and 412 9 mm of brackish water irrigation during the other growth stages the first freshwater irrigation amount was 40 mm after sowing and mulching 33 0 mm of fresh water fw was used to avoid the salt stress in the root zone s 0 15 cm depth during the seedling growth stage an additional 27 5 mm 16 5 mm 24 8 mm and 16 5 mm of brackish groundwater bw were used during the budding boll opening early and late flowering and boll setting stages respectively the irrigation interval of 3 days was recommended during the flowering and boll setting stages and 6 days during the other stages compared with the earlier literature results this irrigation strategy could save 26 18 108 m3 of surface fresh water and 10 89 108 m3 of brackish groundwater in xinjiang considering the cotton farmland was about 2 2 106 ha hydrus 3d is an efficient tool for assessing and optimizing farmland water and salinity management salt migration processes were simulated for three years for conditions with a shallow groundwater table the gradually increasing groundwater use resulted in a groundwater table decline considering the interactions between saturated and unsaturated zones and related mechanisms is very important under such conditions the water and solute transport characteristics in the unsaturated saturated zone would be more complicated and computationally intensive which would be worthy of further research and discussion similarly this irrigation strategy also needs to consider macroscopic mechanisms mutually affecting the soil environment and crops to manage agricultural water usage the model also did not consider the scale effects on soil salt migration and accumulation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8939,soil salinization problems are widespread in the hetao plain inner mongolia resulting from arid climate conditions a shallow saline water table poor irrigation water management and insufficient drainage this study follows previous research aimed at evaluating crop water use and controlling the salinity build up in the region namely using weighing and static water table lysimeters to parameterize a water balance model aimed at the development of appropriate irrigation scheduling two sets of five static water table lysimeters which fixed depths ranged from 1 25 to 2 25 m were used over two maize crop seasons the mechanistic hydrus 1d model was further used to daily predict measured data on soil water contents boundary fluxes in the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece and the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act the soil water balance helped quantify the combined effect of water and salinity stresses on root water uptake as well as groundwater fluxes into the rootzone the salt balance showed that the salinity build up was much related to irrigation and capillary fluxes and that the autumn irrigation carried out during the non growing season was essential for controlling soil salinity the efficiency of the autumn irrigation much depended on groundwater depth and the amount of water applied for salt leaching with the best results found for the lysimeters with water table depths at 2 0 and 2 25 m 85 100 for irrigation depths 220 mm the lysimeters with shallower water tables never showed a leaching efficiency higher than 88 this research shows that the sustainability of irrigation in hetao depends on finding adequate solutions for controlling the depth of the saline groundwater minimizing capillary fluxes to the rootzone and developing consequent approaches for autumn irrigation leaching keywords autumn irrigation electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract evapotranspiration hydrus 1d model leaching upward fluxes data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil salinization is a major abiotic constraint in regions of arid to dry sub humid climates the best available estimates suggest that about 412 million ha are affected by salinity and 618 million ha by sodicity either due to natural or human induced processes fao 2015 the human induced causes also referred to as secondary salinization are mostly associated with the poor management of irrigation water with factors such as climate conditions soil properties irrigation method and associated soil and water management practices influencing the dynamics of salts in the soil profile and the degree to which crops are affected rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2014 hopmans et al 2021 improving the sustainable management of irrigation water under saline conditions is thus critical to cope with the increasing water scarcity of salt affected regions finding innovative water management techniques and strategies is required to improve crop water use while controlling the salt balance in the soil water system preventing salt accumulation in the root zone and minimizing the damaging effect of salinity on crop transpiration and yield minhas et al 2020 the hetao plain in inner mongolia with an irrigated area of 570 000 ha is an example of a region where secondary salinization has been contributing to the degradation of local soil and water resources xu et al 2010 2011 liu et al 2022a wu et al 2023 surface irrigation is a well adapted irrigation method for the region because diverted water from the yellow river has an extremely high concentration of sediments which is detrimental to sprinkler and drip equipment however as typical of its traditional management the long term excessive water diversion associated with hydro geological conditions poor irrigation water management and insufficient drainage has led to the rise of the saline water table and widespread salinization of the soil root zone xu et al 2010 2011 water saving measures that have been progressively implemented throughout the years include the optimization of irrigation scheduling and practices pereira et al 2003 2007 miao et al 2016 bai et al 2017 the precise land leveling of basins and ridge furrows bai et al 2010 miao et al 2015 2018 dong et al 2018 and the use of straw and plastic film mulching zhao et al 2016 qi et al 2018 dong et al 2018 while some of those water saving techniques can also contribute to minimizing soil salinization risks in the rootzone the main approach for salt leaching continues to be the surface basin or border irrigation practiced in autumn after crops harvesting and before soil water freezes with large water depths applied 200 mm or more to leach the full root zone however the effectiveness of such a technique may be constrained by the presence of shallow and saline water tables minhas et al 2020 as salts can easily migrate back up due to poor soil drainage conditions and to the gradients that may develop before or after the soil freezes as the topsoil layers dry up furthermore the autumn irrigation may not be compatible with the characteristics of modern irrigation systems such as drip which are becoming increasingly used in hetao further stressing the importance of finding new approaches to control soil salinity the current study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of autumn irrigation for salinity control in hetao and follows the companion papers dealing with crop water use under saline conditions in the region liu et al 2022a 2022b both studies evaluated the crop water use and the soil water balance of maize under saline conditions using weighing and static water table lysimeters respectively over three growing seasons in both studies the simdualkc model was used to successfully simulate the partition of crop evapotranspiration into its components soil evaporation and crop evaporation following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 the model was also able to quantify the groundwater contribution to crop evapotranspiration the effect of the different stressors water and salinity on crop water use and the water productivity of maize while accounting for the leaching needs because of its semi empirical nature the model could not simulate the salinity build up in the soil profile particularly in the presence of shallow saline water tables nor assess the effectiveness of autumn irrigation for salinity control for such evaluations mechanistic water flux models are needed as reviewed by liu et al 2022a 2022b diverse mechanistic models have been adopted and adapted for simulating the soil water dynamics and solute transport under hetao s shallow saline groundwater conditions e g xu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 xue and ren 2017 xiong et al 2021 most models were subjected to extensive calibration validation for simulating the salinity build up in the soil profile and impacts on crop growth and yields but the effectiveness of salinity control measures ancient or new have rarely been assessed nevertheless various studies focusing on the hetao plateau have recognized the importance of the autumn irrigation for controlling salinity and improving soil conditions for plant germination and growth e g xu et al 2010 2011 miao et al 2015 and liu et al 2022a 2022b however rare are studies attempting to identify the best application depths and relate them to the wtd liu et al 2022c meanwhile modelling applications have further been used for finding a suitable groundwater depth for crop growth pereira et al 2007 ma et al 2008 xu et al 2013 lacking yet appropriate validation using data such as those obtained from the referred lysimeter studies as such the specific objectives of this study are i to calibrate validate the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 for simulating soil water contents boundary fluxes in the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones the electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract ece and the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act using the static water table lysimeters data from the companion paper by liu et al 2022b ii to compute the soil water and salt balances in the various lysimeters over the 2017 and 2018 maize growing seasons and iii to evaluate the effectiveness of autumn irrigation for salt leaching when different application depths are used the results of this study can contribute to the development of new approaches for salt control in the hetao region and the sustainable use of soil and water resources 2 material and methods 2 1 study region and experimental data this study is part of the investigation covered in companion paper liu et al 2022b which presents the experimental data obtained in two sets of five static water table lysimeters placed at the shuguang experimental station hetao plain inner mongolia china 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 6 m a s l during three maize growing seasons 2017 2019 as such only information relevant to the current modeling study which used data collected in 2017 and 2018 will be given here the 2019 data were not considered as management conditions drastically changed in that season when no irrigation occurred the climate in the hetao plain is arid continental the mean annual precipitation is 137 mm 40 years average mostly occurring in summer the annual temperature ranges from 10 c in january to 25 c in july and the number of frost free days ranges from 135 to 150 the weather data for the study period was obtained from a nearby automatic weather station placed over a well watered clipped grass and included the maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin c the mean and minimum relative humidity rhmean rhmin the number of sunshine hours nsun h and the wind speed measured at 2 m height u2 m s 1 these data were used to compute the daily reference evapotranspiration eto mm with the fao 56 penman monteith pm equation allen et al 1998 daily precipitation p mm was also obtained at the same weather station so completing the daily weather data fig 1 shows the information of interest to this study i e the daily values of eto and precipitation during the study period the soil is silty loam with the main physical properties presented in table 1 while the methodology used for soil sampling and their determination is detailed in the companion paper by liu et al 2022a the groundwater table is saline with the electrical conductivity ecgw averaging 1 85 and 1 75 ds m 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively liu et al 2022b lysimeters were 3 3 m long 2 0 m wide 2 6 m deep placed within a maize field 8 6 ha and distanced not less than 100 m from the field edges to guarantee that the boundary layer of air above lysimeters was in equilibrium allen et al 1991a 1991b allen et al 2011a 2011b wright 1991 mariotte bottles were used to supply a stable water flow rate at the lysimeters bottom to maintain the targeted groundwater depth the consumed water was measured every day at 8 00 am with volume differences in the mariotte bottles between two consecutive days corresponding to the portion of the groundwater used by the plants the mariotte bottles were then refilled back to the initial mark using groundwater pumped from a nearby well in addition drainage bottles were used to collect and measure the excess applied water relative to the fixed wtd lysimeters were placed under an automatic rain shelter to avoid rainfall influence and more precisely measure the upward fluxes from the different water table depths wtd and related impacts further details about the characteristics of the lysimeters are given by liu et al 2022b the static lysimeters used in this study had the water table fixed at depths of 1 25 1 5 2 0 2 25 m during both seasons covering the range of wtd observed in the region xiong et al 2021 maize xi meng 3358 was sown inside and outside lysimeters to ensure a similitude of environmental conditions and the one dimensionality of measurements allen et al 1991a 1991b the sowing dates and the dates of the crop stages for each growing season are given in table 2 plants were distanced 0 3 m along the row and 0 40 m between rows 83 333 plants ha 1 a 0 2 mm thick transparent polyethylene film mulch was placed along plant rows covering 75 of the lysimeters surface 4 95 m2 to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature the remaining soil surface was left bare for the application of irrigation water fertilizers and herbicides which management followed local recommended practices four irrigation events were performed in each maize season table 3 which were defined based on the surface irrigation management practices usually carried out by local farmers irrigation water was pumped from the groundwater conveyed by a pvc pipe applied in the lysimeters bare surface and monitored with water meters lysimeters were also irrigated in autumn 200 mm mainly to leach salts away from the rootzone lysimeters were further subjected to pre sowing irrigation aiming at having adequate soil moisture for ensuring adequate plant emergence and development because model simulations were performed from the sowing date onwards the pre sowing irrigation was only accounted for when defining the initial soil moisture conditions and therefore not included in table 3 the soil water contents swc were measured every hour with fdr soil moisture sensors witu agricultural technology shenyang china calibration procedures for the fdr sensors are described in liu et al 2022b the fdr sensors were placed in all lysimeters at the depths of 0 1 0 2 0 4 m and then at every 0 2 m down to the targeted wtd for the determination of the electrical conductivity disturbed soil samples 0 1 kg were collected inside the lysimeters at the same depths as the swc measurements using a soil auger the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 ds m 1 was then measured using a dds 11a conductivity meter inesa scientific instrument shanghai china and converted to the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece as described in liu et al 2022b measurements were carried out approximately every 10 days during both seasons 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 model description the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2016 was used to numerically simulate one dimensional water flow and solute transport in variably saturated porous media by solving the richards and the fickian based convection dispersion equations respectively as follows 1 θ t z k h h z 1 s h z t 2 θ c t ρ c t z θ d c z qc z where θ is the volumetric soil water content l3 l 3 t is time t z is the vertical space coordinate l h is the soil pressure head l k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 s is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots l3 l 3 t 1 c and c are solute concentrations in the liquid m l 3 and solid m m 1 phases respectively ρ is the soil bulk density m l 3 q is the volumetric flux density l t 1 and d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 root growth was simulated using the verhulst pearl logistic growth function hoffman and van genuchten 1983 the flow equation considered the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties as described by the van genuchten mualem functional relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 3 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h η m 4 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where se is the effective saturation θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents l3 l 3 respectively ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 α l 1 and η are empirical shape parameters l is a pore connectivity tortuosity parameter and m 1 1 η the sink term in the flow equation considered the macroscopic approach proposed by feddes et al 1978 where the potential root water uptake rate i e the potential crop transpiration rate tc l t 1 is distributed over the root zone and reduced due to the presence of depth varying water and salinity stressors to obtain the actual root water uptake rate or actual transpiration rate tc act l t 1 the feddes et al 1978 model was selected to describe the water stress response function in this model root water uptake is at the potential rate when h is between h2 and h3 drops off linearly when h h2 or h h3 and becomes zero when h h4 or h h1 subscripts 1 4 denote different threshold pressure heads for the effect of the salinity stress on root water uptake the maas 1990 salinity threshold and slope function was used in this function root water uptake is maximum when the ece is below the crop tolerance salinity threshold ece threshold ds m 1 decreasing then linearly for a unit increase in salinity beyond the threshold s per ds m 1 because hydrus 1d simulates the electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecsw the relation ecsw ece ratio 2 is assumed for conversion purposes following a common approximation used for soil water contents near field capacity in medium textured soils u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 skaggs et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 the effects of the water and salinity stresses were assumed to be multiplicative van genuchten 1987 the compensated root water uptake mechanism introduced by šimůnek and hopmans 2009 was further considered when computing root water uptake this mechanism considers the capacity of maize to compensate for reduced root water uptake in water stressed parts of the root zone by increasing uptake in other soil regions that are less stressed a critical value of the water stress index ωc also referred to as root adaptability factor jarvis 1989 is defined with values ranging from 0 to 1 the closer the values are to 1 the less the ability to compensate rootzone stresses the solute transport equation considered the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water eciw and the soil solution ecsw as nonreactive tracers meaning that no adsorption in the solid phase was possible ramos et al 2011 no solute uptake by plants was considered 2 2 2 model setup in each lysimeter the soil domain was defined as a one dimensional column with 2 6 m depth discretized using 261 nodes the soil profile was relatively homogeneous as is characteristic of loess soils table 1 however during model calibration there was a need to distinguish the topsoil layer from the rest of the soil profile lysimeters included a 0 25 m thick filter layer with sand and gravel placed at the bottom therefore the soil column was divided into 3 distinct layers with depths of 0 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 35 m and 2 35 2 6 m the soil hydraulic parameters were first defined for each soil layer according to the average values proposed by carsel and parrish 1988 for each soil texture class soil dispersivity λ cm values were set according to xu et al 2015 the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters of the top two layers were then subjected to calibration the initial soil water contents were defined based on the calibrated measured data from the fdr soil moisture sensors the initial ecsw was also defined based on the measurements the upper boundary conditions were determined by the potential crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm rates irrigation and rainfall fluxes and the eciw tc and es values were computed daily following the dual crop coefficient dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 using the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 as documented in liu et al 2022b tc reductions due to water stress were computed with the defined parameters in wesseling et al 1991 for maize h1 15 cm h2 30 cm h3 325 to 600 cm and h4 8000 cm tc reductions due to salinity stress considered a ece threshold value of 1 7 ds m 1 and a s rate value of 12 per ds m 1 minhas et al 2020 the conversion of these values into ecsw as required by hydrus 1d assumed the ecsw ece 2 ratio in all lysimeters the maximum root depth was set at 1 0 m because this could not be directly observed in the lysimeters without causing a major disturbance several model runs were made to find the most adequate root depth for each lysimeter the best results were found in all lysimeters for the same depth while some relationship between root depth and groundwater depth could be expected irrigation and the fact that root water uptake does not necessarily increase with root length as axial conductance becomes limiting landsberg and fowkes 1978 justifies this option root water uptake was thus assumed to occur mostly in the topsoil layers the lower boundary conditions were described through variable pressure head conditions which were set according to the depth of the water table in each lysimeter 2 2 3 model calibration and validation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated for each lysimeter using the 2018 dataset it was never possible to find a unique set of parameters capable of reproducing field measurements in all lysimeters mostly due to small differences related to soil hydraulic parameters the option was thus to allow varying soil hydraulic data between lysimeters while maintaining constant crop related parameters validation was then performed using the calibrated parameters in each lysimeter and the independent data set of 2017 calibration procedures followed a four step approach and were initiated by minimizing the deviation between measured and simulated soil moisture data at different depths in this first step the soil hydraulic parameters θs α η and ks were obtained through inverse modeling of daily soil water content data following šimunek and van genuchten 1996 the weighting coefficients used for the different soil water content data points in the objective function to be minimized were all assumed to be 1 since the observation errors of the measurements were unknown ramos et al 2006 gonzález et al 2015 the θr was not modified as this parameter usually has little influence on simulated time series of soil water contents and soil pressure heads gonzález et al 2015 jacques et al 2002 šimůnek et al 1998 the connectivity tortuosity l parameter was set to 0 5 following mualem 1976 at the end of this first step measured soil moisture data were generally well reproduced at different depths however the upward fluxes measured at the depths of the static water tables were not therefore in a second step the ks values were manually adjusted following a trial and error procedure until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of the upward fluxes were well simulated the parameters of the root growth function root depth at time t were also tunned the third step of the calibration procedure focused on adjusting the soil dispersivity λ values of the different soil layers also following a trial and error procedure until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of the ece values were minimized in the fourth and final step the ωc was modified to minimize the deviations between model simulations and field measurements of actual evapotranspiration etc act data the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed and predicted soil moisture upward fluxes in the interface between the vadose zone and groundwater ece and etc act data were those recommended by pereira et al 2015 the regression coefficient of the linear regression through the origin b0 the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between observed and predicted values the root mean square error rmse the ratio between the rmse and the mean of the observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the nash and sutcliffe 1970 modeling efficiency nse the full description of the statistical indicators can be found in moriasi et al 2007 and legates and mccabe 1999 in general b0 equal to 1 indicates that the predicted values are statistically identical to field measurements r2 values close to 1 show that the model can explain the variance of the observations rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate that estimation errors are small and model predictions are good pbias values close to zero describe accurate model simulations while negative or positive values indicate over or under estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 mean that model predictions are good as the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance contrarily if nse 0 the observed mean is a better indicator than model predictions 2 2 4 the salt balance and leaching efficiency the salt balance sb kg ha 1 was computed by considering the depth and salinity of irrigation water diverted into the soil the depth and salinity of rainfall infiltrating the soil and the depth and salinity of drainage water discharged from the soil as follows wilcox and resch 1963 bresler et al 1982 5 sb tsc iw tsc rain tsc dw 0 64 d iw ec iw d rain ec rain d dw ec dw 10 where tsciw tscrain and tscdw are the total salt content of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water kg ha 1 respectively diw drain and ddw are the depth of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water mm respectively and eciw ecrain and ecdw are the electrical conductivity of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water ds m 1 respectively the ecrain was 0 10 ds m 1 which is slightly below the value of 0 12 ds m 1 used by phogat et al 2018 positive sb values refer to salt accumulation in the root zone layer while negative sb values refer to leaching from the same layer the sb was computed daily and results accumulated for the entire growing season table 3 the sb was further extended to the end of each year december so that the leaching resulting from autumn irrigation could be accounted for the leaching efficiency le was lastly determined in each lysimeter from the ratio of the collected drained salt mass to the applied salt mass grismer 1990 yang et al 2019 as follows 6 le tsc dw tsc iw tsc rain 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parameterization table 4 presents the calibrated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters of the various lysimeters differences between lysimeters were due to the natural variability of soil hydraulic properties to which the accurate representation of soil water content and upward fluxes data was sensitive for the topsoil layer 0 0 0 4 m those differences were noticed on the shape parameters α and η of the soil water retention θ h and soil hydraulic conductivity k h curves for the subsoil layer 0 4 2 35 m differences between lysimeters were likewise found on the same shape parameters as well as on the ks the variability of both soil hydraulic functions was relatively minor fig 2 but still capable of impacting the soil water balance in the lysimeters the calibrated soil dispersivity values were set the same in all lysimeters table 4 for the topsoil layer 0 0 0 4 m and especially for the subsoil 0 4 2 35 m layer the calibrated values were found to be higher than those reported in similar modeling applications performed in the hetao region or nearby xu et al 2013 set λ to 19 cm in soil layers with varying thicknesses from 0 3 to 0 5 m in a 3 0 m soil profile xu et al 2015 set λ to 20 cm in 0 6 0 9 m thickness layers in a 1 5 m soil column ren et al 2016 2017 set λ to a range of values from 15 to 20 cm in soil layers with thickness from 0 4 to 1 6 m in a 3 0 m soil profile soil dispersivity values are scaled with travel distance vanderborght and vereecken 2007 which justifies the larger calibrated values in this study namely for the subsoil layer which thickness was larger 1 95 m than any considered in the applications cited above lastly ωc was set to 0 9 in all lysimeters which agrees with šimůnek and hopmans 2009 hypothesis that agricultural plants may have a relatively high ωc and thus a limited ability to compensate for natural stresses the value is higher than the 0 8 adopted by gonzález et al 2015 for maize under full and deficit irrigation in brazil but that study didn t hold data on measured etc act for a better definition of that parameter 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water contents fig 3 shows as an example the measured soil water contents in different soil layers and the respective hydrus 1d simulated values in the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m along both growing seasons higher variations of soil water contents were observed closer to the soil surface which was associated with irrigation events infiltration redistribution and root water uptake at deeper depths soil water contents were relatively stable and progressively closer to soil saturation with depth due to the proximity of the water table the same dynamics were observed for the remaining lysimeters table 5 presents the values of the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between measured and simulated soil water contents in all lysimeters for 2018 the calibration year the regression coefficients b0 were all close to the 1 0 target ranging from 0 969 wtd 2 25 m to 0 997 wtd 2 0 m indicating that the simulated values were close to the observed ones the values of r2 were all greater than 0 752 wtd 2 25 m showing that generally the model could explain most of the variance of the observed data the errors of the estimates were always small with rmse 0 033 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse 10 2 the pbias values were also quite small 0 357 pbias 2 111 with no particular over or under estimation tendency when simulating the measured data lastly the nse values were all greater than 0 742 thus indicating that the variance of the residuals was largely smaller than the measured data variance for the 2017 validation season the goodness of fit indicators showed generally the same tendency and a similar range of values as observed for calibration thus indicating a very good reproduction of measured soil water content values in all lysimeters the goodness of fit indicators were comparable to other hydrus 1d applications using inverse modeling of soil moisture data e g gonzález et al 2015 diongue et al 2022 kumar et al 2022 ramos et al 2023 and to the values simulated by the simdualkc model for the same lysimeters liu et al 2022b 3 2 2 upward fluxes fig 4 shows the upward fluxes measured in the unsaturated saturated interface of each lysimeter as well as the corresponding hydrus 1d simulations in all lysimeters the upward fluxes from the groundwater table increased after sowing and between irrigation events as the topsoil layers dried up and soil matric heads were reduced during and immediately after irrigation events all upward fluxes ceased because then infiltration became the dominant process in the soil the shallower the groundwater depth the greater the upward fluxes the hydrus 1d model was able to adequately simulate this dynamic in all lysimeters table 5 the worst goodness of fit indicators relative to the upward fluxes were obtained for the lysimeter with the deepest water table depth wtd 2 25 m where the r2 0 591 and the nse 0 550 nevertheless all other indicators were comparable to those computed for other lysimeters namely the bo and pbias which continued showing good accuracy in simulating the measured data statistics were also comparable to luo and sophocleous 2010 who estimated groundwater contribution to winter wheat water requirements in the shandong province china using lysimeter data and the hydrus 1d model present results were also comparable to those obtained with simdualkc when simulating observed upward fluxes with the same and with weighing lysimeters liu et al 2022a 2022b 3 2 3 deep percolation the simulated and measured downward fluxes in the unsaturated saturated interface of each lysimeter are shown in fig 5 deep percolation was only observed immediately after irrigation events reducing to null values in the days that followed the lower the wtd the smaller the flow peak hydrus 1d was not able to reproduce flow peaks in the lysimeters with the shallowest wtd wtd 1 5 m measured flow peaks may likely be attributed to preferential flow patches that formed possibly because of soil sampling for determination of the ece a more complex modeling approach would be needed to eventually reach those flow peaks since the current simulations only considered fluxes in the soil matrix šimůnek et al 2003 however those preferential flow patches were not of natural occurrence to justify that and had little impact on simulations the goodness of fit indicators for the shallower lysimeters were quite acceptable returning r2 values ranging from 0 574 to 0 749 and nse values from 0 468 to 0 748 table 5 the same cannot be said for the lysimeters with deeper wtd which statistical indicators were poor mostly because the majority of the pairwise measured and simulated values were null a visual analysis of results can only lead to the conclusion that simulations well described deep percolation in those lysimeters 3 2 4 soil salinity the ece values measured in each lysimeter showed a tendency to increase over each growing season the salinity levels were greater in the lysimeter with the shallowest water table wtd 1 25 m fig 6 in which topsoil layer 0 0 0 1 m registered the highest ece values 6 0 9 23 ds m 1 and in the bottom layer 1 0 1 2 m the lowest 1 94 3 60 ds m 1 on the opposite the salinity levels were lower in the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m which topsoil layer 0 0 0 1 m showed ece values only ranging from 2 78 to 6 08 ds m 1 and the bottom values 1 8 2 0 m from 2 16 to 2 79 ds m 1 the autumn irrigation always caused a drop in the ece values in the soil profile in every lysimeter the goodness of fit indicators between measured and simulated ece values were less good than those relative to soil moisture and upward fluxes table 5 this was expected as statistical indicators for solute transport simulations are usually worse than for soil moisture because they are dependent on i soil moisture simulations ii the established relation for converting measured values of ec1 5 into ece data which is obviously subjected to error and iii the assumed relationship for converting simulated ecsw into ece data which is also subjected to uncertainty skaggs et al 2006 as a result the r2 values ranged from 0 33 to 0 64 thus denoting a somewhat wide dispersion of values along the regression line and the nse values from 0 13 to 0 38 nevertheless positive and indicating that the variance of residuals was smaller than the variance of observations the values for b0 were generally 10 close to 1 0 indicating under estimation for small wtd and over estimation when wtd was large with best results for wtd around 1 5 m the nrmse values were relatively low 19 7 nrmse 29 0 and comparable to ramos et al 2023 who conducted a similar validation approach based on ece data 3 2 5 actual evapotranspiration the etc act values increased during the development stage and reached maximum values above 8 mm d 1 at the beginning of august during the mid season stage in both seasons to drop again with senescence in the late season stage until maize was harvested at the end of september fig 7 in all crop stages etc act values never reached the potential etc values because of the combined effects of water and salinity stresses on root water uptake the hydrus 1d model was able to simulate etc act values very well either during the calibration or the validation with r2 values from 0 794 to 0 933 and nse values from 0 617 to 0 823 table 5 for these results the activation of the compensation mechanism was decisive šimůnek and hopmans 2009 however some underestimation of etc act values was noticed in lysimeters with wtd 2 0 and wtd 2 25 during the 2018 growing season with b0 values dropping to 0 693 and 0 712 respectively and pbias increasing to values above 31 and 26 respectively this divergence was more notorious for a short period between july 22nd and july 31st because in that period which followed the irrigation event performed on july 16th the soil should be drying up and the water and salinity stresses increasing the next irrigation was only on august 9th the model predictions seem more realistic than measurement values that were maintained at very high rates during validation such problem was not observed even if b0 failed to go above values of 0 855 luo and sophocleous 2010 also reported similar good statistics for the etc act in their lysimeter study er raki et al 2021 showed comparable good estimations of the etc act of winter wheat grown in morocco using the hydrus 1d model nevertheless the goodness of fit values previously obtained with simdualkc liu et al 2022a 2022b were comparable or superior 3 3 soil water balance the components of the soil water balance estimated by the hydrus 1d model for each lysimeter and crop season are given in table 6 including the non growing period vertical fluxes were computed at 1 25 m depth to facilitate the comparison between lysimeters during crop seasons the tc act was very similar between lysimeters with seasonal cumulative values slightly lower in 2017 396 401 mm than in 2018 413 424 mm in all lysimeters potential root water uptake was reduced 24 25 in 2017 and 25 27 in 2018 due to water and salinity stresses the effect of groundwater depth on the tc act was thus only minor a direct comparison to liu et al 2022b needs to consider that their results were obtained using the simdualkc model which follows a semi empirical approach still in their study potential root water uptake was reduced by 25 2017 and 23 2018 in the lysimeter with the shallowest groundwater depth wtd 1 25 m which was the most affected by salinity stress the lysimeters with the deepest water table wtd 2 25 m and less afflicted by salinity showed root water uptake reductions of only 16 2017 and 17 2018 because the simdualkc approach for computing the salinity stress is directly based on the measured ece values pereira et al 2007 minhas et al 2020 root water uptake reductions agreed with the salinity levels monitored in each lysimeter this was not verified using the hydrus 1d model mostly because the approach adopted considered the ecsw instead which was modeled as a non reactive tracer values were then converted to the ece for comparison likely only by using the ion chemistry module also available in hydrus 1d which considers the transport of soluble ions and reactions between the liquid and solid phases gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 would be possible to have a clearer distinction of the tc act under different soil salinity and groundwater depth conditions in addition the upward fluxes of water into the rootzone were much dependent on the groundwater depth table 6 resulting in higher values 151 155 mm in the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m and lower values 56 57 mm in the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m hence the groundwater contribution to the tc act ranged from 37 to 38 in the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m to 14 in the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m showing a similar trend and close values to liu et al 2022b these estimates also agree with available studies aimed at assessing the groundwater contribution to maize water demand under saline conditions in hetao when using modeling results e g gao et al 2015 ren et al 2016 wu et al 2023 percolation values further decreased with groundwater depth mostly because of the larger drier rootzone layer under such conditions nonetheless estimated values are related to the less efficient irrigation scheduling adopted in the experiment i e with less opportune water applications which followed traditional practices carried out by local farmers however that lower efficiency is beneficial in terms of salt leaching and may be considered desirable the non growing period was characterized by high percolation due to the application of 200 mm as autumn irrigation for leaching the accumulated salts during the crop season 3 4 salt balance and leaching of salts under diverse autumn irrigation depths table 7 presents the salt balance for each lysimeter in both crop seasons like for the soil water balance the salt balance was computed for the growing period and the non growing period the latter to appropriately consider the effect of autumn irrigation on salt leaching the salt balance was also computed for the 0 0 1 25 m soil layer again to facilitate the comparison between lysimeters salts were added to the soil mainly through the irrigation water 3 76 3 97 tonnes ha 1 during the crop period through the autumn irrigation 2 24 2 37 tonnes ha 1 as well transported with the capillary rise of saline groundwater the greater the upward flux the greater the salinity build up in the rootzone this was evidenced in the case of the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m with 3 49 3 57 tonnes ha 1 of salts ascending to the rootzone while the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m had a salt load via capillary rise of only 1 20 tonnes ha 1 during the crop season while some percolation existed in all lysimeters during the growing period which promoted salt leaching and alleviated the salinity stress the autumn irrigation was fundamental for removing the most substantial part of the salts accumulated in the rootzone during the previous maize season nonetheless leaching from autumn irrigation was greater in the lysimeters with shallower wtd 1 5 m 6 31 tonnes ha 1 than deeper wtd 2 0 m 4 75 tonnes ha 1 groundwater levels due to the higher accumulation of salts in these lysimeters and to the higher soil moisture condition of the deeper rootzone layer the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m further showed the highest leaching efficiency 83 5 87 5 compared with the other lysimeters particularly with the one with wtd 2 25 m where the leaching efficiency was the lowest 51 3 53 6 the literature already recognizes the autumn irrigation as an important control mechanism for soil salinity in the hetao irrigation district xu et al 2010 mao et al 2017 wu et al 2019 cao et al 2023 the autumn irrigation is further fundamental for improving the structure of the soil root zone due to the multiple occurrences of soil freezing and thawing particularly in loess silty soils and for increasing soil water content for the summer crops to be planted next april after soil unfreezes wang and akae 2004 li et al 2012 wang et al 2020 yet the amount of water required for salt leaching the most adequate irrigation schedule and method the effectiveness of the procedure and the relation to groundwater depth is often the source of some debate in this study the leaching efficiency of autumn irrigation in relation to water table depth was explored using the calibrated hydrus 1d model the same water table depths ranging from 1 25 m to 2 25 m were considered as well as irrigation dates varying the autumn irrigation depth considerably impacted the effectiveness of the autumn irrigation salinity control measure fig 8 shows the leaching efficiency for each wtd and growing season 2017 and 2018 for autumn irrigation depths ranging from 50 to 400 mm the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m never showed a higher leaching efficiency than the 78 obtained during experimental conditions 200 mm regardless of the amount of water applied likewise the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m showed the highest leaching efficiency 83 5 87 5 for an autumn irrigation depth of 200 mm in both these lysimeters higher depths were never as effective due to the additional salt load to the rootzone and poor drainage conditions these results agree with the discussion by minhas et al 2020 about the ineffectiveness of leaching in the presence of shallow and saline water tables unless subsurface drainage is considered the lysimeter with wtd 2 0 m showed the effectiveness of the autumn irrigation increasing from 67 to 68 86 when the autumn irrigation depth increased from 200 to 250 mm however higher depths also became ineffective in promoting salt leaching see fig 8 lastly the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m showed the most favorable drainage conditions with the effectiveness of autumn irrigation increasing abruptly when small increments above 200 mm were applied with 220 mm the leaching efficiency increased from 51 to 54 to 85 91 i e an additional 20 mm of water represented an increase of the leaching efficiency of about 35 40 with 250 mm 50 mm all salts applied during the growing and non growing seasons were removed only with 400 mm the leaching efficiency dropped again to values below 100 the referred irrigation depths 220 and 250 mm are only slightly lower than the 270 mm recommended by chang et al 2019 for effective salt leaching when the groundwater level was at 2 0 m depth or shallower results confirm the considerations by mao et al 2017 referring that the key to controlling soil salinity in the rootzone would be through increasing the amount of autumn irrigation water or decreasing the groundwater level to reduce the salt input due to the capillary rise however related thresholds were not proposed the results in fig 8 contradict those by liu et al 2022c who found a negative relationship between the depth of the water table and the autumn irrigation depth using an empirical water and salt balance model in fact these authors propose the highest application depth for the smaller wtd and vice versa contrarily to lysimeter observations and hydrus 1d simulations similarly sun et al 2019 recommended a decrease in autumn irrigation requirements when wtd increases and an increase in autumn irrigation depth with the increase in groundwater salinity these authors used a simplified water and mass balance model which predictions were validated through comparison with hydrus 1d simulations instead of field data again the results in fig 8 suggest a more complex relationship between the controlling factors of soil salinity than the simple linear relations reported by liu et al 2022c and sun et al 2019 all lysimeters showed decreasing leaching efficiencies when reducing the autumn irrigation depth below 200 mm fig 8 this directly agrees with cao et al 2023 who conducted a scenario analysis using a hydro agro economic optimization model revealing an increase of soil salt storage in the root zone as winter irrigation depth was reduced the direct effects of decreasing autumn irrigation application depths were land fallow increased soil salinity and decreased agriculture revenues in the hetao chang et al 2019 using the drainmod model also estimated an increase in soil salinity in hetao when the autumn irrigation depth was reduced liu et al 2022c further reported increased soil salinization in hetao s irrigated areas as the autumn irrigation decreased therefore water savings in the hetao irrigation district at expense of the autumn irrigation need to carefully consider the consequences in terms of land degradation and consequent economic losses for farmers in this sense cao et al 2023 further advert to the need of considering the trade off between the loss of benefits from reducing winter irrigation in hetao and the new benefit that the saved winter irrigation could generate elsewhere however the uncertainty of such type of calculations has to be very carefully evaluated in the companion paper liu et al 2022b is concluded that the best cropping conditions higher crop height leaf area index and yield and lower salinity levels were found in the lysimeter with wtd 2 0 m because shallower water table depths always induced a larger accumulation of salts in the root zone due to higher upward water fluxes in the current study modeling results showed that the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m was the one where the autumn irrigation of 200 mm was more effective in leaching salts away from the rootzone layer this is likely related to the commonly adopted application depth used in hetao which led to adopting 200 mm in the lysimeters experiments liu et al 2020a b however simulating larger autumn irrigation depths with the lysimeters with wtd 2 0 m and wtd 2 25 m led to comparable or even better conditions for salt control these results are in favor of the progressive installation of drainage in the hetao plain because groundwater fluxes to the rootzone are also important to fulfil crop water needs a wtd 2 0 m may be the best compromise between crop growth and salinity control in agreement with results by liu et al 2022b nonetheless more efficient irrigation schedules should be developed combined with the appropriate setting of the water table depth to improve the effectiveness of salt leaching in the hetao region an example is given by wu et al 2019 where the anticipation of the autumn irrigation date by 10 days combined with a longer application period allowed reducing irrigation water by 20 controlling the groundwater level and minimizing soil salinization problems however on the one hand it is not yet clear how to adopt this in practice and on the other hand how to apply large irrigation depths when drip irrigation would be adopted currently the progressive use of drip systems in hetao is apparently concurrent with the application of the autumn irrigation which area has remained stable over the last decade qian et al 2022 moreover subsurface drainage now being installed require new irrigation approaches to maximize its impact in improving salt leaching 4 conclusions this study used two sets of five static water table lysimeters which fixed depths ranged from 1 25 to 2 25 m over two growing seasons the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water contents capillary fluxes dp ece and etc act data measured in each lysimeter this constituted one of the most extensive evaluations of the different components of the soil water balance ever performed with this model the model was able to well reproduce soil water contents data and etc act the upward capillary fluxes and dp were also well simulated but the ece simulation was less good but acceptable in every lysimeter irrigation was by flooding and followed standard management performed by local farmers the water was conveyed from the saline groundwater and delivered to the lysimeters as such root water uptake was much impacted by water stress and soil salinity levels with reductions reaching 24 27 which largely affected yields the influence of water table depth on root water uptake was only minor on the other hand the upward fluxes to the rootzone layer were much influenced by the groundwater depth with greater values found with shallower water tables salts were mobilized to the rootzone mostly with irrigation and by capillary rise results lead to conclude that the shallower the groundwater depth the greater the salinity build up in the rootzone over the crop season the autumn leaching irrigation which is performed in hetao since ancient times was the most important mechanism for controlling soil salinity levels in the rootzone its efficiency was also mostly associated with groundwater depth with the greatest efficiency values 83 5 87 5 observed for the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m however when increasing the autumn irrigation depth from 200 to 220 or 250 mm the lysimeters with wtd 2 0 m and wtd 2 25 m showed comparable or even higher efficiencies 85 100 thus evidencing better vertical drainage conditions and allowing to consider the adoption of such irrigation depths for autumn irrigation when further searching the best wtd conditions because the characteristics of autumn irrigation are hardly compatible with the characteristics of modern irrigation systems such as drip the transition of irrigation methods currently in place in hetao and in other places of the world also affected by salinization problems needs to consider developing new approaches to satisfy the needs relative to leaching and soil protection this study shows that for deeper wtd soil salinization in hetao can be controlled with autumn irrigation depths of 220 250 mm however for shallower wtd the effectiveness of autumn irrigation is to be known in the long term and new solutions are required developing new approaches to the autumn leaching and improving silty soils structural conditions while progressively adopting drip irrigation should be imperative to the sustainability of local production systems and therefore a main research issue declaration of

8939,soil salinization problems are widespread in the hetao plain inner mongolia resulting from arid climate conditions a shallow saline water table poor irrigation water management and insufficient drainage this study follows previous research aimed at evaluating crop water use and controlling the salinity build up in the region namely using weighing and static water table lysimeters to parameterize a water balance model aimed at the development of appropriate irrigation scheduling two sets of five static water table lysimeters which fixed depths ranged from 1 25 to 2 25 m were used over two maize crop seasons the mechanistic hydrus 1d model was further used to daily predict measured data on soil water contents boundary fluxes in the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece and the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act the soil water balance helped quantify the combined effect of water and salinity stresses on root water uptake as well as groundwater fluxes into the rootzone the salt balance showed that the salinity build up was much related to irrigation and capillary fluxes and that the autumn irrigation carried out during the non growing season was essential for controlling soil salinity the efficiency of the autumn irrigation much depended on groundwater depth and the amount of water applied for salt leaching with the best results found for the lysimeters with water table depths at 2 0 and 2 25 m 85 100 for irrigation depths 220 mm the lysimeters with shallower water tables never showed a leaching efficiency higher than 88 this research shows that the sustainability of irrigation in hetao depends on finding adequate solutions for controlling the depth of the saline groundwater minimizing capillary fluxes to the rootzone and developing consequent approaches for autumn irrigation leaching keywords autumn irrigation electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract evapotranspiration hydrus 1d model leaching upward fluxes data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil salinization is a major abiotic constraint in regions of arid to dry sub humid climates the best available estimates suggest that about 412 million ha are affected by salinity and 618 million ha by sodicity either due to natural or human induced processes fao 2015 the human induced causes also referred to as secondary salinization are mostly associated with the poor management of irrigation water with factors such as climate conditions soil properties irrigation method and associated soil and water management practices influencing the dynamics of salts in the soil profile and the degree to which crops are affected rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2014 hopmans et al 2021 improving the sustainable management of irrigation water under saline conditions is thus critical to cope with the increasing water scarcity of salt affected regions finding innovative water management techniques and strategies is required to improve crop water use while controlling the salt balance in the soil water system preventing salt accumulation in the root zone and minimizing the damaging effect of salinity on crop transpiration and yield minhas et al 2020 the hetao plain in inner mongolia with an irrigated area of 570 000 ha is an example of a region where secondary salinization has been contributing to the degradation of local soil and water resources xu et al 2010 2011 liu et al 2022a wu et al 2023 surface irrigation is a well adapted irrigation method for the region because diverted water from the yellow river has an extremely high concentration of sediments which is detrimental to sprinkler and drip equipment however as typical of its traditional management the long term excessive water diversion associated with hydro geological conditions poor irrigation water management and insufficient drainage has led to the rise of the saline water table and widespread salinization of the soil root zone xu et al 2010 2011 water saving measures that have been progressively implemented throughout the years include the optimization of irrigation scheduling and practices pereira et al 2003 2007 miao et al 2016 bai et al 2017 the precise land leveling of basins and ridge furrows bai et al 2010 miao et al 2015 2018 dong et al 2018 and the use of straw and plastic film mulching zhao et al 2016 qi et al 2018 dong et al 2018 while some of those water saving techniques can also contribute to minimizing soil salinization risks in the rootzone the main approach for salt leaching continues to be the surface basin or border irrigation practiced in autumn after crops harvesting and before soil water freezes with large water depths applied 200 mm or more to leach the full root zone however the effectiveness of such a technique may be constrained by the presence of shallow and saline water tables minhas et al 2020 as salts can easily migrate back up due to poor soil drainage conditions and to the gradients that may develop before or after the soil freezes as the topsoil layers dry up furthermore the autumn irrigation may not be compatible with the characteristics of modern irrigation systems such as drip which are becoming increasingly used in hetao further stressing the importance of finding new approaches to control soil salinity the current study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of autumn irrigation for salinity control in hetao and follows the companion papers dealing with crop water use under saline conditions in the region liu et al 2022a 2022b both studies evaluated the crop water use and the soil water balance of maize under saline conditions using weighing and static water table lysimeters respectively over three growing seasons in both studies the simdualkc model was used to successfully simulate the partition of crop evapotranspiration into its components soil evaporation and crop evaporation following the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 the model was also able to quantify the groundwater contribution to crop evapotranspiration the effect of the different stressors water and salinity on crop water use and the water productivity of maize while accounting for the leaching needs because of its semi empirical nature the model could not simulate the salinity build up in the soil profile particularly in the presence of shallow saline water tables nor assess the effectiveness of autumn irrigation for salinity control for such evaluations mechanistic water flux models are needed as reviewed by liu et al 2022a 2022b diverse mechanistic models have been adopted and adapted for simulating the soil water dynamics and solute transport under hetao s shallow saline groundwater conditions e g xu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 xue and ren 2017 xiong et al 2021 most models were subjected to extensive calibration validation for simulating the salinity build up in the soil profile and impacts on crop growth and yields but the effectiveness of salinity control measures ancient or new have rarely been assessed nevertheless various studies focusing on the hetao plateau have recognized the importance of the autumn irrigation for controlling salinity and improving soil conditions for plant germination and growth e g xu et al 2010 2011 miao et al 2015 and liu et al 2022a 2022b however rare are studies attempting to identify the best application depths and relate them to the wtd liu et al 2022c meanwhile modelling applications have further been used for finding a suitable groundwater depth for crop growth pereira et al 2007 ma et al 2008 xu et al 2013 lacking yet appropriate validation using data such as those obtained from the referred lysimeter studies as such the specific objectives of this study are i to calibrate validate the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 for simulating soil water contents boundary fluxes in the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones the electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract ece and the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act using the static water table lysimeters data from the companion paper by liu et al 2022b ii to compute the soil water and salt balances in the various lysimeters over the 2017 and 2018 maize growing seasons and iii to evaluate the effectiveness of autumn irrigation for salt leaching when different application depths are used the results of this study can contribute to the development of new approaches for salt control in the hetao region and the sustainable use of soil and water resources 2 material and methods 2 1 study region and experimental data this study is part of the investigation covered in companion paper liu et al 2022b which presents the experimental data obtained in two sets of five static water table lysimeters placed at the shuguang experimental station hetao plain inner mongolia china 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 6 m a s l during three maize growing seasons 2017 2019 as such only information relevant to the current modeling study which used data collected in 2017 and 2018 will be given here the 2019 data were not considered as management conditions drastically changed in that season when no irrigation occurred the climate in the hetao plain is arid continental the mean annual precipitation is 137 mm 40 years average mostly occurring in summer the annual temperature ranges from 10 c in january to 25 c in july and the number of frost free days ranges from 135 to 150 the weather data for the study period was obtained from a nearby automatic weather station placed over a well watered clipped grass and included the maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin c the mean and minimum relative humidity rhmean rhmin the number of sunshine hours nsun h and the wind speed measured at 2 m height u2 m s 1 these data were used to compute the daily reference evapotranspiration eto mm with the fao 56 penman monteith pm equation allen et al 1998 daily precipitation p mm was also obtained at the same weather station so completing the daily weather data fig 1 shows the information of interest to this study i e the daily values of eto and precipitation during the study period the soil is silty loam with the main physical properties presented in table 1 while the methodology used for soil sampling and their determination is detailed in the companion paper by liu et al 2022a the groundwater table is saline with the electrical conductivity ecgw averaging 1 85 and 1 75 ds m 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively liu et al 2022b lysimeters were 3 3 m long 2 0 m wide 2 6 m deep placed within a maize field 8 6 ha and distanced not less than 100 m from the field edges to guarantee that the boundary layer of air above lysimeters was in equilibrium allen et al 1991a 1991b allen et al 2011a 2011b wright 1991 mariotte bottles were used to supply a stable water flow rate at the lysimeters bottom to maintain the targeted groundwater depth the consumed water was measured every day at 8 00 am with volume differences in the mariotte bottles between two consecutive days corresponding to the portion of the groundwater used by the plants the mariotte bottles were then refilled back to the initial mark using groundwater pumped from a nearby well in addition drainage bottles were used to collect and measure the excess applied water relative to the fixed wtd lysimeters were placed under an automatic rain shelter to avoid rainfall influence and more precisely measure the upward fluxes from the different water table depths wtd and related impacts further details about the characteristics of the lysimeters are given by liu et al 2022b the static lysimeters used in this study had the water table fixed at depths of 1 25 1 5 2 0 2 25 m during both seasons covering the range of wtd observed in the region xiong et al 2021 maize xi meng 3358 was sown inside and outside lysimeters to ensure a similitude of environmental conditions and the one dimensionality of measurements allen et al 1991a 1991b the sowing dates and the dates of the crop stages for each growing season are given in table 2 plants were distanced 0 3 m along the row and 0 40 m between rows 83 333 plants ha 1 a 0 2 mm thick transparent polyethylene film mulch was placed along plant rows covering 75 of the lysimeters surface 4 95 m2 to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature the remaining soil surface was left bare for the application of irrigation water fertilizers and herbicides which management followed local recommended practices four irrigation events were performed in each maize season table 3 which were defined based on the surface irrigation management practices usually carried out by local farmers irrigation water was pumped from the groundwater conveyed by a pvc pipe applied in the lysimeters bare surface and monitored with water meters lysimeters were also irrigated in autumn 200 mm mainly to leach salts away from the rootzone lysimeters were further subjected to pre sowing irrigation aiming at having adequate soil moisture for ensuring adequate plant emergence and development because model simulations were performed from the sowing date onwards the pre sowing irrigation was only accounted for when defining the initial soil moisture conditions and therefore not included in table 3 the soil water contents swc were measured every hour with fdr soil moisture sensors witu agricultural technology shenyang china calibration procedures for the fdr sensors are described in liu et al 2022b the fdr sensors were placed in all lysimeters at the depths of 0 1 0 2 0 4 m and then at every 0 2 m down to the targeted wtd for the determination of the electrical conductivity disturbed soil samples 0 1 kg were collected inside the lysimeters at the same depths as the swc measurements using a soil auger the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 ds m 1 was then measured using a dds 11a conductivity meter inesa scientific instrument shanghai china and converted to the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract ece as described in liu et al 2022b measurements were carried out approximately every 10 days during both seasons 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 model description the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2016 was used to numerically simulate one dimensional water flow and solute transport in variably saturated porous media by solving the richards and the fickian based convection dispersion equations respectively as follows 1 θ t z k h h z 1 s h z t 2 θ c t ρ c t z θ d c z qc z where θ is the volumetric soil water content l3 l 3 t is

and m 1 1 η the sink term in the flow equation considered the macroscopic approach proposed by feddes et al 1978 where the potential root water uptake rate i e the potential crop transpiration rate tc l t 1 is distributed over the root zone and reduced due to the presence of depth varying water and salinity stressors to obtain the actual root water uptake rate or actual transpiration rate tc act l t 1 the feddes et al 1978 model was selected to describe the water stress response function in this model root water uptake is at the potential rate when h is between h2 and h3 drops off linearly when h h2 or h h3 and becomes zero when h h4 or h h1 subscripts 1 4 denote different threshold pressure heads for the effect of the salinity stress on root water uptake the maas 1990 salinity threshold and slope function was used in this function root water uptake is maximum when the ece is below the crop tolerance salinity threshold ece threshold ds m 1 decreasing then linearly for a unit increase in salinity beyond the threshold s per ds m 1 because hydrus 1d simulates the electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecsw the relation ecsw ece ratio 2 is assumed for conversion purposes following a common approximation used for soil water contents near field capacity in medium textured soils u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 skaggs et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 the effects of the water and salinity stresses were assumed to be multiplicative van genuchten 1987 the compensated root water uptake mechanism introduced by šimůnek and hopmans 2009 was further considered when computing root water uptake this mechanism considers the capacity of maize to compensate for reduced root water uptake in water stressed parts of the root zone by increasing uptake in other soil regions that are less stressed a critical value of the water stress index ωc also referred to as root adaptability factor jarvis 1989 is defined with values ranging from 0 to 1 the closer the values are to 1 the less the ability to compensate rootzone stresses the solute transport equation considered the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water eciw and the soil solution ecsw as nonreactive tracers meaning that no adsorption in the solid phase was possible ramos et al 2011 no solute uptake by plants was considered 2 2 2 model setup in each lysimeter the soil domain was defined as a one dimensional column with 2 6 m depth discretized using 261 nodes the soil profile was relatively homogeneous as is characteristic of loess soils table 1 however during model calibration there was a need to distinguish the topsoil layer from the rest of the soil profile lysimeters included a 0 25 m thick filter layer with sand and gravel placed at the bottom therefore the soil column was divided into 3 distinct layers with depths of 0 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 35 m and 2 35 2 6 m the soil hydraulic parameters were first defined for each soil layer according to the average values proposed by carsel and parrish 1988 for each soil texture class soil dispersivity λ cm values were set according to xu et al 2015 the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters of the top two layers were then subjected to calibration the initial soil water contents were defined based on the calibrated measured data from the fdr soil moisture sensors the initial ecsw was also defined based on the measurements the upper boundary conditions were determined by the potential crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm rates irrigation and rainfall fluxes and the eciw tc and es values were computed daily following the dual crop coefficient dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 using the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 as documented in liu et al 2022b tc reductions due to water stress were computed with the defined parameters in wesseling et al 1991 for maize h1 15 cm h2 30 cm h3 325 to 600 cm and h4 8000 cm tc reductions due to salinity stress considered a ece threshold value of 1 7 ds m 1 and a s rate value of 12 per ds m 1 minhas et al 2020 the conversion of these values into ecsw as required by hydrus 1d assumed the ecsw ece 2 ratio in all lysimeters the maximum root depth was set at 1 0 m because this could not be directly observed in the lysimeters without causing a major disturbance several model runs were made to find the most adequate root depth for each lysimeter the best results were found in all lysimeters for the same depth while some relationship between root depth and groundwater depth could be expected irrigation and the fact that root water uptake does not necessarily increase with root length as axial conductance becomes limiting landsberg and fowkes 1978 justifies this option root water uptake was thus assumed to occur mostly in the topsoil layers the lower boundary conditions were described through variable pressure head conditions which were set according to the depth of the water table in each lysimeter 2 2 3 model calibration and validation the hydrus 1d model was calibrated for each lysimeter using the 2018 dataset it was never possible to find a unique set of parameters capable of reproducing field measurements in all lysimeters mostly due to small differences related to soil hydraulic parameters the option was thus to allow varying soil hydraulic data between lysimeters while maintaining constant crop related parameters validation was then performed using the calibrated parameters in each lysimeter and the independent data set of 2017 calibration procedures followed a four step approach and were initiated by minimizing the deviation between measured and simulated soil moisture data at different depths in this first step the soil hydraulic parameters θs α η and ks were obtained through inverse modeling of daily soil water content data following šimunek and van genuchten 1996 the weighting coefficients used for the different soil water content data points in the objective function to be minimized were all assumed to be 1 since the observation errors of the measurements were unknown ramos et al 2006 gonzález et al 2015 the θr was not modified as this parameter usually has little influence on simulated time series of soil water contents and soil pressure heads gonzález et al 2015 jacques et al 2002 šimůnek et al 1998 the connectivity tortuosity l parameter was set to 0 5 following mualem 1976 at the end of this first step measured soil moisture data were generally well reproduced at different depths however the upward fluxes measured at the depths of the static water tables were not therefore in a second step the ks values were manually adjusted following a trial and error procedure until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of the upward fluxes were well simulated the parameters of the root growth function root depth at time t were also tunned the third step of the calibration procedure focused on adjusting the soil dispersivity λ values of the different soil layers also following a trial and error procedure until deviations between model simulations and field measurements of the ece values were minimized in the fourth and final step the ωc was modified to minimize the deviations between model simulations and field measurements of actual evapotranspiration etc act data the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between observed and predicted soil moisture upward fluxes in the interface between the vadose zone and groundwater ece and etc act data were those recommended by pereira et al 2015 the regression coefficient of the linear regression through the origin b0 the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between observed and predicted values the root mean square error rmse the ratio between the rmse and the mean of the observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the nash and sutcliffe 1970 modeling efficiency nse the full description of the statistical indicators can be found in moriasi et al 2007 and legates and mccabe 1999 in general b0 equal to 1 indicates that the predicted values are statistically identical to field measurements r2 values close to 1 show that the model can explain the variance of the observations rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate that estimation errors are small and model predictions are good pbias values close to zero describe accurate model simulations while negative or positive values indicate over or under estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 mean that model predictions are good as the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance contrarily if nse 0 the observed mean is a better indicator than model predictions 2 2 4 the salt balance and leaching efficiency the salt balance sb kg ha 1 was computed by considering the depth and salinity of irrigation water diverted into the soil the depth and salinity of rainfall infiltrating the soil and the depth and salinity of drainage water discharged from the soil as follows wilcox and resch 1963 bresler et al 1982 5 sb tsc iw tsc rain tsc dw 0 64 d iw ec iw d rain ec rain d dw ec dw 10 where tsciw tscrain and tscdw are the total salt content of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water kg ha 1 respectively diw drain and ddw are the depth of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water mm respectively and eciw ecrain and ecdw are the electrical conductivity of irrigation water rainfall and drainage water ds m 1 respectively the ecrain was 0 10 ds m 1 which is slightly below the value of 0 12 ds m 1 used by phogat et al 2018 positive sb values refer to salt accumulation in the root zone layer while negative sb values refer to leaching from the same layer the sb was computed daily and results accumulated for the entire growing season table 3 the sb was further extended to the end of each year december so that the leaching resulting from autumn irrigation could be accounted for the leaching efficiency le was lastly determined in each lysimeter from the ratio of the collected drained salt mass to the applied salt mass grismer 1990 yang et al 2019 as follows 6 le tsc dw tsc iw tsc rain 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parameterization table 4 presents the calibrated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters of the various lysimeters differences between lysimeters were due to the natural variability of soil hydraulic properties to which the accurate representation of soil water content and upward fluxes data was sensitive for the topsoil layer 0 0 0 4 m those differences were noticed on the shape parameters α and η of the soil water retention θ h and soil hydraulic conductivity k h curves for the subsoil layer 0 4 2 35 m differences between lysimeters were likewise found on the same shape parameters as well as on the ks the variability of both soil hydraulic functions was relatively minor fig 2 but still capable of impacting the soil water balance in the lysimeters the calibrated soil dispersivity values were set the same in all lysimeters table 4 for the topsoil layer 0 0 0 4 m and especially for the subsoil 0 4 2 35 m layer the calibrated values were found to be higher than those reported in similar modeling applications performed in the hetao region or nearby xu et al 2013 set λ to 19 cm in soil layers with varying thicknesses from 0 3 to 0 5 m in a 3 0 m soil profile xu et al 2015 set λ to 20 cm in 0 6 0 9 m thickness layers in a 1 5 m soil column ren et al 2016 2017 set λ to a range of values from 15 to 20 cm in soil layers with thickness from 0 4 to 1 6 m in a 3 0 m soil profile soil dispersivity values are scaled with travel distance vanderborght and vereecken 2007 which justifies the larger calibrated values in this study namely for the subsoil layer which thickness was larger 1 95 m than any considered in the applications cited above lastly ωc was set to 0 9 in all lysimeters which agrees with šimůnek and hopmans 2009 hypothesis that agricultural plants may have a relatively high ωc and thus a limited ability to compensate for natural stresses the value is higher than the 0 8 adopted by gonzález et al 2015 for maize under full and deficit irrigation in brazil but that study didn t hold data on measured etc act for a better definition of that parameter 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water contents fig 3 shows as an example the measured soil water contents in different soil layers and the respective hydrus 1d simulated values in the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m along both growing seasons higher variations of soil water contents were observed closer to the soil surface which was associated with irrigation events infiltration redistribution and root water uptake at deeper depths soil water contents were relatively stable and progressively closer to soil saturation with depth due to the proximity of the water table the same dynamics were observed for the remaining lysimeters table 5 presents the values of the statistical indicators used to evaluate the goodness of fit between measured and simulated soil water contents in all lysimeters for 2018 the calibration year the regression coefficients b0 were all close to the 1 0 target ranging from 0 969 wtd 2 25 m to 0 997 wtd 2 0 m indicating that the simulated values were close to the observed ones the values of r2 were all greater than 0 752 wtd 2 25 m showing that generally the model could explain most of the variance of the observed data the errors of the estimates were always small with rmse 0 033 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse 10 2 the pbias values were also quite small 0 357 pbias 2 111 with no particular over or under estimation tendency when simulating the measured data lastly the nse values were all greater than 0 742 thus indicating that the variance of the residuals was largely smaller than the measured data variance for the 2017 validation season the goodness of fit indicators showed generally the same tendency and a similar range of values as observed for calibration thus indicating a very good reproduction of measured soil water content values in all lysimeters the goodness of fit indicators were comparable to other hydrus 1d applications using inverse modeling of soil moisture data e g gonzález et al 2015 diongue et al 2022 kumar et al 2022 ramos et al 2023 and to the values simulated by the simdualkc model for the same lysimeters liu et al 2022b 3 2 2 upward fluxes fig 4 shows the upward fluxes measured in the unsaturated saturated interface of each lysimeter as well as the corresponding hydrus 1d simulations in all lysimeters the upward fluxes from the groundwater table increased after sowing and between irrigation events as the topsoil layers dried up and soil matric heads were reduced during and immediately after irrigation events all upward fluxes ceased because then infiltration became the dominant process in the soil the shallower the groundwater depth the greater the upward fluxes the hydrus 1d model was able to adequately simulate this dynamic in all lysimeters table 5 the worst goodness of fit indicators relative to the upward fluxes were obtained for the lysimeter with the deepest water table depth wtd 2 25 m where the r2 0 591 and the nse 0 550 nevertheless all other indicators were comparable to those computed for other lysimeters namely the bo and pbias which continued showing good accuracy in simulating the measured data statistics were also comparable to luo and sophocleous 2010 who estimated groundwater contribution to winter wheat water requirements in the shandong province china using lysimeter data and the hydrus 1d model present results were also comparable to those obtained with simdualkc when simulating observed upward fluxes with the same and with weighing lysimeters liu et al 2022a 2022b 3 2 3 deep percolation the simulated and measured downward fluxes in the unsaturated saturated interface of each lysimeter are shown in fig 5 deep percolation was only observed immediately after irrigation events reducing to null values in the days that followed the lower the wtd the smaller the flow peak hydrus 1d was not able to reproduce flow peaks in the lysimeters with the shallowest wtd wtd 1 5 m measured flow peaks may likely be attributed to preferential flow patches that formed possibly because of soil sampling for determination of the ece a more complex modeling approach would be needed to eventually reach those flow peaks since the current simulations only considered fluxes in the soil matrix šimůnek et al 2003 however those preferential flow patches were not of natural occurrence to justify that and had little impact on simulations the goodness of fit indicators for the shallower lysimeters were quite acceptable returning r2 values ranging from 0 574 to 0 749 and nse values from 0 468 to 0 748 table 5 the same cannot be said for the lysimeters with deeper wtd which statistical indicators were poor mostly because the majority of the pairwise measured and simulated values were null a visual analysis of results can only lead to the conclusion that simulations well described deep percolation in those lysimeters 3 2 4 soil salinity the ece values measured in each lysimeter showed a tendency to increase over each growing season the salinity levels were greater in the lysimeter with the shallowest water table wtd 1 25 m fig 6 in which topsoil layer 0 0 0 1 m registered the highest ece values 6 0 9 23 ds m 1 and in the bottom layer 1 0 1 2 m the lowest 1 94 3 60 ds m 1 on the opposite the salinity levels were lower in the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m which topsoil layer 0 0 0 1 m showed ece values only ranging from 2 78 to 6 08 ds m 1 and the bottom values 1 8 2 0 m from 2 16 to 2 79 ds m 1 the autumn irrigation always caused a drop in the ece values in the soil profile in every lysimeter the goodness of fit indicators between measured and simulated ece values were less good than those relative to soil moisture and upward fluxes table 5 this was expected as statistical indicators for solute transport simulations are usually worse than for soil moisture because they are dependent on i soil moisture simulations ii the established relation for converting measured values of ec1 5 into ece data which is obviously subjected to error and iii the assumed relationship for converting simulated ecsw into ece data which is also subjected to uncertainty skaggs et al 2006 as a result the r2 values ranged from 0 33 to 0 64 thus denoting a somewhat wide dispersion of values along the regression line and the nse values from 0 13 to 0 38 nevertheless positive and indicating that the variance of residuals was smaller than the variance of observations the values for b0 were generally 10 close to 1 0 indicating under estimation for small wtd and over estimation when wtd was large with best results for wtd around 1 5 m the nrmse values were relatively low 19 7 nrmse 29 0 and comparable to ramos et al 2023 who conducted a similar validation approach based on ece data 3 2 5 actual evapotranspiration the etc act values increased during the development stage and reached maximum values above 8 mm d 1 at the beginning of august during the mid season stage in both seasons to drop again with senescence in the late season stage until maize was harvested at the end of september fig 7 in all crop stages etc act values never reached the potential etc values because of the combined effects of water and salinity stresses on root water uptake the hydrus 1d model was able to simulate etc act values very well either during the calibration or the validation with r2 values from 0 794 to 0 933 and nse values from 0 617 to 0 823 table 5 for these results the activation of the compensation mechanism was decisive šimůnek and hopmans 2009 however some underestimation of etc act values was noticed in lysimeters with wtd 2 0 and wtd 2 25 during the 2018 growing season with b0 values dropping to 0 693 and 0 712 respectively and pbias increasing to values above 31 and 26 respectively this divergence was more notorious for a short period between july 22nd and july 31st because in that period which followed the irrigation event performed on july 16th the soil should be drying up and the water and salinity stresses increasing the next irrigation was only on august 9th the model predictions seem more realistic than measurement values that were maintained at very high rates during validation such problem was not observed even if b0 failed to go above values of 0 855 luo and sophocleous 2010 also reported similar good statistics for the etc act in their lysimeter study er raki et al 2021 showed comparable good estimations of the etc act of winter wheat grown in morocco using the hydrus 1d model nevertheless the goodness of fit values previously obtained with simdualkc liu et al 2022a 2022b were comparable or superior 3 3 soil water balance the components of the soil water balance estimated by the hydrus 1d model for each lysimeter and crop season are given in table 6 including the non growing period vertical fluxes were computed at 1 25 m depth to facilitate the comparison between lysimeters during crop seasons the tc act was very similar between lysimeters with seasonal cumulative values slightly lower in 2017 396 401 mm than in 2018 413 424 mm in all lysimeters potential root water uptake was reduced 24 25 in 2017 and 25 27 in 2018 due to water and salinity stresses the effect of groundwater depth on the tc act was thus only minor a direct comparison to liu et al 2022b needs to consider that their results were obtained using the simdualkc model which follows a semi empirical approach still in their study potential root water uptake was reduced by 25 2017 and 23 2018 in the lysimeter with the shallowest groundwater depth wtd 1 25 m which was the most affected by salinity stress the lysimeters with the deepest water table wtd 2 25 m and less afflicted by salinity showed root water uptake reductions of only 16 2017 and 17 2018 because the simdualkc approach for computing the salinity stress is directly based on the measured ece values pereira et al 2007 minhas et al 2020 root water uptake reductions agreed with the salinity levels monitored in each lysimeter this was not verified using the hydrus 1d model mostly because the approach adopted considered the ecsw instead which was modeled as a non reactive tracer values were then converted to the ece for comparison likely only by using the ion chemistry module also available in hydrus 1d which considers the transport of soluble ions and reactions between the liquid and solid phases gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 would be possible to have a clearer distinction of the tc act under different soil salinity and groundwater depth conditions in addition the upward fluxes of water into the rootzone were much dependent on the groundwater depth table 6 resulting in higher values 151 155 mm in the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m and lower values 56 57 mm in the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m hence the groundwater contribution to the tc act ranged from 37 to 38 in the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m to 14 in the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m showing a similar trend and close values to liu et al 2022b these estimates also agree with available studies aimed at assessing the groundwater contribution to maize water demand under saline conditions in hetao when using modeling results e g gao et al 2015 ren et al 2016 wu et al 2023 percolation values further decreased with groundwater depth mostly because of the larger drier rootzone layer under such conditions nonetheless estimated values are related to the less efficient irrigation scheduling adopted in the experiment i e with less opportune water applications which followed traditional practices carried out by local farmers however that lower efficiency is beneficial in terms of salt leaching and may be considered desirable the non growing period was characterized by high percolation due to the application of 200 mm as autumn irrigation for leaching the accumulated salts during the crop season 3 4 salt balance and leaching of salts under diverse autumn irrigation depths table 7 presents the salt balance for each lysimeter in both crop seasons like for the soil water balance the salt balance was computed for the growing period and the non growing period the latter to appropriately consider the effect of autumn irrigation on salt leaching the salt balance was also computed for the 0 0 1 25 m soil layer again to facilitate the comparison between lysimeters salts were added to the soil mainly through the irrigation water 3 76 3 97 tonnes ha 1 during the crop period through the autumn irrigation 2 24 2 37 tonnes ha 1 as well transported with the capillary rise of saline groundwater the greater the upward flux the greater the salinity build up in the rootzone this was evidenced in the case of the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m with 3 49 3 57 tonnes ha 1 of salts ascending to the rootzone while the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m had a salt load via capillary rise of only 1 20 tonnes ha 1 during the crop season while some percolation existed in all lysimeters during the growing period which promoted salt leaching and alleviated the salinity stress the autumn irrigation was fundamental for removing the most substantial part of the salts accumulated in the rootzone during the previous maize season nonetheless leaching from autumn irrigation was greater in the lysimeters with shallower wtd 1 5 m 6 31 tonnes ha 1 than deeper wtd 2 0 m 4 75 tonnes ha 1 groundwater levels due to the higher accumulation of salts in these lysimeters and to the higher soil moisture condition of the deeper rootzone layer the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m further showed the highest leaching efficiency 83 5 87 5 compared with the other lysimeters particularly with the one with wtd 2 25 m where the leaching efficiency was the lowest 51 3 53 6 the literature already recognizes the autumn irrigation as an important control mechanism for soil salinity in the hetao irrigation district xu et al 2010 mao et al 2017 wu et al 2019 cao et al 2023 the autumn irrigation is further fundamental for improving the structure of the soil root zone due to the multiple occurrences of soil freezing and thawing particularly in loess silty soils and for increasing soil water content for the summer crops to be planted next april after soil unfreezes wang and akae 2004 li et al 2012 wang et al 2020 yet the amount of water required for salt leaching the most adequate irrigation schedule and method the effectiveness of the procedure and the relation to groundwater depth is often the source of some debate in this study the leaching efficiency of autumn irrigation in relation to water table depth was explored using the calibrated hydrus 1d model the same water table depths ranging from 1 25 m to 2 25 m were considered as well as irrigation dates varying the autumn irrigation depth considerably impacted the effectiveness of the autumn irrigation salinity control measure fig 8 shows the leaching efficiency for each wtd and growing season 2017 and 2018 for autumn irrigation depths ranging from 50 to 400 mm the lysimeter with wtd 1 25 m never showed a higher leaching efficiency than the 78 obtained during experimental conditions 200 mm regardless of the amount of water applied likewise the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m showed the highest leaching efficiency 83 5 87 5 for an autumn irrigation depth of 200 mm in both these lysimeters higher depths were never as effective due to the additional salt load to the rootzone and poor drainage conditions these results agree with the discussion by minhas et al 2020 about the ineffectiveness of leaching in the presence of shallow and saline water tables unless subsurface drainage is considered the lysimeter with wtd 2 0 m showed the effectiveness of the autumn irrigation increasing from 67 to 68 86 when the autumn irrigation depth increased from 200 to 250 mm however higher depths also became ineffective in promoting salt leaching see fig 8 lastly the lysimeter with wtd 2 25 m showed the most favorable drainage conditions with the effectiveness of autumn irrigation increasing abruptly when small increments above 200 mm were applied with 220 mm the leaching efficiency increased from 51 to 54 to 85 91 i e an additional 20 mm of water represented an increase of the leaching efficiency of about 35 40 with 250 mm 50 mm all salts applied during the growing and non growing seasons were removed only with 400 mm the leaching efficiency dropped again to values below 100 the referred irrigation depths 220 and 250 mm are only slightly lower than the 270 mm recommended by chang et al 2019 for effective salt leaching when the groundwater level was at 2 0 m depth or shallower results confirm the considerations by mao et al 2017 referring that the key to controlling soil salinity in the rootzone would be through increasing the amount of autumn irrigation water or decreasing the groundwater level to reduce the salt input due to the capillary rise however related thresholds were not proposed the results in fig 8 contradict those by liu et al 2022c who found a negative relationship between the depth of the water table and the autumn irrigation depth using an empirical water and salt balance model in fact these authors propose the highest application depth for the smaller wtd and vice versa contrarily to lysimeter observations and hydrus 1d simulations similarly sun et al 2019 recommended a decrease in autumn irrigation requirements when wtd increases and an increase in autumn irrigation depth with the increase in groundwater salinity these authors used a simplified water and mass balance model which predictions were validated through comparison with hydrus 1d simulations instead of field data again the results in fig 8 suggest a more complex relationship between the controlling factors of soil salinity than the simple linear relations reported by liu et al 2022c and sun et al 2019 all lysimeters showed decreasing leaching efficiencies when reducing the autumn irrigation depth below 200 mm fig 8 this directly agrees with cao et al 2023 who conducted a scenario analysis using a hydro agro economic optimization model revealing an increase of soil salt storage in the root zone as winter irrigation depth was reduced the direct effects of decreasing autumn irrigation application depths were land fallow increased soil salinity and decreased agriculture revenues in the hetao chang et al 2019 using the drainmod model also estimated an increase in soil salinity in hetao when the autumn irrigation depth was reduced liu et al 2022c further reported increased soil salinization in hetao s irrigated areas as the autumn irrigation decreased therefore water savings in the hetao irrigation district at expense of the autumn irrigation need to carefully consider the consequences in terms of land degradation and consequent economic losses for farmers in this sense cao et al 2023 further advert to the need of considering the trade off between the loss of benefits from reducing winter irrigation in hetao and the new benefit that the saved winter irrigation could generate elsewhere however the uncertainty of such type of calculations has to be very carefully evaluated in the companion paper liu et al 2022b is concluded that the best cropping conditions higher crop height leaf area index and yield and lower salinity levels were found in the lysimeter with wtd 2 0 m because shallower water table depths always induced a larger accumulation of salts in the root zone due to higher upward water fluxes in the current study modeling results showed that the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m was the one where the autumn irrigation of 200 mm was more effective in leaching salts away from the rootzone layer this is likely related to the commonly adopted application depth used in hetao which led to adopting 200 mm in the lysimeters experiments liu et al 2020a b however simulating larger autumn irrigation depths with the lysimeters with wtd 2 0 m and wtd 2 25 m led to comparable or even better conditions for salt control these results are in favor of the progressive installation of drainage in the hetao plain because groundwater fluxes to the rootzone are also important to fulfil crop water needs a wtd 2 0 m may be the best compromise between crop growth and salinity control in agreement with results by liu et al 2022b nonetheless more efficient irrigation schedules should be developed combined with the appropriate setting of the water table depth to improve the effectiveness of salt leaching in the hetao region an example is given by wu et al 2019 where the anticipation of the autumn irrigation date by 10 days combined with a longer application period allowed reducing irrigation water by 20 controlling the groundwater level and minimizing soil salinization problems however on the one hand it is not yet clear how to adopt this in practice and on the other hand how to apply large irrigation depths when drip irrigation would be adopted currently the progressive use of drip systems in hetao is apparently concurrent with the application of the autumn irrigation which area has remained stable over the last decade qian et al 2022 moreover subsurface drainage now being installed require new irrigation approaches to maximize its impact in improving salt leaching 4 conclusions this study used two sets of five static water table lysimeters which fixed depths ranged from 1 25 to 2 25 m over two growing seasons the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water contents capillary fluxes dp ece and etc act data measured in each lysimeter this constituted one of the most extensive evaluations of the different components of the soil water balance ever performed with this model the model was able to well reproduce soil water contents data and etc act the upward capillary fluxes and dp were also well simulated but the ece simulation was less good but acceptable in every lysimeter irrigation was by flooding and followed standard management performed by local farmers the water was conveyed from the saline groundwater and delivered to the lysimeters as such root water uptake was much impacted by water stress and soil salinity levels with reductions reaching 24 27 which largely affected yields the influence of water table depth on root water uptake was only minor on the other hand the upward fluxes to the rootzone layer were much influenced by the groundwater depth with greater values found with shallower water tables salts were mobilized to the rootzone mostly with irrigation and by capillary rise results lead to conclude that the shallower the groundwater depth the greater the salinity build up in the rootzone over the crop season the autumn leaching irrigation which is performed in hetao since ancient times was the most important mechanism for controlling soil salinity levels in the rootzone its efficiency was also mostly associated with groundwater depth with the greatest efficiency values 83 5 87 5 observed for the lysimeter with wtd 1 5 m however when increasing the autumn irrigation depth from 200 to 220 or 250 mm the lysimeters with wtd 2 0 m and wtd 2 25 m showed comparable or even higher efficiencies 85 100 thus evidencing better vertical drainage conditions and allowing to consider the adoption of such irrigation depths for autumn irrigation when further searching the best wtd conditions because the characteristics of autumn irrigation are hardly compatible with the characteristics of modern irrigation systems such as drip the transition of irrigation methods currently in place in hetao and in other places of the world also affected by salinization problems needs to consider developing new approaches to satisfy the needs relative to leaching and soil protection this study shows that for deeper wtd soil salinization in hetao can be controlled with autumn irrigation depths of 220 250 mm however for shallower wtd the effectiveness of autumn irrigation is to be known in the long term and new solutions are required developing new approaches to the autumn leaching and improving silty soils structural conditions while progressively adopting drip irrigation should be imperative to the sustainability of local production systems and therefore a main research issue declaration of
