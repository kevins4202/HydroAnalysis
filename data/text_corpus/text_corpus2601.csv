optimizing the polymer concentration feed flow rate tip to collector distance and applied voltage during the electrospinning process nanofibers with a regular shape uniform size distribution and compactness were obtained utilizing the electrospun yfonfs and acnfs as the anode and cathode respectively in an undivided photoelectrochemical system enabled the degradation of target pollutants with

discharge from textile industries raises a serious environmental concern because it contains synthetic dyes that are harmful to human health as well as marine life 7 8 among the assorted dyes azo dyes such as orange ii have been widely used to treat textiles however these dyes that are regarded as carcinogen and mutagen are always stable and resistant to aerobic degradation in light of this many research efforts have been put on degrading azo dyes through catalysis technology 9 in general metal materials can be utilized for catalytic applications pt 10 11 and co 12 nanoparticles have been reported to be capable of degrading organic pollutants owing to their catalytic reduction processes in addition metal oxides are also considered potential alternatives to treat wastewater based on their specific photocatalytic activities for example a non toxic and low cost photocatalyst tio2 has been widely utilized for the oxidation of organics which can be driven by ultraviolet uv light wavelength 387 nm irradiation nevertheless the wide energy band gap eg of 3 2 ev of tio2 limits its light absorption to a narrow wavelength range thus restricting its applications under visible light irradiation additionally the recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs of tio2 is still high which also reduces its photocatalytic efficiency 13 to explore new photocatalysts with narrower eg to enhance visible light absorption tio2 based photocatalysts such as cr doped tio2 and tio2 multi wall carbon nanotube heterojunction arrays have been developed 14 15 alternatively other oxides such as perovskite materials have gained much attention in recent years the ferrite perovskite lafeo3 also demonstrated visible light driven photocatalytic activity over rhodamine b methylene with a high removal efficiency re 16 for the same target pollutant yfeo3 yfo prepared through microwave assisted synthesis offered a high re of over 90 in 120 min treatment under visible light irradiation 17 which is four times higher than that of tio2 p25 this is because yfo has a narrow eg of 2 43 ev which is beneficial to visible light excitation in addition the ferromagnetic feature of yfo allows its recovery after use by applying an external magnet 18 19 it has also been reported that the crystal phase of yfo can be changed depending on the calcination temperature during sol gel synthesis 20 hexagonal yfo has a narrower eg value and a more porous structure than orthorhombic yfo thus leading to better visible light photocatalytic activity over methyl orange despite the advantages of yfo in photocatalytic activity most of the literature has focused on powder type perovskite catalysts rather than other types to the best of our knowledge fiber type yfo fabricated via electrospinning has not yet been well addressed and thus its photocatalytic properties in treating organics remain unknown in addition despite the use of a yfo catalyst for treating dye based pollutants its ability to degrade emerging pollutants has not been well explored and thus is worth investigating in our preliminary study a composite electrode comprising powder type yfo and carbon fibers was shown to degrade non biodegradable azo dyes to an appreciably low level 21 based on its photoelectrocatalytic activity as an extension in this study we fabricated a fiber type yfo using electrospinning technology visible light driven photocatalytic activity with low eg high surface area of nanofiber structure and ability to recycle owing to the ferromagnetic feature of the electrospun yfo material are considered advantageous to water purification it was further coupled with electrospun activated carbon nanofibers acnfs in a photoelectrochemical pec system to degrade both the azo dye orange ii and the emerging pollutant sulfamethazine smt under uv light irradiation the influence of electrospinning conditions and post calcination temperature on the material properties of the electrospun yfeo3 nanofibers yfonfs and acnfs were investigated several significant factors that determine the re of the target pollutants in the pec system were examined furthermore the reasons for improvement of the re of the pollutants in the pec system are explained and their reaction kinetics are discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 fabrication of yfonfs and acnfs sol gel synthesis was adopted to prepare the yfo precursor first yttrium nitrate ferric nitrate and ethanol were mixed well to form a solution the molar ratio of yttrium to ferric ions was 1 1 then polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp powders were added to the solution with complete mixing the resultant polymeric precursor was transferred to a syringe which was connected to a stainless steel needle inner diameter 0 33 mm of an electrospinning device through a teflon tube high voltage in the range of 15 30 kv was applied to the device to form electrospun nanofibers which were collected on a collector placed on the opposite side of the needle the pvp concentration feed flow rate applied voltage and tcd were investigated as parameters for the electrospinning process after drying the resultant product was calcined at 700 c to form yfonfs according to our previous study the eg of yfo calcined at 700 c was estimated as 1 35 ev from a tauc plot which was obtained based on the visible light absorption spectrum of the yfo material 21 the synthesis of acnfs was similar to that of yfonfs except for the precursor the acnf precursor was prepared by mixing polyacrylonitrile pan and dimethylformamide dmf with a magnetic stirrer the electrospinning conditions for the yfonf and acnf samples are summarized in tables 1 and s1 respectively in addition all the detailed information for the materials used in the experiments are summarized in table s2 2 2 material characterization the morphology and elemental composition of the fabricated nanofibers were examined using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7800f jeol to investigate the crystal structure of the nanofibers an x ray diffractometer xrd d8 sss bruker with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å was performed with an applied voltage of 40 kv and a current of 40 ma in addition the scan rate was set at 5 min 1 raman spectroscopy nanofinder 30 tokyo instruments with a laser wavelength of 632 8 nm was used to characterize the carbon structure of the acnfs 2 3 photoelectrochemical degradation of orange ii and smt a 500 ml solution of 10 ppm orange ii was prepared as the azo dye artificial wastewater the prepared solution was transferred to a reaction vessel and the ph was adjusted in the range of 2 9 using sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide smt artificial wastewater was prepared by the same method as that used for the azo dye to carry out pec reactions the electrospun yfonfs and acnfs were used as the anode and cathode respectively in an undivided reaction system which were electrically connected to a dc power supply psm 6003 gw instek the reaction area for the two electrodes was 4 4 cm and the distance between them was maintained at 3 cm a uv lamp g8t5 8 w 254 nm was vertically placed between the electrodes as the light source for the reaction system which was enclosed in a dark box to avoid interference from other light sources in addition a circulating water system was introduced to maintain the required reaction temperature a schematic diagram of the undivided pec system is shown in fig 1a to investigate the individual contributions of the yfonf and acnf electrodes a divided reaction system that separated the two electrodes through a nafion membrane was applied in addition each electrode compartment was introduced using a vertically placed uv lamp except for the above all the peripheral devices were the same as those used in the undivided system a schematic diagram of the divided system is shown in fig 1b for water analysis 2 ml of treated orange ii solution was collected at each time interval during the pec treatments and analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy dr3900 hach analysis of the treated smt solution followed the same procedure as that of the orange ii solution except for the analysis device high performance liquid chromatography hplc dad 5430 pump 5110 hitachi the smt sample solution for analysis was 0 01 ml the flow rate of the mobile phase comprising acetonitrile and deionized di water was 1 0 ml min 1 calibration was performed prior to the analysis to ensure experimental accuracy therefore the concentrations of the treated orange ii and smt solutions were determined based on their calibration curves in addition re was introduced to examine the degradation of target pollutants which is defined as follows 1 re c 0 v 0 c t v t c 0 v 0 where c 0 represents the initial concentration of the target pollutant c t is the pollutant concentration at arbitrary time t during the pec treatment v 0 is the initial volume of the test solution and v t is the volume of the test solution at arbitrary time t during the pec treatment additionally specific energy consumption sec was used to evaluate the degradation of the pollutants from the viewpoint of electrical energy consumption this was obtained using the following equation 2 sec i u d t c 0 v 0 c t v t 3 6 where i and u are the applied current and voltage respectively t is the treatment time and c 0 c t v 0 and v t are defined as in eq 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization of electrospun yfonfs and acnfs sem images of the morphologies of the as prepared electrospun yfonfs under various operating conditions are shown in fig 2 the operating conditions had a significant influence on the size shape and compactness of the nanofibers with a low pvp concentration 0 04 g ml 1 nanofibers with uneven size were formed and they tangled together to form a compact structure fig 2a when the concentration was increased to 0 06 g ml 1 the nanofibers exhibited a uniform size with a diameter of approximately 20 nm and they were moderately stacked forming a porous structure fig 2b however more nodules occurred together with the nanofibers as the pvp concentration was further increased fig 2c which resulted in irregular size shape and structure of the electrospun material the estimated average sizes of samples y1 y2 and y3 were 170 209 and 484 nm respectively the nanofibers fabricated with a lower feed flow rate 0 01 ml min 1 tended to have a curved structure with intertwined fibers fig 2d which was different from that of 0 03 ml min 1 fig 2b conversely a higher flow rate aided in forming a membrane like structure with some voids inside rather than stacking nanofibers fig 2e in addition either shorter fig 2f or longer fig 2g tcd resulted in the formation of uneven sized nanofibers where partial fracture of thinner fibers was observed the estimated average sizes of y4 y5 y6 and y7 were 371 323 261 and 280 nm respectively none of those conditions can form nanofibers as small as that of y2 the applied voltage directly influenced the size of the resultant nanofibers although a lower voltage 15 kv led to the formation of larger sized fibers 283 nm fig 2h y8 a higher voltage 25 kv led to smaller fibers 101 nm fig 2i y9 when increasing the voltage associated with the electrical field to a certain extent the ejection speed of the polymeric solution was substantially increased resulting in the unstable and vigorous whipping of the taylor cone consequently smaller sized fibers with a fractured structure formed the opposite is true for the case with a lower voltage overall a moderate pvp concentration feed flow rate tcd and applied voltage would contribute to a continuous and stable taylor cone ejected from the needle as a result favorable formation and distribution of uniform nanofibers with an adequate size was achieved as observed in fig 2b similar morphological analysis was carried out for the as prepared electrospun acnfs see fig s1 the estimated average sizes of the nanofibers were 128 194 327 251 162 137 258 and 379 nm for a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 and a8 respectively the result shows that favorable formation and distribution of uniform nanofibers can be obtained using pan concentration of 0 07 g ml 1 feed flow rate of 0 03 ml min 1 tcd of 15 cm and applied voltage of 25 v fig s1b a2 additionally the average size of acnfs obtained at this optimal condition was similar to that of y2 a dense and porous structure comprising typical yfonfs was further confirmed in a wide area sem image fig 3a where curved nanofibers longer than 5 μm intermingled together with some nodules despite a slight difference the size and distribution of the nanofibers were uniform the layer by layer deposition of the nanofibers during electrospinning compacted the yfonf structure producing a larger contact surface area with the outer medium fig 3b shows the xrd pattern of a typical yfonf several diffraction peaks can be identified with moderate peak intensities reflecting its well crystallized character the xrd pattern matched well with that of the standard one jcpds card no 39 1489 without a second phase indicating that the as prepared yfonfs consisted of a pure orthorhombic phase rather than a hexagonal phase this is consistent with a previously reported result 22 the above evidence supports the successful fabrication of fiber type crystalline yfo without impurity phases as for the acnf material properties a wide area sem image shows that the curved nanofibers were well stacked forming a porous structure which is conducive to infiltration of the liquid electrolyte fig s2a in fig s2b the xrd pattern confirms the amorphous structure for the acnfs additionally in all the raman spectra of acnfs calcined at different temperatures fig s2c f the characteristic bands i e the d and g bands at approximately 1350 and 1580 cm 1 respectively are identified the g band is subjected to the e2g symmetric vibration mode which is associated with the ordered sp2 carbon bonding of graphitic carbon conversely the d band denotes disorder induced vibration resulting from defects in the lattice structure 23 the intensity ratio of the d to g band i d i g is usually used as an index for determining the degree of graphitization of carbonaceous materials the i d i g ratios for the samples calcined at 600 700 800 and 900 c were 1 35 1 55 1 69 and 3 16 respectively it is indicated that the nanofibers calcined at 900 c had the most profound graphitic structure among the samples corresponding to a higher electrical conductivity 3 2 photoelectrochemical degradation of orange ii and smt to clarify the individual contribution of the yfonf anode and the acnf cathode to the degradation of the target pollutant a divided reaction system was applied to treat the artificial wastewater of orange ii fig 4a shows the re of orange ii over time for the yfonf anode and the acnf cathode the re values of the two electrodes increased with increasing time with similar trends notably the anode exhibited a higher re than the cathode over this time range the anode reached an re of approximately 76 at 60 min whereas the cathode reached approximately 49 this finding reveals that both electrodes contributed to the degradation of orange ii but the yfonf anode had an effect superior to that of the acnf cathode because of the photoelectrogenerated hydroxyl radicals oh 21 which can be represented as follows 3 yfeo 3 hν uv yfeo 3 e cb h vb 4 yfeo 3 yfeo 3 h vb e 5 yfeo 3 h vb h 2 o yfeo 3 h oh conversely the photoelectron fenton process occurring at the cathode 24 where the generation of oh is promoted see eqs 6 8 is considered the reason for the cathodic degradation 6 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 hν uv 2 oh 8 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh degradation of the target pollutant can therefore follow the reaction below 9 oh pollutants degradation products the degradation pathway of orange ii can be referred to the previously reported one 25 proposing that the degradation process is initiated by cleavage of the cn bond owing to the oxidative attack of oh different cathode materials were also compared in terms of orange ii degradation and the results are shown in fig 4b it is clear that acnfs present the best re followed by active carbon cloth acc iron and aluminum acnfs and acc are more effective as cathode materials in treating the target pollutant compared to metal plates which can be ascribed to their fibrous and porous structure with a higher contact surface area furthermore acnfs have a larger surface area than acc because of their nanofibrous features thus presenting the best re fig 5a shows the degradation of orange ii in an undivided reaction system using different applied voltages the re increased with time and applied voltage and it reached approximately 85 at 60 min under an applied voltage of 25 v this is not surprising because a higher applied voltage can facilitate electrochemical reactions with a larger driving force it is worth noting that the re of the undivided system was higher than that of either the anode or the cathode in the divided system under the same applied voltage this suggests that a synergetic effect of anodic photoelectrocatalytic oxidation and cathodic photoelectron fenton reactions was induced in the undivided system in light of this all the following discussions focus on the undivided system in addition adsorption effect of the nanofibers was examined using the same reaction system in the dark box without applying current and light the result shows that re of approximately 10 was contributed by nanofibers adsorption at 60 min see fig s3a indicating that the adsorption effect was not significant and approximately 75 of the pollutant was degraded considering the energy consumption the influence of the applied voltage on sec is summarized in fig 5b compared to the slight increase in re sec remarkably increased over 20 v manifesting inefficient treatment at 25 v considering the re and sec 20 v was therefore the optimum applied voltage in this case the undivided reaction system was also effective in treating smt and the influence of the applied voltage on the re of smt was similar to that of orange ii see fig 5c besides contribution of nanofibers adsorption to re was less significant during the treatment as can be seen in fig s3b using the highest voltage of 30 v resulted in the highest re of approximately 88 at 90 min whereas it otherwise consumed a relatively high energy a much higher sec as shown in fig 5d therefore an optimum voltage of 25 v was determined by considering the re and sec for degrading smt the influence of different concentrations of the supporting electrolyte na2so4 on the degradation of the target pollutants was investigated and the results are shown in fig 6a and b the electrolyte concentration did not have a notable influence on the time course of re whereas a medium concentration of 7 mm exhibited the highest re of approximately 81 and 83 for orange ii and smt respectively increasing the electrolyte concentration can increase the ionic conductivity however excess so4 2 ions may otherwise slow the degradation effect by scavenging oh and forming undesired complexes with fe2 fe3 ions 26 consequently a medium electrolyte concentration was favored to enhance degradation performance fig 6c and d show the influence of feso4 concentration on the pollutant degradation performance and a medium value of 0 75 mm was found to contribute the highest re for orange ii and smt this is because the increased fe2 ion concentration can expedite the fenton process leading to favorable pollutant degradation however the following reaction between fe2 ions and oh would also be promoted when excess fe2 ions are present which has an adverse impact on pollutant degradation 27 10 fe 2 oh fe 3 oh the effect of temperature on the pec system was also studied and the results are summarized in fig 7 the degradation performances for orange ii fig 7a and smt fig 7b were similar revealing increased re with increasing temperature up to 30 c for orange ii and 35 c for smt however as the temperature was further increased to 40 c the re for both pollutants decreased ionic velocity can be enhanced by increasing the temperature 28 which contributes to improved electromigration and electroosmosis of a treatment system as a result the highest re was attained at temperatures of 30 c and 35 c for orange ii and smt respectively conversely when the temperature is too high h2o2 formed in the photoelectron fenton process tends to decompose into o2 and h2o thus reducing the generation of oh this may be the reason for the reduced re at 40 c fig 8 shows the effect of ph on the degradation of the target pollutants the re of orange ii decreased with increasing ph reaching the highest re at ph 3 fig 8a this is because fe2 ions are rapidly oxidized to form fe3 ions at higher ph which reduces the generation of oh during the fenton process 29 a similar result was confirmed for smt fig 8b demonstrating that re at ph 3 was higher than that at ph values above 3 however further decreasing the ph to 2 did not lead to a higher re under these conditions h2o2 reacted with h instead of fe2 according to the following reaction 11 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 consequently less oh was generated through the fenton process resulting in reduced degradation performance to further study the reaction kinetics of the degradation of the target pollutants the reaction of eq 9 is considered here it is supposed that oh can be iteratively generated through the pec process therefore the concentration of oh would be much higher than that of the pollutants at any moment in this regard the rate equation for the pollutants denoted as p can be derived as follows 12 d c p d t k c p m where c p is the concentration of pollutants t is time k is the rate constant for pollutant degradation and m is the corresponding reaction order in addition the kinetic reaction model was established by applying pseudo first order and pseudo second order rate equations that is m was set equal to 1 and 2 in eq 12 respectively accordingly the integration forms for the two cases can be expressed as follows pseudo first order 13 ln c p t c p 0 k t pseudo second order 14 1 c p t 1 c p 0 k t where c p 0 and c p t denote the initial pollutant concentration and its concentration at an arbitrary time t respectively during pec treatment fig 9 displays the degradation kinetics for orange ii fig 9a b and smt fig 9c d herein the first 10 min of treatment is considered the dominant degradation process during the pec treatment therefore it was the focus of this study the circles and dotted lines represent the experimental and fitting results respectively the experimental data for orange ii well match the fitting line based on the pseudo first order model fig 9a with a high coefficient of determination r2 of 0 99 which is superior to that of the pseudo second order model fig 9b with an r2 of 0 95 similar results were obtained for smt revealing r2 values of 0 99 and 0 95 for the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models respectively the results indicate that the degradation kinetics of the target pollutants well follow the pseudo first order model for which single molecule reactions are dominant rather than molecular collisions this is probably because the pollutant molecules near the electrodes immediately reacted with the photoelectrogenerated oh leading to rapid structural decomposition of the pollutants in this regard degradation owing to the interactions between pollutant molecules may be less significant 21 4 conclusions perovskite yfonf and acnf electrodes were successfully fabricated using electrospinning technology optimizing the polymer concentration feed flow rate tcd and applied voltage during the electrospinning process aided in the formation of nanofibers with a regular shape uniform size distribution and compactness a pec system involving the electrospun yfonfs and acnfs as the anode and cathode respectively enabled the effective degradation of both azo dye orange ii and the emerging pollutant smt regarding the treatment in a divided system the yfonf anode exhibited superior degradation capability over the target pollutant compared to the acnf cathode owing to the promoted photoelectrogenerated oh conversely the photoelectron fenton process dominated the cathodic degradation a synergetic effect of anodic photoelectrocatalytic oxidation and cathodic photoelectron fenton reactions was achieved using an undivided system reaching a higher re for the pollutants ideal applied voltages of 20 and 25 v were determined for treating orange ii and smt respectively by considering re and sec in addition optimal ion concentrations 7 mm na2so4 and 0 75 mm feso4 and temperature 30 c for orange ii and 35 c for smt at ph 3 benefited the generation of oh corresponding to the improved degradation performance of the target pollutants furthermore the degradation kinetics of the pollutants followed a proposed pseudo first order model rather than a pseudo second order model indicating that single molecule reactions

carbon structure of the acnfs 2 3 photoelectrochemical degradation of orange ii and smt a 500 ml solution of 10 ppm orange ii was prepared as the azo dye artificial wastewater the prepared solution was transferred to a reaction vessel and the ph was adjusted in the range of 2 9 using sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide smt artificial wastewater was prepared by the same method as that used for the azo dye to carry out pec reactions the electrospun yfonfs and acnfs were used as the anode and cathode respectively in an undivided reaction system which were electrically connected to a dc power supply psm 6003 gw instek the reaction area for the two electrodes was 4 4 cm and the distance between them was maintained at 3 cm a uv lamp g8t5 8 w 254 nm was vertically placed between the electrodes as the light source for the reaction system which was enclosed in a dark box to avoid interference from other light sources in addition a circulating water system was introduced to maintain the required reaction temperature a schematic diagram of the undivided pec system is shown in fig 1a to investigate the individual contributions of the yfonf and acnf electrodes a divided reaction system that separated the two electrodes through a nafion membrane was applied in addition each electrode compartment was introduced using a vertically placed uv lamp except for the above all the peripheral devices were the same as those used in the undivided system a schematic diagram of the divided system is shown in fig 1b for water analysis 2 ml of treated orange ii solution was collected at each time interval during the pec treatments and analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy dr3900 hach analysis of the treated smt solution followed the same procedure as that of the orange ii solution except for the analysis device high performance liquid chromatography hplc dad 5430 pump 5110 hitachi the smt sample solution for analysis was 0 01 ml the flow rate of the mobile phase comprising acetonitrile and deionized di water was 1 0 ml min 1 calibration was performed prior to the analysis to ensure experimental accuracy therefore the concentrations of the treated orange ii and smt solutions were determined based on their calibration curves in addition re was introduced to examine the degradation of target pollutants which is defined as follows 1 re c 0 v 0 c t v t c 0 v 0 where c 0 represents the initial concentration of the target pollutant c t is the pollutant concentration at arbitrary time t during the pec treatment v 0 is the initial volume of the test solution and v t is the volume of the test solution at arbitrary time t during the pec treatment additionally specific energy consumption sec was used to evaluate the degradation of the pollutants from the viewpoint of electrical energy consumption this was obtained using the following equation 2 sec i u d t c 0 v 0 c t v t 3 6 where i and u are the applied current and voltage respectively t is the treatment time and c 0 c t v 0 and v t are defined as in eq 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization of electrospun yfonfs and acnfs sem images of the morphologies of the as prepared electrospun yfonfs under various operating conditions are shown in fig 2 the operating conditions had a significant influence on the size shape and compactness of the nanofibers with a low pvp concentration 0 04 g ml 1 nanofibers with uneven size were formed and they tangled together to form a compact structure fig 2a when the concentration was increased to 0 06 g ml 1 the nanofibers exhibited a uniform size with a diameter of approximately 20 nm and they were moderately stacked forming a porous structure fig 2b however more nodules occurred together with the nanofibers as the pvp concentration was further increased fig 2c which resulted in irregular size shape and structure of the electrospun material the estimated average sizes of samples y1 y2 and y3 were 170 209 and 484 nm respectively the nanofibers fabricated with a lower feed flow rate 0 01 ml min 1 tended to have a curved structure with intertwined fibers fig 2d which was different from that of 0 03 ml min 1 fig 2b conversely a higher flow rate aided in forming a membrane like structure with some voids inside rather than stacking nanofibers fig 2e in addition either shorter fig 2f or longer fig 2g tcd resulted in the formation of uneven sized nanofibers where partial fracture of thinner fibers was observed the estimated average sizes of y4 y5 y6 and y7 were 371 323 261 and 280 nm respectively none of those conditions can form nanofibers as small as that of y2 the applied voltage directly influenced the size of the resultant nanofibers although a lower voltage 15 kv led to the formation of larger sized fibers 283 nm fig 2h y8 a higher voltage 25 kv led to smaller fibers 101 nm fig 2i y9 when increasing the voltage associated with the electrical field to a certain extent the ejection speed of the polymeric solution was substantially increased resulting in the unstable and vigorous whipping of the taylor cone consequently smaller sized fibers with a fractured structure formed the opposite is true for the case with a lower voltage overall a moderate pvp concentration feed flow rate tcd and applied voltage would contribute to a continuous and stable taylor cone ejected from the needle as a result favorable formation and distribution of uniform nanofibers with an adequate size was achieved as observed in fig 2b similar morphological analysis was carried out for the as prepared electrospun acnfs see fig s1 the estimated average sizes of the nanofibers were 128 194 327 251 162 137 258 and 379 nm for a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 and a8 respectively the result shows that favorable formation and distribution of uniform nanofibers can be obtained using pan concentration of 0 07 g ml 1 feed flow rate of 0 03 ml min 1 tcd of 15 cm and applied voltage of 25 v fig s1b a2 additionally the average size of acnfs obtained at this optimal condition was similar to that of y2 a dense and porous structure comprising typical yfonfs was further confirmed in a wide area sem image fig 3a where curved nanofibers longer than 5 μm intermingled together with some nodules despite a slight difference the size and distribution of the nanofibers were uniform the layer by layer deposition of the nanofibers during electrospinning compacted the yfonf structure producing a larger contact surface area with the outer medium fig 3b shows the xrd pattern of a typical yfonf several diffraction peaks can be identified with moderate peak intensities reflecting its well crystallized character the xrd pattern matched well with that of the standard one jcpds card no 39 1489 without a second phase indicating that the as prepared yfonfs consisted of a pure orthorhombic phase rather than a hexagonal phase this is consistent with a previously reported result 22 the above evidence supports the successful fabrication of fiber type crystalline yfo without impurity phases as for the acnf material properties a wide area sem image shows that the curved nanofibers were well stacked forming a porous structure which is conducive to infiltration of the liquid electrolyte fig s2a in fig s2b the xrd pattern confirms the amorphous structure for the acnfs additionally in all the raman spectra of acnfs calcined at different temperatures fig s2c f the characteristic bands i e the d and g bands at approximately 1350 and 1580 cm 1 respectively are identified the g band is subjected to the e2g symmetric vibration mode which is associated with the ordered sp2 carbon bonding of graphitic carbon conversely the d band denotes disorder induced vibration resulting from defects in the lattice structure 23 the intensity ratio of the d to g band i d i g is usually used as an index for determining the degree of graphitization of carbonaceous materials the i d i g ratios for the samples calcined at 600 700 800 and 900 c were 1 35 1 55 1 69 and 3 16 respectively it is indicated that the nanofibers calcined at 900 c had the most profound graphitic structure among the samples corresponding to a higher electrical conductivity 3 2 photoelectrochemical degradation of orange ii and smt to clarify the individual contribution of the yfonf anode and the acnf cathode to the degradation of the target pollutant a divided reaction system was applied to treat the artificial wastewater of orange ii fig 4a shows the re of orange ii over time for the yfonf anode and the acnf cathode the re values of the two electrodes increased with increasing time with similar trends notably the anode exhibited a higher re than the cathode over this time range the anode reached an re of approximately 76 at 60 min whereas the cathode reached approximately 49 this finding reveals that both electrodes contributed to the degradation of orange ii but the yfonf anode had an effect superior to that of the acnf cathode because of the photoelectrogenerated hydroxyl radicals oh 21 which can be represented as follows 3 yfeo 3 hν uv yfeo 3 e cb h vb 4 yfeo 3 yfeo 3 h vb e 5 yfeo 3 h vb h 2 o yfeo 3 h oh conversely the photoelectron fenton process occurring at the cathode 24 where the generation of oh is promoted see eqs 6 8 is considered the reason for the cathodic degradation 6 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 hν uv 2 oh 8 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh degradation of the target pollutant can therefore follow the reaction below 9 oh pollutants degradation products the degradation pathway of orange ii can be referred to the previously reported one 25 proposing that the degradation process is initiated by cleavage of the cn bond owing to the oxidative attack of oh different cathode materials were also compared in terms of orange ii degradation and the results are shown in fig 4b it is clear that acnfs present the best re followed by active carbon cloth acc iron and aluminum acnfs and acc are more effective as cathode materials in treating the target pollutant compared to metal plates which can be ascribed to their fibrous and porous structure with a higher contact surface area furthermore acnfs have a larger surface area than acc because of their nanofibrous features thus presenting the best re fig 5a shows the degradation of orange ii in an undivided reaction system using different applied voltages the re increased with time and applied voltage and it reached approximately 85 at 60 min under an applied voltage of 25 v this is not surprising because a higher applied voltage can facilitate electrochemical reactions with a larger driving force it is worth noting that the re of the undivided system was higher than that of either the anode or the cathode in the divided system under the same applied voltage this suggests that a synergetic effect of anodic photoelectrocatalytic oxidation and cathodic photoelectron fenton reactions was induced in the undivided system in light of this all the following discussions focus on the undivided system in addition adsorption effect of the nanofibers was examined using the same reaction system in the dark box without applying current and light the result shows that re of approximately 10 was contributed by nanofibers adsorption at 60 min see fig s3a indicating that the adsorption effect was not significant and approximately 75 of the pollutant was degraded considering the energy consumption the influence of the applied voltage on sec is summarized in fig 5b compared to the slight increase in re sec remarkably increased over 20 v manifesting inefficient treatment at 25 v considering the re and sec 20 v was therefore the optimum applied voltage in this case the undivided reaction system was also effective in treating smt and the influence of the applied voltage on the re of smt was similar to that of orange ii see fig 5c besides contribution of nanofibers adsorption to re was less significant during the treatment as can be seen in fig s3b using the highest voltage of 30 v resulted in the highest re of approximately 88 at 90 min whereas it otherwise consumed a relatively high energy a much higher sec as shown in fig 5d therefore an optimum voltage of 25 v was determined by considering the re and sec for degrading smt the influence of different concentrations of the supporting electrolyte na2so4 on the degradation of the target pollutants was investigated and the results are shown in fig 6a and b the electrolyte concentration did not have a notable influence on the time course of re whereas a medium concentration of 7 mm exhibited the highest re of approximately 81 and 83 for orange ii and smt respectively increasing the electrolyte concentration can increase the ionic conductivity however excess so4 2 ions may otherwise slow the degradation effect by scavenging oh and forming undesired complexes with fe2 fe3 ions 26 consequently a medium electrolyte concentration was favored to enhance degradation performance fig 6c and d show the influence of feso4 concentration on the pollutant degradation performance and a medium value of 0 75 mm was found to contribute the highest re for orange ii and smt this is because the increased fe2 ion concentration can expedite the fenton process leading to favorable pollutant degradation however the following reaction between fe2 ions and oh would also be promoted when excess fe2 ions are present which has an adverse impact on pollutant degradation 27 10 fe 2 oh fe 3 oh the effect of temperature on the pec system was also studied and the results are summarized in fig 7 the degradation performances for orange ii fig 7a and smt fig 7b were similar revealing increased re with increasing temperature up to 30 c for orange ii and 35 c for smt however as the temperature was further increased to 40 c the re for both pollutants decreased ionic velocity can be enhanced by increasing the temperature 28 which contributes to improved electromigration and electroosmosis of a treatment system as a result the highest re was attained at temperatures of 30 c and 35 c for orange ii and smt respectively conversely when the temperature is too high h2o2 formed in the photoelectron fenton process tends to decompose into o2 and h2o thus reducing the generation of oh this may be the reason for the reduced re at 40 c fig 8 shows the effect of ph on the degradation of the target pollutants the re of orange ii decreased with increasing ph reaching the highest re at ph 3 fig 8a this is because fe2 ions are rapidly oxidized to form fe3 ions at higher ph which reduces the generation of oh during the fenton process 29 a similar result was confirmed for smt fig 8b demonstrating that re at ph 3 was higher than that at ph values above 3 however further decreasing the ph to 2 did not lead to a higher re under these conditions h2o2 reacted with h instead of fe2 according to the following reaction 11 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 consequently less oh was generated through the fenton process resulting in reduced degradation performance to further study the reaction kinetics of the degradation of the target pollutants the reaction of eq 9 is considered here it is supposed that oh can be iteratively generated through the pec process therefore the concentration of oh would be much higher than that of the pollutants at any moment in this regard the rate equation for the pollutants denoted as p can be derived as follows 12 d c p d t k c p m where c p is the concentration of pollutants t is time k is the rate constant for pollutant degradation and m is the corresponding reaction order in addition the kinetic reaction model was established by applying pseudo first order and pseudo second order rate equations that is m was set equal to 1 and 2 in eq 12 respectively accordingly the integration forms for the two cases can be expressed as follows pseudo first order 13 ln c p t c p 0 k t pseudo second order 14 1 c p t 1 c p 0 k t where c p 0 and c p t denote the initial pollutant concentration and its concentration at an arbitrary time t respectively during pec treatment fig 9 displays the degradation kinetics for orange ii fig 9a b and smt fig 9c d herein the first 10 min of treatment is considered the dominant degradation process during the pec treatment therefore it was the focus of this study the circles and dotted lines represent the experimental and fitting results respectively the experimental data for orange ii well match the fitting line based on the pseudo first order model fig 9a with a high coefficient of determination r2 of 0 99 which is superior to that of the pseudo second order model fig 9b with an r2 of 0 95 similar results were obtained for smt revealing r2 values of 0 99 and 0 95 for the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models respectively the results indicate that the degradation kinetics of the target pollutants well follow the pseudo first order model for which single molecule reactions are dominant rather than molecular collisions this is probably because the pollutant molecules near the electrodes immediately reacted with the photoelectrogenerated oh leading to rapid structural decomposition of the pollutants in this regard degradation owing to the interactions between pollutant molecules may be less significant 21 4 conclusions perovskite yfonf and acnf electrodes were successfully fabricated using electrospinning technology optimizing the polymer concentration feed flow rate tcd and applied voltage during the electrospinning process aided in the formation of nanofibers with a regular shape uniform size distribution and compactness a pec system involving the electrospun yfonfs and acnfs as the anode and cathode respectively enabled the effective degradation of both azo dye orange ii and the emerging pollutant smt regarding the treatment in a divided system the yfonf anode exhibited superior degradation capability over the target pollutant compared to the acnf cathode owing to the promoted photoelectrogenerated oh conversely the photoelectron fenton process dominated the cathodic degradation a synergetic effect of anodic photoelectrocatalytic oxidation and cathodic photoelectron fenton reactions was achieved using an undivided system reaching a higher re for the pollutants ideal applied voltages of 20 and 25 v were determined for treating orange ii and smt respectively by considering re and sec in addition optimal ion concentrations 7 mm na2so4 and 0 75 mm feso4 and temperature 30 c for orange ii and 35 c for smt at ph 3 benefited the generation of oh corresponding to the improved degradation performance of the target pollutants furthermore the degradation kinetics of the pollutants followed a proposed pseudo first order model rather than a pseudo second order model indicating that single molecule reactions

13006,biocompatibility of titanium ti and recycling of the coagulated sludge to produce functional nanoparticles make the popularization of ti based coagulants highly attractive slow alkaline titration sat method was commonly used to synthesize polytitanium coagulants but cannot control the formation of dominant flocculation species due to the fast hydrolysis we propose the innovative preparation of ti based coagulants by electrodialysis ed to control the directional transfer of electrons and regulate the rate of the micro interface reaction an efficient polytitanium chloride ptc was successfully prepared by ed method with ticl4 as precursor denoted as e ptc results from electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry esi tof ms proved the generation of the ti based hydroxyl polymers with various degrees of polymerization benefiting from the controllable migration of ions during ed process the predominant ti based species changed from the small median polymers to the large ones with increasing ed period this was evidenced by ti ferron assay that high tib 34 35 and tic 47 05 fractions were obtained in e ptc after 8 h of ed period the resulting e ptc had stronger coagulation capability for both surface water and municipal wastewater treatment than the conventional ones compared with the conventional al based and fe based coagulants e ptc achieved 15

polytitanium chloride electrodialysis electrospray ionization mass spectrum sludge properties 1 introduction coagulation flocculation has become a cost effective and established pretreatment strategy in water wastewater treatment systems 1 2 the application of common al based and fe based coagulants inevitably generates some issues such as the toxicity of residual al the unacceptable color of residual fe and the difficulty of sludge disposal 3 5 the novel ti based coagulants make up for these drawbacks with the most outstanding merit of sludge recovery as value added photocatalysts 6 7 besides ti based coagulants have superior or at least comparable coagulation capability in comparison with traditional al and fe based salts 8 9 high efficient removal of organic matter was accompanied by large floc size fast growth rate and quick sludge sedimentation 10 11 abundant reserves of ti based salts and their biocompatibility further make their popularization highly attractive 12 13 recently ti based coagulants from single ti based salts to inorganic polymeric salts from unitary compound to composite salts have been paid considerable attention 14 16 inorganic polymer flocculants especially polytitanium chloride ptc have been extensively studied because of their strong water purification capability low dosage and wide applicable ph ranges 4 17 18 our previous study has firstly prepared ptc with different basicity b values by slow alkaline titration sat method 18 however owing to the extremely rapid hydrolysis rate of ti based salts 19 this alkaline polymerization method could not precisely adjust the micro interfacial process of hydrolysis and polymerization between ti4 and hydroxyl groups oh resulting in the difficulty of controlling ti based species distribution these hydrolyzates with high efficient floccualtion capability are the key to determining the coagulation performance 20 currently a challenge is to establish a simple and accurate synthesis method to control the hydrolysis polymerization process in order to obtain ptc rich with advantageous flocculation species electrochemical method is capable of controlling the directional transfer of electrons and regulating the rate and efficiency of the microinterface process 21 among which the electrochemical synthesis of polyaluminum chloride pac has attracted widespread attention two categories of electrochemical process to synthetic pac involve i sacrificial metallic anode electrolysis and ii electrodialysis ed the former however is not suitable for the preparation of ptc because ti belongs to valve type metal and can immediately form a non conductive oxide layer on the exposed surface when it is used as an anode material 22 resulting in a rapid increase in resistance the latter has been utilized to obtain synthesize valuable pac with high content of optimal hydrolyzates species through the directional transfer and precise regulation of electrons 23 24 theoretically the ed method of preparing pac can be used as a prototype for the preparation of polytitanium flocculant based on the principle of selective permeability of the ion exchange membrane and water splitting this process enables the titanium tetrachloride ticl4 solution to be gradually alkalized to obtain pure ptc products it is expected to precisely control the microreaction process between ti4 and oh to obtain hydrolysates with optimal flocculation capability here in this study the ed reactor included three chambers anode chamber reaction chamber and cathode chamber which were divided by anion exchange membranes under the action of direct current the oh of the cathode chamber entered the reaction chamber through anion exchange membrane by regulating the yield and output of the oh to gradually alkalize ticl4 solution herein the hydrolysis rate of ti based species was expected to be controlled by the injection rate and injection amount of oh by control of current intensity and ed period meanwhile the cl in the reaction chamber migrated to the anode chamber through the anion exchange membrane on the anode side consequently a migration channel of anions was constituted in the entire ed system which made it possible to synthesize ptc rich with stable dominant hydrolysis species aims of this study were to i synthesize the ptc rich with the dominant species of flocculation by ed process named e ptc ii characterize the e ptc in terms of basicity b value and zeta potential especially the identification of the hydrolyzed ti based species using electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry esi tof ms and ti ferron assay iii evaluate the coagulation behavior and sludge properties of e ptc for surface water sw and municipal wastewater mw treatment both mechanisms of e ptc preparation and its coagulation were included 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ptc by electrodialysis the ptc was prepared by ed method and the schematic view of apparatus was illustrated in fig s1 the electrochemical system mainly consisted of a dc power supply krp 3005 db zhaoxin china and a three compartment ed reactor made of organic glass with an outer dimension of each single tank of 40 mm length 80 mm width 80 mm height i e 50 ml of effective volume homogeneous anion exchange membranes hmed 0510 3 hangzhou huamo technology co ltd china were selected as the ion exchange membrane in this experiment and graphite rods 6 mm 100 mm with a high purity of 99 9 were utilized as cathode and anode materials sodium sulfate na2so4 0 50 m and sodium chloride nacl 0 50 m were used as anolyte and catholyte respectively a certain concentration of ticl4 was chosen as the solution of the reaction chamber in which a magnetic stirrer ms 500 intllab china was used to vigorously stir to promote the polymerization of ti4 and oh and reduce concentration polarization the ed process worked in a constant current mode and the e ptcs ptcs prepared by ed were prepared by controlling reaction period of 2 4 6 and 8 h with the products being named as e2 ptc e4 ptc e6 ptc and e8 ptc respectively after the reaction was completed the electrolytes were analyzed for cl concentration conductivity and ph using ion chromatograph ics 900 thermofisher scientific usa conductivity meter sevencompact s230 mettler toledo instruments china and ph meter phs3c leici china respectively 2 2 characterization of e ptcs 2 2 1 esi tof ms esi tof ms was employed to detect the hydrolysates of e ptc coagulants to avoid contamination of the instrument the obtained e ptcs were diluted in deionized water to get a solution with a concentration of 0 01 mol l before measurement 18 the spectra were recorded with a liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight 1290 infinity ii g6545b agilent usa equipped with an electrospray ionization source with positive ion mode the diluted coagulant products were injected into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min the instrument parameters were as followed nozzle voltage 500 v gas temperature 325 c gas flow rate 12 l min mass range 50 1000 the peaks with strong response intensity representing the specific ti based hydroxyl polymers were chosen for the esi tof ms study 2 2 2 ferron assay the ti based species were measured by ti ferron time spectrophotometry assay wherein the hydrolyzed ti based species were analyzed based on the difference of the dissociation and reaction kinetic between hydrolyzed ti based species and ferron reagent the timed absorbance measurements at 370 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810pc persee china were carried out within 1 min and monitored for further 400 min to complete the reaction between ti based species and ferron three fractions of ti based species could be defined as tia tib and tic corresponding to the monomeric polymers reacted within 1 min the medium polymers reacted from 1 to 400 min and the larger polymers or sol gels non reacted respectively tic was calculated by subtracting tia and tib from the total ti tit 2 2 3 basicity and zeta potential the b value can be measured via the titrimetric method based on the principle of oh ti molar ratio which mainly involved i the quantities of ti4 determined by the complexation reaction between ti4 and kf solution and ii the quantities of oh determined by the neutralization reaction between oh and hcl detailed analytical procedures are provided in the supporting information s2 zeta potential of the e ptcs was investigated using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instrument uk each value was measured for at least three times and the results shall be averaged to narrow the error 2 3 electrochemical characterization cyclic voltammetry

room temperature experiments were carried out in a three electrode system containing na2so4 solution where the graphite electrode used in this study served as the working electrode and the platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the counter and reference electrode respectively chronopotentiometry cp was performed in the designed ed device to monitor the potential change the anode was connected to the working electrode and the cathode was connected to the counter and reference electrode 2 4 jar test two kinds of water samples were utilized surface water sw from jiazi

the distribution of ti based species in e ptc solutions according to the different mass to charge ratio m z detected in mass spectra fig 1 the abundance of ti based hydroxyl polymers could be observed from the relative ion intensity of m z signals polymerization degree and the probable molecular formula of the hydrolyzed ti based species were calculated using python software according to the general formula of tixoy oh zcln h2o m 4x 2y z n 18 with the results being summarized in table s3 for the mass spectra of ticl4 e2 ptc and e6 ptc the main signals were almost the same fig 1 the signal at m z 132 ti5 ti6 cores dominated their spectra with an intensity of 100 whereas the most intensive signal for e8 ptc spectra appeared at the signal at m z 541 ti9 ti18 cores zhao et al 18 has reported that the ti based species could be classified into four categories including ti1 ti2 monomer and dimer ti3 ti8 small polymer ti9 ti16 median polymer and ti17 and above large polymer when the ed period reached 8 h the signal intensity of the small and median polymeric species with m z 134 150 and 320 decreased by 20 30 in comparison to ticl4 and the signals at m z 279 and 322 vanished table s2 the polymerization degree of ti based species gradually increased with the transformation of the dominant ti based species to large polymers as the electrolysis period increased as reflected by the appearance of the large polymers at m z 611 617 633 684 758 and 763 at 2 h and the gradual increase of the signal intensity besides compared with ticl4 case the signals intensity at m z 359 610 615 and 689 of e8 ptc apparently increased by 30 45 the median and large polymeric ti based complexes were the main signals in e8 ptc solution additionally a few signals at m z values 64 27 01 and 91 21 47 were detected in the spectra of ticl4 which were speculated to be monomers dimers and small polymers ti1 ti2 and ti4 according to zhao et al 18 the ed process weakened the ion strength of these signals 3 1 2 ferron assay based on the assumption that hydroxyl ti based species have various reaction periods with ferron reagent three categories of ti based hydroxyl polymers mononuclear tia reactive polynuclear tib and high polymers tic can be distinguished by ti ferron assay fig s2 showed the curves of the ti ferron reaction kinetics with the results revealing that an initial sharp increase in absorbance that become almost flat over a long period of time generally the reaction between tia tib and ferron was considered to be finished when there was no significant increase in absorbance the content of ti based species tia tib and tic can be quantified by standard curve and the speciation results are listed in table 1 for e2 ptc tib contributed to 68 10 of hydroxyi ti based species while the fractions of tia and tic were much less with the ed period increased the ti ferron reaction rate slowed down which was accompanied by the decrease in tib content the dominant species of e ptcs gradually changed from tib to tic fractions for e8 ptc there were only 34 35 of tib fractions but with 47 05 of tic fractions the results indicated that the longer the ed period was the higher degree of the pre hydrolysis of ti based species was extension of the ed period could lead to the polymerization of ti based hydroxyl polymers resulting in the medium polymers being gradually transformed to the larger ones 3 1 3 b values and zeta potential b value increased with increasing ed period while the reverse trend was observed in case of zeta potential table 1 table s4 a growing number of oh were injected into the reaction chamber and immediately polymerized with ticl4 solution to form e ptc products this resulted in the increasing of b value with increasing ed period rapid reaction within 2 h resulted in the increase of b value to 1 1 above under both current conditions of 0 005 a and 0 02 a slight increase of b value to around 1 7 in 8 h may result from the concentration polarization effect reducing the current efficiency the preparation of e ptcs by ed process is actually a pre hydrolysis process of ticl4 involving the injecting oh into ti4 to form hydroxyl products under the impetus of external direct current zeta potential of ticl4 was about 25 2 mv which decreased to around 13 0 and 15 0 mv under current condition of 0 005 a and 0 02 a respectively in 8 h of ed period table 1 table s4 it was expected that ti based hydroxyl polymers with high degree of polymerization would be generated as the ed progress accompanied by the gradual neutralization of ti4 by oh resulting in a low zeta potential low zeta potential generally represents the weak charge neutralization capability 27 overall the extension in ed period facilitated the increase of the b value of e ptc and the weakening of the charge neutralization ability similar result was also obtained in the previous studies 18 28 3 2 synthesized mechanism of e ptcs by electrodialysis 3 2 1 mechanism of e ptc synthesis the synthesized mechanism of e ptcs is illustrated in fig 2 when a stable direct current was applied to the ed reactor with na2so4 as anolyte nacl as catholyte and ticl4 as the reaction solution oxygen chlorine evolution and hydrogen evolution will appear at the anode and cathode respectively anode reaction 1 h 2 o e 1 2 o 2 h or 2 c l e 1 2 cl 2 cathode reaction 3 h 2 o e o h 1 2 h 2 with the occurrence of the reactions oxygen evolution eq 1 took place on the anode chamber to generate h while oh was produced by the hydrogen evolution eq 3 in cathode chamber driven by direct current oh migrated toward the reaction chamber and immediately underwent hydrolysis polymerization reaction thereby generating e ptc aqueous solutions the reaction in reaction chamber can be expressed as 4 no h mticl 4 tim oh ncl 4 m n nc l the net result of the ed process was to substitute cl with oh in ticl4 solution to produce the ti based hydroxyl polymers the tim oh ncl4m n or more precisely expressed as tixoy oh zcln h2o m 4x 2y z n represented the ti based hydroxyl polymers generated during the hydrolysis polymerization process it was possible to control the ti based hydroxyl polymers by regulating current intensity and ed period from the analysis of esi tof ms fig 1 the in situ hydrolyzed ti based complexes generated by ticl4 were mainly small polymers such as ti3cl6 h2o 25 6 ti5cl12 h2o 22 8 or ti6o2cl14 h2o 5 6 and so on whilsit during ed process the violent oxygen and hydrogen evolution occurred within the first 2 h and the generated oh quickly penetrated the anion exchange membrane into the reaction chamber followed by the displacement with the cl in the in situ hydrolyzed ti based complexes during this period the degree of polymerization of ti based species increased and the most small polymers gradually turned into the median polymers e g ti11o oh 4cl31 h2o 15 7 and ti12o2 oh 21cl15 h2o 39 8 as the ed process extended to 6 h the dominant reaction in the reaction chamber was supposed to change from the polymerization between ti4 and oh to the self polymerization of the ti based hydroxyl polymers little change of b value during 4 8 h table 1 further verified this speculation self polymerization of the ti based species resulted in the formation of large polymers like ti18o30 oh 8cl h2o 6 3 and ti21o38 oh cl3 h2o 39 4 in 8 h meanwhile the trace cl entering the anode chamber from the reaction chamber inevitably underwent chlorine evolution on the anode 3 2 2 evolution of solution chemistry factors the ph value of electrolytes regardless of anolyte or catholyte changed vs ed period followed two stages a stage of rapid ph decrease within 2 h followed by a stage where ph slowly drop close to equilibrium fig 3a specifically oxygen evolution eq 1 generated h causing the ph of the anolyte to gradually change from near neutral to acidic meanwhile with the high efficiency of hydrogen evolution eq 3 and mass transfer most of the generated oh were transferred from the cathode chamber to the reaction chamber so that the ph value of the catholyte gradually decreased worth noting was that the significant drop of ph obviously occurred within 2 h demonstrating the high current efficiency of oxygen and hydrogen evolution during the initial period as the ed process continued it was speculated that the concentration polarization phenomenon may begin to appear causing a decrease in oh permeation and current efficiency based on the result that an insignificant drop of the electrolyte ph in the later stage more than 4 h these results also further verified the above inference about the synthesis mechanism of e ptcs meanwhile cl has also undergone a directional migration during the ed process moving toward the anode while moving to the cathode in order to compensate for the charge imbalance caused by the absence of oh fig 3a the variation in cl concentration of the catholyte was quite consistent with the change trend of ph conductivity is a parameter used to characterize the ease of charge flow which is inversely proportional to the resistance 29 fig 3b indicated that both the anolyte and catholyte were gradually electrolyzed to obtain free ions during the ed process which increased the charge mobility and conductivity of the electrolyte in contrast the conductivity of the ticl4 solution gradually decreased with the occurrence of the ed process reflecting that oh polymerized with ti4 ions immediately after entering the reaction chamber finally a clear and transparent product with a high degree of polymerization and low conductivity was obtained in approximately 100 yield 3 2 3 evolution of potential and electrode characteristics within the first 5 min a sharp increase of the potential in the ed stack was observed due to the decrease of the non faradaic current which was followed by a relatively stable potential platform fig s4 the electrochemical characteristics of the anode and cathode electrodes were tested with the results presenting that no obvious redox peaks were detected by cv scanning fig s5 for anode the graphite electrode after reaction showed a larger current density figs s5a and s6a which indicated that treatment by electrochemical scanning caused the activation reaction of the graphite electrode surface to improve the electrochemical performance and gradually formed the electrode surface with higher stability and reproducibility 30 by contrast the current intensity of the cathode tended to be relatively stable or decrease slightly with the extension of ed period figs s5b and s6b the reasons for the different phenomena of the cathode and anode electrodes and the recyclability of the graphite electrode still need to be further studied 3 3 coagulation performance of e ptcs 3 3 1 uv254 and turbidity removal significant advantage of e ptcs synthesized under current intensity of 0 005 a over ticl4 was observed in terms of uv254 removal fig 4a and b especially e8 ptc performed the best performance in removing organic matter with the peak removal efficiency of 75 85 and 70 0 for sw and mw treatment respectively approximately more than 15 higher than ticl4 coagulation a larger dosage requirement for e ptcs than ticl4 may be due to the difference in pre hydrolysed ti based species during the ed process ticl4 was pre hydrolyzed to form ti based hydroxyl polymers with low zeta potential table 1 which had strong complexing capability under the action of sweep flocculation at higher dosages moreover the removal of organic matter was improved by extending the ed period which may be attributed to the fact that the ed period promoted the deepening of the pre hydrolysis of ti4 and generated e ptcs rich in dominant hydrolysis species that have extremely strong sweeping ability additionally the e ptcs were effective in removing turbidity fig s7 within the range of the investigated dosage 5 60 mg l for sw and 10 120 mg l for mw the residual turbidities of e ptcs coagulated effluent mostly maintained below 5 44 ntu and 3 26 ntu for sw and mw treatment respectively by contrast in case of ticl4 coagulation the turbidity removal capability deteriorated rapidly at dosages above 40 mg l for sw and 80 mg l for mw which probably due to the fact that the flocs with strongly positive charges facilitated the occurrence of anti coagulation phenomenon at high ticl4 dosages a comparison of the coagulation performance of the obtained e8 ptc and conventional al fe ti coagulants e g pac pfs and ptc15 was also carried out for the sw and mw treatment supporting information s11 notably the coagulation performance in terms of uv254 and doc removal showed that the obtained e8 ptc was more capable of removing organic matter than pac and pfs as evidenced by 10 to 30 higher organic matter removal although pac coagulant exhibited the stronger capability to remove turbidity at low dosages the turbidity removal efficiency of e8 ptc was gradually equal to or even better than that of traditional coagulants as the dose increased besides e8 ptc performed an obvious improvement in comparison with ptc15 as proved by higher uv254 removal detailed comparisons referred to supporting information s11 additionally the residual ti concentration of the supernatant collected from the coagulated effluent sample with an e8 ptc dosage of 50 mg l in sw treatment was found to be approximately 0 52 mg l which was much lower than those of al and fe based coagulants 1 31 this result showed that most of the ti ions would combine with pollutants to produce precipitates during coagulation and subsequently could be easily removed from waters by conventional sedimentation processes and previous study found that only trace concentration of ti remained by filtration though 0 22 μm microporous fiber membranes 32 it was indicated that the ti concentration in the final effluent would easily meet the provisions of any health guidelines after coagulation and filtration and there is no concern that coagulant residues threaten the environment and health current intensity is a crucial factor that regulates the rate of electrochemical reaction and therefore affects the hydrolyzed species of coagulant 33 in this study coagulation performance of the e ptcs prepared at current intensity of 0 02 a was also investigated supporting information s12 in mw treatment case a larger dosage for e ptcs prepared at current intensity of 0 02 a was required to achieve a comparable removal compared with 0 005 a case this result proved the classical view that lowering current intensity favored the formation of the advantageous flocculation species 34 it was speculated that the high current intensity accelerated the rate of oh injection causing the overfast polymerization of ti4 and oh to obtain ti based hydroxyl polymers with relatively weak coagulation capability 3 3 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis 3d eem of organic matter before and after coagulation were compared with the results being showed in supporting information s13 the fluorescent peaks of both raw water and coagulated effluent appeared in region v indicating the dominant humic like component of organic matter according to previous literatures 35 36 none of the ticl4 ptc15 and e ptc coagulation changed the types of organic components but they reduced the fluorescence intensity and contour density of region v specifically the spectra of e8 ptc effluent had the weakest fluorescent response after coagulation regardless of the optimum dosages or the same dosage which proved the capability of e8 ptc for the fluorescent humus removal 3 3 3 coagulation mechanism when e ptcs were added into the test water they were firstly speculated to hydrolyze to the positively charged hydroxyl polymers followed by their reaction with the negatively charged pollutants for instance many large polymeric ti based species of hydrolysates e g ti18o30 oh 8cl8 h2o 6 3 ti21o38 oh cl3 h2o 39 4 and ti24o15 oh 28cl32 h2o 39 6 in e8 ptc were generated after coagulant addition into water table s3 by contrast our previous study has reported that ptc prepared by sat method was supposed to hydrolyzed to the median polymers such as ti9o15 oh cl2 h2o 3 ti12o18 oh 7cl h2o m 4 and ti16o28 oh cl3 h2o 4 and so on 18 obviously the degree of polymerization of the hydrolysates for the two polytitanium salt coagulants was markedly different and tic was the dominant flocculation species in e8 ptc exhibiting strong bonding bridging and sweep flocculation capability variation of floc zeta potential vs e ptcs dosage was presented in fig 4c and d with the results showing gradual increase of floc zeta potential from negative to the positive worth noting was the difference in the flocs zeta potential after coagulation of e ptcs prepared at various ed periods with the results following the order of e0 ptc e2 ptc e4 ptc e6 ptc e8 ptc this illustrated that charge neutralization ability of hydrolyzed ti based species gradually weakened with the prolongation of the ed period according to table 1 the increase in ed period resulted in the drop of zeta potential of coagulants this demonstrated that a larger amount of oh injection led to a greater degree of pre hydrolysis accompanied by the formation of pre hydrolyzed species with less positive charges than the in situ formed hydrolyzed species by ticl4 consequently a much higher dosage was needed for e ptcs to destabilize the flocs to reach isoelectric point changes of the floc zeta potential are generally utilized to investigate the coagulation mechanisms which are generally explained by charge neutralization and sweep flocculation 37 for ticl4 case the zeta potential increased sharply under a low range of dosage reaching 1 09 and 13 1 mv at the optimal dosages of 30 and 60 mg l for sw and mw treatment respectively it was indicated that charge neutralization played a primary role in contrast the zeta potential of e ptcs coagulation was much lower representing a weaker charge neutralization ability even so the more effective turbidity and uv254 removal over ticl4 occurred at high dosages figs 4 and s7 while the zeta potential has changed from negative to positive values in this dosage range this result demonstrated that there exist tic sweep flocculation in addition to tib charge neutralization which jointly governed the organic matter and turbidity removal moreover as the ed period increased a larger amount of oh injection promoted the ti based species to be more fully hydrolyzed resulting in reducing the consumption of oh when coagulant was added to the test water thereby inhibiting the effluent ph reduction fig 4e and f the improvement of the effluent ph would alleviate the pressure of adjusting ph after coagulation which is expected to reduce the cost for further wastewater treatment 3 4 sludge characteristics on line monitoring of floc growth breakage and recovery showed a significant increase of floc size in the initial 2 min followed by a steady state phase fig 5a compared with the traditional pac and pfs the e8 ptc produced larger flocs about 1797 6 μm with faster growth rate around 575 2 μm min table s5 the steady state particles subjected to obvious broken due to the introduction of shear force followed by floc recovery as slow stirring back especially the e8 ptc coagulated flocs exhibited the strongest strength and recoverability as indicated by the largest s f and r f values table s5 even after 5 times of continuous breakage fig 5a hardly observed peak shift in e8 ptc case further proved the strong shear resistance fig 5b fractal dimension d f is a significant parameter representing floc density 4 35 the large loose e8 ptc flocs with incompact structure low d f of 2 0 tended to rearrange to form denser structure after being broken for 5 times as evidenced by increasing d f values fig s15 additionally the e8 ptc coagulated sludge exhibited better settleability than that of pac and pfs cases as the lower svi value seen table s6 lower water content ca 82 0 and srf value 2 3 109 s2 g evidenced the superior dewatering capability of e8 ptc after coagulation with e8 ptc the coagulated sludge was collected dewatered followed by one step calcination to produce high efficient nano photocatalysts tio2 fig s18 the results corresponded well with the previous studies 8 18 3 5 cost effective analysis the development of ti based coagulants has experienced from monomer to the polymeric or composite which has been paid extensive attention because of their high efficiency of water purification and sludge recycling recently the price of ti salts has been gradually comparable to traditional al or fe salts coagulants us 114 ton 32 38 and the coagulated sludge could be recycled to produce functional photocatalyst products with superior photocatalytic performance than commercial tio2 fig s18 39 our previous research has also found that ti based coagulated sludge can be recycled in one step calcination to obtain functional titanium nanoflowers us 38 ton with a yield of up to 0 6 kg kg sludge 38 which achieved excellent photocatalytic performance and stability in the degradation of phenolic compounds 95 and the synergistic removal rate of cr vi and phenol was as high as 99 8 38 in this study we adopted the ed method to synthesize functional coagulants named e ptcs ed process is a safe and economical technology with the advantages of mature equipment flexible operation and wide application 40 for e ptc preparation the most commonly used market electrode such as graphite electrode could meet the requirements of this study and our study proved that the ed process could activate the electrodes without the occurrence of passivation or corrosion supporting information s9 besides the commercially available anion exchange membrane showed smooth ion mitigation with good performance and could be reused after simple washing by deionized water most important was that e ptcs could improve the coagulation performance and floc characteristics for a medium scale 105 m3 d sewage treatment plant primary coagulation with e ptc is estimated to consume ti salts and energy cost of approximately us 4206 and us 79 which are almost equivalent to traditional coagulants high dosage of e ptc required for coagulation could be recouped by the coagulated sludge recycling in conclusion the synthesis method was economical and efficient as 1 abundant raw materials with comparable price as the conventional coagulants 2 maturity and feasibility of the synthetic method 3 efficient water purification capacity and 4 recyclability of the coagulated sludge 4 conclusions this study firstly proposed the synthesis of high efficient ptc using ed process named e ptc the identification results of esi tof ms indicated the formation of ti based hydroxyl polymers with various polymerization degrees high content of tib and tic fractions were detected by ti ferron assay in e ptc solutions as the ed period increased predominant ti based species shifted from small median polymer tib to large polymer tic compared with conventional al and fe based coagulants e ptc could achieve higher organic matter removal with superior sludge characteristics moreover after e ptc coagulation the effluent ph was not sharply decreased as that after coagulation with ticl4 to sum up this ed method was capable to produce the high efficient ptc rich with the hydrolyzed

13006,biocompatibility of titanium ti and recycling of the coagulated sludge to produce functional nanoparticles make the popularization of ti based coagulants highly attractive slow alkaline titration sat method was commonly used to synthesize polytitanium coagulants but cannot control the formation of dominant flocculation species due to the fast hydrolysis we propose the innovative preparation of ti based coagulants by electrodialysis ed to control the directional transfer of electrons and regulate the rate of the micro interface reaction an efficient polytitanium chloride ptc was successfully prepared by ed method with ticl4 as precursor denoted as e ptc results from electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry esi tof ms proved the generation of the ti based hydroxyl polymers with various degrees of polymerization benefiting from the controllable migration of ions during ed process the predominant ti based species changed from the small median polymers to the large ones with increasing ed period this was evidenced by ti ferron assay that high tib 34 35 and tic 47 05 fractions were obtained in e ptc after 8 h of ed period the resulting e ptc had stronger coagulation capability for both surface water and municipal wastewater treatment than the conventional ones compared with the conventional al based and fe based coagulants e ptc achieved 15 to 30 higher removal of organic matter and produced the flocs with larger size faster growth rate better dewaterability stronger strength and recoverability this study provided the efficient ed method

polytitanium chloride electrodialysis electrospray ionization mass spectrum sludge properties 1 introduction coagulation flocculation has become a cost effective and established pretreatment strategy in water wastewater treatment systems 1 2 the application of common al based and fe based coagulants inevitably generates some issues such as the toxicity of residual al the unacceptable color of residual fe and the difficulty of sludge disposal 3 5 the novel ti based coagulants make up for these drawbacks with the most outstanding merit of sludge recovery as value added photocatalysts 6 7 besides ti based coagulants have superior or at least comparable coagulation capability in comparison with traditional al and fe based salts 8 9 high efficient removal of organic matter was accompanied by large floc size fast growth rate and quick sludge sedimentation 10 11 abundant reserves of ti based salts and their biocompatibility further make their popularization highly attractive 12 13 recently ti based coagulants from single ti based salts to inorganic polymeric salts from unitary compound to composite salts have been paid considerable attention 14 16 inorganic polymer flocculants especially polytitanium chloride ptc have been extensively studied because of their strong water purification capability low dosage and wide applicable ph ranges 4 17 18 our previous study has firstly prepared ptc with different basicity b values by slow alkaline titration sat method 18 however owing to the extremely rapid hydrolysis rate of ti based salts 19 this alkaline polymerization method could not precisely adjust the micro interfacial process of hydrolysis and polymerization between ti4 and hydroxyl groups oh resulting in the difficulty of controlling ti based species distribution these hydrolyzates with high efficient floccualtion capability are the key to determining the coagulation performance 20 currently a challenge is to establish a simple and accurate synthesis method to control the hydrolysis polymerization process in order to obtain ptc rich with advantageous flocculation species electrochemical method is capable of controlling the directional transfer of electrons and regulating the rate and efficiency of the microinterface process 21 among which the electrochemical synthesis of polyaluminum chloride pac has attracted widespread attention two categories of electrochemical process to synthetic pac involve i sacrificial metallic anode electrolysis and ii electrodialysis ed the former however is not suitable for the preparation of ptc because ti belongs to valve type metal and can immediately form a non conductive oxide layer on the exposed surface when it is used as an anode material 22 resulting in a rapid increase in resistance the latter has been utilized to obtain synthesize valuable pac with high content of optimal hydrolyzates species through the directional transfer and precise regulation of electrons 23 24 theoretically the ed method of preparing pac can be used as a prototype for the preparation of polytitanium flocculant based on the principle of selective permeability of the ion exchange membrane and water splitting this process enables the titanium tetrachloride ticl4 solution to be gradually alkalized to obtain pure ptc products it is expected to precisely control the microreaction process between ti4 and oh to obtain hydrolysates with optimal flocculation capability here in this study the ed reactor included three chambers anode chamber reaction chamber and cathode chamber which were divided by anion exchange membranes under the action of direct current the oh of the cathode chamber entered the reaction chamber through anion exchange membrane by regulating the yield and output of the oh to gradually alkalize ticl4 solution herein the hydrolysis rate of ti based species was expected to be controlled by the injection rate and injection amount of oh by control of current intensity and ed period meanwhile the cl in the reaction chamber migrated to the anode chamber through the anion exchange membrane on the anode side consequently a migration channel of anions was constituted in the entire ed system which made it possible to synthesize ptc rich with stable dominant hydrolysis species aims of this study were to i synthesize the ptc rich with the dominant species of flocculation by ed process named e ptc ii characterize the e ptc in terms of basicity b value and zeta potential especially the identification of the hydrolyzed ti based species using electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry esi tof ms and ti ferron assay iii evaluate the coagulation behavior and sludge properties of e ptc for surface water sw and municipal wastewater mw treatment both mechanisms of e ptc preparation and its coagulation were included 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ptc by electrodialysis the ptc was prepared by ed method and the schematic view of apparatus was illustrated in fig s1 the electrochemical system mainly consisted of a dc power supply krp 3005 db zhaoxin china and a three compartment ed reactor made of organic glass with an outer dimension of each single tank of 40 mm length 80 mm width 80 mm height i e 50 ml of effective volume homogeneous anion exchange membranes hmed 0510 3 hangzhou huamo technology co ltd china were selected as the ion exchange membrane in this experiment and graphite rods 6 mm 100 mm with a high purity of 99 9 were utilized as cathode and anode materials sodium sulfate na2so4 0 50 m and sodium chloride nacl 0 50 m were used as anolyte and catholyte respectively a certain concentration of ticl4 was chosen as the solution of the reaction chamber in which a magnetic stirrer ms 500 intllab china was used to vigorously stir to promote the polymerization of ti4 and oh and reduce concentration polarization the ed process worked in a constant current mode and the e ptcs ptcs prepared by ed were prepared by controlling reaction period of 2 4 6 and 8 h with the products being named as e2 ptc e4 ptc e6 ptc and e8 ptc respectively after the reaction was completed the electrolytes were analyzed for cl concentration conductivity and ph using ion chromatograph ics 900 thermofisher scientific usa conductivity meter sevencompact s230 mettler toledo instruments china and ph meter phs3c leici china respectively 2 2 characterization of e ptcs 2 2 1 esi tof ms esi tof ms was employed to detect the hydrolysates of e ptc coagulants to avoid contamination of the instrument the obtained e ptcs were diluted in deionized water to get a solution with a concentration of 0 01 mol l before measurement 18 the spectra were recorded with a liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight 1290 infinity ii g6545b agilent usa equipped with an electrospray ionization source with positive ion mode the diluted coagulant products were injected into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min the instrument parameters were as followed nozzle voltage 500 v gas temperature 325 c gas flow rate 12 l min mass range 50 1000 the peaks with strong response intensity representing the specific ti based hydroxyl polymers were chosen for the esi tof ms study 2 2 2 ferron assay the ti based species were measured by ti ferron time spectrophotometry assay wherein the hydrolyzed ti based species were analyzed based on the difference of the dissociation and reaction kinetic between hydrolyzed ti based species and ferron reagent the timed absorbance measurements at 370 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810pc persee china were carried out within 1 min and monitored for further 400 min to complete the reaction between ti based species and ferron three fractions of ti based species could be defined as tia tib and tic corresponding to the monomeric polymers reacted within 1 min the medium polymers reacted from 1 to 400 min and the larger polymers or sol gels non reacted respectively tic was calculated by subtracting tia and tib from the total ti tit 2 2 3 basicity and zeta potential the b value can be measured via the titrimetric method based on the principle of oh ti molar ratio which mainly involved i the quantities of ti4 determined by the complexation reaction between ti4 and kf solution and ii the quantities of oh determined by the neutralization reaction between oh and hcl detailed analytical procedures are provided in the supporting information s2 zeta potential of the e ptcs was investigated using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instrument uk each value was measured for at least three times and the results shall be averaged to narrow the error 2 3 electrochemical characterization cyclic voltammetry cv and linear sweep voltammetry lsv were applied to investigate the changes in the electrochemical properties of electrodes on a electrochemical workstation chi760e chenhua instruments co ltd china at room temperature experiments were carried out in a three electrode system containing na2so4 solution where the graphite electrode used in this study served as the working electrode and the platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the counter and reference electrode respectively chronopotentiometry cp was performed in the designed ed device to monitor the potential change the anode was connected to the working electrode and the cathode was connected to the counter and reference electrode 2 4 jar test two kinds of water samples were utilized surface water sw from jiazi lake university of jinan and municipal wastewater mw from the secondary sedimentation tank everbright water limited in jinan shandong province china the coagulants used were e ptcs synthesized in

meiyu instrument china was employed in coagulation experiments which allowed stirring time and speed to be preset after coagulation the water samples from 2 cm under the solution surface were collected for water quality evaluation including residual turbidity uv254 effluent ph value zeta potential and residual ti concentration details of the physical chemical characteristics of the water samples coagulation procedures and analytical methods are presented in supporting information s3 2 5 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis 3d eem fluorescence spectra of raw water and supernatant samples was scanned using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fluoromax 4 horiba scientific usa which parameters were as following emission em spectrum were collected from 300 to 550 nm at 1 nm sampling increments by varying the excitation ex wavelengths in the range from 220 to 500 nm with 5 nm sampling increments both em and ex slits were adjusted to 10 nm the response of

measured 2 6 sludge properties evolution of dynamic floc size was monitored on line via a laser diffraction analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern uk during coagulation the suspended flocs were measured

liquor suspended solids mlss of coagulated sludge were determined in accordance with the standard methods 25 dewatering performance was determined by specific resistance to filtration srf measured by the vacuum filtration approach detailed information can be obtained in previous study 26 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of e ptcs 3 1 1 esi tof ms the est tof ms was applied to identify the distribution of ti based species in e ptc solutions according to the different mass to charge ratio m z detected in mass spectra fig 1 the abundance of ti based hydroxyl polymers could be observed from the relative ion intensity of m z signals polymerization degree and the probable molecular formula of the hydrolyzed ti based species were calculated using python software according to the general formula of tixoy oh zcln h2o m 4x 2y z n 18 with the results being summarized in table s3 for the mass spectra of ticl4 e2 ptc and e6 ptc the main signals were almost the same fig 1 the signal at m z 132 ti5 ti6 cores dominated their spectra with an intensity of 100 whereas the most intensive signal for e8 ptc spectra appeared at the signal at m z 541 ti9 ti18 cores zhao et al 18 has reported that the ti based species could be classified into four categories including ti1 ti2 monomer and dimer ti3 ti8 small polymer ti9 ti16 median polymer and ti17 and above large polymer when the ed period reached 8 h the signal intensity of the small and median polymeric species with m z 134 150 and 320 decreased by 20 30 in comparison to ticl4 and the signals at m z 279 and 322 vanished table s2 the polymerization degree of ti based species gradually increased with the transformation of the dominant ti based species to large polymers as the electrolysis period increased as reflected by the appearance of the large polymers at m z 611 617 633 684 758 and 763 at 2 h and the gradual increase of the signal intensity besides compared with ticl4 case the signals intensity at m z 359 610 615 and 689 of e8 ptc apparently increased by 30 45 the median and large polymeric ti based complexes were the main signals in e8 ptc solution additionally a few signals at m z values 64 27 01 and 91 21 47 were detected in the spectra of ticl4 which were speculated to be monomers dimers and small polymers ti1 ti2 and ti4 according to zhao et al 18 the ed process weakened the ion strength of these signals 3 1 2 ferron assay based on the assumption that hydroxyl ti based species have various reaction periods with ferron reagent three categories of ti based hydroxyl polymers mononuclear tia reactive polynuclear tib and high polymers tic can be distinguished by ti ferron assay fig s2 showed the curves of the ti ferron reaction kinetics with the results revealing that an initial sharp increase in absorbance that become almost flat over a long period of time generally the reaction between tia tib and ferron was considered to be finished when there was no significant increase in absorbance the content of ti based species tia tib and tic can be quantified by standard curve and the speciation results are listed in table 1 for e2 ptc tib contributed to 68 10 of hydroxyi ti based species while the fractions of tia and tic were much less with the ed period increased the ti ferron reaction rate slowed down which was accompanied by the decrease in tib content the dominant species of e ptcs gradually changed from tib to tic fractions for e8 ptc there were only 34 35 of tib fractions but with 47 05 of tic fractions the results indicated that the longer the ed period was the higher degree of the pre hydrolysis of ti based species was extension of the ed period could lead to the polymerization of ti based hydroxyl polymers resulting in the medium polymers being gradually transformed to the larger ones 3 1 3 b values and zeta potential b value increased with increasing ed period while the reverse trend was observed in case of zeta potential table 1 table s4 a growing number of oh were injected into the reaction chamber and immediately polymerized with ticl4 solution to form e ptc products this resulted in the increasing of b value with increasing ed period rapid reaction within 2 h resulted in the increase of b value to 1 1 above under both current conditions of 0 005 a and 0 02 a slight increase of b value to around 1 7 in 8 h may result from the concentration polarization effect reducing the current efficiency the preparation of e ptcs by ed process is actually a pre hydrolysis process of ticl4 involving the injecting oh into ti4 to form hydroxyl products under the impetus of external direct current zeta potential of ticl4 was about 25 2 mv which decreased to around 13 0 and 15 0 mv under current condition of 0 005 a and 0 02 a respectively in 8 h of ed period table 1 table s4 it was expected that ti based hydroxyl polymers with high degree of polymerization would be generated as the ed progress accompanied by the gradual neutralization of ti4 by oh resulting in a low zeta potential low zeta potential generally represents the weak charge neutralization capability 27 overall the extension in ed period facilitated the increase of the b value of e ptc and the weakening of the charge neutralization ability similar result was also obtained in the previous studies 18 28 3 2 synthesized mechanism of e ptcs by electrodialysis 3 2 1 mechanism of e ptc synthesis the synthesized mechanism of e ptcs is illustrated in fig 2 when a stable direct current was applied to the ed reactor with na2so4 as anolyte nacl as catholyte and ticl4 as the reaction solution oxygen chlorine evolution and hydrogen evolution will appear at the anode and cathode respectively anode reaction 1 h 2 o e 1 2 o 2 h or 2 c l e 1 2 cl 2 cathode reaction 3 h 2 o e o h 1 2 h 2 with the occurrence of the reactions oxygen evolution eq 1 took place on the anode chamber to generate h while oh was produced by the hydrogen evolution eq 3 in cathode chamber driven by direct current oh migrated toward the reaction chamber and immediately underwent hydrolysis polymerization reaction thereby generating e ptc aqueous solutions the reaction in reaction chamber can be expressed as 4 no h mticl 4 tim oh ncl 4 m n nc l the net result of the ed process was to substitute cl with oh in ticl4 solution to produce the ti based hydroxyl polymers the tim oh ncl4m n or more precisely expressed as tixoy oh zcln h2o m 4x 2y z n represented the ti based hydroxyl polymers generated during the hydrolysis polymerization process it was possible to control the ti based hydroxyl polymers by regulating current intensity and ed period from the analysis of esi tof ms fig 1 the in situ hydrolyzed ti based complexes generated by ticl4 were mainly small polymers such as ti3cl6 h2o 25 6 ti5cl12 h2o 22 8 or ti6o2cl14 h2o 5 6 and so on whilsit during ed process the violent oxygen and hydrogen evolution occurred within the first 2 h and the generated oh quickly penetrated the anion exchange membrane into the reaction chamber followed by the displacement with the cl in the in situ hydrolyzed ti based complexes during this period the degree of polymerization of ti based species increased and the most small polymers gradually turned into the median polymers e g ti11o oh 4cl31 h2o 15 7 and ti12o2 oh 21cl15 h2o 39 8 as the ed process extended to 6 h the dominant reaction in the reaction chamber was supposed to change from the polymerization between ti4 and oh to the self polymerization of the ti based hydroxyl polymers little change of b value during 4 8 h table 1 further verified this speculation self polymerization of the ti based species resulted in the formation of large polymers like ti18o30 oh 8cl h2o 6 3 and ti21o38 oh cl3 h2o 39 4 in 8 h meanwhile the trace cl entering the anode chamber from the reaction chamber inevitably underwent chlorine evolution on the anode 3 2 2 evolution of solution chemistry factors the ph value of electrolytes regardless of anolyte or catholyte changed vs ed period followed two stages a stage of rapid ph decrease within 2 h followed by a stage where ph slowly drop close to equilibrium fig 3a specifically oxygen evolution eq 1 generated h causing the ph of the anolyte to gradually change from near neutral to acidic meanwhile with the high efficiency of hydrogen evolution eq 3 and mass transfer most of the generated oh were transferred from the cathode chamber to the reaction chamber so that the ph value of the catholyte gradually decreased worth noting was that the significant drop of ph obviously occurred within 2 h demonstrating the high current efficiency of oxygen and hydrogen evolution during the initial period as the ed process continued it was speculated that the concentration polarization phenomenon may begin to appear causing a decrease in oh permeation and current efficiency based on the result that an insignificant drop of the electrolyte ph in the later stage more than 4 h these results also further verified the above inference about the synthesis mechanism of e ptcs meanwhile cl has also undergone a directional migration during the ed process moving toward the anode while moving to the cathode in order to compensate for the charge imbalance caused by the absence of oh fig 3a the variation in cl concentration of the catholyte was quite consistent with the change trend of ph conductivity is a parameter used to characterize the ease of charge flow which is inversely proportional to the resistance 29 fig 3b indicated that both the anolyte and catholyte were gradually electrolyzed to obtain free ions during the ed process which increased the charge mobility and conductivity of the electrolyte in contrast the conductivity of the ticl4 solution gradually decreased with the occurrence of the ed process reflecting that oh polymerized with ti4 ions immediately after entering the reaction chamber finally a clear and transparent product with a high degree of polymerization and low conductivity was obtained in approximately 100 yield 3 2 3 evolution of potential and electrode characteristics within the first 5 min a sharp increase of the potential in the ed stack was observed due to the decrease of the non faradaic current which was followed by a relatively stable potential platform fig s4 the electrochemical characteristics of the anode and cathode electrodes were tested with the results presenting that no obvious redox peaks were detected by cv scanning fig s5 for anode the graphite electrode after reaction showed a larger current density figs s5a and s6a which indicated that treatment by electrochemical scanning caused the activation reaction of the graphite electrode surface to improve the electrochemical performance and gradually formed the electrode surface with higher stability and reproducibility 30 by contrast the current intensity of the cathode tended to be relatively stable or decrease slightly with the extension of ed period figs s5b and s6b the reasons for the different phenomena of the cathode and anode electrodes and the recyclability of the graphite electrode still need to be further studied 3 3 coagulation performance of e ptcs 3 3 1 uv254 and turbidity removal significant advantage of e ptcs synthesized under current intensity of 0 005 a over ticl4 was observed in terms of uv254 removal fig 4a and b especially e8 ptc performed the best performance in removing organic matter with the peak removal efficiency of 75 85 and 70 0 for sw and mw treatment respectively approximately more than 15 higher than ticl4 coagulation a larger dosage requirement for e ptcs than ticl4 may be due to the difference in pre hydrolysed ti based species during the ed process ticl4 was pre hydrolyzed to form ti based hydroxyl polymers with low zeta potential table 1 which had strong complexing capability under the action of sweep flocculation at higher dosages moreover the removal of organic matter was improved by extending the ed period which may be attributed to the fact that the ed period promoted the deepening of the pre hydrolysis of ti4 and generated e ptcs rich in dominant hydrolysis species that have extremely strong sweeping ability additionally the e ptcs were effective in removing turbidity fig s7 within the range of the investigated dosage 5 60 mg l for sw and 10 120 mg l for mw the residual turbidities of e ptcs coagulated effluent mostly maintained below 5 44 ntu and 3 26 ntu for sw and mw treatment respectively by contrast in case of ticl4 coagulation the turbidity removal capability deteriorated rapidly at dosages above 40 mg l for sw and 80 mg l for mw which probably due to the fact that the flocs with strongly positive charges facilitated the occurrence of anti coagulation phenomenon at high ticl4 dosages a comparison of the coagulation performance of the obtained e8 ptc and conventional al fe ti coagulants e g pac pfs and ptc15 was also carried out for the sw and mw treatment supporting information s11 notably the coagulation performance in terms of uv254 and doc removal showed that the obtained e8 ptc was more capable of removing organic matter than pac and pfs as evidenced by 10 to 30 higher organic matter removal although pac coagulant exhibited the stronger capability to remove turbidity at low dosages the turbidity removal efficiency of e8 ptc was gradually equal to or even better than that of traditional coagulants as the dose increased besides e8 ptc performed an obvious improvement in comparison with ptc15 as proved by higher uv254 removal detailed comparisons referred to supporting information s11 additionally the residual ti concentration of the supernatant collected from the coagulated effluent sample with an e8 ptc dosage of 50 mg l in sw treatment was found to be approximately 0 52 mg l which was much lower than those of al and fe based coagulants 1 31 this result showed that most of the ti ions would combine with pollutants to produce precipitates during coagulation and subsequently could be easily removed from waters by conventional sedimentation processes and previous study found that only trace concentration of ti remained by filtration though 0 22 μm microporous fiber membranes 32 it was indicated that the ti concentration in the final effluent would easily meet the provisions of any health guidelines after coagulation and filtration and there is no concern that coagulant residues threaten the environment and health current intensity is a crucial factor that regulates the rate of electrochemical reaction and therefore affects the hydrolyzed species of coagulant 33 in this study coagulation performance of the e ptcs prepared at current intensity of 0 02 a was also investigated supporting information s12 in mw treatment case a larger dosage for e ptcs prepared at current intensity of 0 02 a was required to achieve a comparable removal compared with 0 005 a case this result proved the classical view that lowering current intensity favored the formation of the advantageous flocculation species 34 it was speculated that the high current intensity accelerated the rate of oh injection causing the overfast polymerization of ti4 and oh to obtain ti based hydroxyl polymers with relatively weak coagulation capability 3 3 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis 3d eem of organic matter before and after coagulation were compared with the results being showed in supporting information s13 the fluorescent peaks of both raw water and coagulated effluent appeared in region v indicating the dominant humic like component of organic matter according to previous literatures 35 36 none of the ticl4 ptc15 and e ptc coagulation changed the types of organic components but they reduced the fluorescence intensity and contour density of region v specifically the spectra of e8 ptc effluent had the weakest fluorescent response after coagulation regardless of the optimum dosages or the same dosage which proved the capability of e8 ptc for the fluorescent humus removal 3 3 3 coagulation mechanism when e ptcs were added into the test water they were firstly speculated to hydrolyze to the positively charged hydroxyl polymers followed by their reaction with the negatively charged pollutants for instance many large polymeric ti based species of hydrolysates e g ti18o30 oh 8cl8 h2o 6 3 ti21o38 oh cl3 h2o 39 4 and ti24o15 oh 28cl32 h2o 39 6 in e8 ptc were generated after coagulant addition into water table s3 by contrast our previous study has reported that ptc prepared by sat method was supposed to hydrolyzed to the median polymers such as ti9o15 oh cl2 h2o 3 ti12o18 oh 7cl h2o m 4 and ti16o28 oh cl3 h2o 4 and so on 18 obviously the degree of polymerization of the hydrolysates for the two polytitanium salt coagulants was markedly different and tic was the dominant flocculation species in e8 ptc exhibiting strong bonding bridging and sweep flocculation capability variation of floc zeta potential vs e ptcs dosage was presented in fig 4c and d with the results showing gradual increase of floc zeta potential from negative to the positive worth noting was the difference in the flocs zeta potential after coagulation of e ptcs prepared at various ed periods with the results following the order of e0 ptc e2 ptc e4 ptc e6 ptc e8 ptc this illustrated that charge neutralization ability of hydrolyzed ti based species gradually weakened with the prolongation of the ed period according to table 1 the increase in ed period resulted in the drop of zeta potential of coagulants this demonstrated that a larger amount of oh injection led to a greater degree of pre hydrolysis accompanied by the formation of pre hydrolyzed species with less positive charges than the in situ formed hydrolyzed species by ticl4 consequently a much higher dosage was needed for e ptcs to destabilize the flocs to reach isoelectric point changes of the floc zeta potential are generally utilized to investigate the coagulation mechanisms which are generally explained by charge neutralization and sweep flocculation 37 for ticl4 case the zeta potential increased sharply under a low range of dosage reaching 1 09 and 13 1 mv at the optimal dosages of 30 and 60 mg l for sw and mw treatment respectively it was indicated that charge neutralization played a primary role in contrast the zeta potential of e ptcs coagulation was much lower representing a weaker charge neutralization ability even so the more effective turbidity and uv254 removal over ticl4 occurred at high dosages figs 4 and s7 while the zeta potential has changed from negative to positive values in this dosage range this result demonstrated that there exist tic sweep flocculation in addition to tib charge neutralization which jointly governed the organic matter and turbidity removal moreover as the ed period increased a larger amount of oh injection promoted the ti based species to be more fully hydrolyzed resulting in reducing the consumption of oh when coagulant was added to the test water thereby inhibiting the effluent ph reduction fig 4e and f the improvement of the effluent ph would alleviate the pressure of adjusting ph after coagulation which is expected to reduce the cost for further wastewater treatment 3 4 sludge characteristics on line monitoring of floc growth breakage and recovery showed a significant increase of floc size in the initial 2 min followed by a steady state phase fig 5a compared with the traditional pac and pfs the e8 ptc produced larger flocs about 1797 6 μm with faster growth rate around 575 2 μm min table s5 the steady state particles subjected to obvious broken due to the introduction of shear force followed by floc recovery as slow stirring back especially the e8 ptc coagulated flocs exhibited the strongest strength and recoverability as indicated by the largest s f and r f values table s5 even after 5 times of continuous breakage fig 5a hardly observed peak shift in e8 ptc case further proved the strong shear resistance fig 5b fractal dimension d f is a significant parameter representing floc density 4 35 the large loose e8 ptc flocs with incompact structure low d f of 2 0 tended to rearrange to form denser structure after being broken for 5 times as evidenced by increasing d f values fig s15 additionally the e8 ptc coagulated sludge exhibited better settleability than that of pac and pfs cases as the lower svi value seen table s6 lower water content ca 82 0 and srf value 2 3 109 s2 g evidenced the superior dewatering capability of e8 ptc after coagulation with e8 ptc the coagulated sludge was collected dewatered followed by one step calcination to produce high efficient nano photocatalysts tio2 fig s18 the results corresponded well with the previous studies 8 18 3 5 cost effective analysis the development of ti based coagulants has experienced from monomer to the polymeric or composite which has been paid extensive attention because of their high efficiency of water purification and sludge recycling recently the price of ti salts has been gradually comparable to traditional al or fe salts coagulants us 114 ton 32 38 and the coagulated sludge could be recycled to produce functional photocatalyst products with superior photocatalytic performance than commercial tio2 fig s18 39 our previous research has also found that ti based coagulated sludge can be recycled in one step calcination to obtain functional titanium nanoflowers us 38 ton with a yield of up to 0 6 kg kg sludge 38 which achieved excellent photocatalytic performance and stability in the degradation of phenolic compounds 95 and the synergistic removal rate of cr vi and phenol was as high as 99 8 38 in this study we adopted the ed method to synthesize functional coagulants named e ptcs ed process is a safe and economical technology with the advantages of mature equipment flexible operation and wide application 40 for e ptc preparation the most commonly used market electrode such as graphite electrode could meet the requirements of this study and our study proved that the ed process could activate the electrodes without the occurrence of passivation or corrosion supporting information s9 besides the commercially available anion exchange membrane showed smooth ion mitigation with good performance and could be reused after simple washing by deionized water most important was that e ptcs could improve the coagulation performance and floc characteristics for a medium scale 105 m3 d sewage treatment plant primary coagulation with e ptc is estimated to consume ti salts and energy cost of approximately us 4206 and us 79 which are almost equivalent to traditional coagulants high dosage of e ptc required for coagulation could be recouped by the coagulated sludge recycling in conclusion the synthesis method was economical and efficient as 1 abundant raw materials with comparable price as the conventional coagulants 2 maturity and feasibility of the synthetic method 3 efficient water purification capacity and 4 recyclability of the coagulated sludge 4 conclusions this study firstly proposed the synthesis of high efficient ptc using ed process named e ptc the identification results of esi tof ms indicated the formation of ti based hydroxyl polymers with various polymerization degrees high content of tib and tic fractions were detected by ti ferron assay in e ptc solutions as the ed period increased predominant ti based species shifted from small median polymer tib to large polymer tic compared with conventional al and fe based coagulants e ptc could achieve higher organic matter removal with superior sludge characteristics moreover after e ptc coagulation the effluent ph was not sharply decreased as that after coagulation with ticl4 to sum up this ed method was capable to produce the high efficient ptc rich with the hydrolyzed

anaerobic anoxic oxic process with tertiary filtration membrane bioreactor dissolved organic matter variation spectroscopic characterization chromatographic characterization 1 introduction aquatic environment pollution is an urgent issue so that countries worldwide are devoting efforts to wastewater treatment 1 for example the chinese government is implementing stricter sewage discharge standards nationwide 2 with the tightening legislation more wastewater treatment plants wwtps are upgraded with more advanced but expensive treatment processes anaerobic anoxic oxic process a2o with common gravity sludge sedimentation is most widely used in municipal wastewater treatment due to its cost performance balance 3 the membrane bioreactor mbr can be treated as an improvement to the conventional a2o which also requires higher investment it combines activated sludge treatment and membrane separation to fulfill high concentration of biomass and independent control of sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt 3 4 theoretically higher srt higher sludge concentration and membrane interception should lead to much better pollutant removal performance for mbr to date literature comparing mbr and conventional a2o processes have focused on micropollutant removal performance 5 10 bacterial community and activity 11 13 nitrification efficiency 13 14 sludge characteristic 15 16 and so on nitrification performance is better for mbr than conventional a2o due to the enhanced accumulation of slow growing nitrifiers 3 13 14 mbr has shown better performance in removing limited types of micropollutants 5 6 residual sludge from mbr has poorer dewaterability 15 comprehensively speaking mbr may not have theoretically overwhelming advantages over conventional a2o further comparison is needed for objective evaluation on the effect of process improvement from conventional a2o to mbr which will provide the basis for judging whether pollutant reduction performance of mbr deserves its high cost dissolved organic matter dom is the collective term for dissolved organic pollutants to be removed in wastewater treatment process which are heterogeneous and complex 3 17 detailed characterization of dom variation in mbr and conventional a2o will advance the knowledge on their respective mechanisms on organic pollutants removal which to the best of our knowledge has been rarely investigated 18 no comparative studies of dom variation between full scale mbr and conventional a2o wwtps have been performed yet the combination of chromatographic and molecular spectroscopic specifically refer to uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry in this study techniques is widely used in dom characterization to gather comprehensive and detailed information on complex dom chemical composition more conveniently and cheaply 19 21 they are also more suitable for frequent dom monitoring in this study than other laborious and expensive characterization methods such as resin separation gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr 22 high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec which has advantages over other analytical techniques in minimal pretreatment high usability low cost and fast speed 22 is commonly used to separate dom into fractions 23 25 multiple detectors e g uv fluorescence and dissolved organic carbon doc detectors after chromatographic separation offer more organized fractional information on complex dom 26 uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry have been widely utilized in dom studies due to their fast responses low cost ease of use and high sensitivity 27 28 they can also provide rich chemical information of dom 29 31 chlorination has been widely used as a disinfection method for controlling pathogens in the effluent of wwtps that contains abundant and complex organic matter 3 so disinfection processes of wwtps which use chlorine are sure to bring about formation of genotoxic and carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps which are of concern for the reclamation and ecological safety of wwtp effluent 32 dom in wastewater treatment process is rich in dbps precursors 32 for example humic like substances hs were found to constitute a large portion of dom entirety in municipal wwtp effluent 33 34 they are rich in polyhydroxyaromatic and unsaturated moieties which tend to react with disinfectants and produce dbps 35 especially trihalomethanes thms 36 different wastewater treatment processes have their own internal dom composition which will lead to their different dbps formation characteristics 37 so dbps formation of effluent is also a meaningful factor related to dom for evaluating the efficiency of different wastewater treatment processes in this study dom variation characteristics and resultant effect such as dbps formation in two typical full scale wwtps operating with conventional anaerobic anoxic oxic process with tertiary filtration a2owtf and mbr respectively were compared convenient characterization methods including hpsec uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry were used to reveal differences in efficiency and mechanism of dom removal between these two kinds of processes the results from this study are expected to help achieve an objective comparison between the performance of conventional a2o and mbr from the perspective of dom variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and sample preparation water samples were taken from municipal wwtps changzhou city china operating a2owtf 119 50 30 e 31 56 50 n wwtp a and mbr 119 52 7 e 31 45 48 n wwtp b processes respectively flow chart shown in fig 1 sampling periods were july october 2020 and january april 2021 representing four seasons 3 samples sets each set included whole process samples from different dates were taken in each of the 4 sampling months so for either of the two wwtps there were totally 12 samples sets corresponding to 12 sampling days influent anoxia aeration and sand filtration effluent were sampled from a2owtf wwtp a identical hpsec chromatograms excitation emission matrix eem spectra and uv vis spectra of corresponding wwtp a aeration and high density sedimentation effluent data not shown revealed that high density sedimentation made no change to dom composition so that it was not sampled for study influent anoxia aeration and membrane effluent were sampled from mbr wwtp b the time interval between sampling events for two adjacent process units equaled the hrt in between all the samples were filtered on site through 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filters cnw germany pre washed with 10 ml ultrapure water the first few ml of the filtrate was discarded filtered samples were stored in glass vials at 4 c prior to analyses completed within two days after sampling 2 2 bulk water quality indexes measurement water quality indexes such as doc total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 n and ammonia nh3 n were measured according to chinese nepa standard methods 38 doc concentrations were measured as non purgeable organic carbon with shimadzu toc analyzer 2 3 spectroscopic characterization uv vis spectra 190 450 nm were measured with a dr6000 spectrometer hach usa in 1 cm quartz cuvette milli q ultrapure water was used as reference the absorption bands in uv vis spectra were deconvoluted by gaussian fitting with peakfit v4 12 to investigate the changes of dom composition the number of deconvoluted bands reflects the number of chemical species within dom entirety while center wavelength of each band reflects the chemical property of specific organic substance related to this band 39 fluorescence eems were measured with a fluorescence spectrometer f 2700 hitachi japan and 1 cm quartz cuvette the emission wavelengths em ranged from 240 nm to 550 nm with 2 nm increment and the excitation wavelengths ex ranged from 240 nm to 450 nm with 5 nm increment eem spectra were analyzed by the fluorescence regional integration fri method which divided eem into five regions representing different components of dom fig 2 31 region

polypeptides and amino acid like substances region v humic acid like substances normalized eem volume φ i n and percent fluorescence response p i n at region i which reveals concentration of different dom components are calculated according to methods from a previous study 31 eem volume removal rates of different regions at different process units used the corresponding volume of influent samples as comparison parallel factor parafac analyses for the eem spectra were performed with the domfluor toolbox run by matlab 2018 40 parafac could decompose whole dom eem into fluorescence components reflecting organic compounds of different chemical properties that were mixed in dom entirety which helps to dissect dom s complex compositional characteristics series of criteria such as loading and leverage inspection residual analysis split half analysis and random analysis were used to check input and output data to ensure the validity of parafac results samples with too high uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 were diluted to uva254 0 05 measured with 1 cm cuvette before eem measurement for parafac analyses to avoid inner filter effect 41 2 4 hpsec characterization lc 2030 shimadzu japan chromatograph with uv detector spd 6a shimadzu japan was used in this study the detection wavelengths were 210 and 254 nm an m9 online toc analyzer ge usa was connected in tandem with chromatograph

ph 6 85 at flow rate of 1 0 ml min sample injection volume was 1000 μl chromatographic area of specific hpsec fraction represents the concentration of specific fraction of dom so removal rates of different dom fractions were calculated with chromatographic area by eq 1 1 removal rate 1 a eff a inf 100 where ainf and aeff are the chromatographic areas of certain hpsec fraction of initial influent samples and effluent samples from specific process units respectively uv absorbance ratio index uri and specific uv absorbance suva can provide information for classification and comparison on dom components of different chemical properties which were separated by hpsec uri of substances eluted at specific time on hpsec chromatogram was calculated as the ratio of chromatographic uv absorbance at 210 nm uva210 to uva254 at the same elution time 42 43 the average uri of certain hpsec fraction for one sample set 12 samples sets in total was calculated by the average value of all data points within certain fraction of uri chromatogram chromatographic fractions with peaky uri chromatogram and higher value correspond to higher content of non humic compounds rich in functional groups containing oxygen and nitrogen in comparison those with peakless flat uri chromatogram and lower value reflect richness in aromatic hs 42 suva of substances eluted at specific time on hpsec chromatogram was calculated as thousandfold multiplied ratio of chromatographic uva254 to doc at the same elution time the suva and uva254 correlate positively with the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of dom chromatographic components 44 2 5 thm formation potential thmfp analysis chlorine was added to water samples stored in pyrex bottles with ptfe lined screw cap at 25 1 c to simulate disinfection process the stock chlorine solution was prepared with sodium hypochlorite scrc china with an active chlorine concentration of 10 0 g l equivalent of cl2 chlorine dosage for each water sample was determined by preliminary test to ensure final free chlorine residue to be at least 1 0 mg l after 72 h after 72 h incubation sodium sulfite scrc china was added stoichiometrically to quench the residual chlorine before timely measurement of total thm tthm chbrcl2 chbr2cl chcl3 chbr3 according to the standard method with gas chromatograph gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu japan 45 total thms concentration was normalized by doc concentration to obtain the thmfp which presents the thm formation reactivity 3 results and discussion 3 1 conventional wastewater quality indexes comparison wastewater quality of the influent and effluent after different process units of wwtps a and b were summarized in supplementary material tables s1 s2 as the two wwtps are all municipal wwtps treating domestic wastewater in the same city the influent doc concentration level of both wwtps resembled each other for both wwtps final effluent quality data were well below discharge limits of china s national discharge standard of pollutants for urban wastewater treatment plants 2 both wwtps in this study operated stably so that they were suitable as the object of this case study wwtps a and b all performed well with tn removal rates over 75 in nutrient removal but doc removal rates representing total dom removal of mbr wwtp b were lower than those of a2owtf wwtp a supplementary material tables s1 s2 mbr is usually regarded to perform better than conventional a2o due to its higher activated sludge concentration and membrane filtration which will metabolize and separate pollutants in wastewater in larger quantities 3 lower doc removal rates of mbr wwtp b in this study were below expectation more advanced characterization on dom sampled from these two wwtps was performed in the following sections to find out the reason for their unexpected different dom removal efficiency 3 2 fluorescence spectroscopic comparison wastewater samples from wwtps a and b were analyzed by fluorescence eem spectrometry eem spectra of samples from the same process unit and wwtp but different months were highly reproducible influent doc concentration of samples collected on october 9th 2020 from wwtps a and b were similar to their respective average value during the sampling period so eem spectra of samples collected on this day are shown in fig 2 to exemplify eem comparison of dom between these two wwtps as shown in fig 2 eem spectra were partitioned into regions mentioned in section 2 3 to facilitate organized comparison 31 influent eem spectra of both wwtps fluoresced in all the five regions with the strongest fluorescence in region iv representing richness of proteins and amino acid fig 2 a and e which was in good agreement with eem characteristics of sanitary sewage i e the identical origin of influent of both wwtps 46 corresponding regional fluorescence intensity reduction rates were different for these two wwtps as shown in fig 3 a for a2owtf wwtp a normalized eem volumes of all five eem regions decreased obviously from influent to final effluent but for mbr wwtp b obvious reduction of normalized eem volumes was only found in regions i ii and iv while regions iii and v exhibited almost no reduction fig 3 b sand filtration and membrane separation reduced a very small amount of eem volume in all five regions fig 3 which indicated that most dom was removed during secondary biotreatment units rather than tertiary separation wwtps a and b had similar φ i n and φ iv n removal rates but average removal rates of φ ii n φ iii n and φ v n for a2owtf wwtp a were 70 3 66 5 and 61 0 while corresponding rates for mbr wwtp b were merely 33 4 1 3 and 7 3 fig 3 p iii n and p v n together similarly constituted 34 and 35 of total eem volume in influent spectra of wwtps a and b respectively in final effluent corresponding ratios became 48 and 60 supplementary material fig s1 these revealed lower removal capacity of φ iii n and φ v n respectively representing concentration of fulvic acid like and humic acid like hs 3 22 by mbr wwtp b compared with a2owtf wwtp a it could be inferred that poorer removal of hs led to worse doc removal of mbr wwtp b section 3 1 hs are mainly removed by hydrophobic adsorption onto activated sludge which functions in both mbr and conventional a2o processes 47 49 it has been demonstrated that 60 70 of hs in wastewater can be adsorbed on the activated sludge flocs 48 φ iii n and φ v n removal rates of a2owtf wwtp a was respectively 66 5 and 61 0 which fell within the above range fig 3 a corresponding rates of mbr wwtp b were unexpectedly lower than even 10 fig 3 b supplementary material table s3 listed some operating parameters of wwtps a and b mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of mbr wwtp b 8 6 g l is more than twice that of a2owtf wwtp a 4 2 g l theoretically higher activated sludge concentration means higher hs adsorption capacity and higher φ iii n and φ v n removal for mbr wwtp b which was proved otherwise by observation in this study the unexpected difference between phenomena and theory requires further characterization to explain eem spectra in this study were also analyzed by parafac residual and split half analyses revealed that a 4 component parafac model could well describe eem spectra of both wwtps the parafac components were named c1 c4 fig 4 wwtps a and b c1 resembled each other ex peak 250 400 nm em peak 400 450 nm they both revealed highly humified feature and was likely to originate from tap water 50 wwtps a and b c2 also shared high similarity ex peak around 280 nm em peak around 315 nm this fluorophore was related to tyrosine like fluorescence typical in sanitary sewage 46 c1 and c2 represented dom components brought into both wwtps through influent c3 and c4 of wwtps a and b differed significantly a2owtf wwtp a c3 showed proteinic and tryptophan like fluorescence em peak 380 nm fig 4 a which indicated recent autochthonous microbially produced proteinic dom components 46 51 52 on the contrary mbr wwtp b c3 with em peak around 400 nm fig 4 b was obviously humic and fulvic like fluorophore dominant in wastewater dom which originated from microbial metabolism 46 53 wwtps a and b c4 revealed highly humified fluorophores with em peak 450 nm 31 but mbr wwtp b c4 exhibited three humic like fluorophores while a2owtf wwtp a c4 only exhibited one there was also a proteinic fluorophore em peak 300 nm fig 4 a 31 in a2owtf wwtp a c4 according to parafac results it could be concluded that dom variation mechanism in conventional a2o and mbr processes differed significantly c3 and c4 featuring dom variation in mbr process fig 4 b only revealed humic fluorophores so that much higher degree of dom humification happened during mbr process it was reasonable to deduce that hs generation led to poorer reduction of φ iii n φ v n by mbr fig 3 a vs b qualitative parafac analysis lacked quantifiable results to verify such deduction more quantitative information on dom variation was discussed on the basis of hpsec comparison section 3 4 3 3 uv vis spectroscopic comparison there was no distinct difference in uv vis spectral pattern and variation trend between samples collected from the same process unit and wwtp but in different months so samples collected on october 9th 2020 from wwtps a and b were used to exemplify uv vis spectroscopic comparison uv vis spectra of influent aeration effluent and sand filtration membrane separation effluent were selected to reveal dom characteristics of raw wastewater secondary biotreatment effluent and tertiary advanced separation effluent uv vis spectra of all samples were nearly featureless except for their absorbance monotonically decreased with increasing wavelength it was hard to obtain information on dom variation characteristics of conventional a2o and mbr through direct observation and comparison on untreated uv vis spectra supplementary material fig s2 dom uv vis spectra are superpositions of individual componential chromophore spectra which make them incapable of directly characterizing specific components 27 therefore uv vis spectra in this study were deconvoluted with peakfit software to reveal variation trend of absorption bands representing dom components horizontal ordinate unit of uv vis spectra was transformed from wavelength nm to wavenumber cm 1 and then deconvoluted with gaussian fitting fig 5 modeled spectra well agreed with the observed spectra r2 0 99 detailed information of deconvoluted bands was listed in supplementary material table s4 nitrate no3 generated during biological nitrification will interfere with dom uv vis spectra by sharply increasing absorbance at short wavelengths which obscures spectral variation of dom 27 uv vis spectra of nitrate are featured by a single peak around 200 nm corresponding to 50 000 cm 1 supplementary material fig s3 as shown in supplementary material table s4 gaussian deconvolution results of each sample included a band peaked around 50 000 cm 1 band p17 p10 p9 of a2owtf wwtp a influent aeration effluent sand filtration effluent respectively and p17 p13 p12 of mbr wwtp b influent aeration effluent membrane effluent respectively which revealed that gaussian deconvolution separated adsorption band and removed interference of nitrate position and number of deconvoluted bands of wwtps a and b influent uv vis spectra were nearly identical supplementary material table s4 this indicated the same influent dom composition of these two wwtps the number of deconvoluted bands all decreased in final effluent of both wwtps which indicated consistent reduction of dom component categories after both mbr and a2owtf processing but for either aeration or filtration membrane effluent more bands can be deconvoluted from mbr wwtp b spectra than a2owtf wwtp a spectra fig 5 b c vs e f this revealed more complex dom composition within mbr compared with a2owtf previous studies reported risks of dom discharged from wwtps into aquatic environment including direct cytotoxicity formation of dbps and so on 54 55 a more complex dom composition in mbr effluent revealed by uv vis spectroscopic deconvolution in this study meant more unknown chemical species which will potentially bring about higher ecological risks supplementary material table s4 showed that deconvoluted bands of effluent uv vis spectra of a2owtf wwtp a had peak wavenumbers over 29 000 cm 1 while mbr wwtp b effluent spectra exhibited deconvoluted bands with wavenumbers under 29 000 cm 1 29 000 cm 1 corresponds to wavelength of about 345 nm so that mbr wwtp b effluent dom had more components with adsorption peaks over 345 nm organics with absorbance over 345 nm are mostly polyaromatic or highly unsaturated hs 27 it was also revealed by uv vis spectroscopic characterization that mbr process would result in more abundant hs in effluent which was proved by eem characterization section 3 2 3 4 hpsec comparison spectroscopic partition and characterization of dom components were relatively qualitative indirect incomplete and ambiguous which hindered detailed analyses on dom variation to achieve deeper insight into and more quantitative analyses on dom component variation in conventional a2o and mbr processes samples from wwtps a and b were analyzed by hpsec which was based on direct chromatographic separation with uva210 uva254 and doc detection uri and suva chromatograms were also derived fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 d e i and j removal rates of chromatographic fractions after specific process units were calculated with different indexes fig 7 chromatograms of samples from the same process units and wwtp but at different dates revealed high similarity so chromatograms of samples collected on october 9th 2020 were used to exemplify comparison as shown in fig 6 influent chromatograms of wwtps a and b were almost identical in chromatographic pattern which again proved their highly similar influent dom composition chromatograms of both wwtps were partitioned into five fractions according to the clear boundaries between chromatographic peaks elution times as fraction dividing lines for both wwtps were the same fraction i 10 27 min fraction ii 27 39 min fraction iii 39 44 min fraction iv 44 51 min fraction v 51 110 min fraction v was further separated into fractions v 1 and v 2 with 80 min as dividing line because nitrate generated during treatment was chromatographically separated into fraction v 1 and interfered with dom characterization supplementary material fig s7 hpsec is able to separate complex dom mixtures into components with specific chemical properties 56 57 fraction i of both wwtps influent consisted of large molecular size substances with distinct and high peaks in uva210 uva254 doc and uri chromatograms but suva chromatographic response was low fig 6 these revealed that influent dom fraction i had low aromaticity and was rich in non aromatic oxygen nitrogen containing functional groups which pointed to that its major chemical composition were biopolymers like protein and polysaccharides for both wwtps 57 for following process units chromatographic characteristics of wwtps a and b in fraction i differed significantly intense uva and uri peaks disappeared in fraction i of wwtp a anoxia and subsequent process unit chromatograms supplementary material figs s4 s6 a b and d while only doc chromatographic peaks with much weaker intensity remained supplementary material figs s4 s6 c this revealed that the a2owtf process effectively removed protein and polysaccharides in wwtp a influent previous studies also reported the high biodegradability of protein and polysaccharides during wastewater treatment 23 33 on the contrary wwtp b chromatographic fraction i continued to exhibit strong peaks in uva210 uva254 doc and uri chromatograms of anoxia and aeration units supplementary material figs s4 and s5 f i these strong peaks all disappeared in membrane effluent chromatograms supplementary material fig s6 f i the chromatographic variation above revealed low removal rates by biotreatment units of mbr on protein and polysaccharides which could only be removed by mechanical membrane separation these phenomena contradicted with strong microbial degradation capacity of mbr due to higher biomass and high bioavailability of protein and polysaccharides 3 33 average fraction i uri value of mbr wwtp b anoxia and aeration chromatograms were higher than that of influent supplementary material table s5 11 22 and 9 86 vs 7 02 which indicated that protein and polysaccharides in effluent of mbr process units had different chemical properties from those in influent so the apparently and unexpectedly refractory proteins and polysaccharides persisted in biotreatment units of mbr were generated during process rather than remained from influent actually the high persistence of protein and polysaccharides is the result of complicated factors first membrane sieving can accumulate undegraded protein and polysaccharides which are of large molecular size in the mbr process 58 second extracellular polymeric substances eps in activated sludge are rich in protein and polysaccharides eps have been reported to be released into mbr supernatant due to higher shearing stress resulting from higher aeration intensity 59 60 it could be inferred that stripped eps from activated sludge caused persistence of protein and polysaccharides third longer srt can lead to higher degradation and lower concentration of protein and polysaccharides in mbr process and vice versa 61 the srt of mbr wwtp b in this study could be too short to let the activated sludge completely degrade protein and polysaccharides fourth low f m condition in mbr process will cause massive production of smps rich in polysaccharides 62 such condition will also lead to the lesser production of the enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides from activated sludge 63 these will cause inertness of polysaccharides in mbr process overall generation and retention of protein and polysaccharides counteracted their degradation and finally resulted in apparently lower removal rates of chromatographic fraction i in biotreatment units of mbr compared with a2owtf aeration effluent doc removal rate 95 0 vs 58 7 fig 7 a vs g the corresponding differences in uva210 removal rate of these two kinds of processes were much more obvious aeration effluent uva210 removal rate 87 8 vs 7 9 fig 7 a vs g because of stronger uv absorption of non humic protein and polysaccharides at shorter wavelengths 42 the lower removal of protein and polysaccharides during mbr biotreatment units was undetectable by spectroscopic characterization in previous sections the persistent large molecular protein and polysaccharides for mbr wwtp b are disadvantageous because they are major membrane foulants which will significantly increase the operation cost of mbr on membrane cleaning 64 65 chromatographic fraction ii and iii have been reported to be hs and building blocks containing hs of smaller size respectively 57 relatively flat uri chromatograms with low value fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 d and i and peaky suva chromatograms with high value fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 e and j of fractions ii and iii also proved components in these two fractions of both wwtps to be aromatic and humic like 42 differences in removal characteristics of these two fractions between wwtps a and b were the most prominent among all fractions for fractions ii and iii a2owtf wwtp a exhibited increasing removal rates from anoxia to sand filtration units in all indexes fig 7 b and c this revealed overall reduction of hs in conventional a2o process but mbr wwtp b only exhibited about half the doc removal rates for fractions ii and iii compared with a2owtf wwtp a 53 2 vs 26 9 fig 7 b vs h 48 9 vs 24 7 fig 7 c vs i there were even obviously negative fraction ii uva210 and uva254 removal rates indicating generation of hs for wwtp b anoxia and aeration chromatograms fig 7 h the negative value only slightly decreased after membrane separation which indicated low removal of hs by membrane filtration fig 7 h uva254 chromatographic removal rates variation of fraction iii followed the same trend as fraction ii but some non aromatic biodegradable polyprotic acids with strong uv absorption at short wavelengths like 210 nm also eluted into fraction iii due to ionic repulsion revealed by a weak uri peak in fraction iii of influent chromatograms fig 6 d and i so that uva210 removal rates were positive along the process for this fraction of wwtp b fig 7 i 57 chromatographic variation characteristics of mbr wwtp b fractions ii and iii revealed that large amounts of hs generated during mbr process which could account for unexpectedly low hs like eem volume φ iii n and φ v n removal discovered in section 3 2 hs existed in fractions iv and v 2 with distinct suva chromatographic peaks fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 j removal by sludge adsorption indeed happened in mbr process revealed by positive uva254 chromatographic removal rate fig 7 j and l but was counteracted by the mass production of hs existed in fractions ii and iii during biotreatment units membrane separation exhibited little effect in removing hs in fractions ii and iii fig 7 h and i these factors resulted in apparently constant hs like eem volume φ iii n and φ v n indicating constant hs concentration in final effluent chromatographic fractions iv of wwtps a and b influent contained non aromatic and low molecular weight organic acids which were highly biodegradable 57 this composition characteristic was revealed by prominent uri chromatographic peak with high value in fraction iv fig 6 d and i 42 but fraction iv removal rates differed significantly between these two wwtps a2owtf wwtp a revealed higher removal rates for fraction iv in all indexes than mbr wwtp b more than 60 vs less than 50 fig 7 d vs j it was noteworthy that average uri value kept growing during biotreatment of both wwtps with a higher increasing extent for mbr wwtp b supplementary material table s5 this indicated new substances generated during conventional a2o and mbr with more robust generation for mbr utilization associated products uaps derived from substrate biodegradation could account for the origin of newly generated substances in fraction iv uaps are of low molecular weight and rich in aromatic proteins peptides and amino acids 62 66 they tend to elute into fraction iv due to size exclusion and ionic repulsion and exhibited strong absorption in low wavelength range correspondingly high uri 42 57 persistently higher protein and polysaccharides accumulated in fraction i fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s5 h concentration in mbr process provided with more substrate to generate uaps which counteracted removal of components in fraction iv and resulted in low fraction iv removal rates for mbr a prominent negative valley was at the boundary of fraction iv and v which was referred to as salt boundary 67 dom eluted after salt boundary were separated on mechanisms more than size exclusion such as hydrophobic interaction and so on 57 prominent uva210 and uva254 peaks in fraction v 1 appeared in anoxia and subsequent process units chromatograms which were proved to be signal of nitrate supplementary material fig s7 nitrate generation resulted in very negative uva210 chromatographic removal rates of fraction v 1 fig 7 e and k which made dom information acquisition from fraction v 1 hard fraction v 2 suva chromatograms of all samples exhibited peaks with high values which revealed abundance of hydrophobic hs in fraction v 2 final removal rates of fraction v 2 were identical for a2owtf wwtp a and mbr wwtp b fig 7 g vs l but fraction v 2 removal rates of wwtp b in all indexes increased after membrane separation fig 7 l this also reflected lower efficiency of biotreatment units of mbr in removing hs compared with conventional a2o 3 5 thmfp comparison chemical composition of dom within effluent of wwtps a and b was proved to be very different by spectroscopic and chromatographic comparison in this study thm accounts for the most significant proportion of total dbps generated during water disinfection 68 so thmfp of final effluent from wwtps a and b were measured to reveal their potential difference in dbps formation derived from their unique dom composition it was noteworthy that effluent thmfp was higher for mbr wwtp b than a2owtf wwtp a fig 8 this meant more dbps generation and higher potential ecological risks after disinfection process of mbr wwtp b as effluent doc concentration of both wwtps were similar as revealed in section 3 2 eem φ iii n revealing fulvic acid like hs concentration reduced little from influent to filtration effluent for mbr wwtp b while corresponding reduction rate for a2owtf wwtp a was much higher fig 3 fulvic acid like hs are the main precursors of thm due to their abundance of polyhydroxyaromatic moieties 32 36 as a result thmfp of mbr wwtp b was higher than that of a2owtf wwtp a it was proved in section 3 4 that unchanged φ iii n for mbr wwtp b is a result of its unique massive production of smps which could not be filtered out by membrane especially hs reflected by negative chromatographic removal rates of hpsec fractions ii and iii fig 7 h and i previous studies categorized part of smps released during biomass decay in the endogenous phase as biomass associated products baps 66 69 baps are of large molecular size and rich in hs 62 69 70 so higher baps generation could account for the unique massive hs production found in mbr wwtp b this conjecture could be supported by the different operating conditions of wwtps a and b the sludge concentration of mbr wwtp b was much higher than a2owtf wwtp a and its corresponding f m was much lower supplementary material table s3 which kept microbes in mbr wwtp b in endogenous phase and made them easy to undergo cell lysis 61 baps in the microbes would hence enter dom entirety of mbr wwtp b and increase the content ratio of hs which resulted in the high effluent thmfp lowering sludge concentration to increase f m may alleviate endogenous smps release problem for mbr and reduce the concentration of dbps precursors 71 but this will increase the reactor area and reduce srt which will impair the comparative advantages of mbr over conventional a2o 3 moreover there is no reference for deciding the optimum sludge concentration for mbr according to the wastewater influent characteristics the more practical measure for reducing the precursor of dbps in mbr should be adding more advanced treatment process units e g activated carbon adsorption to remove such precursors before disinfection 72 4 conclusions this study compared dom variation characteristics of conventional a2o and mbr through case study on typical full scale wwtps combination of conventional wastewater quality indexes eem and uv vis spectroscopic analyses and hpsec characterization gradually revealed differences between dom variation of conventional a2o and mbr from phenomena to deeper mechanism which helped in acquisition of rich information for comprehensive and objective comparison between effectiveness of conventional a2o and mbr conveniently it is revealed in this study that in practical application operational characteristics of mbr may bring about release of endogenous organic matter which will result in its disadvantage in dom removal compared with conventional a2o unique persistent protein and polysaccharides with large molecular size in mbr process could be well removed by membrane interception fig 7 g still these membrane retained substances were also severe membrane foulants hs concentration increase unique to mbr which led to much higher thmfp for mbr effluent was found in this study and deduced to result from bap released in endogenous phase due to high sludge concentration and low f m of mbr it was also revealed by uv vis characterization that dom composition in mbr effluent might be more complex fig 5 which was possible to bring about some unknown side effects up to now there is no standard or study on determining adequate operation parameters e g sludge concentration for retaining the advantage of mbr while avoiding potentially concomitant adverse effects mentioned above membrane separation in mbr can efficiently trap some particulate organic matter and reduce total pollutant concentration in final effluent but this also can be achieved by adding filtration facilities into conventional a2o which is much cheaper 3 the performance of mbr and conventional a2o processes treating municipal wastewater in practical application was comprehensively compared from the perspective of dom compositional characteristics for the first time in this study such comparison provided novel insight into the effect of operating municipal wwtps with expensive mbr which was considered to be more advanced than conventional a2o the significant conclusion from this study is that mbr potentially has some inherent problems in terms of dom removal which are hard to solve and have no existence for conventional a2o but adopting mbr to upgrade municipal wwtps is still prevailing 73 74 results from this study can urge researchers engineers and investors to take more caution with this trend when there is no limit such as shortage of land 3 conventional a2o in tandem with tertiary treatment facilities like filters should be better for

potential thmfp for final effluent than a2owtf in conclusion mbr should be prudently considered in terms of dom removal for municipal wwtp upgrading graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic anoxic oxic process with tertiary filtration membrane bioreactor dissolved organic matter variation spectroscopic characterization chromatographic characterization 1 introduction aquatic environment pollution is an urgent issue so that countries worldwide are devoting efforts to wastewater treatment 1 for example the chinese government is implementing stricter sewage discharge standards nationwide 2 with the tightening legislation more wastewater treatment plants wwtps are upgraded with more advanced but expensive treatment processes anaerobic anoxic oxic process a2o with common gravity sludge sedimentation is most widely used in municipal wastewater treatment due to its cost performance balance 3 the membrane bioreactor mbr can be treated as an improvement to the conventional a2o which also requires higher investment it combines activated sludge treatment and membrane separation to fulfill high concentration of biomass and independent control of sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt 3 4 theoretically higher srt higher sludge concentration and membrane interception should lead to much better pollutant removal performance for mbr to date literature comparing mbr and conventional a2o processes have focused on micropollutant removal performance 5 10 bacterial community and activity 11 13 nitrification efficiency 13 14 sludge characteristic 15 16 and so on nitrification performance is better for mbr than conventional a2o due to the enhanced accumulation of slow growing nitrifiers 3 13 14 mbr has shown better performance in removing limited types of micropollutants 5 6 residual sludge from mbr has poorer dewaterability 15 comprehensively speaking mbr may not have theoretically overwhelming advantages over conventional a2o further comparison is needed for objective evaluation on the effect of process improvement from conventional a2o to mbr which will provide the basis for judging whether pollutant reduction performance of mbr deserves its high cost dissolved organic matter dom is the collective term for dissolved organic pollutants to be removed in wastewater treatment process which are heterogeneous and complex 3 17 detailed characterization of dom variation in mbr and conventional a2o will advance the knowledge on their respective mechanisms on organic pollutants removal which to the best of our knowledge has been rarely investigated 18 no comparative studies of dom variation between full scale mbr and conventional a2o wwtps have been performed yet the combination of chromatographic and molecular spectroscopic specifically refer to uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry in this study techniques is widely used in dom characterization to gather comprehensive and detailed information on complex dom chemical composition more conveniently and cheaply 19 21 they are also more suitable for frequent dom monitoring in this study than other laborious and expensive characterization methods such as resin separation gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr 22 high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec which has advantages over other analytical techniques in minimal pretreatment high usability low cost and fast speed 22 is commonly used to separate dom into fractions 23 25 multiple detectors e g uv fluorescence and dissolved organic carbon doc detectors after chromatographic separation offer more organized fractional information on complex dom 26 uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry have been widely utilized in dom studies due to their fast responses low cost ease of use and high sensitivity 27 28 they can also provide rich chemical information of dom 29 31 chlorination has been widely used as a disinfection method for controlling pathogens in the effluent of wwtps that contains abundant and complex organic matter 3 so disinfection processes of wwtps which use chlorine are sure to bring about formation of genotoxic and carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps which are of concern for the reclamation and ecological safety of wwtp effluent 32 dom in wastewater treatment process is rich in dbps precursors 32 for example humic like substances hs were found to constitute a large portion of dom entirety in municipal wwtp effluent 33 34 they are rich in polyhydroxyaromatic and unsaturated moieties which tend to react with disinfectants and produce dbps 35 especially trihalomethanes thms 36 different wastewater treatment processes have their own internal dom composition which will lead to their different dbps formation characteristics 37 so dbps formation of effluent is also a meaningful factor related to dom for evaluating the efficiency of different wastewater treatment processes in this study dom variation characteristics and resultant effect such as dbps formation in two typical full scale wwtps operating with conventional anaerobic anoxic oxic process with tertiary filtration a2owtf and mbr respectively were compared convenient characterization methods including hpsec uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry were used to reveal differences in efficiency and mechanism of dom removal between these two kinds of processes the results from this study are expected to help achieve an objective comparison between the performance of conventional a2o and mbr from the perspective of dom variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and sample preparation water samples were taken from municipal wwtps changzhou city china operating a2owtf 119 50 30 e 31 56 50 n wwtp a and mbr 119 52 7 e 31 45 48 n wwtp b processes respectively flow chart shown in fig 1 sampling periods were july october 2020 and january april 2021 representing four seasons 3 samples sets each set included whole process samples from different dates were taken in each of the 4 sampling months so for either of the two wwtps there were totally 12 samples sets corresponding to 12 sampling days influent anoxia aeration and sand filtration effluent were sampled from a2owtf wwtp a identical hpsec chromatograms excitation emission matrix eem spectra and uv vis spectra of corresponding wwtp a aeration and high density sedimentation effluent data not shown revealed that high density sedimentation made no change to dom composition so that it was not sampled for study influent anoxia aeration and membrane effluent were sampled from mbr wwtp b the time interval between sampling events for two adjacent process units equaled the hrt in between all the samples were filtered on site through 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filters cnw germany pre washed with 10 ml ultrapure water the first few ml of the filtrate was discarded filtered samples were stored in glass vials at 4 c prior to analyses completed within two days after sampling 2 2 bulk water quality indexes measurement water quality indexes such as doc total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 n and ammonia nh3 n were measured according to chinese nepa standard methods 38 doc concentrations were measured as non purgeable organic carbon with shimadzu toc analyzer 2 3 spectroscopic characterization uv vis spectra 190 450 nm were measured with a dr6000 spectrometer hach usa in 1 cm quartz cuvette milli q ultrapure water was used as reference the absorption bands in uv vis spectra were deconvoluted by gaussian fitting with peakfit v4 12 to investigate the changes of dom composition the number of deconvoluted bands reflects the number of chemical species within dom entirety while center wavelength of each band reflects the chemical property of specific organic substance related to this band 39 fluorescence eems were measured with a fluorescence spectrometer f 2700 hitachi japan and 1 cm quartz cuvette the emission wavelengths em ranged from 240 nm to 550 nm with 2 nm increment and the excitation wavelengths ex ranged from 240 nm to 450 nm with 5 nm increment eem spectra were analyzed by the fluorescence regional integration fri method which divided eem into five regions representing different components of dom fig 2 31 region i aromatic proteins of smaller molecular size region ii aromatic proteins of larger molecular size region iii fulvic acid like substances region iv soluble microbial byproducts smps proteins polypeptides and amino acid like substances region v humic acid like substances normalized eem volume φ i n and percent fluorescence response p i n at region i which reveals concentration of different dom components are calculated according to methods from a previous study 31 eem volume removal rates of different regions at different process units used the corresponding volume of influent samples as comparison parallel factor parafac analyses for the eem spectra were performed with the domfluor toolbox run by matlab 2018 40 parafac could decompose whole dom eem into fluorescence components reflecting organic compounds of different chemical properties that were mixed in dom entirety which helps to dissect dom s complex compositional characteristics series of criteria such as loading and leverage inspection residual analysis split half analysis and random analysis were used to check input and output data to ensure the validity of parafac results samples with too high uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 were diluted to uva254 0 05 measured with 1 cm cuvette before eem measurement for parafac analyses to avoid inner filter effect 41 2 4 hpsec characterization lc 2030 shimadzu japan chromatograph with uv detector spd 6a shimadzu japan was used in this study the detection wavelengths were 210 and 254 nm an m9 online toc analyzer ge usa was connected in tandem with chromatograph the column with size of 250 20 mm was packed with toyopearl hw 50s resin tosoh japan phosphate buffer 2 5 g kh2po4 1 5 g na2hpo4 2h2o diluted into 1 l ultrapure water fluka germany was used as eluent ph 6 85 at flow rate of 1 0 ml min sample injection volume was 1000 μl chromatographic area of specific hpsec fraction represents the concentration of specific fraction of dom so removal rates of different dom fractions were calculated with chromatographic area by eq 1 1 removal rate 1 a eff a inf 100 where ainf and aeff are the chromatographic areas of certain hpsec fraction of initial influent samples and effluent samples from specific process units respectively uv absorbance ratio index uri and specific uv absorbance suva can provide information for classification and comparison on dom components of different chemical properties which were separated by hpsec uri of substances eluted at specific time on hpsec chromatogram was calculated as the ratio of chromatographic uv absorbance at 210 nm uva210 to uva254 at the same elution time 42 43 the average uri of certain hpsec fraction for one sample set 12 samples sets in total was calculated by the average value of all data points within certain fraction of uri chromatogram chromatographic fractions with peaky uri chromatogram and higher value correspond to higher content of non humic compounds rich in functional groups containing oxygen and nitrogen in comparison those with peakless flat uri chromatogram and lower value reflect richness in aromatic hs 42 suva of substances eluted at specific time on hpsec chromatogram was calculated as thousandfold multiplied ratio of chromatographic uva254 to doc at the same elution time the suva and uva254 correlate positively with the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of dom chromatographic components 44 2 5 thm formation potential thmfp analysis chlorine was added to water samples stored in pyrex bottles with ptfe lined screw cap at 25 1 c to simulate disinfection process the stock chlorine solution was prepared with sodium hypochlorite scrc china with an active chlorine concentration of 10 0 g l equivalent of cl2 chlorine dosage for each water sample was determined by preliminary test to ensure final free chlorine residue to be at least 1 0 mg l after 72 h after 72 h incubation sodium sulfite scrc china was added stoichiometrically to quench the residual chlorine before timely measurement of total thm tthm chbrcl2 chbr2cl chcl3 chbr3 according to the standard method with gas chromatograph gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu japan 45 total thms concentration was normalized by doc concentration to obtain the thmfp which presents the thm formation reactivity 3 results and discussion 3 1 conventional wastewater quality indexes comparison wastewater quality of the influent and effluent after different process units of wwtps a and b were summarized in supplementary material tables s1 s2 as the two wwtps are all municipal wwtps treating domestic wastewater in the same city the influent doc concentration level of both wwtps resembled each other for both wwtps final effluent quality data were well below discharge limits of china s national discharge standard of pollutants for urban wastewater treatment plants 2 both wwtps in this study operated stably so that they were suitable as the object of this case study wwtps a and b all performed well with tn removal rates over 75 in nutrient removal but doc removal rates representing total dom removal of mbr wwtp b were lower than those of a2owtf wwtp a supplementary material tables s1 s2 mbr is usually regarded to perform better than conventional a2o due to its higher activated sludge concentration and membrane filtration which will metabolize and separate pollutants in wastewater in larger quantities 3 lower doc removal rates of mbr wwtp b in this study were below expectation more advanced characterization on dom sampled from these two wwtps was performed in the following sections to find out the reason for their unexpected different dom removal efficiency 3 2 fluorescence spectroscopic comparison wastewater samples from wwtps a and b were analyzed by fluorescence eem spectrometry eem spectra of samples from the same process unit and wwtp but different months were highly reproducible influent doc concentration of samples collected on october 9th 2020 from wwtps a and b were similar to their respective average value during the sampling period so eem spectra of samples collected on this day are shown in fig 2 to exemplify eem comparison of dom between these two wwtps as shown in fig 2 eem spectra were partitioned into regions mentioned in section 2 3 to facilitate organized comparison 31 influent eem spectra of both wwtps fluoresced in all the five regions with the strongest fluorescence in region iv representing richness of proteins and amino acid fig 2 a and e which was in good agreement with eem characteristics of sanitary sewage i e the identical origin of influent of both wwtps 46 corresponding regional fluorescence intensity reduction rates were different for these two wwtps as shown in fig 3 a for a2owtf wwtp a normalized eem volumes of all five eem regions decreased obviously from influent to final effluent but for mbr wwtp b obvious reduction of normalized eem volumes was only found in regions i ii and iv while regions iii and v exhibited almost no reduction fig 3 b sand filtration and membrane separation reduced a very small amount of eem volume in all five regions fig 3 which indicated that most dom was removed during secondary biotreatment units rather than tertiary separation wwtps a and b had similar φ i n and φ iv n removal rates but average removal rates of φ ii n φ iii n and φ v n for a2owtf wwtp a were 70 3 66 5 and 61 0 while corresponding rates for mbr wwtp b were merely 33 4 1 3 and 7 3 fig 3 p iii n and p v n together similarly constituted 34 and 35 of total eem volume in influent spectra of wwtps a and b respectively in final effluent corresponding ratios became 48 and 60 supplementary material fig s1 these revealed lower removal capacity of φ iii n and φ v n respectively representing concentration of fulvic acid like and humic acid like hs 3 22 by mbr wwtp b compared with a2owtf wwtp a it could be inferred that poorer removal of hs led to worse doc removal of mbr wwtp b section 3 1 hs are mainly removed by hydrophobic adsorption onto activated sludge which functions in both mbr and conventional a2o processes 47 49 it has been demonstrated that 60 70 of hs in wastewater can be adsorbed on the activated sludge flocs 48 φ iii n and φ v n removal rates of a2owtf wwtp a was respectively 66 5 and 61 0 which fell within the above range fig 3 a corresponding rates of mbr wwtp b were unexpectedly lower than even 10 fig 3 b supplementary material table s3 listed some operating parameters of wwtps a and b mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of mbr wwtp b 8 6 g l is more than twice that of a2owtf wwtp a 4 2 g l theoretically higher activated sludge concentration means higher hs adsorption capacity and higher φ iii n and φ v n removal for mbr wwtp b which was proved otherwise by observation in this study the unexpected difference between phenomena and theory requires further characterization to explain eem spectra in this study were also analyzed by parafac residual and split half analyses revealed that a 4 component parafac model could well describe eem spectra of both wwtps the parafac components were named c1 c4 fig 4 wwtps a and b c1 resembled each other ex peak 250 400 nm em peak 400 450 nm they both revealed highly humified feature and was likely to originate from tap water 50 wwtps a and b c2 also shared high similarity ex peak around 280 nm em peak around 315 nm this fluorophore was related to tyrosine like fluorescence typical in sanitary sewage 46 c1 and c2 represented dom components brought into both wwtps through influent c3 and c4 of wwtps a and b differed significantly a2owtf wwtp a c3 showed proteinic and tryptophan like fluorescence em peak 380 nm fig 4 a which indicated recent autochthonous microbially produced proteinic dom components 46 51 52 on the contrary mbr wwtp b c3 with em peak around 400 nm fig 4 b was obviously humic and fulvic like fluorophore dominant in wastewater dom which originated from microbial metabolism 46 53 wwtps a and b c4 revealed highly humified fluorophores with em peak 450 nm 31 but mbr wwtp b c4 exhibited three humic like fluorophores while a2owtf wwtp a c4 only exhibited one there was also a proteinic fluorophore em peak 300 nm fig 4 a 31 in a2owtf wwtp a c4 according to parafac results it could be concluded that dom variation mechanism in conventional a2o and mbr processes differed significantly c3 and c4 featuring dom variation in mbr process fig 4 b only revealed humic fluorophores so that much higher degree of dom humification happened during mbr process it was reasonable to deduce that hs generation led to poorer reduction of φ iii n φ v n by mbr fig 3 a vs b qualitative parafac analysis lacked quantifiable results to verify such deduction more quantitative information on dom variation was discussed on the basis of hpsec comparison section 3 4 3 3 uv vis spectroscopic comparison there was no distinct difference in uv vis spectral pattern and variation trend between samples collected from the same process unit and wwtp but in different months so samples collected on october 9th 2020 from wwtps a and b were used to exemplify uv vis spectroscopic comparison uv vis spectra of influent aeration effluent and sand filtration membrane separation effluent were selected to reveal dom characteristics of raw wastewater secondary biotreatment effluent and tertiary advanced separation effluent uv vis spectra of all samples were nearly featureless except for their absorbance monotonically decreased with increasing wavelength it was hard to obtain information on dom variation characteristics of conventional a2o and mbr through direct observation and comparison on untreated uv vis spectra supplementary material fig s2 dom uv vis spectra are superpositions of individual componential chromophore spectra which make them incapable of directly characterizing specific components 27 therefore uv vis spectra in this study were deconvoluted with peakfit software to reveal variation trend of absorption bands representing dom components horizontal ordinate unit of uv vis spectra was transformed from wavelength nm to wavenumber cm 1 and then deconvoluted with gaussian fitting fig 5 modeled spectra well agreed with the observed spectra r2 0 99 detailed information of deconvoluted bands was listed in supplementary material table s4 nitrate no3 generated during biological nitrification will interfere with dom uv vis spectra by sharply increasing absorbance at short wavelengths which obscures spectral variation of dom 27 uv vis spectra of nitrate are featured by a single peak around 200 nm corresponding to 50 000 cm 1 supplementary material fig s3 as shown in supplementary material table s4 gaussian deconvolution results of each sample included a band peaked around 50 000 cm 1 band p17 p10 p9 of a2owtf wwtp a influent aeration effluent sand filtration effluent respectively and p17 p13 p12 of mbr wwtp b influent aeration effluent membrane effluent respectively which revealed that gaussian deconvolution separated adsorption band and removed interference of nitrate position and number of deconvoluted bands of wwtps a and b influent uv vis spectra were nearly identical supplementary material table s4 this indicated the same influent dom composition of these two wwtps the number of deconvoluted bands all decreased in final effluent of both wwtps which indicated consistent reduction of dom component categories after both mbr and a2owtf processing but for either aeration or filtration membrane effluent more bands can be deconvoluted from mbr wwtp b spectra than a2owtf wwtp a spectra fig 5 b c vs e f this revealed more complex dom composition within mbr compared with a2owtf previous studies reported risks of dom discharged from wwtps into aquatic environment including direct cytotoxicity formation of dbps and so on 54 55 a more complex dom composition in mbr effluent revealed by uv vis spectroscopic deconvolution in this study meant more unknown chemical species which will potentially bring about higher ecological risks supplementary material table s4 showed that deconvoluted bands of effluent uv vis spectra of a2owtf wwtp a had peak wavenumbers over 29 000 cm 1 while mbr wwtp b effluent spectra exhibited deconvoluted bands with wavenumbers under 29 000 cm 1 29 000 cm 1 corresponds to wavelength of about 345 nm so that mbr wwtp b effluent dom had more components with adsorption peaks over 345 nm organics with absorbance over 345 nm are mostly polyaromatic or highly unsaturated hs 27 it was also revealed by uv vis spectroscopic characterization that mbr process would result in more abundant hs in effluent which was proved by eem characterization section 3 2 3 4 hpsec comparison spectroscopic partition and characterization of dom components were relatively qualitative indirect incomplete and ambiguous which hindered detailed analyses on dom variation to achieve deeper insight into and more quantitative analyses on dom component variation in conventional a2o and mbr processes samples from wwtps a and b were analyzed by hpsec which was based on direct chromatographic separation with uva210 uva254 and doc detection uri and suva chromatograms were also derived fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 d e i and j removal rates of chromatographic fractions after specific process units were calculated with different indexes fig 7 chromatograms of samples from the same process units and wwtp but at different dates revealed high similarity so chromatograms of samples collected on october 9th 2020 were used to exemplify comparison as shown in fig 6 influent chromatograms of wwtps a and b were almost identical in chromatographic pattern which again proved their highly similar influent dom composition chromatograms of both wwtps were partitioned into five fractions according to the clear boundaries between chromatographic peaks elution times as fraction dividing lines for both wwtps were the same fraction i 10 27 min fraction ii 27 39 min fraction iii 39 44 min fraction iv 44 51 min fraction v 51 110 min fraction v was further separated into fractions v 1 and v 2 with 80 min as dividing line because nitrate generated during treatment was chromatographically separated into fraction v 1 and interfered with dom characterization supplementary material fig s7 hpsec is able to separate complex dom mixtures into components with specific chemical properties 56 57 fraction i of both wwtps influent consisted of large molecular size substances with distinct and high peaks in uva210 uva254 doc and uri chromatograms but suva chromatographic response was low fig 6 these revealed that influent dom fraction i had low aromaticity and was rich in non aromatic oxygen nitrogen containing functional groups which pointed to that its major chemical composition were biopolymers like protein and polysaccharides for both wwtps 57 for following process units chromatographic characteristics of wwtps a and b in fraction i differed significantly intense uva and uri peaks disappeared in fraction i of wwtp a anoxia and subsequent process unit chromatograms supplementary material figs s4 s6 a b and d while only doc chromatographic peaks with much weaker intensity remained supplementary material figs s4 s6 c this revealed that the a2owtf process effectively removed protein and polysaccharides in wwtp a influent previous studies also reported the high biodegradability of protein and polysaccharides during wastewater treatment 23 33 on the contrary wwtp b chromatographic fraction i continued to exhibit strong peaks in uva210 uva254 doc and uri chromatograms of anoxia and aeration units supplementary material figs s4 and s5 f i these strong peaks all disappeared in membrane effluent chromatograms supplementary material fig s6 f i the chromatographic variation above revealed low removal rates by biotreatment units of mbr on protein and polysaccharides which could only be removed by mechanical membrane separation these phenomena contradicted with strong microbial degradation capacity of mbr due to higher biomass and high bioavailability of protein and polysaccharides 3 33 average fraction i uri value of mbr wwtp b anoxia and aeration chromatograms were higher than that of influent supplementary material table s5 11 22 and 9 86 vs 7 02 which indicated that protein and polysaccharides in effluent of mbr process units had different chemical properties from those in influent so the apparently and unexpectedly refractory proteins and polysaccharides persisted in biotreatment units of mbr were generated during process rather than remained from influent actually the high persistence of protein and polysaccharides is the result of complicated factors first membrane sieving can accumulate undegraded protein and polysaccharides which are of large molecular size in the mbr process 58 second extracellular polymeric substances eps in activated sludge are rich in protein and polysaccharides eps have been reported to be released into mbr supernatant due to higher shearing stress resulting from higher aeration intensity 59 60 it could be inferred that stripped eps from activated sludge caused persistence of protein and polysaccharides third longer srt can lead to higher degradation and lower concentration of protein and polysaccharides in mbr process and vice versa 61 the srt of mbr wwtp b in this study could be too short to let the activated sludge completely degrade protein and polysaccharides fourth low f m condition in mbr process will cause massive production of smps rich in polysaccharides 62 such condition will also lead to the lesser production of the enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides from activated sludge 63 these will cause inertness of polysaccharides in mbr process overall generation and retention of protein and polysaccharides counteracted their degradation and finally resulted in apparently lower removal rates of chromatographic fraction i in biotreatment units of mbr compared with a2owtf aeration effluent doc removal rate 95 0 vs 58 7 fig 7 a vs g the corresponding differences in uva210 removal rate of these two kinds of processes were much more obvious aeration effluent uva210 removal rate 87 8 vs 7 9 fig 7 a vs g because of stronger uv absorption of non humic protein and polysaccharides at shorter wavelengths 42 the lower removal of protein and polysaccharides during mbr biotreatment units was undetectable by spectroscopic characterization in previous sections the persistent large molecular protein and polysaccharides for mbr wwtp b are disadvantageous because they are major membrane foulants which will significantly increase the operation cost of mbr on membrane cleaning 64 65 chromatographic fraction ii and iii have been reported to be hs and building blocks containing hs of smaller size respectively 57 relatively flat uri chromatograms with low value fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 d and i and peaky suva chromatograms with high value fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 e and j of fractions ii and iii also proved components in these two fractions of both wwtps to be aromatic and humic like 42 differences in removal characteristics of these two fractions between wwtps a and b were the most prominent among all fractions for fractions ii and iii a2owtf wwtp a exhibited increasing removal rates from anoxia to sand filtration units in all indexes fig 7 b and c this revealed overall reduction of hs in conventional a2o process but mbr wwtp b only exhibited about half the doc removal rates for fractions ii and iii compared with a2owtf wwtp a 53 2 vs 26 9 fig 7 b vs h 48 9 vs 24 7 fig 7 c vs i there were even obviously negative fraction ii uva210 and uva254 removal rates indicating generation of hs for wwtp b anoxia and aeration chromatograms fig 7 h the negative value only slightly decreased after membrane separation which indicated low removal of hs by membrane filtration fig 7 h uva254 chromatographic removal rates variation of fraction iii followed the same trend as fraction ii but some non aromatic biodegradable polyprotic acids with strong uv absorption at short wavelengths like 210 nm also eluted into fraction iii due to ionic repulsion revealed by a weak uri peak in fraction iii of influent chromatograms fig 6 d and i so that uva210 removal rates were positive along the process for this fraction of wwtp b fig 7 i 57 chromatographic variation characteristics of mbr wwtp b fractions ii and iii revealed that large amounts of hs generated during mbr process which could account for unexpectedly low hs like eem volume φ iii n and φ v n removal discovered in section 3 2 hs existed in fractions iv and v 2 with distinct suva chromatographic peaks fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s6 j removal by sludge adsorption indeed happened in mbr process revealed by positive uva254 chromatographic removal rate fig 7 j and l but was counteracted by the mass production of hs existed in fractions ii and iii during biotreatment units membrane separation exhibited little effect in removing hs in fractions ii and iii fig 7 h and i these factors resulted in apparently constant hs like eem volume φ iii n and φ v n indicating constant hs concentration in final effluent chromatographic fractions iv of wwtps a and b influent contained non aromatic and low molecular weight organic acids which were highly biodegradable 57 this composition characteristic was revealed by prominent uri chromatographic peak with high value in fraction iv fig 6 d and i 42 but fraction iv removal rates differed significantly between these two wwtps a2owtf wwtp a revealed higher removal rates for fraction iv in all indexes than mbr wwtp b more than 60 vs less than 50 fig 7 d vs j it was noteworthy that average uri value kept growing during biotreatment of both wwtps with a higher increasing extent for mbr wwtp b supplementary material table s5 this indicated new substances generated during conventional a2o and mbr with more robust generation for mbr utilization associated products uaps derived from substrate biodegradation could account for the origin of newly generated substances in fraction iv uaps are of low molecular weight and rich in aromatic proteins peptides and amino acids 62 66 they tend to elute into fraction iv due to size exclusion and ionic repulsion and exhibited strong absorption in low wavelength range correspondingly high uri 42 57 persistently higher protein and polysaccharides accumulated in fraction i fig 6 and supplementary material figs s4 s5 h concentration in mbr process provided with more substrate to generate uaps which counteracted removal of components in fraction iv and resulted in low fraction iv removal rates for mbr a prominent negative valley was at the boundary of fraction iv and v which was referred to as salt boundary 67 dom eluted after salt boundary were separated on mechanisms more than size exclusion such as hydrophobic interaction and so on 57 prominent uva210 and uva254 peaks in fraction v 1 appeared in anoxia and subsequent process units chromatograms which were proved to be signal of nitrate supplementary material fig s7 nitrate generation resulted in very negative uva210 chromatographic removal rates of fraction v 1 fig 7 e and k which made dom information acquisition from fraction v 1 hard fraction v 2 suva chromatograms of all samples exhibited peaks with high values which revealed abundance of hydrophobic hs in fraction v 2 final removal rates of fraction v 2 were identical for a2owtf wwtp a and mbr wwtp b fig 7 g vs l but fraction v 2 removal rates of wwtp b in all indexes increased after membrane separation fig 7 l this also reflected lower efficiency of biotreatment units of mbr in removing hs compared with conventional a2o 3 5 thmfp comparison chemical composition of dom within effluent of wwtps a and b was proved to be very different by spectroscopic and chromatographic comparison in this study thm accounts for the most significant proportion of total dbps generated during water disinfection 68 so thmfp of final effluent from wwtps a and b were measured to reveal their potential difference in dbps formation derived from their unique dom composition it was noteworthy that effluent thmfp was higher for mbr wwtp b than a2owtf wwtp a fig 8 this meant more dbps generation and higher potential ecological risks after disinfection process of mbr wwtp b as effluent doc concentration of both wwtps were similar as revealed in section 3 2 eem φ iii n revealing fulvic acid like hs concentration reduced little from influent to filtration effluent for mbr wwtp b while corresponding reduction rate for a2owtf wwtp a was much higher fig 3 fulvic acid like hs are the main precursors of thm due to their abundance of polyhydroxyaromatic moieties 32 36 as a result thmfp of mbr wwtp b was higher than that of a2owtf wwtp a it was proved in section 3 4 that unchanged φ iii n for mbr wwtp b is a result of its unique massive production of smps which could not be filtered out by membrane especially hs reflected by negative chromatographic removal rates of hpsec fractions ii and iii fig 7 h and i previous studies categorized part of smps released during biomass decay in the endogenous phase as biomass associated products baps 66 69 baps are of large molecular size and rich in hs 62 69 70 so higher baps generation could account for the unique massive hs production found in mbr wwtp b this conjecture could be supported by the different operating conditions of wwtps a and b the sludge concentration of mbr wwtp b was much higher than a2owtf wwtp a and its corresponding f m was much lower supplementary material table s3 which kept microbes in mbr wwtp b in endogenous phase and made them easy to undergo cell lysis 61 baps in the microbes would hence enter dom entirety of mbr wwtp b and increase the content ratio of hs which resulted in the high effluent thmfp lowering sludge concentration to increase f m may alleviate endogenous smps release problem for mbr and reduce the concentration of dbps precursors 71 but this will increase the reactor area and reduce srt which will impair the comparative advantages of mbr over conventional a2o 3 moreover there is no reference for deciding the optimum sludge concentration for mbr according to the wastewater influent characteristics the more practical measure for reducing the precursor of dbps in mbr should be adding more advanced treatment process units e g activated carbon adsorption to remove such precursors before disinfection 72 4 conclusions this study compared dom variation characteristics of conventional a2o and mbr through case study on typical full scale wwtps combination of conventional wastewater quality indexes eem and uv vis spectroscopic analyses and hpsec characterization gradually revealed differences between dom variation of conventional a2o and mbr from phenomena to deeper mechanism which helped in acquisition of rich information for comprehensive and objective comparison between effectiveness of conventional a2o and mbr conveniently it is revealed in this study that in practical application operational characteristics of mbr may bring about release of endogenous organic matter which will result in its disadvantage in dom removal compared with conventional a2o unique persistent protein and polysaccharides with large molecular size in mbr process could be well removed by membrane interception fig 7 g still these membrane retained substances were also severe membrane foulants hs concentration increase unique to mbr which led to much higher thmfp for mbr effluent was found in this study and deduced to result from bap released in endogenous phase due to high sludge concentration and low f m of mbr it was also revealed by uv vis characterization that dom composition in mbr effluent might be more complex fig 5 which was possible to bring about some unknown side effects up to now there is no standard or study on determining adequate operation parameters e g sludge concentration for retaining the advantage of mbr while avoiding potentially concomitant adverse effects mentioned above membrane separation in mbr can efficiently trap some particulate organic matter and reduce total pollutant concentration in final effluent but this also can be achieved by adding filtration facilities into conventional a2o which is much cheaper 3 the performance of mbr and conventional a2o processes treating municipal wastewater in practical application was comprehensively compared from the perspective of dom compositional characteristics for the first time in this study such comparison provided novel insight into the effect of operating municipal wwtps with expensive mbr which was considered to be more advanced than conventional a2o the significant conclusion from this study is that mbr potentially has some inherent problems in terms of dom removal which are hard to solve and have no existence for conventional a2o but adopting mbr to upgrade municipal wwtps is still prevailing 73 74 results from this study can urge researchers engineers and investors to take more caution with this trend when there is no limit such as shortage of land 3 conventional a2o in tandem with tertiary treatment facilities like filters should be better for

13008,processes optimisation is one of the main issues to take into account for the design of new chemical processes applied to wastewater treatment plants wwtps particularly it can be achieved using design of experiments doe tools and can represent progress in the process performance and cost reduction in this work an advanced oxidation process aop namely fenton s process is applied to degrade a nitrophenol model compound i e 4 nitrophenol 4np in a lab scale batch reactor to optimise the process parameters such as the temperature of the reaction t and the initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 doe was applied namely central composite design ccd and response surface methodology rsm the 4np degradation and mineralisation were evaluated as process outputs the maximum 4np and toc removals 100 and 49 2 respectively and a non toxic effluent determined by the inhibition of vibrio fischeri bacteria were achieved after 60 min of reaction using the optimum conditions provided by the model t 70 2 c h2o2 2 945 g l and fe2 5 9 mg l some strategies i e gradual addition of h2o2 and uv visible radiation application were still adopted to increase the mineralisation however the complete removal of 4np and 80 of mineralisation was achieved when the fenton process was assisted with uv visible radiation the lumped kinetic model lkm proposed and used for the first time to describe the mineralisation of 4np by fenton s reaction described well the profile of the residual carbon i e the fraction of carbon not mineralised during the treatment time for these experiments graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords 4 nitrophenol advanced oxidation process fenton s reagent central composite design response surface methodology lumped kinetic model 1 introduction the high concentrations of toxic pollutants present in the chemical industries liquid effluents which affect soil surface water and groundwater when not adequately treated before disposal or discharge still represent a danger for the environment and human health to reduce such risks environmental research has been looking in the last decades for efficient treatment processes aiming to remove these compounds from effluents following what is required by environmental laws and regulations since the usual wastewater treatment plants wwtps techniques like biological systems e g activated sludge may not be efficient in treating industrial effluents containing pollutants with high toxicity such as phenolic compounds alternative processes are required advanced oxidation processes aops stand out as destructive technologies for partial or total degradation of organic pollutants 1 including phenolic compounds whereby are appropriate processes for treating toxic chemical effluents leading to the elimination and mineralisation of relevant pollutants one of the most relevant phenolic compounds is 4 nitrophenol 4np which is known for its high toxicity 2 4 and is often reported to be present in petrochemical effluents 5 6 accordingly it requires efficient treatment processes suitable for its complete elimination different aops like photodegradation 7 electrolysis and ozonation 8 electro fenton 9 and fenton 10 12 were reported for the treatment of 4np however for industrial application of any of such aops more research is required to be done particularly focused on processes optimisation which should promote cost reduction better process control and specifically reduce energy consumption 13 14 which is an increasingly pressing matter for their real application on wwtps one of the aops that is more easily transferred for wwtps is the fenton process due to its low complexity in operation the fact of using chemicals easily purchased and easy control under operation in batch systems this process is based on the reaction between hydrogen peroxide h2o2 oxidant agent and ferrous ion fe2 catalyst to generate the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals ho oxidising species indicated by eq 1 15 17 the ho species act as responsible by organic compounds rh oxidation 15 17 forming intermediate species rh upon partial oxidation and co2 and h2o complete oxidation as indicated by eqs 2 and 3 respectively 10 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh ho 2 ho rh h 2 o rh 3 ho rh h 2 o co 2 furthermore other reactions occur at the same time e g catalyst regeneration eq 4 and scavenging of the ho by an excess of fe2 eq 5 and or h2o2 eq 6 15 17 4 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 5 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh 6 ho h 2 o 2 h 2 o ho 2 compared to other aops advantages of fenton s process also include short reaction times associated with a strong oxidation process based on the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals simple operation and the fact that it runs at atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions being thus of interest for wwtps moreover the possible total conversion of the pollutants into inoculum substances co2 and water using environmentally friendly reagents 18 like iron with low toxicity 19 and h2o2 that quickly decomposes into water and o2 is a great attraction to this technology so its interest has increased in the last decades and thus several researchers applied fenton or fenton like technologies coupled with other processes such as ultrasonic us or electrolysis which represent an increase in energetic costs for the degradation of 4np cf table 1 achieving however complete removal in some cases however regarding the mineralisation of this pollutant few studies reported such information cf table 1 although widely studied some peculiarities of the fenton process must be considered especially when aiming to achieve high mineralisation rates since as shown previously in eqs 1 6 a significant number of reactions occur simultaneously during oxidation an effective control of the process parameters is required thus by properly controlling the ph of the effluent the temperature of the reaction and amount of fenton s reagents h2o2 and fe2 high mineralisation performances and low amounts of residual carbon directly related to the formation of intermediaries throughout the reaction can be achieved 34 36 improving the efficiency of the treatment even though the reaction parameters can be easily controlled for achieving high levels of mineralisation with fenton s processes it may be necessary to use high concentrations of chemicals which increases the operational costs a critical issue in the scale up for industrial application thus to reduce the consumption of reagents particularly of catalyst to decrease the formation of iron containing sludge at the end of the process process optimisation by design of experiments doe tools can be used particularly the response surface methodology rsm can be used to determine the optimal conditions of a process 37 39 providing results statistically reliable in a multivariable system 40 as reported in previous studies 1 41 42 as stated above a general problem with fenton s process also reported in studies applying other aops is the partial oxidation represented by low mineralisation in fact it can promote the formation of intermediate species which should be considered appropriately due to issues of toxicity and recalcitrance to quantify these intermediate species during the mineralisation lumped kinetic models lkm can be quite useful 41 42 moreover information taken from such models can be crucial for designing efficient reactors to be applied in wwtps this work aims to optimise the treatment of 4np by the homogeneous fenton s process to achieve maximum degradation and mineralisation at the end of the treatment firstly the doe was applied to find the best treatment conditions then strategies such as the gradual oxidant dosing to the reaction or the use of uv visible radiation were assessed aiming to enhance the mineralisation finally the profile of the residual carbon not mineralised during treatment of 4np by fenton s process was described using for the first time a lumped kinetic model lkm 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals 4 nitrophenol 4np c6h5no3 mw 139 11 g mol and 99 5 purity was purchased from sigma

purchased from vwr chemicals titanium and potassium oxide 98 were purchased from alfa aesar 2 2 design of experiments doe it is essential to optimise the treatment process to facilitate the control the day to day operation of wwtps and reduce the costs associated with reagents consumption the doe methodology permits performing such optimisation by reducing the number of runs carried out and the time for obtaining the optimal operating conditions 43 44 in this study a central composite design ccd a full factorial two level design with expansions was applied to find the optimal condition for fenton s process during the 4np degradation and mineralisation the parameters selected for the ccd were temperature t x1 initial oxidant dose h2o2 x2 and catalyst concentration fe2 x3 table 2

with different units and decrease the error in the polynomial fit 45 7 x i x i x 0 x in this equation x0 is the value of variable i in the central point i e it corresponds to xi 0 and δx corresponds to the difference of that variable between 1 level and the centre point the response surface methodology rsm was used to determine the linear and quadratic variables and their interactions that are statistically significant for 4np degradation and mineralisation responses thus the t student test for a confidence level of 95 was applied a variable or interaction was considered to have significance if the corresponding t probability was smaller than 0 05 45 the adequacy of the quadratic model fitting eq 8 45 was evaluated by anova analysis this statistical analysis divides the global variance into two components variance associated with the model and with the experimental error if the f ratio was higher than the tabulated f value which depends on the number of degrees of freedom and confidence level commonly 95 the variance was associated with the model moreover other statistical criteria that can be taken into account for evaluating the adequacy of the model can be used namely the f probability i e to assess if p f if this parameter is less than 0 05 for the confidence level of 95 the variance that occurs in the response is associated with the model 45 finally the r2 value estimates the fraction of the response variation around the mean that can be attributed to the model instead of the experimental error for all statistical analyses jmp5 0 1 software was

treatment of 4np the fenton process was carried out in a jacketed glass batch reactor coupled with a condenser with a capacity of 250 ml connected to a thermostatic bath polystat cc1 from huber to control the process temperature through water recirculation the solution was kept under constant agitation at 200 rpm using a magnetic bar and a stirring plate falc for all runs a volume of 150 ml of 4np solution with a concentration of 500 mg l this concentration was selected because it was typically found in real effluents 46 47 was put inside the reactor and after the predetermined temperature had been stabilised the ph was adjusted with 1 m h2so4 to the desired value the desired amount of catalyst feso4 7h2o was added upon dissolution of the ferrous salt the addition of h2o2 occurred this instant corresponded to the start of the reaction i e corresponds to time zero t 0 periodically samples were collected at predetermined times to determine the remaining 4np concentration and the total organic carbon toc which were determined using the techniques described herein below cf section 2 4 in the run wherein h2o2 was gradually added along the reaction the experimental procedure was the same except that a fraction of oxidant was added every 5 min up to 55 min of process time in this experiment the residual concentration of h2o2 was also determined throughout the reaction and in the end the sample toxicity the fenton process assisted with uv visible radiation was carried out in a glass batch reactor with a capacity of 1 l equipped with a high pressure mercury lamp heraeus tq 150 with 500 w m2 which emits in wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm the lamp was inserted inside the reactor into the quartz tube connected to the thermostatic bath to maintain the temperature constant during the reaction this run was carried out the same way as fenton s runs the lamp was turned on immediately after adding the oxidant 2 4 analytical methods for toc analyses the samples along the process were collected to a glass bottle and a predetermined mass of excess sodium sulfite was added which reacts instantaneously with the remaining h2o2 this way stopping the oxidation process and precipitating the dissolved iron before toc analysis the samples were filtered using a nitrate membrane syringe filter with a porosity of 0 45 μm fioroni the toc concentration in the samples was determined using a shimadzu toc analyser model toc l by catalytic oxidation at 720 c according to the 5310 d method 48 for toxicity determination the samples were collected in glass bottles and the ph was raised to 10 0 using 10 m naoh promoting this way the elimination of the residual h2o2 and the precipitation of iron then the supernatant was collected and the ph was readjusted to 7 with 1 m hcl and filtered using a nitrate membrane with a porosity of 0 45 μm the toxicity tests were performed according to the din en iso 11348 3 49 in a microtox analyser modern water model 500 for the determination of the perceptual inhibition of the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri v fischeri in these tests each sample was put into contact with the bacteria for 5 15 and 30 min and the luminescence emitted by v fischeri was quantified the residual concentration of h2o2 was determined following the method developed by sellers 50 it measures the absorbance at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer helios γ model thermo electron corporation of the yellow colour due to the complex formed in the reaction between residual h2o2 with titanium and potassium oxide high performance liquid chromatography hplc hitachi lachrom elite was used to determine the concentration of 4np a volume of 20 μl of each sample same used to determine toxicity was injected in the column purospher star rp 18 5 mm 250 4 0 mm which was operated at 35 c with a mobile phase 10 90 of methanol and water acidified at ph 2 2 with phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 0 75 ml min the detection was performed at a wavelength of 280 nm 3 results and discussion the 4np solution prepared presents a ph of 4 6 toc of 260 mgc l and toxicity of 53 6 47 9 for contact times of 5 and 30 min respectively with the v fischeri bacteria therefore corroborating the dangerousness and importance of using this compound as a model for studies related to aops the fenton process is influenced by several parameters such as initial ph temperature oxidant and catalyst concentrations for the application of ccd considering all these parameters and their interactions 27 runs are necessary to be performed a preliminary parametric study was carried out to reduce the number of experiments and establish the levels in ccd whose results are discussed in the next section 3 1 preliminary runs the influence of the oxidant concentration the initial ph and the catalyst dose in the toc removal was evaluated in the parametric study to evaluate the effect of the initial oxidant concentration the range of 0 0 to 2 9 g l of h2o2 corresponding to 0 to 1 8 times the stoichiometric value based on the cod value of the 4np solution 758 2 mgo2 l was selected the other operating conditions were fixed at fe2 30 mg l ph 3 0 and t 30 c fig 2 a and b shows the results obtained being possible to verify that neither toc nor ph decreased when the oxidant concentration was null so 4np was not oxidised in the presence of the catalyst alone however an improvement in mineralisation was observed when adding h2o2 indicating that 4np was oxidised into carbon dioxide and water as well as some intermediate compounds like carboxylic acids 1 51 52 which may represent intermediate oxidation states and are responsible for a decrease in the ph of the solution as can be observed in fig 2b the h2o2 concentration had a positive effect on toc removal up to 2 4 mg l reaching 45 after 60 min of reaction but for a higher oxidant dose 2 9 g l the mineralisation decreased to 28 the appearance of an optimum for h2o2 concentration is due to parallel scavenging reactions between the excess of h2o2 and the ho species formed generating ho2 species with a lower oxidation potential eq 6 17 53 54 the best oxidant concentration found 2 4 g l and the smallest concentration tested 1 6 g l which permitted reaching the second best toc removal 40 were selected as 1 and 0 levels respectively of the ccd cf table 2 the effect of the initial ph was evaluated in the range of 2 5 to 4 0 fig 3a and b at the same time the other operating conditions were fixed fe2 30 mg l h2o2 2 4 g l value of the best toc removal reported in the previous section and t 30 c the maximum mineralisation was observed at ph 3 0 45 at 60 min fig 3a although the difference between the performance in the run at ph 3 5 was not significant 40 a negative effect of the initial ph was observed using the lowest ph 2 5 in which the toc removal reached less than 30 fig 3a under the conditions tested at the same time the ph also decreased along time in all runs performed as expected fig 3b the existence of an optimal initial ph value in fenton s process was previously reported and the range between 2 0 and 4 0 was usually adopted 50 51 55 for excessively acidic conditions the formation of ho is inhibited due to their scavenging by h in excess 55 additionally the decomposition of h2o2 could be promoting the production of h3o2 and therefore reaction with ferrous ions to generate the ho species does not occur at the expected rate 56 on the other hand for higher ph values the ferrous ion ends up precipitating at least partly becoming less catalyst dissolved and available for reaction with the h2o2 57 still higher ph values accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 into h2o and o2 58 consequently reducing the efficiency of the process in the ccd the ph was fixed at 3 5 because the performance is very close to that at a ph of 3 0 and reduces the amount of acid necessary for the acidification of the reaction medium to determine the catalyst concentration range for the ccd a series of preliminary runs were performed in the range of 0 to 180 mg l of fe2 the operational conditions were fixed as follows h2o2 2 4 g l ph 3 5 and t 30 c the run performed without catalyst only h2o2 reached a mineralisation of nearly 13 fig 4a associated with the small oxidation potential of h2o2 1 78 ev 59 the addition of the catalyst benefited the performance of the fenton s process fig 4a being that the maximum toc removal 40 was observed when using an iron concentration of 90 mg l see fig 4a so this concentration was selected as central point level of the ccd cf table 2 the mineralisation was similar for the highest ferrous ion dose 180 mg l the appearance of an optimum catalyst dose or a plateau is associated with the occurrence of undesirable scavenging reactions between the fe2 in excess and the hydroxyl radicals eq 5 52 thereby decreasing the amount of these radicals available for oxidation of the organic compounds regarding ph evolution acidification of the medium was observed for all runs fig 4b and it was the highest for the optimal catalyst concentration as mentioned above ph reduction during the reaction was associated with formation of intermediate compounds like carboxylic acids 60 3 2 ccd experimental design the ccd was performed taking into account the results achieved in the parametric study section 3 1 the initial ph value was fixed at 3 5 aiming to reduce the number of factors of the ccd because it allowed achieving the maximum mineralisation so the factors evaluated in ccd were the process temperature the concentration of h2o2 and the iron dose as reported in table 2 the temperature was selected as a factor due to its importance in the reaction kinetics 61 and its levels were determined based on other previous studies 62 65 the h2o2 and fe2 concentrations were determined in the parametric study previously reported see section 3 1 the responses evaluated for the ccd were the 4np removal and the mineralisation toc removal after 15 and 60 min of reaction they were established taking into account the importance of organic matter reduction for processes efficiency in wwtps which normally is achieved upon biological or biochemical process and whose monitoring is key to improve the modelling of wwtps and their performance 66 68 the results obtained are shown in table 3 the experiments corresponding to the centre of the cubic domain were performed in triplicate runs 9 11 the 4np removal observed varied between 94 2 and 94 4 standard deviation sd of 0 08 after 15 min and 97 1 97 2 sd 0 05 after 60 min the toc removal was in the range 27 8 30 4 sd 1 1 for 15 min and 31 3 33 3 sd 0 8 for 60 min see table 3 these results indicate the low error associated with the experimental performance the suitability of the quadratic model was tested by anova 69 table 4 summarises the results obtained the f ratio values reached for 4np removal after 15 and 60 min of reaction were slightly smaller than the fisher s f value f9 7 3 80 which indicates that the variations in the responses were associated with random errors and not to the model however the opposite was observed for mineralisation where f ratio was higher than f9 7 consequently the toc removal variations are associated with the model the p f values permits reaching to the same conclusion once for 4np removal at 60 min this value was higher than 0 05 considering a confidence level of 95 while for the other models was smaller than 0 05 however the r2 values indicated that 78 4 82 3 for 4np removal and 96 6 98 6 for mineralisation of the responses variability were associated with the model therefore it was concluded that the proposed models are in general a proper fit for the experimental data particularly those for toc removal for the second order models faithfulness analysis the student s t test was employed to identify the statistically significant variables and or interactions the results are shown in table 5 being concluded that i for 4np removal after 15 min only the oxidant dose x2 had a statistical significance p value 0 05 ii no variable or interaction affected the pollutant reduction after 60 min iii the temperature x1 and its quadratic term the h2o2 and iron concentrations respectively x2 and x3 influence the toc removal after 15 min and iv the mineralisation at 60 min was affected by temperature and h2o2 concentration since these parameters reported p values smaller than 0 05 for 95 confidence level eqs 9 12 represent the models obtained for all responses considered i e 4np and toc removal after 15 and 60 min 9 4 np removal 15 min 94 43 7 15 h 2 o 2 1 6 0 8 10 4 np removal 60 min 97 19 11 toc removal 15 min 29 23 11 30 t 45 15 6 54 t 45 15 2 20 56 h 2

fig 5a no variable influences the pollutant removal after 60 min of the fenton process fig 5b regarding mineralisation toc removal h2o2 concentration has a strong positive effect both at 15 and 60 min of reaction however the quadratic of the temperature and iron dose showed a negative effect for toc removal after 15 min of reaction fig 5c and d the predicted model responses for 4np removal after 15 min and toc removals after 15 and 60 min vs experimental results are presented in the parity plots fig 6 for 4np degradation the absolute deviations were less than 11 however the average is only 3 1 on the other hand minor absolute deviations were observed for the mineralisation with an average of 2 0 which indicated that the statistical models had an excellent fit to the experimental data as also found in previous studies using the same experimental design tools 70 73 surface plots for the toc removals based on the graphical representation of the model after 15 min eq 11 and after 60 min eq 12 are shown in fig 7 after 15 min of reaction the mineralisation increases with the oxidant concentration while for higher temperatures and excessive iron dose a negative effect in toc removal was observed after 60 min of fenton s reaction the toc removal improved with the h2o2 concentration and temperature regardless of the catalyst concentration in the range studied thus the lowest iron dose 5 9 mg l should be employed to reduce the consumption of chemicals and consequently reduce operating costs this is an important issue as it allows the reduction of iron containing sludge at the end of the treatment which is quite relevant for real application of fenton s process in wwtps regarding the decrease in 4np concentration the surface plots were not shown once the models predict that after 15 min of reaction only the dose of oxidant positively affects the response i e the removal of 4np increases with h2o2 and after 60 min it was independent of the conditions used in the treatment process being able to apply the minimum tested because the response will tend to the average value 3 3 approaches for mineralisation improvement taking into account that the model proposed by ccd for mineralisation after 60 min of fenton s reaction under the optimum conditions fe2 5 9 mg l t 70 2 c and h2o2 2 945 g l only predicted a mineralisation degree of 50 two approaches were carried out for improving the toc removal the first approach consisted of the gradual addition of h2o2 with the perspective of minimising the undesirable scavenging reactions the second one was implemented by applying uv visible radiation with the main goal to improve the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated according to eqs 1 and 13 14 74 75 and accelerate the regeneration of iron eqs 2 and 14 18 75 76 13 h 2 o 2 hν 2 ho 14 fe 3 h 2 o 2 hν fe 2 ho h 15 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe o 2 h 2 h 16 fe o 2 h 2 hν fe 2 ho 2 17 fe 3 rco 2 fe r co 2 2 18 fe r co 2 2 hν fe 2 co 2 r the mineralisation reached in the run wherein the oxidant was totally added at the beginning of the reaction was quick in the first 20 min of reaction nearly 40 and increased only slightly along the process up to 60 min wherein it reached 49 very close to the predicted value in the model 50 see fig 8a at the same time the h2o2 consumption was almost complete right at the beginning of the reaction fig 8b the degradation of 4np was complete after the first 5 min of the process under the conditions tested data not shown at the end of the process the effluent toxicity was null pointing to the efficiency of the conditions used to reduce the toxicity of the model solution from 53 6 47 9 to 0 and demonstrating that no toxic intermediates remained at the end of the treatment under the conditions tested from such an experiment it stands out that the homogeneous fenton s process was efficient without combination with other processes such as those reported in table 1 similar results of mineralisation and degradation 49 2 of toc removal and complete 4np degradation cf table 1 were obtained by rodrigues et al 11 when the same 4np concentration 500 mg l was treated using fenton s reagent in a bubble column reactor under batch mode conditions cf table 1 regarding the strategies used to increase the mineralisation the gradual oxidant addition promoted a progressive increase in the toc removal during the reaction fig 8a at the end of the process it was achieved the removal of 54 reporting the improvement in fenton s reagent efficiency however it is worth noting that the reaction could have been extended thus yielding higher performances as there was still hydrogen peroxide in the solution see fig 8b the increase in the process performance is explained by the fact of minimising the scavenging reaction eq 6 making more ho species available to degrade the organic compounds 12 however the best removal of toc was achieved for the run where the uv vis radiation was employed it was achieved 80 of mineralisation in just 20 min being that this period coincides with the total consumption of the oxidant the results obtained using fenton s reagent assisted by uv vis radiation were superior to those achieved by other authors that in most cases used lower 4np concentrations even with heterogeneous processes cf table 1 showing the higher efficiency of the homogeneous process this excellent performance of the treatment process is due to the fact that more hydroxyl radicals are generated because this occurs through more than one pathway eqs 1 and 13 14 as well as to the regeneration of iron ii eqs 2 and 14 18 which is essential for the reaction not to stop again in both approaches the complete degradation of 4np was reached which was not always the case in previous studies reported by other authors cf table 1 and the toxicity of the final effluent toward v fischeri bacteria was null 3 4 lumped kinetic model the lumped kinetic model lkm herein used was proposed to explain the mineralisation of organic compounds through several reactions 77 the model was proposed to represent the residual toc concentration profiles which is related to the formation of intermediate species during the application of aops for the treatment of organic pollutants 9 78 79 the lkm was chosen due to the good results obtained by other researchers 42 64 80 81 and considering the few literature concerning the application of this model to the homogeneous fenton s process usually studied for wet oxidation 79 and catalytic wet hydrogen peroxide oxidation 82 with some adaptations the lkm adopted was based on the model proposed by zaidan et al 41 42 who evaluated the degradation of phenol by catalytic wet peroxidation in short the organics are represented by a b and c species fig 9 74 the a element represents the initial compound 4np in this mechanism the model assumes that the oxidation reactions of this element and of the intermediate compounds are of the first order type the b element represents all intermediate compounds resulting from the initial compound a while the c element involves all co2 and h2o formed by complete oxidation of a and b 74 the lkm mechanism proposed in this study for 4np oxidation is based on eqs 19 and 20 41 42 19 a 4 np toc 0 20 b non refractory compounds refractory compounds toc 0 assuming first order reactions one has 41 42 21 d a dt k 1 k 3 a 22 d b dt k 1 a k 2 b eqs 21 and 22 were integrated considering the carbon residual fraction of the lumps a b and c considering also that in the initial time b c 0 and a a 0 yielding eqs 23 and 24 41 42 23 a a 0 exp k 1 k 3 t 24 b k 1 a 0 k 1 k 3 k 2 exp k 2 t exp k 1 k 3 t combining eqs 23 24 the toc profile was obtained eq 25 41 42 25 a b toc from the initial conditions i e t 0 a 0 1 and b 0 0 the model proposed for the residual carbon profile is the following 41 42 26 toc toc 0 k 1 k 1 k 3 k 2 exp k 2 t k 3 k 2 k 1 k 3 k 2 exp k 1 k 3 t the kinetic constants k1 k2 and k3 were obtained from the model fitting to the toc data obtained in the samples collected along the reactions performed under the optimum conditions dark fenton process with the total and gradual addition of h2o2 as well as fenton process assisted with uv visible radiation the determination of the kinetic constants was performed by applying a nonlinear regression while minimising the quadratic sum of the residues to the remaining toc fraction using the solver tool from microsoft office excel data obtained are shown in table 6 the lkm applied for fenton s optimised conditions total oxidant addition experiment has a kinetic constant for the intermediate species formation k1 slightly superior than the kinetic constant for the direct mineralisation of 4np k3 cf table 6 it shows that the concentration of intermediate species that remains during the treatment is significant comparing the different ways of adding the oxidant total at the beginning vs gradually throughout the reaction to the fenton process an increase in the apparent kinetic constants except k3 is observed being particularly evident an increase in the oxidation rate of 4np and corresponding intermediates yielding thus a more efficient process compared with the dark fenton process in the same conditions i e all oxidant added at the beginning of the run it is noteworthy that all apparent kinetic constants increase when uv vis radiation is present particularly it stands out the increase in the kinetic constant k3 which is responsible for the lower concentration of intermediate species formed and better efficiency of the treatment for the uv vis assisted process in the mineralisation of 4np the lkm well adjusted the experimental data obtained for the residual toc in all reactions as shown in fig 10 there is an excellent relationship between the observed experimental data and those predicted by the model for toc toc0 including both approaches employed to improve the mineralisation other authors e g 41 42 reported similar data fitting when applied the same lkm to degrade phenol by other aops finally it is worth stressing that the partial oxidation or incomplete mineralisation promoted in some cases by the fenton s reaction could be reduced by applying coupled technologies like being assisted with uv vis radiation even so the toxicity results obtained at the end of fenton s process do not report risk to the discharge of the final effluent treated confirming the efficiency of fenton s process even with moderate mineralisation 4 conclusions the degradation of 4np and its mineralisation by the homogeneous fenton s process under batch mode conditions depends upon several conditions as ph temperature and chemicals concentration the ccd experimental design adopted in this work allowed to establish models for 4np removal and mineralisation toc removal after 15 and 60 min of reaction and the optimal operating conditions were determined the models proposed show that only the initial oxidant concentration affects the 4np degradation for 15 min of reaction however at the end of the process 60 min it was independent of the operating conditions regarding mineralisation it was found that after 15 min of reaction all parameters oxidant and catalyst concentrations and temperature affect the response the optimal conditions adopted for the treatment were determined from the model for the toc removal after 60 min which was influenced by the temperature and the oxidant concentration allowing to reduce the use of catalyst concentration in the process under the best conditions found for mineralisation after 60 min of fenton s oxidation t 70 2 c h2o2 2 945 g l and fe2 5 9 mg l a total 4np degradation and null toxicity of the effluent was reached however the mineralisation achieved was less than 50 at the end of the treatment so two approaches to improve the mineralisation gradual addition of oxidant or assisting the fenton process by uv vis radiation were used increasing the mineralisation to 80 when the uv vis radiation was applied to the fenton process for the first time the lkm was applied to describe the carbon residual fraction during fenton s process for the treatment of 4np results obtained proved that the model was satisfactory to describe the toc conversion and the formation of intermediates in the fenton reaction with total and gradual oxidant

13008,processes optimisation is one of the main issues to take into account for the design of new chemical processes applied to wastewater treatment plants wwtps particularly it can be achieved using design of experiments doe tools and can represent progress in the process performance and cost reduction in this work an advanced oxidation process aop namely fenton s process is applied to degrade a nitrophenol model compound i e 4 nitrophenol 4np in a lab scale batch reactor to optimise the process parameters such as the temperature of the reaction t and the initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 doe was applied namely central composite design ccd and response surface methodology rsm the 4np degradation and mineralisation were evaluated as process outputs the maximum 4np and toc removals 100 and 49 2 respectively and a non toxic effluent determined by the inhibition of vibrio fischeri bacteria were achieved after 60 min of reaction using the optimum conditions provided by the model t 70 2 c h2o2 2 945 g l and fe2 5 9 mg l some strategies i e gradual addition of h2o2 and uv visible radiation application were still adopted to increase the mineralisation however the complete removal of 4np and 80 of mineralisation was achieved when the fenton process was assisted with uv visible radiation the lumped kinetic model lkm proposed and used

these experiments graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords 4 nitrophenol advanced oxidation process fenton s reagent central composite design response surface methodology lumped kinetic model 1 introduction the high concentrations of toxic pollutants present in the chemical industries liquid effluents which affect soil surface water and groundwater when not adequately treated before disposal or discharge still represent a danger for the environment and human health to reduce such risks environmental research has been looking in the last decades for efficient treatment processes aiming to remove these compounds from effluents following what is required by environmental laws and regulations since the usual wastewater treatment plants wwtps techniques like biological systems e g activated sludge may not be efficient in treating industrial effluents containing pollutants with high toxicity such as phenolic compounds alternative processes are required advanced oxidation processes aops stand out as destructive technologies for partial or total degradation of organic pollutants 1 including phenolic compounds whereby are appropriate processes for treating toxic chemical effluents leading to the elimination and mineralisation of relevant pollutants one of the most relevant phenolic compounds is 4 nitrophenol 4np which is known for its high toxicity 2 4 and is often reported to be present in petrochemical effluents 5 6 accordingly it requires efficient treatment processes suitable for its complete elimination different aops like photodegradation 7 electrolysis and ozonation 8 electro fenton 9 and fenton 10 12 were reported for the treatment of 4np however for industrial application of any of such aops more research is required to be done particularly focused on processes optimisation which should promote cost reduction better process control and specifically reduce energy consumption 13 14 which is an increasingly pressing matter for their real application on wwtps one of the aops that is more easily transferred for wwtps is the fenton process due to its low complexity in operation the fact of using chemicals easily purchased and easy control under operation in batch systems this process is based on the reaction between hydrogen peroxide h2o2 oxidant agent and ferrous ion fe2 catalyst to generate the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals ho oxidising species indicated by eq 1 15 17 the ho species act as responsible by organic compounds rh oxidation 15 17 forming intermediate species rh upon partial oxidation and co2 and h2o complete oxidation as indicated by eqs 2 and 3 respectively 10 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh ho 2 ho rh h 2 o rh 3 ho rh h 2 o co 2 furthermore other reactions occur at the same time e g catalyst regeneration eq 4 and scavenging of the ho by an excess of fe2 eq 5 and or h2o2 eq 6 15 17 4 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 5 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh 6 ho h 2 o 2 h 2 o ho 2 compared to other aops advantages of fenton s process also include short reaction times associated with a strong oxidation process based on the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals simple operation and the fact that it runs at atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions being thus of interest for wwtps moreover the possible total conversion of the pollutants into inoculum substances co2 and water using environmentally friendly reagents 18 like iron with low toxicity 19 and h2o2 that quickly decomposes into water and o2 is a great attraction to this technology so its interest has increased in the last decades and thus several researchers applied fenton or fenton like technologies coupled with other processes such as ultrasonic us or electrolysis which represent an increase in energetic costs for the degradation of 4np cf table 1 achieving however complete removal in some cases however regarding the mineralisation of this pollutant few studies reported such information cf table 1 although widely studied some peculiarities of the fenton process must be considered especially when aiming to achieve high mineralisation rates since as shown previously in eqs 1 6 a significant number of reactions occur simultaneously during oxidation an effective control of the process parameters is required thus by properly controlling the ph of the effluent the temperature of the reaction and amount of fenton s reagents h2o2 and fe2 high mineralisation performances and low amounts of residual carbon directly related to the formation of intermediaries throughout the reaction can be achieved 34 36 improving the efficiency of the treatment even though the reaction parameters can be easily controlled for achieving high levels of mineralisation with fenton s processes it may be necessary to use high concentrations of chemicals which increases the operational costs a critical issue in the scale up for industrial application thus to reduce the consumption of reagents particularly of catalyst to decrease the formation of iron containing sludge at the end of the process process optimisation by design of experiments doe tools can be used particularly the response surface methodology rsm can be used to determine the optimal conditions of a process 37 39 providing results statistically reliable in a multivariable system 40 as reported in previous studies 1 41 42 as stated above a general problem with fenton s process also reported in studies applying other aops is the partial oxidation represented by low mineralisation in fact it can promote the formation of intermediate species which should be considered appropriately due to issues of toxicity and recalcitrance to quantify these intermediate species during the mineralisation lumped kinetic models lkm can be quite useful 41 42 moreover information taken from such models can be crucial for designing efficient reactors to be applied in wwtps this work aims to optimise the treatment of 4np by the homogeneous fenton s process to achieve maximum degradation and mineralisation at the end of the treatment firstly the doe was applied to find the best treatment conditions then strategies such as the gradual oxidant dosing to the reaction or the use of uv visible radiation were assessed aiming to enhance the mineralisation finally the profile of the residual carbon not mineralised during treatment of 4np by fenton s process was described using for the first time a lumped kinetic model lkm 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals 4 nitrophenol 4np c6h5no3 mw 139 11 g mol and 99 5 purity was purchased from sigma

purchased from vwr chemicals titanium and potassium oxide 98 were purchased from alfa aesar 2 2 design of experiments doe it is essential to optimise the treatment process to facilitate the control the day to day operation of wwtps and reduce the costs associated with reagents consumption the doe methodology permits performing such optimisation by reducing the number of runs carried out and the time for obtaining the optimal operating conditions 43 44 in this study a central composite design ccd a full factorial two level design with expansions was applied to find the optimal condition for fenton s process during the 4np degradation and mineralisation the parameters selected for the ccd were temperature t x1 initial oxidant dose h2o2 x2 and catalyst concentration fe2 x3 table 2 seventeen experiments were carried out according to yates algorithm table 3 which correspond to eight cubic points α 1 runs 1 8 three replicates at the centre points α 0 runs 9 11 and six axial points α 1 682 runs 12 17 for the statistical calculations the natural variables denoted as xi are converted into dimensionless codified values xi according to eq 7 to compare factors of different natures with different units and decrease the error in the polynomial fit 45 7 x i x i x 0 x in this equation x0 is the value of variable i in the central point i e it corresponds to xi 0 and δx corresponds to the difference of that variable between 1 level and the centre point the response surface methodology rsm was used to determine the linear and quadratic variables and their interactions that are statistically significant for 4np degradation and mineralisation responses thus the t student test for a confidence level of 95 was applied a variable or interaction was considered to have significance if the corresponding t probability was smaller than 0 05 45 the adequacy of the quadratic model fitting eq 8 45 was evaluated by anova analysis this statistical analysis divides the global variance into two components variance associated with the model and with the experimental error if the f ratio was higher than the tabulated f value which depends on the number of degrees of freedom and confidence level commonly 95 the variance was associated with the model moreover other statistical criteria that can be taken into account for evaluating the adequacy of the model can be used namely the f probability i e to assess if p f if this parameter is less than 0 05 for the confidence level of 95 the variance that occurs in the response is associated with the model 45 finally the r2 value estimates the fraction of the response variation around the mean that can be attributed to the model instead of the experimental error for all statistical analyses jmp5 0 1 software was

treatment of 4np the fenton process was carried out in a jacketed glass batch reactor coupled with a condenser with a capacity of 250 ml connected to a thermostatic bath polystat cc1 from huber to control the process temperature through water recirculation the solution was kept under constant agitation at 200 rpm using a magnetic bar and a stirring plate falc for all runs a volume of 150 ml of 4np solution with a concentration of 500 mg l this concentration was selected because it was typically found in real effluents 46 47 was put inside the reactor and after the predetermined temperature had been stabilised the ph was adjusted with 1 m h2so4 to the desired value the desired amount of catalyst feso4 7h2o was added upon dissolution of the ferrous salt the addition of h2o2 occurred this instant corresponded to the start of the reaction i e corresponds to time zero t 0 periodically samples were collected at predetermined times to determine the remaining 4np concentration and the total organic carbon toc which were determined using the techniques described herein below cf section 2 4 in the run wherein h2o2 was gradually added along the reaction the experimental procedure was the same except that a fraction of oxidant was added every 5 min up to 55 min of process time in this experiment the residual concentration of h2o2 was also determined throughout the reaction and in the end the sample toxicity the fenton process assisted with uv visible radiation was carried out in a glass batch reactor with a capacity of 1 l equipped with a high pressure mercury lamp heraeus tq 150 with 500 w m2 which emits in wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm the lamp was inserted inside the reactor into the quartz tube connected to the thermostatic bath to maintain the temperature constant during the reaction this run was carried out the same way as fenton s runs the lamp was turned on immediately after adding the oxidant 2 4 analytical methods for toc analyses the samples along the process were collected to a glass bottle and a predetermined mass of excess sodium sulfite was added which reacts instantaneously with the remaining h2o2 this way stopping the oxidation process and precipitating the dissolved iron before toc analysis the samples were filtered using a nitrate membrane syringe filter with a porosity of 0 45 μm fioroni the toc concentration in the samples was determined using a shimadzu toc analyser model toc l by catalytic oxidation at 720 c according to the 5310 d method 48 for toxicity determination the samples were collected in glass bottles and the ph was raised to 10 0 using 10 m naoh promoting this way the elimination of the residual h2o2 and the precipitation of iron then the supernatant was collected and the ph was readjusted to 7 with 1 m hcl and filtered using a nitrate membrane with a porosity of 0 45 μm the toxicity tests were performed according to the din en iso 11348 3 49 in a microtox analyser modern water model 500 for the determination of the perceptual inhibition of the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri v fischeri in these tests each sample was put into contact with the bacteria for 5 15 and 30 min and the luminescence emitted by v fischeri was quantified the residual concentration of h2o2 was determined following the method developed by sellers 50 it measures the absorbance at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer helios γ model thermo electron corporation of the yellow colour due to the complex formed in the reaction between residual h2o2 with titanium and potassium oxide high performance liquid chromatography hplc hitachi lachrom elite was used to determine the concentration of 4np a volume of 20 μl of each sample same used to determine toxicity was injected in the column purospher star rp 18 5 mm 250 4 0 mm which was operated at 35 c with a mobile phase 10 90 of methanol and water acidified at ph 2 2 with phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 0 75 ml min the detection was performed at a wavelength of 280 nm 3 results and discussion the 4np solution prepared presents a ph of 4 6 toc of 260 mgc l and toxicity of 53 6 47 9 for contact times of 5 and 30 min respectively with the v fischeri bacteria therefore corroborating the dangerousness and importance of using this compound as a model for studies related to aops the fenton process is influenced by several parameters such as initial ph temperature oxidant and catalyst concentrations for the application of ccd considering all these parameters and their interactions 27 runs are necessary to be performed a preliminary parametric study was carried out to reduce the number of experiments and establish the levels in ccd whose results are discussed in the next section 3 1 preliminary runs the influence of the oxidant concentration the initial ph and the catalyst dose in the toc removal was evaluated in the parametric study to evaluate the effect of the initial oxidant concentration the range of 0 0 to 2 9 g l of h2o2 corresponding to 0 to 1 8 times the stoichiometric value based on the cod value of the 4np solution 758 2 mgo2 l was selected the other operating conditions were fixed at fe2 30 mg l ph 3 0 and t 30 c fig 2 a and b shows the results obtained being possible to verify that neither toc nor ph decreased when the oxidant concentration was null so 4np was not oxidised in the presence of the catalyst alone however an improvement in mineralisation was observed when adding h2o2 indicating that 4np was oxidised into carbon dioxide and water as well as some intermediate compounds like carboxylic acids 1 51 52 which may represent intermediate oxidation states and are responsible for a decrease in the ph of the solution as can be observed in fig 2b the h2o2 concentration had a positive effect on toc removal up to 2 4 mg l reaching 45 after 60 min of reaction but for a higher oxidant dose 2 9 g l the mineralisation decreased to 28 the appearance of an optimum for h2o2 concentration is due to parallel scavenging reactions between the excess of h2o2 and the ho species formed generating ho2 species with a lower oxidation potential eq 6 17 53 54 the best oxidant concentration found 2 4 g l and the smallest concentration tested 1 6 g l which permitted reaching the second best toc removal 40 were selected as 1 and 0 levels respectively of the ccd cf table 2 the effect of the initial ph was evaluated in the range of 2 5 to 4 0 fig 3a and b at the same time the other operating conditions were fixed fe2 30 mg l h2o2 2 4 g l value of the best toc removal reported in the previous section and t 30 c the maximum mineralisation was observed at ph 3 0 45 at 60 min fig 3a although the difference between the performance in the run at ph 3 5 was not significant 40 a negative effect of the initial ph was observed using the lowest ph 2 5 in which the toc removal reached less than 30 fig 3a under the conditions tested at the same time the ph also decreased along time in all runs performed as expected fig 3b the existence of an optimal initial ph value in fenton s process was previously reported and the range between 2 0 and 4 0 was usually adopted 50 51 55 for excessively acidic conditions the formation of ho is inhibited due to their scavenging by h in excess 55 additionally the decomposition of h2o2 could be promoting the production of h3o2 and therefore reaction with ferrous ions to generate the ho species does not occur at the expected rate 56 on the other hand for higher ph values the ferrous ion ends up precipitating at least partly becoming less catalyst dissolved and available for reaction with the h2o2 57 still higher ph values accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 into h2o and o2 58 consequently reducing the efficiency of the process in the ccd the ph was fixed at 3 5 because the performance is very close to that at a ph of 3 0 and reduces the amount of acid necessary for the acidification of the reaction medium to determine the catalyst concentration range for the ccd a series of preliminary runs were performed in the range of 0 to 180 mg l of fe2 the operational conditions were fixed as follows h2o2 2 4 g l ph 3 5 and t 30 c the run performed without catalyst only h2o2 reached a mineralisation of nearly 13 fig 4a associated with the small oxidation potential of h2o2 1 78 ev 59 the addition of the catalyst benefited the performance of the fenton s process fig 4a being that the maximum toc removal 40 was observed when using an iron concentration of 90 mg l see fig 4a so this concentration was selected as central point level of the ccd cf table 2 the mineralisation was similar for the highest ferrous ion dose 180 mg l the appearance of an optimum catalyst dose or a plateau is associated with the occurrence of undesirable scavenging reactions between the fe2 in excess and the hydroxyl radicals eq 5 52 thereby decreasing the amount of these radicals available for oxidation of the organic compounds regarding ph evolution acidification of the medium was observed for all runs fig 4b and it was the highest for the optimal catalyst concentration as mentioned above ph reduction during the reaction was associated with formation of intermediate compounds like carboxylic acids 60 3 2 ccd experimental design the ccd was performed taking into account the results achieved in the parametric study section 3 1 the initial ph value was fixed at 3 5 aiming to reduce the number of factors of the ccd because it allowed achieving the maximum mineralisation so the factors evaluated in ccd were the process temperature the concentration of h2o2 and the iron dose as reported in table 2 the temperature was selected as a factor due to its importance in the reaction kinetics 61 and its levels were determined based on other previous studies 62 65 the h2o2 and fe2 concentrations were determined in the parametric study previously reported see section 3 1 the responses evaluated for the ccd were the 4np removal and the mineralisation toc removal after 15 and 60 min of reaction they were established taking into account the importance of organic matter reduction for processes efficiency in wwtps which normally is achieved upon biological or biochemical process and whose monitoring is key to improve the modelling of wwtps and their performance 66 68 the results obtained are shown in table 3 the experiments corresponding to the centre of the cubic domain were performed in triplicate runs 9 11 the 4np removal observed varied between 94 2 and 94 4 standard deviation sd of 0 08 after 15 min and 97 1 97 2 sd 0 05 after 60 min the toc removal was in the range 27 8 30 4 sd 1 1 for 15 min and 31 3 33 3 sd 0 8 for 60 min see table 3 these results indicate the low error associated with the experimental performance the suitability of the quadratic model was tested by anova 69 table 4 summarises the results obtained the f ratio values reached for 4np removal after 15 and 60 min of reaction were slightly smaller than the fisher s f value f9 7 3 80 which indicates that the variations in the responses were associated with random errors and not to the model however the opposite was observed for mineralisation where f ratio was higher than f9 7 consequently the toc removal variations are associated with the model the p f values permits reaching to the same conclusion once for 4np removal at 60 min this value was higher than 0 05 considering a confidence level of 95 while for the other models was smaller than 0 05 however the r2 values indicated that 78 4 82 3 for 4np removal and 96 6 98 6 for mineralisation of the responses variability were associated with the model therefore it was concluded that the proposed models are in general a proper fit for the experimental data particularly those for toc removal for the second order models faithfulness analysis the student s t test was employed to identify the statistically significant variables and or interactions the results are shown in table 5 being concluded that i for 4np removal after 15 min only the oxidant dose x2 had a statistical significance p value 0 05 ii no variable or interaction affected the pollutant reduction after 60 min iii the temperature x1 and its quadratic term the h2o2 and iron concentrations respectively x2 and x3 influence the toc removal after 15 min and iv the mineralisation at 60 min was affected by temperature and h2o2 concentration since these parameters reported p values smaller than 0 05 for 95 confidence level eqs 9 12 represent the models obtained for all responses

fig 5a no variable influences the pollutant removal after 60 min of the fenton process fig 5b regarding mineralisation toc removal h2o2 concentration has a strong positive effect both at 15 and 60 min of reaction however the quadratic of the temperature and iron dose showed a negative effect for toc removal after 15 min of reaction fig 5c and d the predicted model responses for 4np removal after 15 min and toc removals after 15 and 60 min vs experimental results are presented in the parity plots fig 6 for 4np degradation the absolute deviations were less than 11 however the average is only 3 1 on the other hand minor absolute deviations were observed for the mineralisation with an average of 2 0 which indicated that the statistical models had an excellent fit to the experimental data as also found in previous studies using the same experimental design tools 70 73 surface plots for the toc removals based on the graphical representation of the model after 15 min eq 11 and after 60 min eq 12 are shown in fig 7 after 15 min of reaction the mineralisation increases with the oxidant concentration while for higher temperatures and excessive iron dose a negative effect in toc removal was observed after 60 min of fenton s reaction the toc removal improved with the h2o2 concentration and temperature regardless of the catalyst concentration in the range studied thus the lowest iron dose 5 9 mg l should be employed to reduce the consumption of chemicals and consequently reduce operating costs this is an important issue as it allows the reduction of iron containing sludge at the end of the treatment which is quite relevant for real application of fenton s process in wwtps regarding the decrease in 4np concentration the surface plots were not shown once the models predict that after 15 min of reaction only the dose of oxidant positively affects the response i e the removal of 4np increases with h2o2 and after 60 min it was independent of the conditions used in the treatment process being able to apply the minimum tested because the response will tend to the average value 3 3 approaches for mineralisation improvement taking into account that the model proposed by ccd for mineralisation after 60 min of fenton s reaction under the optimum conditions fe2 5 9 mg l t 70 2 c and h2o2 2 945 g l only predicted a mineralisation degree of 50 two approaches were carried out for improving the toc removal the first approach consisted of the gradual addition of h2o2 with the perspective of minimising the undesirable scavenging reactions the second one was implemented by applying uv visible radiation with the main goal to improve the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated according to eqs 1 and 13 14 74 75 and accelerate the regeneration of iron eqs 2 and 14 18 75 76 13 h 2 o 2 hν 2 ho 14 fe 3 h 2 o 2 hν fe 2 ho h 15 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe o 2 h 2 h 16 fe o 2 h 2 hν fe 2 ho 2 17 fe 3 rco 2 fe r co 2 2 18 fe r co 2 2 hν fe 2 co 2 r the mineralisation reached in the run wherein the oxidant was totally added at the beginning of the reaction was quick in the first 20 min of reaction nearly 40 and increased only slightly along the process up to 60 min wherein it reached 49 very close to the predicted value in the model 50 see fig 8a at the same time the h2o2 consumption was almost complete right at the beginning of the reaction fig 8b the degradation of 4np was complete after the first 5 min of the process under the conditions tested data not shown at the end of the process the effluent toxicity was null pointing to the efficiency of the conditions used to reduce the toxicity of the model solution from 53 6 47 9 to 0 and demonstrating that no toxic intermediates remained at the end of the treatment under the conditions tested from such an experiment it stands out that the homogeneous fenton s process was efficient without combination with other processes such as those reported in table 1 similar results of mineralisation and degradation 49 2 of toc removal and complete 4np degradation cf table 1 were obtained by rodrigues et al 11 when the same 4np concentration 500 mg l was treated using fenton s reagent in a bubble column reactor under batch mode conditions cf table 1 regarding the strategies used to increase the mineralisation the gradual oxidant addition promoted a progressive increase in the toc removal during the reaction fig 8a at the end of the process it was achieved the removal of 54 reporting the improvement in fenton s reagent efficiency however it is worth noting that the reaction could have been extended thus yielding higher performances as there was still hydrogen peroxide in the solution see fig 8b the increase in the process performance is explained by the fact of minimising the scavenging reaction eq 6 making more ho species available to degrade the organic compounds 12 however the best removal of toc was achieved for the run where the uv vis radiation was employed it was achieved 80 of mineralisation in just 20 min being that this period coincides with the total consumption of the oxidant the results obtained using fenton s reagent assisted by uv vis radiation were superior to those achieved by other authors that in most cases used lower 4np concentrations even with heterogeneous processes cf table 1 showing the higher efficiency of the homogeneous process this excellent performance of the treatment process is due to the fact that more hydroxyl radicals are generated because this occurs through more than one pathway eqs 1 and 13 14 as well as to the regeneration of iron ii eqs 2 and 14 18 which is essential for the reaction not to stop again in both approaches the complete degradation of 4np was reached which was not always the case in previous studies reported by other authors cf table 1 and the toxicity of the final effluent toward v fischeri bacteria was null 3 4 lumped kinetic model the lumped kinetic model lkm herein used was proposed to explain the mineralisation of organic compounds through several reactions 77 the model was proposed to represent the residual toc concentration profiles which is related to the formation of intermediate species during the application of aops for the treatment of organic pollutants 9 78 79 the lkm was chosen due to the good results obtained by other researchers 42 64 80 81 and considering the few literature concerning the application of this model to the homogeneous fenton s process usually studied for wet oxidation 79 and catalytic wet hydrogen peroxide oxidation 82 with some adaptations the lkm adopted was based on the model proposed by zaidan et al 41 42 who evaluated the degradation of phenol by catalytic wet peroxidation in short the organics are represented by a b and c species fig 9 74 the a element represents the initial compound 4np in this mechanism the model assumes that the oxidation reactions of this element and of the intermediate compounds are of the first order type the b element represents all intermediate compounds resulting from the initial compound a while the c element involves all co2 and h2o formed by complete oxidation of a and b 74 the lkm mechanism proposed in this study for 4np oxidation is based on eqs 19 and 20 41 42 19 a 4 np toc 0 20 b non refractory compounds refractory compounds toc 0 assuming first order reactions one has 41 42 21 d a dt k 1 k 3 a 22 d b dt k 1 a k 2 b eqs 21 and 22 were integrated considering the carbon residual fraction of the lumps a b and c considering also that in the initial time b c 0 and a a 0 yielding eqs 23 and 24 41 42 23 a a 0 exp k 1 k 3 t 24 b k 1 a 0 k 1 k 3 k 2 exp k 2 t exp k 1 k 3 t combining eqs 23 24 the toc profile was obtained eq 25 41 42 25 a b toc from the initial conditions i e t 0 a 0 1 and b 0 0 the model proposed for the residual carbon profile is the following 41 42 26 toc toc 0 k 1 k 1 k 3 k 2 exp k 2 t k 3 k 2 k 1 k 3 k 2 exp k 1 k 3 t the kinetic constants k1 k2 and k3 were obtained from the model fitting to the toc data obtained in the samples collected along the reactions performed under the optimum conditions dark fenton process with the total and gradual addition of h2o2 as well as fenton process assisted with uv visible radiation the determination of the kinetic constants was performed by applying a nonlinear regression while minimising the quadratic sum of the residues to the remaining toc fraction using the solver tool from microsoft office excel data obtained are shown in table 6 the lkm applied for fenton s optimised conditions total oxidant addition experiment has a kinetic constant for the intermediate species formation k1 slightly superior than the kinetic constant for the direct mineralisation of 4np k3 cf table 6 it shows that the concentration of intermediate species that remains during the treatment is significant comparing the different ways of adding the oxidant total at the beginning vs gradually throughout the reaction to the fenton process an increase in the apparent kinetic constants except k3 is observed being particularly evident an increase in the oxidation rate of 4np and corresponding intermediates yielding thus a more efficient process compared with the dark fenton process in the same conditions i e all oxidant added at the beginning of the run it is noteworthy that all apparent kinetic constants increase when uv vis radiation is present particularly it stands out the increase in the kinetic constant k3 which is responsible for the lower concentration of intermediate species formed and better efficiency of the treatment for the uv vis assisted process in the mineralisation of 4np the lkm well adjusted the experimental data obtained for the residual toc in all reactions as shown in fig 10 there is an excellent relationship between the observed experimental data and those predicted by the model for toc toc0 including both approaches employed to improve the mineralisation other authors e g 41 42 reported similar data fitting when applied the same lkm to degrade phenol by other aops finally it is worth stressing that the partial oxidation or incomplete mineralisation promoted in some cases by the fenton s reaction could be reduced by applying coupled technologies like being assisted with uv vis radiation even so the toxicity results obtained at the end of fenton s process do not report risk to the discharge of the final effluent treated confirming the efficiency of fenton s process even with moderate mineralisation 4 conclusions the degradation of 4np and its mineralisation by the homogeneous fenton s process under batch mode conditions depends upon several conditions as ph temperature and chemicals concentration the ccd experimental design adopted in this work allowed to establish models for 4np removal and mineralisation toc removal after 15 and 60 min of reaction and the optimal operating conditions were determined the models proposed show that only the initial oxidant concentration affects the 4np degradation for 15 min of reaction however at the end of the process 60 min it was independent of the operating conditions regarding mineralisation it was found that after 15 min of reaction all parameters oxidant and catalyst concentrations and temperature affect the response the optimal conditions adopted for the treatment were determined from the model for the toc removal after 60 min which was influenced by the temperature and the oxidant concentration allowing to reduce the use of catalyst concentration in the process under the best conditions found for mineralisation after 60 min of fenton s oxidation t 70 2 c h2o2 2 945 g l and fe2 5 9 mg l a total 4np degradation and null toxicity of the effluent was reached however the mineralisation achieved was less than 50 at the end of the treatment so two approaches to improve the mineralisation gradual addition of oxidant or assisting the fenton process by uv vis radiation were used increasing the mineralisation to 80 when the uv vis radiation was applied to the fenton process for the first time the lkm was applied to describe the carbon residual fraction during fenton s process for the treatment of 4np results obtained proved that the model was satisfactory to describe the toc conversion and the formation of intermediates in the fenton reaction with total and gradual oxidant

13009,this study demonstrates the application of a newly isolated bacterium n circulans dc10 for the degradation of azo dye reactive red 152 rr152 and bio electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell mfc system when used as an anodic biocatalyst n circulans dc10 achieved 94 78 1 17 decolourization and 89 55 2 28 cod reduction within 72 h in the mfc system along with 166 48 mw m2 maximum power density generation the ft ir and gc ms analysis suggested that n circulans dc10 utilizes the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway for degradation of rr152 in the dual chamber mfc system the genome sequence analysis of n circulans dc10 revealed the presence of flavin mononucleotide fmn dependant nadh azoreductase gene azor and a cluster of genes most of which participate in the biosynthesis of type iv pili t4p an extracellular appendage the rt qpcr analysis showed that the expression levels of azor gene increased around seven folds and t4p assembly genes pilt pilz expression levels increased more than two folds in n circulans dc10 during active biodegradation of rr152 in the anode of mfc systems as compared to the static control flask cultures the obtained results suggest that t4p has a role in promoting cell adherence to the surface of anode by n circulans dc10 for exo electron transfer generating bioelectricity the cumulative effect of azor and type iv pilus assembly genes resulted in efficient bio electrogenic degradation of azo dye rr152 in the mfc system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell azo dye degradation bioelectricity direct electron transfer genome annotation 1 introduction azo dyes are water soluble synthetic aromatic compounds that are extensively used for textile dyeing applications with an estimated annual production of 1 million tons 1 2 azo dyes consist of single or multiple azo nn groups along with aromatic rings that are often substituted with sulfonic acid so3 groups 3 a huge proportion of the applied dyes are lost during textile dyeing processes and the resultant dye wastewater is difficult to remediate 4 5 the discharge of textile wastewaters containing azo dyes and their partially degraded products are known to pollute the aquatic ecosystems and exerting toxic and mutagenic effects 6 conventional physico chemical textile dye treatment approaches are known to have higher energy requirements and also result in generation of secondary waste 7 in contrast bioremediation approaches are considered as an eco sustainable option for the treatment of textile dye wastewaters 7 8 microbial biodegradation of azo dyes is mediated by various oxidoreductase enzymes produced by bacteria and fungi that are known to cleave the azo dye structures 1 the azoreductases peroxidases and laccases are some of the major bacterial enzymes that commonly participate in the degradation of azo dyes and facilitate the cleavage of azo bonds nn resulting in the formation of amines 9 10 azoreductase enzymes are further divided into two categories flavin mononucleotide fmn dependent and fmn independent based on their co factor requirements 11 microbial fuel cells mfcs offer a plausible approach for azo dye degradation using electroactive bacteria eab which convert chemical energy of xenobiotic pollutants into the bioelectricity 4 some of the advantages of using mfcs for textile dye remediation over conventional methods include lower sludge generation during anaerobic processes at the anode accessory power generation instead of energy consumption and ambient operational conditions achieving either oxidation or reduction of textile dyes 12 13 the low power output of mfcs has confined their applicability in the large scale operation despite their wide use in the wastewater treatment soil bioremediation and application as biosensors 14 16 the power extraction can be improved by enhancing the bacterial extracellular electron transfer in the mfc systems 17 recently it has been demonstrated that electroactive bacteria achieve higher power generation along with biodegradation of organic pollutants in the mfc systems 18 the acceleration of azo dye reduction is crucially dependent on the eabs enriched at the anode most of these eabs are exoelectrogens meaning that they have the ability to shuttle electrons generated from the degradation of substrate to the electrodes by mechanisms of projected nanowires outer membrane cytochromes or redox mediators 19 there are two mechanisms direct and indirect electron transfer by which electrogenic bacteria donate electrons to the electrodes 20 direct electron transfer mechanism involves the transfer of electrons on the outer membrane of bacteria by redox active proteins type iv pili t4p systems and electrically conductive nanowires 20 in the indirect mechanism electron transfer occurs though electroactive exogenous or endogenous redox mediators such as humic acids phenazines flavins methyl viologen etc 21 in this study a rod shaped gram positive bacterium niallia circulans dc10 was isolated from the soil sediments of a pilot scale constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc system bacterial strains within the genus niallia gen nov are facultatively anaerobic group of bacteria having versatile applications in bioremediation wastewater treatment and enzyme production 22 recently a related bacterial strain bbl03 of bacillus circulans sp now known as niallia circulans was demonstrated to utilize chitin biomass as a substrate for bioelectricity generation in a dual chamber mfc system 23 therefore the

joel japan 2 6 extraction of total rna and real time pcr analysis for the relative gene expression analysis bacterial samples were collected from suspended culture of the anode chamber in the mfc

polluted soil sediments of cw mfc system was purified by repeated streaking on bhm agar plates maintained at 4 c and preserved as glycerol 20 v v stock at 80 c after incubation at 37 c for 48 h white pigmented colony was selected and designated as strain dc10 based on its ability to form larger clear yellow zone indicating efficient decolourization of rr152 dye 100 ppm upon further characterization of the bacterial strains isiolate dc10 showed maximum dye decolourization abilities in bhm rr152 medium as compared to other screened isolates therefore the bacterial strain dc10 was chosen as an anodic biocatalyst in the dual chamber mfc system 3 2 phylogenetic identification and genomic architecture of n circulans dc10 based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the isolated strain dc10 was identified as n circulans blast results from ncbi database showed maximum similarity 98 to n circulans strains which confirmed its taxonomical identity phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences between strains dc10 and closely related n circulans strains from ncbi blast search showed that dc10 was most closely related to the n circulans nbrc 13634 by forming a separate clade in the tree fig 1 the whole genome sequencing assembly results showed that the genome consisted of 5 204 420 bp in length assembled into 72 contigs with a g c content of 35 2 mol which is within the range of 30 52 mol reported for the genus bacillus 32 the circular map of genome was created using patric program https www patricbrc org which showed open reading frames orfs contigs gc skew and start stop codon regions inside the genome fig 2a the patric server predicted 5248 coding sequences cdss out of which 1741 were hypothetical proteins 3507 proteins with functional assignments along with 74 trnas and 5 rrnas respectively patric annotation included distribution of 5283 genes into detailed subsystem categories fig 2b major subsystem features and their genes were of metabolism 682 followed by protein processing 241 cellular processes 208 energy 172 stress response defense virulence 115 dna processing 92 membrane transport 90 rna processing 57 regulation and cell signaling 13 cell envelope 8 and miscellaneous proteins 7 the ani analysis between compared dc10 and related n circulans genomes using anib ncbi revealed the distinct position of strain dc10 as an outlier strain as confirmed by its separate clustering outside the entire genomic groups in the dual dendrogram based on anib calculations it was confirmed that genome of strain dc10 was highly similar to n circulans strains rit379 and gn03 with the percentage identities of 85 30 and 84 70 respectively fig 2c the genome sequencing showed the presence of an azor gene responsible for azo dye degradation this finding supports our study on dye decolourization during mfc operation where dye rr152 was used as model azo dye and 89 35 2 43 decolourization was achieved within 72 h by the bacterium n circulans dc10 the t4p which is a cluster of at least 30 genes assembled for twitching motility and other important cellular functions in bacteria was detected in the genome of n circulans dc10 33 the entire region of t4p assembly in n circulans dc10 comprised of pilus assembly genes enlisted in the table 2 genes such as pila pilb pilc pilm piln pilo pilt pilz sporulation related genes spovb spoob safa spoivfa spoivfb septum site determining genes minc mind as well as rod shape determining genes mreb mrec mred which are altogether implicated in important cellular processes including motility virulence biofilm formation and in bioelectricity generation 34 3 3 performance of n circulans dc10 in the dual chamber mfc system the genus niallia gen nov consists of facultatively anaerobic bacteria which are capable of growing in aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions 22 in this study the bacterial culture n circulans dc10 was isolated by conventional plating and used as an inoculum in the anode chamber of the mfc under anaerobic conditions dye degradation ability of n circulans dc10 was evaluated at two different concentrations of rr152 dye in the mfc system 100 and 300 ppm in the mfc with 100 ppm of rr152 concentration 52 58 1 87 decolourization was achieved within 12 h by n circulans dc10 along with 33 45 1 99 cod reduction fig 3a b post 72 h the total decolourization and cod reduction achieved by n circulans dc10 was 98 76 0 56 and 89 78 3 54 respectively on the other hand in the mfc system with 300 ppm rr152 concentration 40 86 2 21 decolourization and 29 09 2 50 cod reduction was achieved by n circulans dc10 within 12 h likewise total decolourization and cod reduction achieved within 72 h in the mfc system having 300 ppm rr152 was determined to be 94 78 1 17 and 89 55 2 28 respectively fig 3a b in the abiotic control mfc system 1 8 0 51 decolourization and 2 21 0 65 cod reduction was observed at 300 ppm dye concentration within 72 h at 37 c fig 3a b which indicates that the adsorption of rr152 dye on the electrode surface has a minimal effect on the decolourization and cod reduction in the abiotic controls the mfc achieved a stable voltage generation between 40 and 48 h after inoculation stable voltage output of 338 78 6 38 mv and 279 70 9 53 mv were generated in the mfc systems with 100 ppm and 300 ppm rr152 concentrations respectively in closed circuit condition with an external resistor of 500 ω furthermore the power production by mfc system was higher in the absence of rr152 dye in the anode chamber in the absence of the rr152 in the anode chamber of control mfc the maximum power density of 269 28 mw m2 was observed after 72 h fig 3c whereas when rr152 was added in the anode chamber with 100 ppm concentration maximum power density produced by the mfc system notably decreased to 217 84 mw m2 furthermore maximum power density of the system further decreased to 166 48 mw m2 with 300 ppm rr152 concentration in the anode chamber these results suggest that the power density sharply decreased with the increase in the rr152 dye concentration in the mfc system the anode electrode and azo bonds in the dye structure both have the affinity for the electrons produced by the bacterium upon catabolism of dye and co substrates in the anode chamber of the mfc system as a consequence there is a competition of electrons between anode electrode and the azo group of dyes therefore anode gets comparatively less electrons which results in the decrease in the power production at higher azo dye concentrations 19 additionally high concentrations of the azo dyes are known to exert toxicity on the electroactive dye degrading bacteria used in the mfc system 19 therefore due to decrease in the activity of n circulans dc10 decolourization and cod reduction also decreased at the 300 ppm rr152 concentration in the mfc system the voltage generation of the mfc system inoculated with n circulans dc10 and rr152 dye 100 ppm follows the typical tendency of mfc voltage output which are the voltage loss ohmic loss and activation losses as depicted in the fig 3c 35 the power generation by n circulans dc10 at 100 ppm concentration of rr152 was determined to be 217 84 mw m2 which is higher than a previously reported study utilizing a similar mfc configuration for the degradation of acid orange 7 ao7 dye 100 ppm using shewanella oneidensis resulting in a power density output of 42 5 2 6 mw m2 12 as discussed in the section 3 2 n circulans dc10 possesses the type iv pilus t4p assembly proteins which are extracellular nano sized thin hair like appendages involved in the exo electron transfer by the bacterium to the anode of mfc systems 36 the major functions of these pili include the transfer of dna during conjugation formation of biofilm cell adhesion and motility 37 most of the functions of this type of pili have been linked to mobility and adherence to various biotic and abiotic surfaces 38 39 during the electrogenic degradation in the mfc system expression of t4p assembly proteins of n circulans dc10 increased section 3 6 which indicates that the bacterium uses t4p to mediate direct electron transfer to the anode this may be the reason behind the higher electrogenic potential of n circulans dc10 in the mfc system the electrochemical interaction between bacteria and the electrode surface in the mfc system is recently widely explored with the help of the cyclic voltammetry cv analysis the information related to the redox activity of components during a mfc operation is known by the observation of its current as a function of potential 40 the cv of the mfc systems was analysed with the three different anolytes with rr125 300 ppm pure culture without rr152 and the system without bacteria and rr152 control system the cv output of the control system had negligible current response in the presence of applied voltage on the other hand the mfc inoculated with n circulans without rr152 gave higher current response as compared to control system fig 3d the highest current output was observed in the mfc system inoculated with n circulans and rr152 300 ppm this observation suggests that rr152 dye and its degraded metabolites have a redox potential which also influences the electrochemical reactions on the anode surface in a recent study no significant current generation was observed in response to the external voltage in the mfc system with no bacteria in the anolyte 41 similar results were obtained in a previous study where a mfc system with reactive blue 19 rb19 in the anolyte gave high current activity as compared to the mfc control with no dye in the anolyte 42 the pure culture of n circulans dc10 mediates the exoelectron transfer directly to the anode by utilizing t4p assembly proteins which might be the reason behind the higher current response as compared to the abiotic control mfc systems as shown in fig 3d both the bacterial culture of n circulans dc10 and azo dye rr152 are possibly involved in the redox reactions at the anode which resulted in the highest current response among all three mfc system against the same applied voltage in the cv analysis 3 4 rr152 functional groups and biodegradation pathway the ftir spectrum of untreated rr152 disclosed the naphthalene or benzene rings specific peaks in the fingerprint region the peak at 3444 cm 1 indicates the oh stretching and presence of nh bond the peaks at wavenumber 1757 and 1455 cm 1 indicates the presence of co in the structure of the rr152 dye peak at the wavenumber 1549 cm 1 represents the nn azo bond stretching and peak at the wavenumber 1621 cm 1 indicates the cc stretching of aromatic rings on the other hand ft ir spectrum of dye degradation metabolites formed after treatment in the mfc system showed that the azo bond peak at 1549 cm 1 wavenumber disappeared from the spectrum indicating that the azo bond is effectively degraded by the n circulans dc10 fig 4a strong peak at the wavenumber 1664 cm 1 confirmed the presence of co stretching of the carboxylic acid group additionally peak at 2923 cm 1 wavenumber indicates the presence of aliphatic ch bond in the chemical structure the presence of primary amide group was confirmed by the peaks at 3382 cm 1 representing the nh stretching vibrations similar results of chemical shifts were observed in a previous study on azo dye metanil yellow g myg degradation by a halo thermophilic bacterial consortium under microaerophilic conditions 43 the ft ir analysis confirmed the breakdown of azo bonds in the dye structure whereas gc ms was used to predict the intermediates of rr152 dye degradation after bacterial treatment under anaerobic conditions in the anode n circulans dc10 was observed to cleave the azo bond and complex chemical structure of the dye resulting in the formation of acid and pyrrolo 1 2 a pyrazine 1 4 dione hexahydro 3 2 methylpropyl mw 210 propanoic acid 2 2 dimethyl 2 phenylethyl ester mw 172 and finally phenylacetic acid mw 136 fig 4b phenylacetic acid gets further degraded by the bacterial phenylacetic acid catabolism pathway and is mineralised into co2 and water in the tca cycle 44 similar azo dye degradation metabolites were detected by gc ms analysis in a previous study demonstrating the degradation of mixed azo dyes by a bacterial consortium in the dual chamber mfc system 41 3 5 sem analysis and biofilm morphology the sem analysis of the anode surface after 72 h of the mfc operation revealed the extensive biofilm formation of n circulans dc10 as shown in fig 5 the n circulans dc10 cells were clearly observed in the biofilm as shown in the sem images fig 5b d previously narayanasamy and jayaprakash 45 reported a similar morphology of graphite surface and pattern of biofilm formation by pseudomonas aeruginosa on the anode of mfc system which was used for azo dye methyl orange degradation these findings suggest that the n circulans dc10 can adhere to the electrode surface form biofilm and transfer electrons directly to the anode which results in the higher power output by the mfc system 3 6 relative quantification of azor pilt and pilz gene expression in n circulans dc10 during mfc operation expression of fmn dependant azoreductase of n circulans dc10 was induced in the presence of azo dye rr152 as determined by qrt pcr assays during the electrogenic treatment in the mfc system azor was expressed 2 65 0 42 fold higher as compared to the control flask culture at 12 h fig 6a expression levels of azor significantly increased by 5 47 0 58 folds in the anode suspended as cells of the mfc system within 24 h of rr152 treatment as compared to control static flask cultures the expression of azor gene was found to increase further at 48 h by 7 56 0 86 fold as compared to control in the mfc system following 72 h expression levels of azor slightly decreased as compared to its expression at 48 h in both the flask and suspended bacterial cells of mfc system expression levels of azor gene was 6 54 0 73 fold higher in the anode suspended bacterial cells of the mfc system as compared to control at 72 h subsequently expression levels of azor in the anode biofilm was 6 84 0 57 fold higher as compared to control which is slightly higher but not statistically significant than in the suspended bacterial cells present in the anode chamber fig 6a a previous similar study also reported that the enzyme activity of nadh azo reductase in an anaerobic bacterial community increased when the concentration of azo dye acid black 10b was increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l in the bio electrochemical treatment systems bet 46 the results obtained indicates that n circulans dc10 can attach to the anode surface and transfer the electrons directly without any mediators in a recent study by gurav et al 23 a similar bacterium bacillus circulans strain bbl03 newly proposed genus niallia showed bioelectricity generation in the mfc system by utilizing chitin biomass as substrate whole genome sequencing revealed the presence of type iv pilus operon in the genome of n circulans dc10 which encodes t4p on the surface of the bacteria type iv pilus in the gram positive bacteria plays a distinct role in processes such as colonization twitching motility cellular adhesion horizontal gene transfer and biofilm formation 47 apart from these functions t4p also acts as microbial nanowires in the electroactive bacteria such as geobacter sulfurreducens and transfers electrons directly to the anode surface by direct attachment 48 as described in the previous section t4p comprises of different assembly proteins such as pila pilb pilc pilm piln pilo and pilt the protein pilt functions as pilus retraction atpase and is involved in twitching motility 49 moreover pilt protein also plays a crucial role in surface adhesion and formation of biofilm 50 therefore the pilt gene was selected for gene expression studies in the n circulans dc10 during dye degradation and mfc operation increase in the expression level of pilt directly correlated with the twitching motility and biofilm formation by n circulans dc10 similarly another gene chosen for expression studies pilz also encodes the t4p assembly protein which is essential for t4p biogenesis 51 during the electrogenic treatment in the mfc system pilt expression was 1 44 0 22 fold higher as compared to control at 12 h fig 6b expression levels of pilt in n circulans dc10 significantly increased by 2 02 0 15 fold in the suspended cells of mfc system as compared to control at 24 h expression levels of pilt was maximum at 48 h with an increase of 2 53 0 16 fold as compared to control in the mfc system at 72 h as compared to control flask system the expression levels of pilt was found to be 2 36 0 23 fold and 2 14 0 18 fold higher in the anode biofilm and suspended bacterial cells in the anode chamber respectively fig 6b additionally expression levels of pilz also significantly increased during electrogenic degradation of rr152 in the mfc system expression of pilz gene was 1 25 0 13 1 97 0 22 and 2 33 0 19 fold higher in the mfc anode chamber as compared to control at 12 24 and 48 h respectively fig 6c likewise as compared to control at 72 h expression levels of pilz in the anode biofilm and anode suspended cells of the mfc increased to 2 24 0 14 and 2 01 0 24 folds respectively similar results were obtained in a recent study where mfc system was operated with kluyvera georgiana mcc 3673 inoculated with the luria bertani lb medium in the anode chamber the gene expression levels of pilq a t4p assembly protein of k georgiana mcc 3673 was found to be two fold higher during the mfc operation as compared to control flask cultures 34 these results indicate that t4p synthesis in n circulans dc10 increased during an electrogenic degradation of rr152 in the dual chamber mfc system which facilitated the biofilm formation and direct electron transfer to the anode 4 conclusion the bacterium n circulans dc10 achieved efficient degradation of rr152 azo dye in the dual chamber mfc system genome sequence analysis of dc10 identified the genes such as fmn dependant azo reductase azor t4p assembly protein genes pilt and pilz assumed to be responsible for electrogenic azo dye degradation expression levels of pilt pilz and azor genes were found to be higher in the mfc system as compared to control static falsks therefore it can be concluded that type iv pilli in n circulans have a significant role in motility of bacterium towards the anode anodic attachment biofilm formation and exo electron transfer to the anode which resulted in higher redox potential of the mfc system the n circulans dc10 achieved generation of higher power density outputs in the mfc system along with efficient decolourization and cod reduction at higher concentration 300 ppm of rr152 dye these results demonstrate that the n circulans dc10 with enhanced abilities for exo electron transfer and azo dye degradation can be utilized as an effective biocatalyst for the sustainable treatment of textile dye wastewater in the

13009,this study demonstrates the application of a newly isolated bacterium n circulans dc10 for the degradation of azo dye reactive red 152 rr152 and bio electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell mfc system when used as an anodic biocatalyst n circulans dc10 achieved 94 78 1 17 decolourization and 89 55 2 28 cod reduction within 72 h in the mfc system along with 166 48 mw m2 maximum power density generation the ft ir and gc ms analysis suggested that n circulans dc10 utilizes the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway for degradation of rr152 in the dual chamber mfc system the genome sequence analysis of n circulans dc10 revealed the presence of flavin mononucleotide fmn dependant nadh azoreductase gene azor and a cluster of genes most of which participate in the biosynthesis of type iv pili t4p an extracellular appendage the rt qpcr analysis showed that the expression levels of azor gene increased around seven folds and t4p assembly genes pilt pilz expression levels increased more than two folds in n circulans dc10 during active biodegradation of rr152 in the anode of mfc systems as compared to the static control flask cultures the obtained results suggest that t4p has a role in promoting cell adherence to the surface of anode by n circulans dc10 for exo electron transfer generating bioelectricity the cumulative effect of azor and type iv pilus assembly genes resulted in efficient bio electrogenic degradation of azo dye rr152 in the mfc system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell azo dye degradation bioelectricity direct

are known to pollute the aquatic ecosystems and exerting toxic and mutagenic effects 6 conventional physico chemical textile dye treatment approaches are known to have higher energy requirements and also result in generation of secondary waste 7 in contrast bioremediation approaches are considered as an eco sustainable option for the treatment of textile dye wastewaters 7 8 microbial biodegradation of azo dyes is mediated by various oxidoreductase enzymes produced by bacteria and fungi that are known to cleave the azo dye structures 1 the azoreductases peroxidases and laccases are some of the major bacterial enzymes that commonly participate in the degradation of azo dyes and facilitate the cleavage of azo bonds nn resulting in the formation of amines 9 10 azoreductase enzymes are further divided into two categories flavin mononucleotide fmn dependent and fmn independent based on their co factor requirements 11 microbial fuel cells mfcs offer a plausible approach for azo dye degradation using electroactive bacteria eab which convert chemical energy of xenobiotic pollutants into the bioelectricity 4 some of the advantages of using mfcs for textile dye remediation over conventional methods include lower sludge generation during anaerobic processes at the anode accessory power generation instead of energy consumption and ambient operational conditions achieving either oxidation or reduction of textile dyes 12 13 the low power output of mfcs has confined their applicability in the large scale operation despite their wide use in the wastewater treatment soil bioremediation and application as biosensors 14 16 the power extraction can be improved by enhancing the bacterial extracellular electron transfer in the mfc systems 17 recently it has been demonstrated that electroactive bacteria achieve higher power generation along with biodegradation of organic pollutants in the mfc systems 18 the acceleration of azo dye reduction is crucially dependent on the eabs enriched at the anode most of these eabs are exoelectrogens meaning that they have the ability to shuttle electrons generated from the degradation of substrate to the electrodes by mechanisms of projected nanowires outer membrane cytochromes or redox mediators 19 there are two mechanisms direct and indirect electron transfer by which electrogenic bacteria donate electrons to the electrodes 20 direct electron transfer mechanism involves the transfer of electrons on the outer membrane of bacteria by redox active proteins type iv pili t4p systems and electrically conductive nanowires 20 in the indirect mechanism electron transfer occurs though electroactive exogenous or endogenous redox mediators such as humic acids phenazines flavins methyl viologen etc 21 in this study

joel japan 2 6 extraction of total rna and real time pcr analysis for the relative gene expression analysis bacterial samples were collected from suspended culture of the anode chamber in the mfc

polluted soil sediments of cw mfc system was purified by repeated streaking on bhm agar plates maintained at 4 c and preserved as glycerol 20 v v stock at 80 c after incubation at 37 c for 48 h white pigmented colony was selected and designated as strain dc10 based on its ability to form larger clear yellow zone indicating efficient decolourization of rr152 dye 100 ppm upon further characterization of the bacterial strains isiolate dc10 showed maximum dye decolourization abilities in bhm rr152 medium as compared to other screened isolates therefore the bacterial strain dc10 was chosen as an anodic biocatalyst in the dual chamber mfc system 3 2 phylogenetic identification and genomic architecture of n circulans dc10 based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the isolated strain dc10 was identified as n circulans blast results from ncbi database showed maximum similarity 98 to n circulans strains which confirmed its taxonomical identity phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences between strains dc10 and closely related n circulans strains from ncbi blast search showed that dc10 was most closely related to the n circulans nbrc 13634 by forming a separate clade in the tree fig 1 the whole genome sequencing assembly results showed that the genome consisted of 5 204 420 bp in length assembled into 72 contigs with a g c content of 35 2 mol which is within the range of 30 52 mol reported for the genus bacillus 32 the circular map of genome was created using patric program https www patricbrc org which showed open reading frames orfs contigs gc skew and start stop codon regions inside the genome fig 2a the patric server predicted 5248 coding sequences cdss out of which 1741 were hypothetical proteins 3507 proteins with functional assignments along with 74 trnas and 5 rrnas respectively patric annotation included distribution of 5283 genes into detailed subsystem categories fig 2b major subsystem features and their genes were of metabolism 682 followed by protein processing 241 cellular processes 208 energy 172 stress response defense virulence 115 dna processing 92 membrane transport 90 rna processing 57 regulation and cell signaling 13 cell envelope 8 and miscellaneous proteins 7 the ani analysis between compared dc10 and related n circulans genomes using anib ncbi revealed the distinct position of strain dc10 as an outlier strain as confirmed by its separate clustering outside the entire genomic groups in the dual dendrogram based on anib calculations it was confirmed that genome of strain dc10 was highly similar to n circulans strains rit379 and gn03 with the percentage identities of 85 30 and 84 70 respectively fig 2c the genome sequencing showed the presence of an azor gene responsible for azo dye degradation this finding supports our study on dye decolourization during mfc operation where dye rr152 was used as model azo dye and 89 35 2 43 decolourization was achieved within 72 h by the bacterium n circulans dc10 the t4p which is a cluster of at least 30 genes assembled for twitching motility and other important cellular functions in bacteria was detected in the genome of n circulans dc10 33 the entire region of t4p assembly in n circulans dc10 comprised of pilus assembly genes enlisted in the table 2 genes such as pila pilb pilc pilm piln pilo pilt pilz sporulation related genes spovb spoob safa spoivfa spoivfb septum site determining genes minc mind as well as rod shape determining genes mreb mrec mred which are altogether implicated in important cellular processes including motility virulence biofilm formation and in bioelectricity generation 34 3 3 performance of n circulans dc10 in the dual chamber mfc system the genus niallia gen nov consists of facultatively anaerobic bacteria which are capable of growing in aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions 22 in this study the bacterial culture n circulans dc10 was isolated by conventional plating and used as an inoculum in the anode chamber of the mfc under anaerobic conditions dye degradation ability of n circulans dc10 was evaluated at two different concentrations of rr152 dye in the mfc system 100 and 300 ppm in the mfc with 100 ppm of rr152 concentration 52 58 1 87 decolourization was achieved within 12 h by n circulans dc10 along with 33 45 1 99 cod reduction fig 3a b post 72 h the total decolourization and cod reduction achieved by n circulans dc10 was 98 76 0 56 and 89 78 3 54 respectively on the other hand in the mfc system with 300 ppm rr152 concentration 40 86 2 21 decolourization and 29 09 2 50 cod reduction was achieved by n circulans dc10 within 12 h likewise total decolourization and cod reduction achieved within 72 h in the mfc system having 300 ppm rr152 was determined to be 94 78 1 17 and 89 55 2 28 respectively fig 3a b in the abiotic control mfc system 1 8 0 51 decolourization and 2 21 0 65 cod reduction was observed at 300 ppm dye concentration within 72 h at 37 c fig 3a b which indicates that the adsorption of rr152 dye on the electrode surface has a minimal effect on the decolourization and cod reduction in the abiotic controls the mfc achieved a stable voltage generation between 40 and 48 h after inoculation stable voltage output of 338 78 6 38 mv and 279 70 9 53 mv were generated in the mfc systems with 100 ppm and 300 ppm rr152 concentrations respectively in closed circuit condition with an external resistor of 500 ω furthermore the power production by mfc system was higher in the absence of rr152 dye in the anode chamber in the absence of the rr152 in the anode chamber of control mfc the maximum power density of 269 28 mw m2 was observed after 72 h fig 3c whereas when rr152 was added in the anode chamber with 100 ppm concentration maximum power density produced by the mfc system notably decreased to 217 84 mw m2 furthermore maximum power density of the system further decreased to 166 48 mw m2 with 300 ppm rr152 concentration in the anode chamber these results suggest that the power density sharply decreased with the increase in the rr152 dye concentration in the mfc system the anode electrode and azo bonds in the dye structure both have the affinity for the electrons produced by the bacterium upon catabolism of dye and co substrates in the anode chamber of the mfc system as a consequence there is a competition of electrons between anode electrode and the azo group of dyes therefore anode gets comparatively less electrons which results in the decrease in the power production at higher azo dye concentrations 19 additionally high concentrations of the azo dyes are known to exert toxicity on the electroactive dye degrading bacteria used in the mfc system 19 therefore due to decrease in the activity of n circulans dc10 decolourization and cod reduction also decreased at the 300 ppm rr152 concentration in the mfc system the voltage generation of the mfc system inoculated with n circulans dc10 and rr152 dye 100 ppm follows the typical tendency of mfc voltage output which are the voltage loss ohmic loss and activation losses as depicted in the fig 3c 35 the power generation by n circulans dc10 at 100 ppm concentration of rr152 was determined to be 217 84 mw m2 which is higher than a previously reported study utilizing a similar mfc configuration for the degradation of acid orange 7 ao7 dye 100 ppm using shewanella oneidensis resulting in a power density output of 42 5 2 6 mw m2 12 as discussed in the section 3 2 n circulans dc10 possesses the type iv pilus t4p assembly proteins which are extracellular nano sized thin hair like appendages involved in the exo electron transfer by the bacterium to the anode of mfc systems 36 the major functions of these pili include the transfer of dna during conjugation formation of biofilm cell adhesion and motility 37 most of the functions of this type of pili have been linked to mobility and adherence to various biotic and abiotic surfaces 38 39 during the electrogenic degradation in the mfc system expression of t4p assembly proteins of n circulans dc10 increased section 3 6 which indicates that the bacterium uses t4p to mediate direct electron transfer to the anode this may be the reason behind the higher electrogenic potential of n circulans dc10 in the mfc system the electrochemical interaction between bacteria and the electrode surface in the mfc system is recently widely explored with the help of the cyclic voltammetry cv analysis the information related to the redox activity of components during a mfc operation is known by the observation of its current as a function of potential 40 the cv of the mfc systems was analysed with the three different anolytes with rr125 300 ppm pure culture without rr152 and the system without bacteria and rr152 control system the cv output of the control system had negligible current response in the presence of applied voltage on the other hand the mfc inoculated with n circulans without rr152 gave higher current response as compared to control system fig 3d the highest current output was observed in the mfc system inoculated with n circulans and rr152 300 ppm this observation suggests that rr152 dye and its degraded metabolites have a redox potential which also influences the electrochemical reactions on the anode surface in a recent study no significant current generation was observed in response to the external voltage in the mfc system with no bacteria in the anolyte 41 similar results were obtained in a previous study where a mfc system with reactive blue 19 rb19 in the anolyte gave high current activity as compared to the mfc control with no dye in the anolyte 42 the pure culture of n circulans dc10 mediates the exoelectron transfer directly to the anode by utilizing t4p assembly proteins which might be the reason behind the higher current response as compared to the abiotic control mfc systems as shown in fig 3d both the bacterial culture of n circulans dc10 and azo dye rr152 are possibly involved in the redox reactions at the anode which resulted in the highest current response among all three mfc system against the same applied voltage in the cv analysis 3 4 rr152 functional groups and biodegradation pathway the ftir spectrum of untreated rr152 disclosed the naphthalene or benzene rings specific peaks in the fingerprint region the peak at 3444 cm 1 indicates the oh stretching and presence of nh bond the peaks at wavenumber 1757 and 1455 cm 1 indicates the presence of co in the structure of the rr152 dye peak at the wavenumber 1549 cm 1 represents the nn azo bond stretching and peak at the wavenumber 1621 cm 1 indicates the cc stretching of aromatic rings on the other hand ft ir spectrum of dye degradation metabolites formed after treatment in the mfc system showed that the azo bond peak at 1549 cm 1 wavenumber disappeared from the spectrum indicating that the azo bond is effectively degraded by the n circulans dc10 fig 4a strong peak at the wavenumber 1664 cm 1 confirmed the presence of co stretching of the carboxylic acid group additionally peak at 2923 cm 1 wavenumber indicates the presence of aliphatic ch bond in the chemical structure the presence of primary amide group was confirmed by the peaks at 3382 cm 1 representing the nh stretching vibrations similar results of chemical shifts were observed in a previous study on azo dye metanil yellow g myg degradation by a halo thermophilic bacterial consortium under microaerophilic conditions 43 the ft ir analysis confirmed the breakdown of azo bonds in the dye structure whereas gc ms was used to predict the intermediates of rr152 dye degradation after bacterial treatment under anaerobic conditions in the anode n circulans dc10 was observed to cleave the azo bond and complex chemical structure of the dye resulting in the formation of acid and pyrrolo 1 2 a pyrazine 1 4 dione hexahydro 3 2 methylpropyl mw 210 propanoic acid 2 2 dimethyl 2 phenylethyl ester mw 172 and finally phenylacetic acid mw 136 fig 4b phenylacetic acid gets further degraded by the bacterial phenylacetic acid catabolism pathway and is mineralised into co2 and water in the tca cycle 44 similar azo dye degradation metabolites were detected by gc ms analysis in a previous study demonstrating the degradation of mixed azo dyes by a bacterial consortium in the dual chamber mfc system 41 3 5 sem analysis and biofilm morphology the sem analysis of the anode surface after 72 h of the mfc operation revealed the extensive biofilm formation of n circulans dc10 as shown in fig 5 the n circulans dc10 cells were clearly observed in the biofilm as shown in the sem images fig 5b d previously narayanasamy and jayaprakash 45 reported a similar morphology of graphite surface and pattern of biofilm formation by pseudomonas aeruginosa on the anode of mfc system which was used for azo dye methyl orange degradation these findings suggest that the n circulans dc10 can adhere to the electrode surface form biofilm and transfer electrons directly to the anode which results in the higher power output by the mfc system 3 6 relative quantification of azor pilt and pilz gene expression in n circulans dc10 during mfc operation expression of fmn dependant azoreductase of n circulans dc10 was induced in the presence of azo dye rr152 as determined by qrt pcr assays during the electrogenic treatment in the mfc system azor was expressed 2 65 0 42 fold higher as compared to the control flask culture at 12 h fig 6a expression levels of azor significantly increased by 5 47 0 58 folds in the anode suspended as cells of the mfc system within 24 h of rr152 treatment as compared to control static flask cultures the expression of azor gene was found to increase further at 48 h by 7 56 0 86 fold as compared to control in the mfc system following 72 h expression levels of azor slightly decreased as compared to its expression at 48 h in both the flask and suspended bacterial cells of mfc system expression levels of azor gene was 6 54 0 73 fold higher in the anode suspended bacterial cells of the mfc system as compared to control at 72 h subsequently expression levels of azor in the anode biofilm was 6 84 0 57 fold higher as compared to control which is slightly higher but not statistically significant than in the suspended bacterial cells present in the anode chamber fig 6a a previous similar study also reported that the enzyme activity of nadh azo reductase in an anaerobic bacterial community increased when the concentration of azo dye acid black 10b was increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l in the bio electrochemical treatment systems bet 46 the results obtained indicates that n circulans dc10 can attach to the anode surface and transfer the electrons directly without any mediators in a recent study by gurav et al 23 a similar bacterium bacillus circulans strain bbl03 newly proposed genus niallia showed bioelectricity generation in the mfc system by utilizing chitin biomass as substrate whole genome sequencing revealed the presence of type iv pilus operon in the genome of n circulans dc10 which encodes t4p on the surface of the bacteria type iv pilus in the gram positive bacteria plays a distinct role in processes such as colonization twitching motility cellular adhesion horizontal gene transfer and biofilm formation 47 apart from these functions t4p also acts as microbial nanowires in the electroactive bacteria such as geobacter sulfurreducens and transfers electrons directly to the anode surface by direct attachment 48 as described in the previous section t4p comprises of different assembly proteins such as pila pilb pilc pilm piln pilo and pilt the protein pilt functions as pilus retraction atpase and is involved in twitching motility 49 moreover pilt protein also plays a crucial role in surface adhesion and formation of biofilm 50 therefore the pilt gene was selected for gene expression studies in the n circulans dc10 during dye degradation and mfc operation increase in the expression level of pilt directly correlated with the twitching motility and biofilm formation by n circulans dc10 similarly another gene chosen for expression studies pilz also encodes the t4p assembly protein which is essential for t4p biogenesis 51 during the electrogenic treatment in the mfc system pilt expression was 1 44 0 22 fold higher as compared to control at 12 h fig 6b expression levels of pilt in n circulans dc10 significantly increased by 2 02 0 15 fold in the suspended cells of mfc system as compared to control at 24 h expression levels of pilt was maximum at 48 h with an increase of 2 53 0 16 fold as compared to control in the mfc system at 72 h as compared to control flask system the expression levels of pilt was found to be 2 36 0 23 fold and 2 14 0 18 fold higher in the anode biofilm and suspended bacterial cells in the anode chamber respectively fig 6b additionally expression levels of pilz also significantly increased during electrogenic degradation of rr152 in the mfc system expression of pilz gene was 1 25 0 13 1 97 0 22 and 2 33 0 19 fold higher in the mfc anode chamber as compared to control at 12 24 and 48 h respectively fig 6c likewise as compared to control at 72 h expression levels of pilz in the anode biofilm and anode suspended cells of the mfc increased to 2 24 0 14 and 2 01 0 24 folds respectively similar results were obtained in a recent study where mfc system was operated with kluyvera georgiana mcc 3673 inoculated with the luria bertani lb medium in the anode chamber the gene expression levels of pilq a t4p assembly protein of k georgiana mcc 3673 was found to be two fold higher during the mfc operation as compared to control flask cultures 34 these results indicate that t4p synthesis in n circulans dc10 increased during an electrogenic degradation of rr152 in the dual chamber mfc system which facilitated the biofilm formation and direct electron transfer to the anode 4 conclusion the bacterium n circulans dc10 achieved efficient degradation of rr152 azo dye in the dual chamber mfc system genome sequence analysis of dc10 identified the genes such as fmn dependant azo reductase azor t4p assembly protein genes pilt and pilz assumed to be responsible for electrogenic azo dye degradation expression levels of pilt pilz and azor genes were found to be higher in the mfc system as compared to control static falsks therefore it can be concluded that type iv pilli in n circulans have a significant role in motility of bacterium towards the anode anodic attachment biofilm formation and exo electron transfer to the anode which resulted in higher redox potential of the mfc system the n circulans dc10 achieved generation of higher power density outputs in the mfc system along with efficient decolourization and cod reduction at higher concentration 300 ppm of rr152 dye these results demonstrate that the n circulans dc10 with enhanced abilities for exo electron transfer and azo dye degradation can be utilized as an effective biocatalyst for the sustainable treatment of textile dye wastewater in the
