23565,cyclic wave loading on geotube dams creates a cyclic flow in seams between geotubes regime distinct from the uni directional flow that has been previously studied a new laboratory apparatus was used to investigate the effects of hydraulic conditions on the core sand of geotube dams with seams between tubes with this apparatus a series of tests was conducted various maximum pressure heads 0 25 0 3 0 35 and 0 4 m periods of cyclic wave loading 6 7 8 and 10 s and particle porosities 34 35 40 and 45 were used in this test series in the test series the erosion development process of sand was analyzed the results also indicate that the sand in the dam core can still perform satisfactorily after being scoured into the seam and extending a certain length this critical length was found to be a function of the sand porosity cycle period and maximum pressure head keywords cyclic wave loading geotube dam core sand seam between geotubes critical length 1 introduction with the development of protective measures on coasts geotube dams are increasingly used in estuarine and coastal engineering such as in reclaiming tidal flats avoiding saltwater intrusion and storing freshwater the construction of geotube dams involves filling large geotubes on opposite sides to form a cofferdam placing sand inside the cofferdam and stacking additional geotubes to create a water retention dam fig 1 a geotube dam may be as many as tens of kilometers long geotube dams must be constructed of many geotubes connected end to end which inevitably involves the installation of many seams between geotubes fig 2 during the construction and operation of geotube dams seams between geotubes become scour channels for dam core sand the sand in dam cores and seams tends to be washed away by flowing water along the joint furthermore geotube dams are typically used in estuaries and coastal areas where currents are bidirectional and unstable when seams between geotubes are subjected to cyclic water action such as wave loading and water level fluctuations the sand in the dam cores and the seams is easily scoured therefore seams between geotubes pose a great potential safety hazard to these dam structures in many countries with mature technology on geotube geotubes are mostly composed of high strength geotextiles thus individual geotubes can be very large and the problem of erosion stability caused by seams is not serious studies by researchers in these countries have focused more on construction technologies structural stability of geotube dams and related features of geotube materials the structural stability of geotubes under wave loading has been studied in several experiments erosion and deformation of geotubes under wave loading were investigated by combining an indoor model test with a numerical simulation method recio and oumeraci 2009a 2009b the effect of wave loading on the stability of geotubes was revealed through large scale physical model tests van steeg et al 2013 the settlement deformation of geotubes filled with various filling materials was studied in laboratory tests shin and oh 2003 2007 an empirical formula for calculating the settlement deformation was developed and verified via laboratory model tests the erosion characteristics and dewatering features of sand in geotubes have been investigated in laboratory experiments the erosional stability of punctured geotextile filters under cyclic wave loadings was tested using a cyclic flow apparatus koerner and koerner 2006 moo young et al 2002 the test results indicated that the soil geotextile interface can be stable even when the geotextile is punctured provided that the holes do not exceed a critical size the effects of various factors including the water content grain composition and thickness of the geotextiles on the dewatering performance of geotubes were systematically studied muthukumaran and ilamparuthi 2006 geotubes were shown to be viable in dewatering sediment with a high moisture content chew et al 2003 in china geotubes are composed of burst film woven geotextiles due to limitations in material strength these geotubes are small and require the joining of many geotubes with seams to construct a dam with the emergence of structural failure caused by seams between the tubes the erosion of geotube dams through seams has become a focus of study based on investigations of other scour problems chen et al 2012 zanganeh et al 2012 wang et al 2014 the scouring of a geotube dam through the seams between the tubes under uni directional flow was researched in a model test yu et al 2014 a relationship characterizing the migration of core sand though seams between tubes was found however cyclic wave loading on geotube dams creates a cyclic flow in seams between geotubes distinct from uni directional flow cyclic flow produces greater sand instability than uni directional flow zhuang et al 2008 no study of the erosional stability of geotube dams with the seams between geotubes being subjected to cyclic wave loading has been reported therefore the goal of this study was to investigate the scouring of geotube dams through the seams between tubes under cyclic wave loading under cyclic wave loadings sand is easily scoured into seams from dam cores when sand system reached a steady state sand in seams would form sandpile with certain lengths to estimate the stability of geotube dams the critical length of sandpile in seams as sand stabilized l c should be compared with the length of seams l if l c l geotube dams could be considered structurally stable therefore the factors which have effects on l c could affect the stability of geotube dams apparently l c is affected by multiple factors such as the gradation and composition of the sand particles the porosity of the sand deposit and the period and energy of the cyclic wave loadings for simplicity the maximum pressure head was selected to be the characteristic value of cyclic wave loadings therefore the effect of sand porosity n cycle period t and maximum pressure head h to the critical length of sandpile in seams l c was investigated in this study 2 test apparatus the testing apparatus consisted of a cyclic flow apparatus a sandbox and a pipe fig 3 the cyclic flow apparatus was composed of a cyclic flow generator and a water reservoir fig 4 cyclic flow was generated by vertical motion of the piston which was driven by the adjustable speed motor circumrotation movement of the adjustable speed motor was passed to to and fro beeline movement of the piston by the transmission device vertical movement velocity of the piston in the water reservoir changed in sine form as rotational speed of the adjustable speed motor remaining unchanged therefore the water pressure in water reservoir changed in sine form with the sinusoidal speed movement of the piston furthermore the distance of piston motion could be regulated through the regulation of transmission device the variation of maximum pressure was enabled by the distance of piston motion in the water reservoir and the cycle period was adjusted by varying the speed of the adjustable speed motor the dam core was simulated by a sandbox which was divided into two parts a sand filling chamber and an infiltration chamber the sand filling chamber was used to fill dam core sand and the infiltration chamber provided water for the sand filling chamber when needed the sizes of these two chambers of the sand box respectively are 30 cm 50 cm and 20 cm 50 cm these two parts were separated by a porous board non woven fabric attached to the porous board produced a uniform current and prevented the sand in the sand filling chamber from flowing into the infiltration chamber a pipe was used to simulate a seam between geotubes generally seams between geotubes in practical engineering applications are 2 10 m long and approximately 50 mm in diameter thus in section the pipe was a square with a side length of 50 mm and the pipe was 2 m long the pipe was connected the cyclic flow apparatus to the sandbox one sidewall of the pipe was equipped with many access points for water pressure sensors ten water pressure sensors were seted on the side wall of the pipe with nine intervals of 20 cm the signal of water pressure sensors was relayed to a computer in real time dynamically and the fig 5 was created by the computer during a measurement of water pressure in pipe 3 test program before initiating the tests the apparatus was checked for leaks and the water pressure sensors and flowmeters were installed and calibrated sand sample was prepared according to the gradation quartz sand with a typical particle size distribution was used in the tests the particle size distribution was identical to that used in geotube dams constructed in jiangsu province china fig 6 the median particle size of the sand sample with typical grading in tests is small relatively to coarser grained sand the tests results are relatively safe meanwhile finer grained sand could not be used in practical engineering due to difficulties in dewatering of geotubes then the sand sample was added to the sand chamber in layers the weight of sand in each layer was calculated and weighed with electronic scale according to the design porosity this way ensured the homogeneity of filling and met the requirement of design porosity after the sand was placed the water was slowly added to the sandbox and pipe in addition the sand was soaked for 12 h under a static head after being filled with water after sand fully saturation cyclic flow apparatus was started to generate cyclic flow according to design conditions on period and pressure the information such as water pressure and particle migration was collected in real time finally the lengths of sand in pipe were measured at the end of tests after tests the sand in sandbox and pipe was sampled with cutting ring from characteristic parts porosity distribution and graduation could be analyzed with the sample the tests were conducted under different conditions particle porosities of 34 35 40 and 45 were used the period of cyclic wave loadings was set at 6 7 8 and 10 s the maximum pressure head was set at 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 m the test series consisted of several combinations of these three factors 4 test results 4 1 sand erosion process a series of tests was performed with the pipe 20 cm below the free water surface the results indicate that the erosion can be divided into three phases a shock stage an arching stage and a stabilization stage shock stage with the outflow of suspended particles in the junction of the pipe and sandbox a small gap appears in the sandbox near the junction in this stage the movement of sand particles is limited the primary influence of the cyclic flow is only the disturbance of the sand structure arching stage the arching stage is characterized by the development of a hole in the sandbox near the junction this hole is referred to as an arch structure space fig 7 this arching provides space for reciprocation of the flow therefore the potential energy of the current is easily converted into kinetic energy with high velocity flow the liquefied sand particles flow out into the pipe and accumulate to form a sand pile along the pipe stabilization stage with further erosion particles on the top of the arch fall due to their weight and the negative hydrodynamic pressure in this process the grading of the sand particles results in their separation into coarse particles on the bottom and fine particles on the top this phenomenon occurs for two reasons first the fine lightweight particles ascend more easily than the coarse particles during the inflow stage second the distribution of coarser particles on the bottom and finer particles on top prevents the upper particles from entering the pipe therefore the movement of sand particles in this stage decreases ultimately the sand particles stop moving forward to the pipe 4 2 influence of different effect factors the critical length of sand in seams in the pipe l c were yielded by tests with different sand porosity n cycle period t and maximum pressure head h the series of test conditions and results are listed in table 1 based on the theory of dimensional homogeneity the relationships between the critical length of sand in the pipe l c and its determining factors may be expressed with the equation 1 l c l c t h n g where g 9 8 m s 2 which is included to yield the proper dimensions the exponential form of eq 1 is 2 l c k 0 t k 1 h k 2 g k 3 n k 4 where k 0 is a dimensionless proportional constant the dimension relation of eq 2 is 3 l c t k 1 l k 2 l t 2 k 3 according to eq 3 4 k 1 2 5 k 2 1 6 k 3 1 and 7 l c k 0 t 2 h g 1 n k 4 tests a b and c were conducted to find the relation between the critical length of sand in the pipe l c and the maximum pressure head h the test results are plotted in fig 8 the results presented in fig 8 show that larger maximum pressure heads during cyclic wave loadings can cause longer critical lengths of sand in the pipe the reason for the above phenomenon is that for a fixed cycle period a larger maximum pressure head during cyclic wave loadings corresponds to a larger hydraulic gradient across the sand therefore the sand particles can move more easily additional information can be obtained from fig 8 first the critical length of sand in the pipe l c has a linear relationship with the maximum pressure head h second the three plotted lines intercept the x axis at the common point of h 0 208 m third there is no sand in the pipe when h 0 208 m the physical significance of this intercept of the x axis is a critical maximum pressure head h c which is the minimum energy required for the migration of particles in the sandbox clearly 8 h c 0 208 m therefore the maximum pressure head h can be resolved into two parts h c and h u h c is exceeded before the motion of sand is initiated the sand motion is directly caused only by h u accordingly eq 7 needs to be revised as follows 9 l c k 0 t 2 h u g 1 n k 4 where 10 h u h h c combining eq 9 with the test a1 data presented in table 1 yields the following results 11 k 0 23 12 k 4 4 78 13 l c 23 t 2 h u g 1 n 4 78 the porosity of the sand particles has a significant effect on the formation of the arch and the system stability fig 9 shows the variation of l c with n in tests d g using eq 13 yields four empirical curves of l c plotted in fig 10 which indicate a high level of consistency between the empirical values and the experiment data additionally fig 9 shows that with increasing sand porosity the critical length decreases it is easier for sand of higher porosity to rearrange under the action of cyclic wave loadings namely the arch structure space will develop more rapidly meanwhile the particle grading in the arch structure space prevents the movement of particles outside the space therefore the critical length of the sand with higher porosities is shorter than the length with the lower porosity sand the cycle period in real world conditions ranges primarily from 5 to 10 s in the tests the cycle period was set at 6 7 8 and 10 s the results of tests h k are shown in fig 10 eq 13 can also provide values of l c as a function of these experimental data a high level of fitness can again be observed in fig 10 fig 10 shows that for a given sand porosity and maximum pressure head shorter cycle periods result in longer critical lengths of sand in the pipe this result is attributed to the larger hydraulic gradient across the sand near the pipe sandbox interface for shorter cycle periods consequently the drag which drives the particle transport is likewise larger therefore cyclic wave loadings of short periods result in a less stable sand system and more erosion 5 conclusions the erosion of the sand in the sandbox is characterized by the formation of an arch structure space with the development of arch structure the erosion process can be divided into three phases the sand in sandbox cannot be scoured into pipe as long as the maximum pressure head of flow do not exceed a certain critical value showed in eq 8 if a maximum pressure head exceeds the certain critical value a substantial amount of sand from the sandbox will be scoured into the pipe the arch space is maintained by a certain length of sand in the pipe this critical length is a function of the sand porosity cycle period and maximum pressure head the function can be expressed by eq 13 acknowledgements this work is supported by the natural science foundation of china 51179065

of cracks especially the location of cracks are studied by a numerical method it is found out that the influence of crack location on the residual ultimate strength is very much depended on where the

fabrication and excellent strength to weight ratio initial defects or cracks are unavoidable and it may be initiated in the stress concentration areas under the action of repeated loading during the operation of a vessel even cracks do not represent necessarily an immediate danger to the structure it is also well recognized as one of damages that can reduce the structural load carrying capacity on the other hand the current ship rational design procedures require that structural ultimate strength is assessed and checked against specific criteria iacs 2006 in this regards it is of crucial important to understand the effect of crack configurations such as the length location and orientation angle on the residual ultimate strength characteristics additionally axial compression is regularly taken as the typical load component for a stiffened panel for instance deck in sagging or bottom in hogging hence it is of great importance to understand the ultimate strength characteristic and assess it reasonably a large number of studies on the fatigue fracture of cracked structure under cyclic loading sabelkin et al 2006 deng et al 2016 citarella et al 2016 albedah et al 2016 and the influence of initial imperfection on the maximum load bearing capacity of stiffened panel paik et al 2001 lillemae et al 2013 xu and guedes soares 2013 yu et al 2015 have been previously carried out and reported in the literature but there are few investigated the ultimate strength behavior of a cracked structure until the recent decade increasing efforts are made to the residual strength behavior of cracked structures under monotonic extreme load paik et al 2005 paik 2008 paik 2009 and cui et al 2016 studied the ultimate strength of cracked plates under axial compression or tension experimentally and numerically furthermore the investigation was extended to residual compressive ultimate strength of cracked stiffened plates margaritis and toulios 2012 bayatfar et al 2014 xu et al 2014 and ultimate shear strength analysis of cracked stiffened panel was carried out by wang et al 2015 as well regardless of any cracked structures the length of cracks and especially its location can significantly affect the structural ultimate strength characteristics under axial compression longitudinal cracks which are parallel to the axial loading direction are investigated in paik s research paik 2008 the reduction of plate ultimate strength induced by cracks was demonstrated by comparing with intact plate ultimate strength and the effect of crack location on ultimate strength reduction also was illustrated subsequently the ultimate and collapse response of vertical cracked stiffened plate subjected to uniaxial compression was studied by margaritis and toulios 2012 in more recent studies xu et al 2014 and cui et al 2016 considered the influence of not only longitudinal and vertical cracks but also inclined angular cracks for the ultimate compressive strength reduction although several of influence factors have been taken into account there are few studies focusing on the reduction mechanism of crack on ultimate compressive strength and comprehensive assessment of ultimate strength for cracked stiffened panel subjected to compression has not been fully carried out in this study a series of nonlinear finite element analysis is carried out with varying the crack parameters such as length location and orientation angle based on the results obtained the mutual effects of different crack parameters are discussed and the ultimate strength characteristics of a cracked stiffened panel are investigated by considering different structural failure modes finally a rational assessment of ultimate strength for cracked stiffened panel under uniaxial compression is carried out 2 nonlinear finite element analysis 2 1 the feasibility verification of numerical method the compressive experiment of stiffened panel with single crack is few as it is hard to acquire the cracks of what we expect however the numerical procedures are identical for cracked and intact stiffened panel so it is feasible to verify the numerical method by comparing with the results of reference experiment tanaka and endo 1988 conducted a series of experiments to test the ultimate strength of stiffened panel in this paper the ultimate strength for ten of the experimental models is calculated by nonlinear finite element method the comparison of dimensionless ultimate strength σ u σ y obtained by experimental tests and numerical method are summarized in table 1 where σ u σ y n u m and σ u σ y e x p are numerical and experimental results respectively the feasibility of numerical method is verified since the results are pretty close and the mean and variance of the ratios of actual experimental to numerical predicted results are 1 011 and 1 968 respectively which is permitted by the error in engineering 2 2 geometric and material properties of stiffened panel the geometrical dimensions of a stiffened plate structure discussed in this paper are taken from the report of the ultimate strength committee of issc2012 issc committee iii 1 2012 the configuration of the stiffened plate structure which is taken from the bottom panels of a bulk carrier is presented in fig 1 in the present series of analyses the dimensions of local plate panel and longitudinal tee bar stiffener are given in table 2 the plate and stiffener are made of the same material a type of mild steel which stress strain relationship is assumed to follow elastic perfectly plastic model with yield stress σ y 313 6 mpa young s modulus e 205800 mpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 the strain hardening is not considered in this paper 2 3 model range and boundary condition it is very important to prescribe appropriate model range and boundary conditions of continuous stiffened panels in fe analysis as they have a significant effect on the final results xu et al 2013 calculation models with different model ranges and boundary conditions for intact stiffened panels are analyzed to determine an appropriate calculation model to carry out the investigation of crack defect the coordinate system and model range of stiffened panels are shown in fig 2 the z axis is perpendicular to x y plane thus constitute cartesian coordinates uniform compression stress is applied along the longitudinal direction the symmetric boundary condition xu et al 2013 tanaka et al 2014 is applied to two half bays model a1e1 f1g1 1 2 1 2 and one and two half bays model a1b1c1d1 1 2 1 1 2 the simply supported boundary condition is applied to one full bay model a2e2 f2g2 1 and two full bays model a2b2c2d2 1 1 the longitudinal girders and transverse frames are not modeled in fe analysis instead the panels at their locations are assumed to be rigid enough not to produce displacements in z direction but the rotation is set free all the edges of the elementary plate panel are forced to remain straight in the in plane directions due to the neighboring panels the intersection line between longitudinal stiffener and transverse frame at each stiffener web is forced to remain straight in y direction due to the surrounding of transverse frame the average stress average strain relationships for the four kinds of calculation models of intact stiffened panels are obtained and drawn in fig 3 table 3 gives the non dimensional ultimate strength values σ u σ y of the four kinds of calculation models which are very similar to the results in the report of ultimate strength committee of issc2012 issc committee iii 1 2012 this indicates that the model ranges and boundary conditions illustrated above all can be applied to ultimate strength analyses of continuous stiffened panels of a hull to save the calculation costs one full bay model a2e2 f2g2 is finally selected to carry out the investigation of crack defect the detail descriptions of the boundary conditions for model a2e2 f2g2 are given as follows a2e2 u y 0 u z 0 θ y 0 θ z 0 f2g2 u y is uniform u z 0 θ y 0 θ z 0 a2g2 edge of plate panel u x 0 u z 0 θ x 0 θ z 0 edge of stiffener web u x 0 u y is uniform θ x 0 θ y 0

z 0 2 4 geometrical initial imperfections the geometrical imperfections occur during a complex fabrication process and are subject to significant uncertainty related to the magnitude and spatial variation it has been generally found that initial imperfections tend to decrease the rigidity and ultimate strength of stiffened panels these initial imperfections significantly affect the ultimate strength and collapse behavior of stiffened panels and should be accounted for the following three types of initial deflection xu et al 2013 are accounted for in this paper initial deflection of local plate panel 1 w 0 p l a 0 s i n m π x a s i n π y b b 0 s i n π x a s i n π y b column type initial deflection of stiffeners 2 w 0 s b 0 s i n π x a s i n π y b side ways initial deflection of stiffeners due to angular rotation about panel stiffener 3 v 0 s z h w c 0 s i n π x a where a 0 0 1β 2 t p b 0 c 0 0 0015a and h w h w t p 2 t f 2 m is the number of buckling half waves in the longitudinal direction equal to a b in all cases the shapes of initial imperfections are created by python program in the fe analysis according to the coordinates calculated by the equations 1 3 as shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows the average stress average strain relationships of model a2e2 f2g2 with different initial deflections and the corresponding non dimensional ultimate strength is summarized in table 4 it is shown that the influence of stiffeners column type or side ways initial deflections on ultimate strength reduction is insufficient however the ultimate strength characteristics are almost identical for the calculation models which are applied with individual local plate deflection and superposition deflections the initial deformation of a local plate panel has the most significant influence on the ultimate strength characteristics of stiffened panel so it is taken into account in the current study 2 5 cases studied with respect to crack defect it is assumed that the cracks are through thickness and the contact between their faces and crack propagation are not accounted for in the fe modeling the geometrical description of the crack is presented in fig 6 the key crack parameters in the present study include length c orientation angle θ and location s h of the crack where c takes value as 85 mm 170 mm 255 mm 340 mm 425 mm i e relative length of the crack e c 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 θ takes value as 0 30 45 60 90 the crack location is represented by coordinates of the crack center those are s and h because of symmetry of the model geometry it is appropriate to consider the crack location distribution in a quarter range of a stiffened panel as shown in fig 6b the transverse relative distance e h and the longitudinal relative distance e s from the crack center to the center of stiffened panel are taken to be equal to 0 1 6 2 6 3 6 4 6 5 6 1 and 0 1 3 2 3 1 respectively a hypothesis has been made currently that is the initial deflection shape of a local plate panel has a significant influence on the structural ultimate strength characteristics and the influence of crack location on the residual ultimate strength reduction is significantly depended on where the crack locates in the range of plate buckling half wave therefore the crack location was considered in a quarter range of the plate buckling half wave as shown in fig 6c the transverse relative distance e y and the longitudinal relative distance e x from the crack center to the center of the buckling half wave are taken to be equal to 0 1 4 2 4 3 4 1 respectively 2 6 adopted element type and convergence study the shell element s4r is employed in the finite element model which is a 4 node quadrilateral stress displacement shell element with reduced integration and a large strain formulation this element is suitable for analyzing thin walled structures the arc length method in abaqus software is used to assess the ultimate strength of the cracked stiffened panels it is required that the mesh size of fe model should be fine enough to give accurate and reliable results however a balance between computational accuracy and the cost has to be made according to the convergence study of mesh sizes for the intact stiffened panel xu et al 2013 six elements are set along the short edge of stiffener web and flange respectively and the element size on the plate is set as 1 10 of the width of local panel 85 mm as shown in fig 4 for the cracked stiffened panel a square partition whose side length equals to 680 mm is set in the vicinity of the crack inside of which is assigned with finer meshes fig 7 shows different mesh size and meshing algorithm in the vicinity of the crack with e s 0 e h 0 e c 0 5 θ 90 table 5 a gives the residual ultimate strength σ uc and ultimate strength reduction factor σ uc σ u with different mesh size and mesh scheme it is shown that the difference of residual ultimate strength between these four meshing strategies is relatively small advancing front refined meshing fig 7d is chosen to carry out analyses in the present study for the convenience of python programming the refined meshing has been generated at the crack tips to improve the accuracy of the calculation the number of element around the tip side is defined as n three types of meshing algorithms are adopted which is n 11 fig 8 a n 8 fig 8b n 4 fig 8c and the calculation results are shown in table 5 b which reveals that there is fine distinction among different meshing elements what s more the calculation results are convergent from n 8 to n 11 therefore a higher meshing refinement is not necessary 2 7 crack gap effect crack gap w which is the gap between two opposite crack faces may also affect the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel therefore the ultimate strength analyses of cracked stiffened panel e s 0 e h 0 e c 0 5 θ 90 with different crack gap values have been carried out it is observed from table 6 that the ultimate strength decreases a little as the crack gap increases the crack gap w 3 mm is adopted in the present study 3 results and discussions a series of nonlinear finite element analysis with respect to 970 cases totally is carried out with varying the crack parameters of length location and orientation angle it is shown that the main failure modes are buckling of local plates in this research and the effects of a crack on the failure modes are the buckling shape of local plates and lead to the difference of collapse location 3 1 effect of crack length and orientation angle fig 9 shows the typical average stress average strain curves with different crack lengths and orientation angles in the case of fixed crack location e s 0 e h 0 from the figures shown the crack length and orientation angle have considerable effect on the ultimate strength values but have slight effect on the initial stiffness of cracked plates in order to study the mutual effect of different crack parameters on residual ultimate strength of cracked structure the curves of ultimate strength reduction factor σ uc σ u with crack length and orientation angle in three typical cases of crack location are summarized in figs 10 12 it is revealed that the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel decreases with the increasing of crack length or orientation angle but the decreased ultimate strength is also affected by crack location the three typical cases of the crack location with reference to fig 6b are presented as follows location 1 the crest or the trough of plate buckling half wave i e the coordinate point e s 0 e h 0 e s 0 e h 4 6 e s 2 3 e h 0 and e s 2 3 e h 4 6 location 2 the longitudinal location i e x coordinate of crack center locates at zero amplitude of plating buckling half wave and the transverse location i e y coordinate of crack center locates at the crest or the trough of plating buckling half wave i e the coordinate point e s 1 3 e h 0 e s 1 e h 0 e s 1 3 e h 4 6 and e s 1 e h 4 6 location 3 the longitudinal location i e x coordinate of crack center locates at the crest or the trough of plating buckling half wave and the transverse location i e y coordinate of crack center locates at zero amplitude of plating buckling half wave meanwhile under the longitudinal stiffener i e the coordinate point e s 0 e h 2 6 and e s 2 3 e h 2 6 when the crack is in the case of location 1 the effects of crack length and orientation angle on the ultimate strength reduction factor are shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10a the ultimate strength deceases approximately linearly with the increase of crack length fig 10b shows that the ultimate strength decreases with a trend of approximate cosine function with the increase of crack orientation angle a similar effect tendency is also found for the cases of location 2 and location 3 as shown in figs 11 and 12 except for the case of orientation angle equal to zero degree in location 3 for the case of location 2 the ultimate strength decreases less than the case of location 1 from fig 11a it is shown that the ultimate strength has almost no decrease when the relative crack length is less than 0 3 in all cases of crack orientation angle for the case of location 3 the ultimate strength decreases more than the case of location 1 it is noteworthy that the residual ultimate strength decreases sharply when the crack orientation angle is equal to zero degree as shown in fig 12 this is because the longitudinal crack under stiffener decreases the rigidity of both plates and stiffeners the failure modes and von mises stress distributions at the ultimate limit state for the stiffened panels with crack in center and under stiffener are shown in fig 13 which reveals that the failure modes at the ultimate limit state are similar to the applied initial imperfection however a significant dislocation between crack faces and stiffener occurs for the latter case as shown in fig 13b 3 2 effect of crack location 3 2 1 crack in a quarter range of stiffened panel fig 14 shows the effect of longitudinal location of crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor it is observed that the ultimate strength is approximately equal for the cases of crack center location at the similar position of plate buckling half wave and the crack length and orientation angle is fixed the ultimate strength is decreased less for the case of crack locates at zero amplitude of plate buckling half wave than the case of crack locates at the crest or the trough fig 15 shows the effect of transverse location of the crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor and almost similar trend as in fig 14 is found however the case of crack location of e s 0 e h 2 6 θ 0 where crack locates under strong stiffener is expected and the residual ultimate strength decreases sharply since the rigidity of stiffener is destroyed by the crack besides above the hypothesis mentioned in section of 2 5 is confirmed for the cases of a crack in the same location of plate buckling half wave while locations of stiffened panel vary the residual ultimate strength could be considered as ineffective 3 2 2 crack in a quarter model covering plate buckling half wave based on the verification of hypothesis on the crack location a crack location was focused on the range of a quarter model covering plate buckling half wave as shown in fig 6c fig 16 shows the effect of longitudinal location of a crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor it is observed that the residual ultimate strength increases nonlinearly as the crack center moves in e x axis from the crest to zero amplitude of buckling half wave and the trend is similar as a sine function same trend is revealed with varying the length or the orientation angle of the crack on the contrary the residual ultimate strength reduces with a trend of approximate cosine function as shown in fig 17 regardless of the crack length and orientation angle it is remarkable that the case of e x 0 e y 1 θ 0 same crack center point as e s 0 e h 2 6 θ 0 is excluded in the trend 4 empirical formula 4 1 prediction equations an empirical formula is important when the basis of theory is still impractical for engineering design in this study a prediction formula of ultimate strength for cracked stiffened panel under uniaxial compression is proposed on the account of results and discussion above all the influence law of design parameters on the structural ultimate compressive strength is expressed and two fitting steps are carried out respectively as shown in figs 16 and 17 the effect of longitudinal location of the crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor almost follows sine law and the effect of transverse location of the crack center is approximate cosine law therefore the normalized parameters of s i n π e x 2 and c o s π e y 2 are proposed as basic variables in the prediction equation related to the influence of the crack location on the structural ultimate strength it is reasonable to assume that the influence of all design variables is mutually independent so the results as e c 0 5 and θ 60 are selected to present the constant parameters matlab is employed to carry out the fitting the permissible function is assumed to be polynomial and degrees of term s i n π e x 2 and c o s π e y 2 are assumed to be 2 and 1 respectively afterwards the influence parameters of crack length e c and crack angle θ are expressed in the prediction equation it is noted that the concept of effective length expression of e c s i n θ is used to normalize the variable e c and θ and the prediction results in step one reflecting the influence of crack location are treated as a sample of one variable the permissible function is also set as a polynomial the degree of crack length and angle variables term and crack location variable term are 2 and 1 finally the prediction equation of ultimate compressive strength of cracked stiffened panel is as follows 4 σ u c σ u 0 994 0 087 0 058 sin π e x 2 0 068 cos π e y 2 0 083 sin π e x 2 2 0 038 sin π e x 2 cos π e y 2 e c sin θ 0 025 e c sin θ 2 the residual strength of the cracked plate σ u c can be estimated by giving the formulation of σ u in some estimation researches for instance the study of paik and kim 2002 additionally the conclusions and derived equation are only applicable for some general settings of stiffened panels and they have some scope of applications as the calculated model two longitudinal stiffeners between longitudinal girders which is the typical bottom structure of bulk carrier however this is a preliminary study on fitting formula of ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel and the major contribution of this research is to reveal the influence of crack configurations on residual ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel 4 2 accuracy evaluation of prediction equations the surface fitting diagram fig 18 may intuitively evaluate the accuracy of the prediction equation where dots refer to results obtained by a numerical method and the color surface show the form of eq 4 all the dots distribute around the surface and the differences are acceptably small to further quantitatively assess the accuracy of the prediction equations the coordinate points of σ u c σ u o σ u c σ u p where σ u c σ u o the means of the original data results and σ u c σ u p the means of the prediction results of eq 4 is plotted in fig 19 the good fitness is clearly shown by the distribution of all coordinate points around the diagonal line besides the mean values and standard deviations for the samples of σ u c σ u o σ u c σ u p are calculated sufficient accuracy of prediction eq 4 is illustrated by the mean value of 1 002 and the standard deviation of 0 62 5 conclusions in the present study the influences of various geometrical characteristics of cracks on the residual ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panels subjected to longitudinal uniaxial compressive loading were investigated by employing a nonlinear fe analysis method the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel decreases with the increase of crack length or orientation angle but the decrease of the ultimate strength is significantly affected by crack location the influence of crack location on the residual ultimate strength is significantly depended on where the crack locates in the range of plate buckling half wave and similar ultimate residual strength results are obtained for homogeneous crack center location in the plate buckling half wave based on the nonlinear fe results an empirical formula was developed to predict the residual ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel under longitudinal compressive loading furthermore the accuracy evaluation of the empirical prediction equation was carried out to show its accuracy acknowledgements the present study is supported by national natural science

fabrication and excellent strength to weight ratio initial defects or cracks are unavoidable and it may be initiated in the stress concentration areas under the action of repeated loading during the operation of a vessel even cracks do not represent necessarily an immediate danger to the structure it is also well recognized as one of damages that can reduce the structural load carrying capacity on the other hand the current ship rational design procedures require that structural ultimate strength is assessed and checked against specific criteria iacs 2006 in this regards it is of crucial important to understand the effect of crack configurations such as the length location and orientation angle on the residual ultimate strength characteristics additionally axial compression is regularly taken as the typical load component for a stiffened panel for instance deck in sagging or bottom in hogging hence it is of great importance to understand the ultimate strength characteristic and assess it reasonably a large number of studies on the fatigue fracture of cracked structure under cyclic loading sabelkin et al 2006 deng et al 2016 citarella et al 2016 albedah et al 2016 and the influence of initial imperfection on the maximum load bearing capacity of stiffened panel paik et al 2001 lillemae et al 2013 xu and guedes soares 2013 yu et al 2015 have been previously carried out and reported in the literature but there are few investigated the ultimate strength behavior of a cracked structure until the recent decade increasing efforts are made to the residual strength behavior of cracked structures under monotonic extreme load paik et al 2005 paik 2008 paik 2009 and cui et al 2016 studied the ultimate strength of cracked plates under axial compression or tension experimentally and numerically furthermore the investigation was extended to residual compressive ultimate strength of cracked stiffened plates margaritis and toulios 2012 bayatfar et al 2014 xu et al 2014 and ultimate shear strength analysis of cracked stiffened panel was carried out by wang et al 2015 as well regardless of any cracked structures the length of cracks and especially its location can significantly affect the structural ultimate strength characteristics under axial compression longitudinal cracks which are parallel to the axial loading direction are investigated in paik s research paik 2008 the reduction of plate ultimate strength induced by cracks was demonstrated by comparing with intact plate ultimate strength and the effect of crack location on ultimate strength reduction also was illustrated subsequently the ultimate and collapse response of vertical cracked stiffened plate subjected to uniaxial compression was studied by margaritis and toulios 2012 in more recent studies xu et al 2014 and cui et al 2016 considered the influence of not only longitudinal and vertical cracks but also inclined angular cracks for the ultimate compressive strength reduction although several of influence factors have been taken into account there are few studies focusing on the reduction mechanism of crack on ultimate compressive strength and comprehensive assessment of ultimate strength for cracked stiffened panel subjected to compression has not been fully carried out in this study a series of nonlinear finite element analysis is carried out with varying the crack parameters such as length location and orientation angle based on the results obtained the mutual effects of different crack parameters are discussed and the ultimate strength characteristics of a cracked stiffened panel are investigated by considering different structural failure modes finally a rational assessment of ultimate strength for cracked stiffened panel under uniaxial compression is carried out 2 nonlinear finite element analysis 2 1 the feasibility verification of numerical method the compressive experiment of stiffened panel with single crack is few as it is hard to acquire the

geometrical dimensions of a stiffened plate structure discussed in this paper are taken from the report of the ultimate strength committee of issc2012 issc committee iii 1 2012 the configuration of

instead the panels at their locations are assumed to be rigid enough not to produce displacements in z direction but the rotation is set free all the edges of the elementary plate panel are forced to remain straight in the in plane directions due to the neighboring panels the intersection line between longitudinal stiffener and transverse frame at each stiffener web is forced to remain straight in

shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows the average stress average strain relationships of model a2e2 f2g2 with different initial deflections and the corresponding non dimensional ultimate strength is summarized in table 4 it is shown that the influence of stiffeners column type or side ways initial deflections on ultimate strength reduction is insufficient however the ultimate strength characteristics are

8c and the calculation results are shown in table 5 b which reveals that there is fine distinction among different meshing elements what s more the calculation results are convergent from n 8 to n 11 therefore a higher meshing refinement is not necessary 2 7 crack gap effect crack gap w which is the gap between two opposite crack faces may also affect the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel therefore the ultimate strength analyses of cracked stiffened panel e s 0 e h 0 e c 0 5 θ 90 with different crack gap values have been carried out it is observed from table 6 that the ultimate strength decreases a little as the crack gap increases the crack gap w 3 mm is adopted in the present study 3 results and discussions a series of nonlinear finite element analysis with respect to 970 cases totally is carried out with varying the crack parameters of length location and orientation angle it is shown that the main failure modes are buckling of local plates in this research and the effects of a crack on the failure modes are the buckling shape of local plates and lead to the difference of collapse location 3 1 effect of crack length and orientation angle fig 9 shows the typical average stress average strain curves with different crack lengths and orientation angles in the case of fixed crack location e s 0 e h 0 from the figures shown the crack length and orientation angle have considerable effect on the ultimate strength values but have slight effect on the initial stiffness of cracked plates in order to study the mutual effect of different crack parameters on residual ultimate strength of cracked structure the curves of ultimate strength reduction factor σ uc σ u with crack length and orientation angle in three typical cases of crack location are summarized in figs 10 12 it is revealed that the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel decreases with the increasing of crack length or orientation angle but the decreased ultimate strength is also affected by crack location the three typical cases of the crack location with reference to fig 6b are presented as follows location 1 the crest or the trough of plate buckling half wave i e the coordinate point e s 0 e h 0 e s 0 e h 4 6 e s 2 3 e h 0 and e s 2 3 e h 4 6 location 2 the longitudinal location i e x coordinate of crack center locates at zero amplitude of plating buckling half wave and the transverse location i e y coordinate of crack center locates at the crest or the trough of plating buckling half wave i e the coordinate point e s 1 3 e h 0 e s 1 e h 0 e s 1 3 e h 4 6 and e s 1 e h 4 6 location 3 the longitudinal location i e x coordinate of crack center locates at the crest or the trough of plating buckling half wave and the transverse location i e y coordinate of crack center locates at zero amplitude of plating buckling half wave meanwhile under the longitudinal stiffener i e the coordinate point e s 0 e h 2 6 and e s 2 3 e h 2 6 when the crack is in the case of location 1 the effects of crack length and orientation angle on the ultimate strength reduction factor are shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10a the ultimate strength deceases approximately linearly with the increase of crack length fig 10b shows that the ultimate strength decreases with a trend of approximate cosine function with the increase of crack orientation angle a similar effect tendency is also found for the cases of location 2 and location 3 as shown in figs 11 and 12 except for the case of orientation angle equal to zero degree in location 3 for the case of location 2 the ultimate strength decreases less than the case of location 1 from fig 11a it is shown that the ultimate strength has almost no decrease when the relative crack length is less than 0 3 in all cases of crack orientation angle for the case of location 3 the ultimate strength decreases more than the case of location 1 it is noteworthy that the residual ultimate strength decreases sharply when the crack orientation angle is equal to zero degree as shown in fig 12 this is because the longitudinal crack under stiffener decreases the rigidity of both plates and stiffeners the failure modes and von mises stress distributions at the ultimate limit state for the stiffened panels with crack in center and under stiffener are shown in fig 13 which reveals that the failure modes at the ultimate limit state are similar to the applied initial imperfection however a significant dislocation between crack faces and stiffener occurs for the latter case as shown in fig 13b 3 2 effect of crack location 3 2 1 crack in a quarter range of stiffened panel fig 14 shows the effect of longitudinal location of crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor it is observed that the ultimate strength is approximately equal for the cases of crack center location at the similar position of plate buckling half wave and the crack length and orientation angle is fixed the ultimate strength is decreased less for the case of crack locates at zero amplitude of plate buckling half wave than the case of crack locates at the crest or the trough fig 15 shows the effect of transverse location of the crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor and almost similar trend as in fig 14 is found however the case of crack location of e s 0 e h 2 6 θ 0 where crack locates under strong stiffener is expected and the residual ultimate strength decreases sharply since the rigidity of stiffener is destroyed by the crack besides above the hypothesis mentioned in section of 2 5 is confirmed for the cases of a crack in the same location of plate buckling half wave while locations of stiffened panel vary the residual ultimate strength could be considered as ineffective 3 2 2 crack in a quarter model covering plate buckling half wave based on the verification of hypothesis on the crack location a crack location was focused on the range of a quarter model covering plate buckling half wave as shown in fig 6c fig 16 shows the effect of longitudinal location of a crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor it is observed that the residual ultimate strength increases nonlinearly as the crack center moves in e x axis from the crest to zero amplitude of buckling half wave and the trend is similar as a sine function same trend is revealed with varying the length or the orientation angle of the crack on the contrary the residual ultimate strength reduces with a trend of approximate cosine function as shown in fig 17 regardless of the crack length and orientation angle it is remarkable that the case of e x 0 e y 1 θ 0 same crack center point as e s 0 e h 2 6 θ 0 is excluded in the trend 4 empirical formula 4 1 prediction equations an empirical formula is important when the basis of theory is still impractical for engineering design in this study a prediction formula of ultimate strength for cracked stiffened panel under uniaxial compression is proposed on the account of results and discussion above all the influence law of design parameters on the structural ultimate compressive strength is expressed and two fitting steps are carried out respectively as shown in figs 16 and 17 the effect of longitudinal location of the crack center on the ultimate strength reduction factor almost follows sine law and the effect of transverse location of the crack center is approximate cosine law therefore the normalized parameters of s i n π e x 2 and c o s π e y 2 are proposed as basic variables in the prediction equation related to the influence of the crack location on the structural ultimate strength it is reasonable to assume that the influence of all design variables is mutually independent so the results as e c 0 5 and θ 60 are selected to present the constant parameters matlab is employed to carry out the fitting the permissible function is assumed to be polynomial and degrees of term s i n π e x 2 and c o s π e y 2 are assumed to be 2 and 1 respectively afterwards the influence parameters of crack length e c and crack angle θ are expressed in the prediction equation it is noted that the concept of effective length expression of e c s i n θ is used to normalize the variable e c and θ and the prediction results in step one reflecting the influence of crack location are treated as a sample of one variable the permissible function is also set as a polynomial the degree of crack length and angle variables term and crack location variable term are 2 and 1 finally the prediction equation of ultimate compressive strength of cracked stiffened panel is as follows 4 σ u c σ u 0 994 0 087 0 058 sin π e x 2 0 068 cos π e y 2 0 083 sin π e x 2 2 0 038 sin π e x 2 cos π e y 2 e c sin θ 0 025 e c sin θ 2 the residual strength of the cracked plate σ u c can be estimated by giving the formulation of σ u in some estimation researches for instance the study of paik and kim 2002 additionally the conclusions and derived equation are only applicable for some general settings of stiffened panels and they have some scope of applications as the calculated model two longitudinal stiffeners between longitudinal girders which is the typical bottom structure of bulk carrier however this is a preliminary study on fitting formula of ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel and the major contribution of this research is to reveal the influence of crack configurations on residual ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel 4 2 accuracy evaluation of prediction equations the surface fitting diagram fig 18 may intuitively evaluate the accuracy of the prediction equation where dots refer to results obtained by a numerical method and the color surface show the form of eq 4 all the dots distribute around the surface and the differences are acceptably small to further quantitatively assess the accuracy of the prediction equations the coordinate points of σ u c σ u o σ u c σ u p where σ u c σ u o the means of the original data results and σ u c σ u p the means of the prediction results of eq 4 is plotted in fig 19 the good fitness is clearly shown by the distribution of all coordinate points around the diagonal line besides the mean values and standard deviations for the samples of σ u c σ u o σ u c σ u p are calculated sufficient accuracy of prediction eq 4 is illustrated by the mean value of 1 002 and the standard deviation of 0 62 5 conclusions in the present study the influences of various geometrical characteristics of cracks on the residual ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panels subjected to longitudinal uniaxial compressive loading were investigated by employing a nonlinear fe analysis method the ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel decreases with the increase of crack length or orientation angle but the decrease of the ultimate strength is significantly affected by crack location the influence of crack location on the residual ultimate strength is significantly depended on where the crack locates in the range of plate buckling half wave and similar ultimate residual strength results are obtained for homogeneous crack center location in the plate buckling half wave based on the nonlinear fe results an empirical formula was developed to predict the residual ultimate strength of cracked stiffened panel under longitudinal compressive loading furthermore the accuracy evaluation of the empirical prediction equation was carried out to show its accuracy acknowledgements the present study is supported by national natural science

pile system in engineering applications keywords pile buckling free vibration mode shape soil structure interaction 1 introduction long slender piles that extend above the ground are widely used for offshore structures such as causeways cross sea bridges wind turbines and jacket platforms stability and free vibration analyses of the pile foundations are inherent parts of the design in order to prevent collapse or severe damage of the pile supported structures due to static load and resonance extensive literature exists concerning the vibration behavior of beam columns without soil medium and many studies have been devoted to modeling the free vibration of beam columns on elastic foundation e g chen 2002 balkaya et al 2009 li et al 2012 however a few studies have been performed to characterize the free vibration of end bearing piles or axially loaded beam columns in a winkler foundation ragab and aggour 1986 examined the effect of lumped mass on the fundamental frequency of a fully embedded pile valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 presented the closed form solution for predicting the natural frequency of partially supported piles catal 2002 explored the influence of shear deformation on the free vibration of partially embedded piles yesilce and catal 2008 dealt with the free vibration of the piles embedded in two layered soil yesilce 2011 used the differential transform method dtm and differential quadrature element method dqem for analyzing the free vibration of fully embedded reddy bickford piles over the past many years several studies have been undertaken to investigate the buckling response of end bearing piles for example bjerrum 1957 addressed the theoretical buckling load of a fully embedded hinged hinged pile davisson and his colleague 1963 1965 formulated the governing differential equations for estimating the buckling of fully and partially embedded piles and reported the numerical solutions for various combinations of end conditions lee 1968 validated the solutions of davisson and robinson 1965 by comparing the results from physical modeling prakash 1987 employed the energy method to develop an analytical model for the buckling capacity of fully embedded piles west et al 1997 interpreted the buckling load and mode shape of fully embedded piles and identified the phenomenon of modal clustering shields 2007 suggested a semi empirical formulation for pile buckling loads and pointed out that with the ongoing evolution of pile applications to include higher pile capacities the common assumption that buckling does not occur for fully embedded piles is no longer valid by accounting for material non linearity vogt et al 2009 studied the buckling of fully embedded piles in soft soil catal 2014 used the dtm to determine the buckling load of evaluating semi rigid connected and partially embedded piles based on the cusp catastrophe theory chen et al 2015 obtained the buckling load of fully embedded piles the objective of this study is to present a unified model for estimating free vibration and buckling of partially embedded end bearing piles under axial compressive load here the volume of the pile is always held constant although the geometry of the pile is dependent on the variation in the shape and area of cross section along the axis of the pile the governing equation of the problem is derived and solved numerically the versatility of the analytical model is illustrated using numerical examples of the soil pile system for a wide range of geometry and material properties the computed results are compared with closed from and numerical solutions available 2 mathematical formulation fig 1 a shows a partially supported homogenous pile with total length l and embedded length l e subjected to a compressive axial load p at the top end of the pile in cartesian coordinate system x y the origin is taken to be at the bottom end of the pile the pile has a regular polygon cross section with variable depth d defined as the distance between the centroid and vertex throughout its length the volume of the pile is taken to be constant but the upper and lower cross section of the pile is changed linear variation is considered for the depth of the pile as 1 f r 1 x l 1 for 0 x l where r is the taper ratio defined as 2 r d t d b in which d t and d b are the cross sectional depths at top and bottom ends respectively it is noted that the pile is tapered up with x direction for 0 r 1 and tapered down for r 1 obviously the case of prismatic pile corresponds to r 1 the cross sectional depth d projection depth w area a and moment of inertia i of the cross section of the pile are given by 3 d d b f 4 w c 1 d b f c 1 1 cos π 2 m 5 a c 2 d b 2 f 2 c 2 m 2 sin 2 π m 6 i c 3 d b 4 f 4 c 3 c 2 12 cos 2 π m 3 tan 2 π m where m is the positive integer 3 which means the side number of the regular polygon cross section from eqs 4 6 it is clear that when m reaches infinity the values of c 1 c 2 and c 3 are 2 π and π 4 respectively i e solid circular cross section the volume v of the pile can be expressed as 7 v 0 l a d x c 2 c 4 d b 2 l c 4 1 3 r 2 r 1 inserting d b in eq 7 into eqs 3

an elastic winkler foundation with a constant coefficient of subgrade reaction k with unit of force per length3 this assumption is commonly used for cohesive soil prakash and sharma 1990 randolph and gourvenec 2011 the soil reaction r s is proportional to the lateral deflection y of the pile and is formed as 12 r s k w y for a harmonic vibration mode the inertial force against the deflection are supposed by 13 f i ρ a ω i 2 y where ω i is the angular frequency in which subscript i refers to integer mode number and ρ is the mass density of the pile fig 1 b shows the stress resultants of an infinitesimal element of the deformed pile under the action of free vibration based on this free body diagram the ordinary differential equation is obtained by imposing the dynamic equilibriums of the element in embedded portion 14 d q d x r s f i 15 d m d x q p d y d x where p is the axial force q is the shear force and m is the bending moment and other parameters are defined previously by using the stress strain relationship of the pile element i e 16 m e i d 2 y d x 2 where e is the modulus of elasticity the combination of eqs 14 and 15 with eq 16 gives the single fourth order ordinary differential equation for the soil pile system as 17 e i d 4 y d x 4 2 e d i d x d 3 y d x 3 e d 2 i d x 2 p d 2 y d x 2 k w ρ a ω i 2 y 0 to facilitate the numerical analysis the following dimensionless parameters are introduced 18 ξ x l η y l e l e l k π k l 11 2 e v 3 2 p π 2 p l 4 e v 2 c i ω i l 5 2 ρ e v where ξ is the normalized location of the pile η is the normalized deflection of the pile e is the embedment ratio k is the soil stiffness p is the load parameter and c i is the frequency parameter by substituting eq 18 into eq 17 in conjunction with eqs 9 11 and by normalizing eq 1 as 19 f r 1 ξ 1 the dimensionless governing equation for analyzing the free vibration of the partially embedded pile with constant volume can be written as 20 1 d 4 η d ξ 4 8 f d f d ξ d 3 η d ξ

with e 0 remains only it is also noteworthy that an increase in the load parameter p leads to decreasing the natural frequency c i essentially at the point where c i 0 the value of p corresponds to the buckling load b of the pile accordingly by replacing p with b and vanishing c i in eq 20 the simplified governing equation for predicting the buckling behavior of the partially embedded pile with fixed volume is formulated as 21 1 d 4 η d ξ 4 8 f d f d ξ d 3 η d ξ 3 12 f 2 d f d ξ 2 4 f d 2 f d ξ 2 c 2 2 c 4 2 π 2 c 3 f 4 b d 2 η d ξ 2 c 1 c 2 3 2 c 4 3 2 π 2 c 3 f 3 k η for ξ e 21 2 d 4 η d ξ

as 26 ζ a l l π 5 σ a l l e where σ all is the allowable stress of the pile material now consider the boundary conditions with different end constraints as follows for the free end the bending moment m and shear force q are zero and the corresponding dimensionless boundary conditions at the bottom and top ends i e ξ 0 and ξ 1 are derived respectively 27 1 d 2 η d ξ 2 d 3 η d ξ 3 c 2 2 c 4 2 p π 2

method is used to integrate differential equations for calculating modal displacements of ξ and η and the determinant search method combined with the regula falsi method is employed to compute the frequency parameter c i and buckling load parameter b a more detailed solution procedure is described in lee and jeong 2016 for a given set of input parameters i e side number m taper ratio r soil stiffness k embedment ratio e load parameter p and end constraint the frequency parameter c i and corresponding mode shape ξ η are obtained from eq 20 it is noted that the first natural frequency c 1 called as fundamental frequency is considered only in this study because the higher natural frequencies are often of no practical interest carpinteri et al 2014 similarly with known values of m r k e and end constraint the buckling load parameter b and corresponding buckled shape ξ η are determined from eq 21 from a series of numerical analyses the optimum condition for the dynamically or statically strongest pile with constant volume is identified 4 numerical results and discussion in this section firstly the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution method is assessed and then the influences of the geometrical and material parameters m r k e on the free vibration and buckling of the soil pile system are explored 4 1 validation the validation was conducted by comparing results from some degenerated cases of the present problem with the existing solutions in the literature the comparisons were made for the parameters being l 3 m v 0 2 m3 e 20 gpa and ρ 2300 kg m3 and the others being in the respective table comparative results are given in tables 1 4 for several combinations of end conditions the first letter stands for the end at the bottom and the second for the top as a first example the free vibration of a uniform column with varying cross sectional shape and axial compressive force r 1 k 0 and e 0 is taken into account table 1 provides the values of the fundamental frequency ω 1 obtained from the present model and compares with the closed form solutions suggested by bokaian 1988 the computed values of ω 1 for six different cases are identical to those of bokaian 1988 the second is devoted to a partially embedded uniform circular pile under compressive axial load m and r 1 table 2 presents the obtained results of the fundamental frequency ω 1 with two symmetric ends i e free free and hinged hinged piles together with the closed form solutions by valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 the calculations of ω 1 appear to be generally very close to those of valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 the third pertains to the buckling of a column with variable cross section k 0 and e 0 table 3 compares the obtained values of the buckling load b with the numerical solutions of riley 2003 using newmark method the computed values of b are in excellent agreement with the results by riley 2003 lastly the buckling loads of a fully embedded uniform pile with varying cross sectional shape and soil stiffness r 1 and e 1 is evaluated table 4 gives a comparison of the obtained values of buckling load b with the closed form solutions by west et al 1997 the computed values of b match very closely with those of west et al 1997 4 2 parametric study consideration has been given to the selection of realistic geometrical and material properties of the soil pile system the following ranges of the corresponding dimensionless parameters are used in the computation m 3 10 and r 0 5 k 0 1 000 e 0 1 otherwise specified three different combinations of end conditions i e the free free free hinged and free clamped piles are taken numerical results from the parametric study are illustrated in figs 2 7 for free vibration and figs 8 13 for buckling with the input parameters stated in the respective figure fig 2 highlights the effect of side number m on the frequency parameter c 1 of the partially embedded tapered pile an increase in the m value causes a decrease in the value of c 1 for example the reduction in frequency parameter for free hinged pile is found to be about 15 5 as the cross sectional shape of the plies varies from equilateral triangle to regular decagon it is interesting to note that the c 1 values of the regular polygon cross section approach toward those of the circular cross section marked by when the side number m reaches or exceeds 10 fig 2 also shows the dependence of the end constraint on the frequency parameter c 1 of the pile the maximum frequency parameter is achieved at the free clamped pile followed by the free hinged pile and the free free pile the difference between the values of c 1 with respect to m is significant for the free clamped and free hinged piles especially for m 5 however for the free free pile there is no substantial difference in c 1 fig 3 depicts the variation of the frequency parameter c 1 with the taper ratio r for different sets of end conditions the influence of taper ratio is pronounced for r 1 i e the prismatic and pyramidal pile although this influence become less sensible for r 1 i e the inverted pyramidal pile interestingly when the value of r is less than the certain value see symbol the frequency parameter does not exist for all end conditions this is explained by the understanding that if the taper ratio of axially compressed piles has a small value the action of lateral deflection will predominant over the action of free vibration mostly at the pile head under these conditions the pile structure is statically unstable and fails by buckling as an example in fig 3 a when the taper ratio r of the hinged hinged pile is 0 084 the pile buckles under the load parameter p of 1 the buckling load parameter of the hinged hinged pile with r 0 084 becomes b 1 on the other hand it is observed in fig 3 that the behavioral difference with respect to r is very sensitive to the end constraint for the clamped clamped clamped hinged and hinged hinged piles as shown in fig 3 a the value of c 1 increases first then decreases with an increase in the r value the peak frequency parameters represented by are 8 977 7 349 and 6 580 respectively when the taper ratio are 2 051 0 459 and 1 545 for the clamped clamped clamped hinged and hinged hinged piles respectively for the clamped free hinged hinged and free free pies as displayed in fig 3 b the results shows a similar trend of c 1 versus r and the prominent peak values of c 1 fig 3 c indicates that the value of c 1 for the hinged clamped free clamped and free hinged piles continuously increases with increasing the value of r in r 5 however the value of c 1 reaches peak and then decrease in r 5 which is not shown in fig 3 c from these results it is recognized that there exists the dynamic optimal taper ratio r opt at which the pile has the maximum frequency parameter c 1opt keeping all other parameters constant this means that it is possible to determine an optimal taper shape such that the pile with a requirement of constant volume is capable of carrying a maximum natural frequency when the geometrical and material properties are given as a consequence the proposed model is of benefit to optimal design of the material or geometry of the soil pile system for certain particular purpose fig 4 presents the effect of soil stiffness k on the frequency parameter c 1 of the partially embedded tapered square pile the value of c 1 increases as the k value increases irrespective of end constraint it is also noticed that the frequency parameter for free free pile is much lower than those by other two end conditions especially for higher soil stiffness the difference between the results of the free free and free clamped piles reaches as high as approximately 480 for k 1000 meanwhile it should be noted that the free free pile buckles when the value of k is less than 8 81 see symbol fig 5 demonstrates the effect of embedment ratio e on the frequency parameter c 1 of the tapered square pile the value of c 1 increases with increasing the value of e as expected for the free clamped and free hinged piles frequency parameters initially increase dramatically and then approach to some limit values for the free free pile when the pile is less embedded than about one third of the pile length i e e 0 339 the load parameter p 1 is high enough to overwhelm free vibration characteristics and cause the pile to buckle for 0 339 e 1 the c 1 value of the free free pile monotonically increases with an increase in the e value until e 1 i e the fully embedded pile at which there is slight differences among the c 1 values of three piles fig 6 shows the effect of load parameter p on the frequency parameter c 1 of the partially embedded tapered square pile the value of c 1 exhibits a decreasing tendency as the p value increases and this overall trend is also appreciable for all end conditions a similar observation was reported by valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 for the axially loaded straight pile from this result it can be inferred that the presence of axial compressive load leads to reduction in natural frequency in particular as the applied axial load approaches the buckling load the natural frequency of the soil pile system drops to zero as seen in fig 6 see symbol therefore the dynamic motion of the system degenerates into a static stability problem as discussed in figs 3 5 for the case of p 1 the first two mode shapes of free vibration of the partially embedded tapered square pile with different end conditions are illustrated in fig 7 it is noteworthy that at the transition between the static and dynamic motions the mode shapes of natural frequency and bucking are identical fig 8 highlights the effect of side number m on the buckling load parameter b of the partially embedded tapered pile it is worth noting that the buckling load parameters at m 4 are identical to the frequency parameter p at c i 0 in fig 6 the results reveal that increasing the value of m varying from triangular pile to circular pile the value of b decreases for instance as the value of m increases from 3 to the buckling load parameter of free hinged piles is found to be reduced by 24 7 this reduction percentage is higher than that of the corresponding frequency parameter presented in fig 2 indicating that the influence of side number is more significant for buckling than free vibration fig 9 depicts the variation of the buckling load parameter b with change in the taper ratio r for different sets of end conditions regardless of the taper ratio the highest and lowest values of b are attained at the clamped clamped and the free free piles respectively this supports the fact that the degree of end fixity of actual pile stays between these two ends hence the buckling loads of an end bearing pile will be bounded by the corresponding two distinct buckling loads west et al 1997 moreover the clamped clamped piles have the strongest influence for promoting the load carrying capacity but the free free piles have the weakest influence from fig 9 it is also seen that the peak buckling load parameter exists for all end conditions as an example the camped clamped pile has a peak b 61 17 at r 1 081 denoted by in a similar manner as those of the dynamic optimal taper ratio the present model can predict a static optimal parameter r opt such that the load carrying capacity of piles against buckling is effectively raised and the relevant parameters retains unchanged namely the strongest system that is capable of bearing applied compressive load can be evaluated fig 10 presents the effect of soil stiffness k on the buckling load parameter b of the partially embedded tapered square pile irrespective of end constraint the value of b increases with increasing the soil stiffness it is particularly predominant for smaller soil stiffness further it is noted that there is only marginal difference in the buckling load parameter of piles with the free clamped and free hinged ends fig 11 demonstrates the effect of embedment ratio e on the buckling load parameter b of the tapered square pile it is noticed that the piles with deep embedment have higher load carrying capacity compared to those with shallow embedment for the case of e 0 7 the first buckled shape of the partially embedded tapered square pile with different end conditions are illustrated in fig 12 the variation of buckling stress parameter ζ with respect to the normalized location ξ of the partially embedded tapered square pile is displayed in fig 13 where the allowable

23567,offshore structures are often founded on long slender piles that extend for a substantial distance above the ground surface this paper presents a novel unified model to analyze the free

the geometry and material parameters that statically and dynamically yield the strongest piles with fixed volume are identified the analytical model is beneficial for the optimum design of the soil pile system in engineering applications keywords pile buckling free vibration mode shape soil structure interaction 1 introduction long slender piles that extend above the ground are widely used for offshore structures such as causeways cross sea bridges wind turbines and jacket platforms stability and free vibration analyses of the pile foundations are inherent parts of the design in order to prevent collapse or severe damage of the pile supported structures due to static load and resonance extensive literature exists concerning the vibration behavior of beam columns without soil medium and many studies have been devoted to modeling the free vibration of beam columns on elastic foundation e g chen 2002 balkaya et al 2009 li et al 2012 however a few studies have been performed to characterize the free vibration of end bearing piles or axially loaded beam columns in a winkler foundation ragab and aggour 1986 examined the effect of lumped mass on the fundamental frequency of a fully embedded pile valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 presented the closed form solution for predicting the natural frequency of partially supported piles catal 2002 explored the influence of shear deformation on the free vibration of partially embedded piles yesilce and catal 2008 dealt with the free vibration of the piles embedded in two layered soil yesilce 2011 used the differential transform method dtm and differential quadrature element method dqem for analyzing the free vibration of fully embedded reddy bickford piles over the past many years several studies have been undertaken to investigate the buckling response of end bearing piles for example bjerrum 1957 addressed the theoretical buckling load of a fully embedded hinged hinged pile davisson and his colleague 1963 1965 formulated the governing differential equations for estimating the buckling of fully and partially embedded piles and reported the numerical solutions for various combinations of end conditions lee 1968 validated the solutions of davisson and robinson 1965 by comparing the results from physical modeling prakash 1987 employed the energy method to develop an analytical model for the buckling capacity of fully embedded piles west et al 1997 interpreted the buckling load and mode shape of fully embedded piles and identified the phenomenon of modal clustering shields 2007 suggested a semi empirical formulation for pile buckling loads and pointed out that with the ongoing evolution of pile applications to include higher pile capacities the common assumption that buckling does not occur for fully embedded piles is no longer valid by accounting for material non linearity vogt et al 2009 studied the buckling of fully embedded piles in soft soil catal 2014 used the dtm to determine the buckling load of evaluating semi rigid connected and partially embedded piles based on the cusp catastrophe theory chen et al 2015 obtained the buckling load of fully embedded piles the objective of this study is to present a unified model for estimating free vibration and buckling of partially embedded end bearing piles under axial compressive load here the volume of the pile is always held constant although the geometry of the pile is dependent on the variation in the shape and area of cross section along the axis of the pile the governing equation of the problem is derived and solved numerically the versatility of the analytical model is illustrated using numerical examples of the soil pile system for a wide range of geometry and material properties the computed results are compared with closed from and numerical solutions available 2 mathematical formulation fig 1 a shows a partially supported homogenous pile with total length l and embedded length l e subjected to a compressive axial load p at the top end of the pile in cartesian coordinate system x y the origin is taken to be at the bottom end of the pile the pile has a regular polygon cross section with variable depth d defined as the distance between the centroid and vertex throughout its length the volume of the pile is taken to be constant but the upper and lower cross section of the pile is changed linear variation is considered for the depth of the pile as 1 f r 1 x l 1 for 0 x l where r is the taper ratio defined as 2 r d t d b in which d t and d b are the cross sectional depths at top and bottom ends respectively it is noted that the pile is tapered up with x direction for 0 r 1 and tapered down for r 1 obviously the case of prismatic pile corresponds to r 1 the cross sectional depth d projection depth w area a and moment of inertia i of the cross section of the pile are given by 3 d d b f 4 w c 1 d b f c 1 1 cos π 2 m 5 a c 2 d b 2 f 2 c 2 m 2 sin 2 π m 6 i c 3 d b 4 f 4 c

1 c 2 and c 3 are 2 π and π 4 respectively i e solid circular cross section the volume v of the pile can be expressed as 7 v 0 l a d x c 2 c 4 d b 2 l c 4 1 3 r 2 r 1 inserting d b in eq 7 into eqs 3

an elastic winkler foundation with a constant coefficient of subgrade reaction k with unit of force per length3 this assumption is commonly used for cohesive soil prakash and sharma 1990 randolph and gourvenec 2011 the soil reaction r s is proportional to the lateral deflection y of the pile and is formed as 12 r s k w y for a harmonic vibration mode the inertial force against the deflection are supposed by 13 f i ρ a ω i 2 y where ω i is the angular frequency in which subscript i refers to integer mode number and ρ is the mass density of the pile fig 1 b shows the stress resultants of an infinitesimal element of the deformed pile under the action of free vibration based on this free body diagram the ordinary differential equation is obtained by imposing the dynamic equilibriums of the element in embedded portion 14 d q d x r s f i 15 d m d x q p d y d x where p is the axial force q is the shear force and m is the bending moment and other parameters are defined previously by using the stress strain relationship of the pile element i e 16 m e i d 2 y d x 2 where e is the modulus of elasticity the combination of eqs 14 and 15 with eq 16 gives the single fourth order ordinary

eq 1 as 19 f r 1 ξ 1 the dimensionless governing equation for analyzing the free vibration of the partially embedded pile with constant volume can be written as 20 1 d 4 η d ξ 4 8 f d f d ξ d 3 η d ξ

with e 0 remains only it is also noteworthy that an increase in the load parameter p leads to decreasing the natural frequency c i essentially at the point where c i 0 the value of p corresponds to the buckling load b of the pile accordingly by replacing p with b and vanishing c i in eq 20 the simplified governing equation for predicting the buckling behavior of the partially embedded pile with

as 26 ζ a l l π 5 σ a l l e where σ all is the allowable stress of the pile material now consider the boundary conditions with different end constraints as follows for the free end the bending moment

method is used to integrate differential equations for calculating modal displacements of ξ and η and the determinant search method combined with the regula falsi method is employed to compute the frequency parameter c i and buckling load parameter b a more detailed solution procedure is described in lee and jeong 2016 for a given set of input parameters i e side number m taper ratio r soil stiffness k embedment ratio e load parameter p and end constraint the frequency parameter c i and corresponding mode shape ξ η are obtained from eq 20 it is noted that the first natural frequency c 1 called as fundamental frequency is considered only in this study because the higher natural frequencies are often of no practical interest carpinteri et al 2014 similarly with known values of m r k e and end constraint the buckling load parameter b and corresponding buckled shape ξ η are determined from eq 21 from a series of numerical analyses the optimum condition for the dynamically or statically strongest pile with constant volume is identified 4 numerical results and discussion in this section firstly the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution method is assessed and then the influences of the geometrical and material parameters m r k e on the free vibration and buckling of the soil pile system are explored 4 1 validation the validation was conducted by comparing results from some degenerated cases of the present problem with the existing solutions in the literature the comparisons were made for the parameters being l 3 m v 0 2 m3 e 20 gpa and ρ 2300 kg m3 and the others being in the respective table comparative results are given in tables 1 4 for several combinations of end conditions the first letter stands for the end at the bottom and the second for the top as a first example the free vibration of a uniform column with varying cross sectional shape and axial compressive force r 1 k 0 and e 0 is taken into account table 1 provides the values of the fundamental frequency ω 1 obtained from the present model and compares with the closed form solutions suggested by bokaian 1988 the computed values of ω 1 for six different cases are identical to those of bokaian 1988 the second is devoted to a partially embedded uniform circular pile under compressive axial load m and r 1 table 2 presents the obtained results of the fundamental frequency ω 1 with two symmetric ends i e free free and hinged hinged piles together with the closed form solutions by valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 the calculations of ω 1 appear to be generally very close to those of valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 the third pertains to the buckling of a column with variable cross section k 0 and e 0 table 3 compares the obtained values of the buckling load b with the numerical solutions of riley 2003 using newmark method the computed values of b are in excellent agreement with the results by riley 2003 lastly the buckling loads of a fully embedded uniform pile with varying cross sectional shape and soil stiffness r 1 and e 1 is evaluated table 4 gives a comparison of the obtained values of buckling load b with the closed form solutions by west et al 1997 the computed values of b match very closely with those of west et al 1997 4 2 parametric study consideration has been given to the selection of realistic geometrical and material properties of the soil pile system the following ranges of the corresponding dimensionless parameters are used in the computation m 3 10 and r 0 5 k 0 1 000 e 0 1 otherwise specified three different combinations of end conditions i e the free free free hinged and free clamped piles are taken numerical results from the parametric study are illustrated in figs 2 7 for free vibration and figs 8 13 for buckling with the input parameters stated in the respective figure fig 2 highlights the effect of side number m on the frequency parameter c 1 of the partially embedded tapered pile an increase in the m value causes a decrease in the value of c 1 for example the reduction in frequency parameter for free hinged pile is found to be about 15 5 as the cross sectional shape of the plies varies from equilateral triangle to regular decagon it is interesting to note that the c 1 values of the regular polygon cross section approach toward those of the circular cross section marked by when the side number m reaches or exceeds 10 fig 2 also shows the dependence of the end constraint on the frequency parameter c 1 of the pile the maximum frequency parameter is achieved at the free clamped pile followed by the free hinged pile and the free free pile the difference between the values of c 1 with respect to m is significant for the free clamped and free hinged piles especially for m 5 however for the free free pile there is no substantial difference in c 1 fig 3 depicts the variation of the frequency parameter c 1 with the taper ratio r for different sets of end conditions the influence of taper ratio is pronounced for r 1 i e the prismatic and pyramidal pile although this influence become less sensible for r 1 i e the inverted pyramidal pile interestingly when the value of r is less than the certain value see symbol the frequency parameter does not exist for all end conditions this is explained by the understanding that if the taper ratio of axially compressed piles has a small value the action of lateral deflection will predominant over the action of free vibration mostly at the pile head under these conditions the pile structure is statically unstable and fails by buckling as an example in fig 3 a when the taper ratio r of the hinged hinged pile is 0 084 the pile buckles under the load parameter p of 1 the buckling load parameter of the hinged hinged pile with r 0 084 becomes b 1 on the other hand it is observed in fig 3 that the behavioral difference with respect to r is very sensitive to the end constraint for the clamped clamped clamped hinged and hinged hinged piles as shown in fig 3 a the value of c 1 increases first then decreases with an increase in the r value the peak frequency parameters represented by are 8 977 7 349 and 6 580 respectively when the taper ratio are 2 051 0 459 and 1 545 for the clamped clamped clamped hinged and hinged hinged piles respectively for the clamped free hinged hinged and free free pies as displayed in fig 3 b the results shows a similar trend of c 1 versus r and the prominent peak values of c 1 fig 3 c indicates that the value of c 1 for the hinged clamped free clamped and free hinged piles continuously increases with increasing the value of r in r 5 however the value of c 1 reaches peak and then decrease in r 5 which is not shown in fig 3 c from these results it is recognized that there exists the dynamic optimal taper ratio r opt at which the pile has the maximum frequency parameter c 1opt keeping all other parameters constant this means that it is possible to determine an optimal taper shape such that the pile with a requirement of constant volume is capable of carrying a maximum natural frequency when the geometrical and material properties are given as a consequence the proposed model is of benefit to optimal design of the material or geometry of the soil pile system for certain particular purpose fig 4 presents the effect of soil stiffness k on the frequency parameter c 1 of the partially embedded tapered square pile the value of c 1 increases as the k value increases irrespective of end constraint it is also noticed that the frequency parameter for free free pile is much lower than those by other two end conditions especially for higher soil stiffness the difference between the results of the free free and free clamped piles reaches as high as approximately 480 for k 1000 meanwhile it should be noted that the free free pile buckles when the value of k is less than 8 81 see symbol fig 5 demonstrates the effect of embedment ratio e on the frequency parameter c 1 of the tapered square pile the value of c 1 increases with increasing the value of e as expected for the free clamped and free hinged piles frequency parameters initially increase dramatically and then approach to some limit values for the free free pile when the pile is less embedded than about one third of the pile length i e e 0 339 the load parameter p 1 is high enough to overwhelm free vibration characteristics and cause the pile to buckle for 0 339 e 1 the c 1 value of the free free pile monotonically increases with an increase in the e value until e 1 i e the fully embedded pile at which there is slight differences among the c 1 values of three piles fig 6 shows the effect of load parameter p on the frequency parameter c 1 of the partially embedded tapered square pile the value of c 1 exhibits a decreasing tendency as the p value increases and this overall trend is also appreciable for all end conditions a similar observation was reported by valsangkar and pradhanang 1987 for the axially loaded straight pile from this result it can be inferred that the presence of axial compressive load leads to reduction in natural frequency in particular as the applied axial load approaches the buckling load the natural frequency of the soil pile system drops to zero as seen in fig 6 see symbol therefore the dynamic motion of the system degenerates into a static stability problem as discussed in figs 3 5 for the case of p 1 the first two mode shapes of free vibration of the partially embedded tapered square pile with different end conditions are illustrated in fig 7 it is noteworthy that at the transition between the static and dynamic motions the mode shapes of natural frequency and bucking are identical fig 8 highlights the effect of side number m on the buckling load parameter b of the partially embedded tapered pile it is worth noting that the buckling load parameters at m 4 are identical to the frequency parameter p at c i 0 in fig 6 the results reveal that increasing the value of m varying from triangular pile to circular pile the value of b decreases for instance as the value of m increases from 3 to the buckling load parameter of free hinged piles is found to be reduced by 24 7 this reduction percentage is higher than that of the corresponding frequency parameter presented in fig 2 indicating that the influence of side number is more significant for buckling than free vibration fig 9 depicts the variation of the buckling load parameter b with change in the taper ratio r for different sets of end conditions regardless of the taper ratio the highest and lowest values of b are attained at the clamped clamped and the free free piles respectively this supports the fact that the degree of end fixity of actual pile stays between these two ends hence the buckling loads of an end bearing pile will be bounded by the corresponding two distinct buckling loads west et al 1997 moreover the clamped clamped piles have the strongest influence for promoting the load carrying capacity but the free free piles have the weakest influence from fig 9 it is also seen that the peak buckling load parameter exists for all end conditions as an example the camped clamped pile has a peak b 61 17 at r 1 081 denoted by in a similar manner as those of the dynamic optimal taper ratio the present model can predict a static optimal parameter r opt such that the load carrying capacity of piles against buckling is effectively raised and the relevant parameters retains unchanged namely the strongest system that is capable of bearing applied compressive load can be evaluated fig 10 presents the effect of soil stiffness k on the buckling load parameter b of the partially embedded tapered square pile irrespective of end constraint the value of b increases with increasing the soil stiffness it is particularly predominant for smaller soil stiffness further it is noted that there is only marginal difference in the buckling load parameter of piles with the free clamped and free hinged ends fig 11 demonstrates the effect of embedment ratio e on the buckling load parameter b of the tapered square pile it is noticed that the piles with deep embedment have higher load carrying capacity compared to those with shallow embedment for the case of e 0 7 the first buckled shape of the partially embedded tapered square pile with different end conditions are illustrated in fig 12 the variation of buckling stress parameter ζ with respect to the normalized location ξ of the partially embedded tapered square pile is displayed in fig 13 where the allowable stress parameter ζ a l l of the pile is included for comparison the maximum buckling stress ζ m a x is obtained at the minimum cross section of the tapered pile as expected for the example in this figure the buckling of the free clamped pile is governed by the allowable stress ζ a l l that is calculated to be 0 306 for concrete with e 20 gpa and σ all 20 mpa ζ a l l 0 306 is lower than ζ m a x 0 319 so that the corresponding load carrying capacity is not b 16 94 but p all ζ a l l ζ m a x b 16 25 see symbol in contrast the buckling of the free free and free hinged piles is governed by the buckling stress rather than the allowable stress see symbol 5 conclusion a new unified model is developed for analyzing the free vibration and buckling of partially embedded end bearing piles subjected to axial compressive load emphasis is placed on the consideration of the tapered piles with variable cross sectional shape with constant volume the single fourth order differential governing equations of the dynamic and static motions are derived and the runge kutta method in combination with the regula flasi method is used in solving the governing equations with various end constraints

23568,numerical simulation is an effective method to study the global buckling of submarine pipelines under high temperature and high pressure the length of the pipeline model has a significant effect on the global buckling during the numerical simulation this paper outlines the global buckling regularity of different pipes of various lengths and proposes a method to determine the pipe model length for the numerical simulation of pipe buckling by using theoretical analysis and the fea method a method of calculating the pipeline s critical length and upper limit critical length is proposed based on the characteristics of the short pipe and long pipe the numerical analysis results indicate that the global buckling amplitude of the short pipe increases with the length of the pipeline model therefore the model length of a short pipeline in the numerical simulation should be equal to the actual length of the research object in contrast the buckling amplitude of pipes with a length greater than the critical length does not vary with the pipe length thus the model length only needs to be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length a method to determine the length of the pipe model for the numerical simulation of pipe buckling is proposed for various pipelines with different laying modes in practical engineering keywords submarine pipeline pipeline global buckling fea method the critical length pipe model length 1 introduction submarine pipelines are widely used in the development of offshore oil and gas resources and they are increasingly required to operate under high temperatures and pressures which are prone to cause the global buckling deformation of pipelines scholars have performed a considerable amount of research on the global buckling of submarine pipelines as early as hobbs 1984 deduced the classical analytical solution for the vertical and lateral global buckling of an ideal submarine pipeline in taylor and gan 1986 derived an analytical solution to the global buckling of pipes with single arch and double arch geometric initial imperfection based on hobbs 1984 analytical solution the analytical solution can accurately reflect the global buckling mechanism in theory but can only be applied to the analysis of pipeline buckling for a small deformation as it presents many limitations in the study of post buckling with a large deformation in the non linear pipeline because a small slope angle and linear elasticity are assumed with the rapid development of computer technology in the past 40 years the finite element analysis fea method based on piplin iii plusone abp upbuck and abaqus finite element software has been applied to the global buckling of submarine pipelines the large scale commercial software abaqus 2008 has been most widely used many valuable calculation results have been obtained using this software several researchers have described the pipe buckling mechanism using the fea method based on abaqus such as miles and calladine 1999 bruton and carr 2005 klæbo and giertsensævik 2008 li 2011 and karampour et al 2013 numerical simulations based on the pipeline project of the gulf of mexico and the south china sea were carried out by jukes et al 2008 ramaiah and bong 2013 and carpenter 2015 several investigators sriskandarajah et al 2001 peek and yun 2009 jukes et al 2009 sun et al 2011 and liu et al 2014 have used many different methods to numerically simulate global buckling the static method the riks method and the dynamic method are the main methods used to study the global buckling of a subsea pipeline when using abaqus many results of fea study on the global buckling of subsea pipelines demonstrate that fea method is critical for the theoretical research and engineering guidance of pipeline accurately predicting the pipeline global buckling and its responses relies on the fea model being constructed correctly therefore a well developed fea model should incorporate the physical and mechanical parameters of the pipeline and subsoil as these parameters have a significant influence on the global buckling deformation the effects of various parameters on the numerical simulation of pipeline global buckling have been studied several researchers investigated the influence of a geometric initial imperfection on the buckling of a submarine pipeline when using the fea method sriskandarajah et al 1999 suzuki et al 2006 chaudhuri et al 2008 arjomandi and taheri 2009 hong et al 2015 bruton et al 2006 2008 2009 noted the significant effect of the pipe soil interaction on the numerical simulation of pipeline global buckling as it is the most uncertain parameter in pipeline design in haq et al 2013 analysed the influence of various parameters such as the ratio of the outside diameter and the wall thickness of the pipeline d t pipe out of straightness oos internal and external pressure lateral and axial friction operating temperature and installation depth on the numerical simulation of pipeline global buckling because an accurate simulation of pipeline global buckling relies on correct parameters many studies have focused on the parameters relevant to pipeline global buckling when using the fea method this article focuses on the impact of the pipe model length on the numerical simulation of pipeline buckling and proposes a method to determine the length of the pipeline model as few studies have systematically investigated this topic in christensen 2005 first proposed the concept of a short pipeline and noted that the result is conservative for short pipelines when using the hobbs equations for very long pipelines to assess the global buckling walker et al 2010 assessed the influence of the material properties friction coefficient and the virtual anchor spacing vas length on the axial strain of the buckling pipeline using the fea method based on abaqus he concluded that the pipeline buckling strain increases with the vas length by analysing the relationship between axial strain and vas length with different materials and under different friction coefficients the cases of short flowlines medium flowlines and unbounded pipe in pipe systems were presented by maoût et al 2011 as he holds the view that the infinite mode buckle shape does not accurately reflect the lateral buckling mechanism the buckling axial force of an unbounded pipe and medium and short flowlines was given and the expression of the axial force at the anchor was deduced an equation for the summation of the pipe buckling length and pipe sliding length was deduced by liu et al 2015 in 2016 using the energy method the derivation of the equations is illustrated through an example of a pipeline with a single arch initial imperfection undergoing third order global buckling these studies show that several researchers have investigated the effects of the pipeline length on the global buckling and found that pipeline buckling is quite sensitive to the pipeline length therefore it is critical to propose a method to determine the length of the pipe model for numerical simulations of pipe buckling this paper includes three main sections the first section provides the definitions of critical length long pipe and short pipe by analysing the law of the axial force distribution of the pipeline proposed by the classical analytical solution and establishes a method for calculating the critical length and upper limit critical length the second section focuses on the buckling regularity of the long pipe and short pipe by simulating several different pipeline models with various lengths based on the 3d explicit method the last section proposes a method to determine the length of the pipe model for the numerical simulation of pipe buckling and demonstrates how it can be used for pipelines with different laying modes 2 definitions of the critical length long pipe and short pipe the hobbs equation hobbs 1984 which has been used for years to evaluate the susceptibility of pipelines to global buckling assumes that the pipeline is infinitely long the deformation length of the pipe is assumed to be divided into two parts the buckling length l and sliding length l s as shown in fig 1 the axial force at the end of the sliding section to infinity is p 0 which is the axial pressure of the pipe in the fully constrained state at the design temperature the axial force of the pipe buckling section is p the infinite model introduced by hobbs is infeasible when using the fea method to study the global buckling of the pipeline the length of the pipe model can be determined by difference in the axial forces of buckling pipelines of different lengths next a pipe with two free ends and an initial imperfection in the middle is used as an example to analyse the relationship between the pipe length l m and axial force distribution three basic forms of pipe axial force are shown in fig 2 for the first basic form of the pipe axial force as shown in fig 2 a the pipe is sufficiently long the buckled pipe can be divided into four parts based on the axial force distribution the buckling section l slip section l s fully constrained section l d and free end of the axial force releasing section l c the maximum axial force p m equal to p 0 appears in the fully constrained section when the pipeline length decreases from sufficiently long the length of the fully constrained section l d decreases equivalently and the length of the other three sections does not change the pipe axial force becomes the second form when the length of the fully constrained section l d decreases to zero as shown in fig 2 b the buckled pipe can be divided into three parts the buckled section l slip section l s and free end axial force releasing section l c the maximum axial force p m is equal to p 0 when the pipe length is reduced further the lengths of the pipe buckling section l slip section l s and free end axial force releasing section l c decrease and l d is equal to zero as shown in fig 2 c the maximum axial force p m is less than p 0 from the analysis above the axial force form in fig 2 b characterized by l d 0 and p m p 0 is the critical form of the axial force distribution of pipelines with different lengths therefore this paper defines this length as the critical length denoted as l t a pipe with a length greater than the critical length is designated a long pipe and a pipe with a length less than the critical length is designated a short pipe the maximum axial force p m of the long pipe is equal to p 0 and appears at the end of l s e f which is defined as the anchor the distance between the two anchors is referred to as the anchor spacing the maximum axial force p m of the short pipe is less than p 0 and appears at the end of l s e f which is defined as the virtual anchor the distance between the two virtual anchors is referred to as the virtual anchor spacing 3 methods to determine the pipeline s critical length and upper limit critical length critical length is an important basis for assessing whether a pipeline is considered a long pipe or short pipe the method for determining the critical length is illustrated through an example of a single insulation pipe using both the analytical method and fea method the basic parameters of the pipeline tianyinghun 2007 are shown in table 1 the submerged weight per unit length of the pipe is 1233 74 n m when the weight of the pipe contents is considered the design temperature is 88 c higher than the environment and the design pressure was set at 4 65 mpa according to liu et al 2013 the equivalent temperature is 5 c when the internal pressure is 4 65 mpa thus the total temperature is 93 c higher than the environment when treating pressure as an effective temperature to simplify the calculation other detailed parameters of the model are provided in table 2 from the method of taylor and gan 1986 the imperfection deflection expression can be assumed as follows 1 v 0 x q φ l e i l 0 4 3 38 10 3 cos n 0 x 1 47 10 2 x l 0 2 6 98 10 3 if the initial imperfection amplitude is 1 m the initial defect morphology is as shown in fig 3 3 1 analytical method as shown in fig 2 b the critical length l t includes l l s and l c the sum of l and l s is equal to the anchor spacing denoted as l f l t can be expressed as the following equations 2 l t l f 2 l c 3 l c a e α t q a where a is the cross sectional area of the pipe e is the elastic modulus α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material t is the equivalent temperature q is the submerged weight per unit length and φ a is the axial friction coefficient between the pipe and soil l f is expressed as equation 4 which was derived by liu et al 2013 in 2016 using the energy method 4 l f 2 59 l 2 6 l 1 φ l φ a q φ l e i a i 3 6213 10 4 l 5 1 4556 10 4 l 0 l 2 l 0 5 1 2 1 where l is the wavelength of the large deformation along the positive direction of the y axis φ l is the lateral friction coefficient between the pipe and soil i is the moment of inertia l 0 is the wavelength of the initial geometric imperfections and the other parameters are as provided above equation 4 assumes that the pipeline with a single arch initial imperfection undergoes third order global buckling substituting the parameters in tables 1and 2 into equations 2 4 yields l f 5733 9 m l c 3029 8 m and l t 11793 5 m 3 2 fea method the 3d explicit method based on abaqus is considered to simulate the global buckling of the pipe model presented above and to determine its critical length accurately predicting the critical length relies on having an appropriate length in the fea model to select the appropriate length for the fea model a prefetch length ranges from 2 to 14 km at 2 km intervals pipe31 beam element and c3d8r solid elements are used to model the pipeline and foundation soil in the 3d fe model the mechanical behaviour of the pipeline is assumed to be linear elastic the material properties of the pipe include the pipe density elastic modulus poisson ratio and coefficient of thermal expansion the mohr coulomb model is used as the soil foundation constitutive model to simulate the stress strain relationship with these soil properties the material properties of the soil with no dilatancy include the density elastic modulus poisson s ratio cohesion and internal friction angle the soil boundary conditions are resistant both laterally and axially the bottom boundary of the soil is completely fixed both ends of the pipe are free the pipe s initial imperfection determined by equation 1 is imported by the cad model the steps of simulation are two one is to apply the gravity field so that the pipeline and the soil contact can behaviour the second is to increase the temperature of the pipeline to simulate the process of high temperature load until the pipeline occurs the global buckling the simulation results show that the ratio of the dynamic energy and the potential energy during the pipeline heating process is low as shown in fig 4 the lengths of l l s and l c in the long pipe are equal to the corresponding variables of the critical length equation l t l 2l s 2l c whereas l l s and l c of the short pipe have smaller values now define l mf l 2l s 2l c for the long pipe and l mf l 2l s 2l c for the short pipe the relationship between l mf and the pipe model length l m of the 2 km 14 km models is defined as shown in fig 5 the value of l mf increases as l m increases for the 2 km 10 km models whereas the l mf of the 12 km and 14 km models is a definite value therefore the 12 km model is used to analyse the critical length the axial stress along the pipe of the 12 km model is shown in fig 6 the midpoint of the initial imperfection is taken as the origin of the x axis the 12 km model belongs to the long pipe as the length of l d is larger than zero therefore the sum of l l s and l c in fig 6 is the critical length as shown in the figure l f 5720 m and l c 3030 m thus l t 11780 m from the above analysis l t 11793 5 m based on the analytical method and l t 11780 m based on the fea method the deviation of the two methods is extremely small 0 11 suggesting that equation 2 is reliable for calculating the critical length but the efficiency is low because it takes heavy effort to calculate l f in the formula which is complex and difficult to derive in addition the computational result depends on the pipe buckling form and equation 2 must be modified when the pipe does not exhibit third order global buckling therefore when the critical length is determined by the analytical method the ultimate buckling form of the pipeline must be accurately predicted otherwise large errors may occur 3 3 simplified analytical method for the upper limit critical length to overcome the two limitations of equation 2 the upper limit critical length equation is derived by analysing the axial force release process of the pipeline during buckling which simplifies the calculation of the critical length and makes the calculation applicable to the arbitrary buckling form the axial force release process during buckling is shown in fig 6 for a pipeline with two free ends and an initial imperfection in the middle fig 3 as the temperature rises from 0 c to 9 3 c and then 18 6 c the length of the axial force release at both ends of the pipe increases from 0 to l 1 and then to l 2 when the temperature reaches the design value the length of the pipe free end axial force releasing section reaches the maximum value l c and the corresponding axial force release is p 0 which is proportional to the length l c for the initial imperfection segment the axial force release occurs as the pipe begins to buckle when the axial force reaches the critical buckling force p the axial force release reaches the maximum value p 0 p when the temperature reaches the design value and the corresponding pipe length is l f 2 less than l c fig 6 shows that the magnitude of the buckling axial force p is approximately 7 of p 0 the length of the axial force release section l f 2 is equal to l c when the maximum axial force release due to buckling is assumed to be p 0 thus the critical length of the pipe is slightly larger than the actual critical length recorded as the upper limit critical length l tm the expression is as follows 5 l t m 4 l c substituting the parameters in tables 1 and 2 into equations 3 and 5 the upper limit critical length is obtained as l tm 12119 2 m l tm is 2 76 and 2 88 larger than the critical lengths calculated by equation 2 and the fea method respectively the disparities are less than 5 for a pipeline with two fixed ends and an initial imperfection in the middle fig 7 the upper limit critical length equation can also be deduced from the law of pipe axial pressure release when analysing the axial force release path of segment ac the axial force can only release through buckling from point c as the pipe end is completely fixed therefore there is no axial force release before the temperature rises to the value that causes the critical buckling load p the axial force release through the global buckling is p 0 p from the analysis above the upper limit critical length of segment ac is equal to l c thus when the length of segment ac is longer than l c the axial force release through the global buckling cannot extend to point a and no axial force is released at the pipe end ensuring that the maximum axial force p m is equal to p 0 because segment cb is symmetrical to segment ac l t m of the following model can be expressed as 6 l t m 2 l c for an asymmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and free ends fig 8 each segment should be assessed as a long tube or short tube because the lengths of the segments on both sides of the initial imperfection are unequal according to the aforementioned axial force release theory the maximum critical lengths of segments ac and cb are both 2l c therefore the maximum critical length of the pipe is given by segment ac l t m 2 l c 7 segment bc l t m 2 l c the boundary conditions and laying mode of the pipeline in actual engineering applications may be one of the aforementioned situations or a combination of a variety of conditions however the law of pipe axial pressure release due to global buckling is still correct and thus the derivation of the equation for the upper limit critical length is still applicable therefore a unified expression for the upper limit critical length is 8 l t m n l c from the above equation the upper limit critical length of the pipe is determined by n and l c the parameter n is determined by the boundary conditions and the laying mode of the pipeline and the parameter l c is determined mainly by the design temperature the friction between the pipe and soil foundation and the submerged weight per unit length of pipe l c is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the friction between the pipe and soil foundation and the submerged weight per unit length of pipe when the above parameters of the model change the upper limit critical length of pipe will change accordingly and the long tube and short tube can be converted to each other 4 determination of the model length for both the long pipe and short pipe five models with pipe lengths ranging from 6 to 14 km at 2 km intervals are used to simulate the global buckling to study the influence of the pipe length on global buckling and to study the law of the global buckling of the long tube and short tube the parameters of these models are shown in tables 1 and 2 and fig 3 the axial stress along the pipe models of different lengths when setting the origin of the x axis at the midpoint of the initial imperfection is shown in fig 9 a based on the above analysis the critical length is l t 11780 m therefore the 6 8 and 10 km models belong to the short pipe whereas the 12 and 14 km models belong to the long pipe fig 9 a shows that the short pipes have no fully constrained section and the pipe axial force varies significantly with the change in the pipe length l m in contrast all long pipes contain the fully constrained sections the anchor positions in the long pipes with different lengths are completely coincident on the x axis and the axial force curves of the 12 and 14 km models between the anchors are completely coincident to further analyse the relationship between the pipe length l m and its axial force the relationship between the pipe length and axial force p m of the virtual anchor as shown in fig 9 b is extracted according to the diagram in fig 9 a the axial force p m at the virtual anchors of the different short pipes with various lengths increases linearly with increases in the pipe length l m and increases to p 0 when the pipe length l m increases to the critical length by contrast the axial force p m of the anchors of the different long pipes with various lengths is the definite value p 0 fig 9 a also shows that the x coordinate values of the virtual anchors of the 6 8 and 10 km models are 1 42 1 92 and 2 42 km respectively for the 12 and 14 km models the x coordinates of the anchors are both equal to 2 86 km given the relationship between virtual anchor spacing and the pipe length l m fig 9 c the virtual anchor spacing increases linearly with increases in the pipe length l m and increases to l f as l m increases to the critical length the anchor spacing of different long pipes with various lengths is the definite value l f setting the origin of the x axis at the midpoint of the initial imperfection the lateral displacement amplitude is expressed by v and the maximum buckling amplitude is expressed by v m the lateral displacements of pipes with different lengths are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a shows that the buckling amplitudes of the short pipes increase as the pipe length l m ranges from 6 to 10 km however the lateral displacement curves of the 12 and 14 km models coincide completely fig 10 b shows that the maximum buckling amplitude of the pipe grows at a decreasing rate as the length of the model increases when the length of the model reaches the critical length the growth rate decreases to zero and the maximum buckling amplitude increases to a definite value therefore the critical length is not only the critical point of the pipeline axial force distribution change but also the critical point that the global buckling amplitude of pipes with different lengths will no longer increase with further increases in l m fig 11 shows the distribution of the axial strain ε along the buckling pipes with different lengths fig 11 shows that the axial strain curves of all long pipe and short pipe models are symmetrical about the initial imperfections the axial strain fluctuates considerably in the buckling section and the maximum values of both tensile and compressive strains appear in the buckling section the axial strain ε at the buckling section of different short pipes with various lengths increases with increases in the pipe length l m by contrast the axial strain curves at the buckling sections of different long pipes with various lengths coincide completely for the non buckling section the 6 8 and 10 km models all contain an extreme point on the positive x axis the corresponding x axis coordinates are 1 42 1 92 and 2 42 km respectively the axial strain at the virtual anchor of the short pipe models with different lengths increases with increases in the pipe length for long pipes both the 12 and 14 km models contain segments with no axial strain located near the end of the slip section the x coordinate of the end of the slip section is 2 86 km corresponding to the anchor positions of the long pipes in the free end axial force releasing section the axial strain curves on all pipes with different lengths are parallel and the axial strains at the end of pipes are equal the axial displacements along buckling pipelines of different lengths are shown in fig 12 fig 12 illustrates that the axial displacements of the short pipes at the virtual anchor and the long pipes in the fully constrained segment are zero the law for the axial displacement of the long and short pipes is summarized as the following two points the axial displacement graph of each model is symmetrical about the initial imperfection the axial displacement direction of the buckling and sliding sections is towards the initial imperfection whereas the axial displacement direction of the free end axial force releasing section deviates from the initial imperfection the axial displacement direction is denoted by arrows in the figure the difference in the axial displacement of the long and short pipes can be summarized as follows the axial displacement at the end of different short pipes increases with increases in the pipe length but the axial displacements at the end of the long pipes with different lengths are equal for short pipes the axial displacement between the two virtual anchors increases with increases in the pipe length however the axial displacement curves of long pipes with different lengths completely overlap between the two anchors the above analysis demonstrates that the global buckling law of a short pipe differs from that of a long pipe for the short pipe the buckling amplitude axial pressure axial displacement and axial strain vary with the pipe length when global buckling occurs however the buckling amplitude axial pressure axial displacement and axial strain of long pipes with various lengths are all equal between their anchors the 6 km short pipe model and 14 km long pipe model were selected for a comparative analysis to study the cause of the significant difference between the long and short pipe buckling results fig 13 shows the axial strain axial displacement and axial pressure of the 6 and 14 km models fig 13 a shows that the maximum axial force extreme axial strain and critical axial displacement appear at the same point in the pipeline which has no axial displacement but has axial force release and axial strain therefore the point is considered a virtual anchor the distance between the virtual anchors in different short pipes of various lengths is unequal and thus the axial force p m and the axial strain ε are unequal this inequality causes the difference between the buckling amplitude and stress of short pipes with various lengths fig 13 b shows that the constant axial force section axial strain free section and non axial displacement section appear at the same position of the pipe which has no axial force release no axial strain and no axial displacement therefore the pipe segment is completely restrained the end of the slip section that is the start of the segment noted above is considered an anchor the distance between the anchors in long pipes of various lengths is equal and the axial force p m and axial strain ε are also equal therefore the buckling amplitude and stress of long pipes with various lengths are identical the pipeline length l m is determined by the following two factors in the simulation of the pipeline buckling the actual situation of the pipe should be simulated to the extent possible that is using the real pipe length to simulate the global buckling however an excessively long pipe model may lead to non convergence of the calculation due to the limitation of the finite element software itself furthermore the computing costs should be considered when considering the length of the pipe model used to simulate the global buckling therefore when the fea method is used to study the global buckling of submarine pipelines one must first assess whether the object is a long pipe or short pipe if it is a short pipe the pipeline model length should be equal to the actual length of the research object if it is a long pipe the model length should be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length considering the difficulty of calculating the critical length we recommended using the upper limit critical length to determine the pipe model length the specific steps are as follows the parameters n and l c of the upper limit critical length nl c are determined by analysing the pipeline boundary conditions the length of the research object should then be compared with nl c if the research object is larger than nl c it is a long pipe in this case the pipe model length l m only needs to be equal to or slightly larger than nl c another case is that the object is a short pipe or a long pipe with a very short fully constrained segment because its length is shorter than nl c therefore the actual length of the research object should be taken as the pipe model length thus the global buckling of the object can be simulated accurately the drawback of this approach is that the pipe model length determined by nl c may be larger than that calculated by the critical length when it is a long pipe with a short fully constrained segment the largest waste of computing costs is the difference between nl c and l t the third quarter analysis indicated that the difference does not exceed 5 the flowchart for determining the pipeline model length in the numerical simulation of pipe buckling is shown in fig 14 5 engineering application the boundary conditions and laying modes of pipelines include free ends fixed ends symmetrical models and asymmetrical models pipeline engineering may consider one of the situations above or a combination of a variety of conditions the application of the method for determining the pipe model length will be presented by analysing the three basic pipe laying modes highlighted above 1 for a symmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and free ends fig 3 the fourth chapter of the application of the method for determining the pipe model lengths is applicable 2 for a symmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and fixed ends fig 15 the upper limit critical length l tm 2l c from equation 6 and is equal to 60539 6 m when equation 3 is introduced into equation 6 this value is considerably smaller than the actual length of 20 km in fig 15 therefore the subject is a long pipe and the pipe model length for the fea should be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length considering the convenience factor this model length is set at 7 km the axial pressure and horizontal displacement of the 7 km pipe are extracted with the midpoint of the initial defect as the x axis origin to compare it with the result of the 14 km pipe with free ends the axial force and horizontal displacement diagrams of the 7 and 14 km models are shown in fig 16 fig 16 a shows that the curve of the axial force along the 7 km model contains a fully constrained segment indicating that it is a long pipe and the 7 km length of the pipe model reasonably reflects the buckling regularity and can reduce the calculation cost compared to the full length model fig 16 a and b shows that the axial force and horizontal displacement curves of the 7 and 14 km models coincide completely indicating that the buckling results in the 7 km pipe with fixed ends and the 14 km pipe with free ends are identical therefore when the finite element method is used to study the global buckling of the submarine pipeline the cost can be reduced by adding a fixed constraint to the pipe end 3 for an asymmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and free ends fig 17 the upper limit critical length l tm is determined by equation 7 which is expressed as l tm 2l c for segments ac and bc the upper limit critical length l tm is equal to 60539 6 m when equation 3 is introduced into equation 7 segment ac is a long pipe because its 15 km length is longer than 60539 6 m therefore the pipe model length for the fea can be equal to or slightly longer than l tm the length of the ac segment pipeline is considered to be 7 km for convenience segment bc is a short pipe or a long pipe with a short fully constrained segment because its 3 km length is shorter than 60539 6 m therefore the actual length of 3 km is taken as the length of the bc segment pipe as shown in fig 18 the axial pressure and horizontal displacement of the pipe are extracted with the midpoint of the initial imperfection as the x axis origin segment ac is a long pipe because its axial force curve contains a fully constrained segment and segment bc is a short pipe because its axial force curve contains a virtual anchor indicating that the length of the pipe model is selected correctly as shown in fig 18 b the horizontal displacement curve of the pipe is extracted and compared to the horizontal displacements of the aforementioned 14 and 6 km symmetrical pipe models at a distance from the x axis origin the horizontal displacement curve of the ac segment pipe and the 14 km pipe model coincide with each other and the horizontal displacement curve of the bc segment pipe coincides with the 6 km pipe model showing that the buckling law of the long or short pipe is applicable to the asymmetrical pipe segment with assessing a long or short pipe in a certain range near the x axis origin the horizontal displacement amplitude of this model is between the 14 and 6 km models which indicates that the buckling of this segment of the asymmetrical pipe is a combination of the left and right pipes 6 conclusions based on the analysis of the buckling behaviour of different length pipes this paper proposes the method of calculating the critical length l t and upper limit critical length l tm and establishes a method of determining the length of the pipeline with different laying modes during global buckling simulated by the fea method under the regularity of the global buckling of long and short pipes the conclusions are as follows 1 from the distribution law of the pipeline axial force given by the classical analytical solution the length of the pipeline characterized by l d 0 and p m p 0 is defined as the critical length the critical length is related to the pipe operating temperature pipe soil friction coefficient unit weight and boundary conditions of the pipe the equations for the critical length and upper limit critical length of the pipeline are established 2 in the numerical analysis the length of the pipe model has a significant effect on the global buckling deformation the buckling amplitude and axial force of different short pipes change with changes in the pipe length l m when global buckling occurs in contrast the buckling amplitude and axial force of long pipes do not change with variations in the pipe length 3 the critical length is the criterion for assessing whether a pipe is a long or short pipe it is also an important basis for determining the length of the model in the numerical simulation of pipe buckling for a short pipe the model length should be equal to the actual length of the research object for a long pipe the model length only needs to be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length the method for calculating the critical length can be greatly simplified by using the upper limit critical length calculation method moreover the difference in the results from these two methods is minor the upper limit critical length is applicable for calculating the model length of pipelines with different boundary conditions laying modes and multiple defect combinations 
23568,numerical simulation is an effective method to study the global buckling of submarine pipelines under high temperature and high pressure the length of the pipeline model has a significant effect on the global buckling during the numerical simulation this paper outlines the global buckling regularity of different pipes of various lengths and proposes a method to determine the pipe model length for the numerical simulation of pipe buckling by using theoretical analysis and the fea method a method of calculating the pipeline s critical length and upper limit critical length is proposed based on the characteristics of the short pipe and long pipe the numerical analysis results indicate that the global buckling amplitude of the short pipe increases with the length of the pipeline model therefore the model length of a short pipeline in the numerical simulation should be equal to the actual length of the research object in contrast the buckling amplitude of pipes with a length greater than the critical length does not vary with the pipe length thus the model length only needs to be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length a method to determine the length of the pipe model for the numerical simulation of pipe buckling is proposed for various pipelines with different laying modes in practical engineering keywords submarine pipeline pipeline global buckling fea method the critical length pipe model length 1 introduction submarine pipelines are widely used in the development of offshore oil and gas resources and they are increasingly required to operate under high temperatures and pressures which are prone to cause the global buckling deformation of pipelines scholars have performed a considerable amount of research on the global buckling of submarine pipelines as early as hobbs 1984 deduced the classical analytical solution for the vertical and lateral global buckling of an ideal submarine pipeline in taylor and gan 1986 derived an analytical solution to the global buckling of pipes with single arch and double arch geometric initial imperfection based on hobbs 1984 analytical solution the analytical solution can accurately reflect the global buckling mechanism in theory but can only be applied to the analysis of pipeline buckling for a small deformation as it presents many limitations in the study of post buckling with a large deformation in the non linear pipeline because a small slope angle and linear elasticity are assumed with the rapid development of computer technology in the past 40 years the finite element analysis fea method based on piplin iii plusone abp upbuck and abaqus finite element software has been applied to the global buckling of submarine pipelines the large scale commercial software abaqus 2008 has been most widely used many valuable calculation results have been obtained using this software several researchers have described the pipe buckling mechanism using the fea method based on abaqus such as miles and calladine 1999 bruton and carr 2005 klæbo and giertsensævik 2008 li 2011 and karampour et al 2013 numerical simulations based on the pipeline project of the gulf of mexico and the south china sea were carried out by jukes et al 2008 ramaiah and bong 2013 and carpenter 2015 several investigators sriskandarajah et al 2001 peek and yun 2009 jukes et al 2009 sun et al 2011 and liu et al 2014 have used many different methods to numerically simulate global buckling the static method the riks method and the dynamic method are the main methods used to study the global buckling of a subsea pipeline when using abaqus many results of fea study on the global buckling of subsea pipelines demonstrate that fea method is critical for the theoretical research and engineering guidance of pipeline accurately predicting the pipeline global buckling and its responses relies on the fea model being constructed correctly therefore a well developed fea model should incorporate the physical and mechanical parameters of the pipeline and subsoil as these parameters have a significant influence on the global buckling deformation the effects of various parameters on the numerical simulation of pipeline global buckling have been studied several researchers investigated the influence of a geometric initial imperfection on the buckling of a submarine pipeline when using the fea method sriskandarajah et al 1999 suzuki et al 2006 chaudhuri et al 2008 arjomandi and taheri 2009 hong et al 2015 bruton et al 2006 2008 2009 noted the significant effect of the pipe soil interaction on the numerical simulation of pipeline global buckling as it is the most uncertain parameter in pipeline design in haq et al 2013 analysed the influence of various parameters such as the ratio of the outside diameter and the wall thickness of the pipeline d t pipe out of straightness oos internal and external pressure lateral and axial friction operating temperature and installation depth on the numerical simulation of pipeline global buckling because an accurate simulation of pipeline global buckling relies on correct parameters many studies have focused on the parameters relevant to pipeline global buckling when using the fea method this article focuses on the impact of the pipe model length on the numerical simulation of pipeline buckling and proposes a method to determine the length of the pipeline model as few studies have systematically investigated this topic in christensen 2005 first proposed the concept of a short pipeline and noted that the result is conservative for short pipelines when using the hobbs equations for very long pipelines to assess the global buckling walker et al 2010 assessed the influence of the material properties friction coefficient and the virtual anchor spacing vas length on the axial strain of the buckling pipeline using the fea method based on abaqus he concluded that the pipeline buckling strain increases with the vas length by analysing the relationship between axial strain and vas length with different materials and under different friction coefficients the cases of short flowlines medium flowlines and unbounded pipe in pipe systems were presented by maoût et al 2011 as he holds the view that the infinite mode buckle shape does not accurately reflect the lateral buckling mechanism the buckling axial force of an unbounded pipe and medium and short flowlines was given and the expression of the axial force at the anchor was deduced an equation for the summation of the pipe buckling length and pipe sliding length was deduced by liu et al 2015 in 2016 using the energy method the derivation of the equations is illustrated through an example of a pipeline with a single arch initial imperfection undergoing third order global buckling these studies show that several researchers have investigated the effects of the pipeline length on the global buckling and found that pipeline buckling is quite sensitive to the pipeline length therefore it is critical to propose a method to determine the length of the pipe model for numerical simulations of pipe buckling this paper includes three main sections the first section provides the definitions of critical length long pipe and short pipe by analysing the law of the axial force distribution of the pipeline proposed by the classical analytical solution and establishes a method for calculating the critical length and upper limit critical length the second section focuses on the buckling regularity of the long pipe and short pipe by simulating several different pipeline models with various lengths based on the 3d explicit method the last section proposes a method to determine the length of the pipe model for the numerical simulation of pipe buckling and demonstrates how it can be used for pipelines with different laying modes 2 definitions of the critical length long pipe and short pipe the hobbs equation hobbs 1984 which has been used for years to evaluate the susceptibility of pipelines to global buckling assumes that the pipeline is infinitely long the deformation length of the pipe is assumed to be divided into two parts the buckling length l and sliding length l s as shown in fig 1 the axial force at the end of the sliding section to infinity is p 0 which is the axial pressure of the pipe in the fully constrained state at the design temperature the axial force of the pipe buckling section is p the infinite model introduced by hobbs is infeasible when using the fea method to study the global buckling of the pipeline the length of the pipe model can be determined by difference in the axial forces of buckling pipelines of different lengths next a pipe with two free ends and an initial imperfection in the middle is used as an example to analyse the relationship between the pipe length l m and axial force distribution three basic forms of pipe axial force are shown in fig 2 for the first basic form of the pipe axial force as shown in fig 2 a the pipe is sufficiently long the buckled pipe can be divided into four parts based on the axial force distribution the buckling section l slip section l s fully constrained section l d and free end of the axial force releasing section l c the maximum axial force p m equal to p 0 appears in the fully constrained section when the pipeline length decreases from sufficiently long the length of the fully constrained section l d decreases equivalently and the length of the other three sections does not change the pipe axial force becomes the second form when the length of the fully constrained section l d decreases to zero as shown in fig 2 b the buckled pipe can be divided into three parts the buckled section l slip section l s and free end axial force releasing section l c the maximum axial force p m is equal to p 0 when the pipe length is reduced further the lengths of the pipe buckling section l slip section l s and free end axial force releasing section l c decrease and l d is equal to zero as shown in fig 2 c the maximum axial force p m is less than p 0 from the analysis above the axial force form in fig 2 b characterized by l d 0 and p m p 0 is the critical form of the axial force distribution of pipelines with different lengths therefore this paper defines this length as the critical length denoted as l t a pipe with a length greater than the critical length is designated a long pipe and a pipe with a length less than the critical length is designated a short pipe the maximum axial force p m of the long pipe is equal to p 0 and appears at the end of l s e f which is defined as the anchor the distance between the two anchors is referred to as the anchor spacing the maximum axial force p m of the short pipe is less than p 0 and appears at the end of l s e f which is defined as the virtual anchor the distance between the two virtual anchors is referred to as the virtual anchor spacing 3 methods to determine the pipeline s critical length and upper limit critical length critical length is an important basis for assessing whether a pipeline is considered a long pipe or short pipe the method for determining the critical length is illustrated through an example of a single insulation pipe using both the analytical method and fea method the basic parameters of the pipeline tianyinghun 2007 are shown in table 1 the submerged weight per unit length of the pipe is 1233 74 n m when the weight of the pipe contents is considered the design temperature is 88 c higher than the environment and the design pressure was set at 4 65 mpa according to liu et al 2013 the equivalent temperature is 5 c when the internal pressure is 4 65 mpa thus the total temperature is 93 c higher than the environment when treating pressure as an effective temperature to simplify the calculation other detailed parameters of the model are provided in table 2 from the method of taylor and gan 1986 the imperfection deflection expression can be assumed as follows 1 v 0 x q φ l e i l 0 4 3 38 10 3 cos n 0 x 1 47 10 2 x l 0 2 6 98 10 3 if the initial imperfection amplitude is 1 m the initial defect morphology is as shown in fig 3 3 1 analytical method as shown in fig 2 b the critical length l t includes l l s and l c the sum of l and l s is equal to the anchor spacing denoted as l f l t can be expressed as the following equations 2 l t l f 2 l c 3 l c a e α t q a where a is the cross sectional area of the pipe e is the elastic modulus α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material t is the equivalent temperature q is the submerged weight per unit length and φ a is the axial friction coefficient between the pipe and soil l f is expressed as equation 4 which was derived by liu et al 2013 in 2016 using the energy method 4 l f 2 59 l 2 6 l 1 φ l φ a q φ l e i a i 3 6213 10 4 l 5 1 4556 10 4 l 0 l 2 l 0 5 1 2 1 where l is the wavelength of the large deformation along the positive direction of the y axis φ l is the lateral friction coefficient between the pipe and soil i is the moment of inertia l 0 is the wavelength of the initial geometric imperfections and the other parameters are as provided above equation 4 assumes that the pipeline with a single arch initial imperfection undergoes third order global buckling substituting the parameters in tables 1and 2 into equations 2 4 yields l f 5733 9 m l c 3029 8 m and l t 11793 5 m 3 2 fea method the 3d explicit method based on abaqus is considered to simulate the global buckling of the pipe model presented above and to determine its critical length accurately predicting the critical length relies on having an appropriate length in the fea model to select the appropriate length for the fea model a prefetch length ranges from 2 to 14 km at 2 km intervals pipe31 beam element and c3d8r solid elements are used to model the pipeline and foundation soil in the 3d fe model the mechanical behaviour of the pipeline is assumed to be linear elastic the material properties of the pipe include the pipe density elastic modulus poisson ratio and coefficient of thermal expansion the mohr coulomb model is used as the soil foundation constitutive model to simulate the stress strain relationship with these soil properties the material properties of the soil with no dilatancy include the density elastic modulus poisson s ratio cohesion and internal friction angle the soil boundary conditions are resistant both laterally and axially the bottom boundary of the soil is completely fixed both ends of the pipe are free the pipe s initial imperfection determined by equation 1 is imported by the cad model the steps of simulation are two one is to apply the gravity field so that the pipeline and the soil contact can behaviour the second is to increase the temperature of the pipeline to simulate the process of high temperature load until the pipeline occurs the global buckling the simulation results show that the ratio of the dynamic energy and the potential energy during the pipeline heating process is low as shown in fig 4 the lengths of l l s and l c in the long pipe are equal to the corresponding variables of the critical length equation l t l 2l s 2l c whereas l l s and l c of the short pipe have smaller values now define l mf l 2l s 2l c for the long pipe and l mf l 2l s 2l c for the short pipe the relationship between l mf and the pipe model length l m of the 2 km 14 km models is defined as shown in fig 5 the value of l mf increases as l m increases for the 2 km 10 km models whereas the l mf of the 12 km and 14 km models is a definite value therefore the 12 km model is used to analyse the critical length the axial stress along the pipe of the 12 km model is shown in fig 6 the midpoint of the initial imperfection is taken as the origin of the x axis the 12 km model belongs to the long pipe as the length of l d is larger than zero therefore the sum of l l s and l c in fig 6 is the critical length as shown in the figure l f 5720 m and l c 3030 m thus l t 11780 m from the above analysis l t 11793 5 m based on the analytical method and l t 11780 m based on the fea method the deviation of the two methods is extremely small 0 11 suggesting that equation 2 is reliable for calculating the critical length but the efficiency is low because it takes heavy effort to calculate l f in the formula which is complex and difficult to derive in addition the computational result depends on the pipe buckling form and equation 2 must be modified when the pipe does not exhibit third order global buckling therefore when the critical length is determined by the analytical method the ultimate buckling form of the pipeline must be accurately predicted otherwise large errors may occur 3 3 simplified analytical method for the upper limit critical length to overcome the two limitations of equation 2 the upper limit critical length equation is derived by analysing the axial force release process of the pipeline during buckling which simplifies the calculation of the critical length and makes the calculation applicable to the arbitrary buckling form the axial force release process during buckling is shown in fig 6 for a pipeline with two free ends and an initial imperfection in the middle fig 3 as the temperature rises from 0 c to 9 3 c and then 18 6 c the length of the axial force release at both ends of the pipe increases from 0 to l 1 and then to l 2 when the temperature reaches the design value the length of the pipe free end axial force releasing section reaches the maximum value l c and the corresponding axial force release is p 0 which is proportional to the length l c for the initial imperfection segment the axial force release occurs as the pipe begins to buckle when the axial force reaches the critical buckling force p the axial force release reaches the maximum value p 0 p when the temperature reaches the design value and the corresponding pipe length is l f 2 less than l c fig 6 shows that the magnitude of the buckling axial force p is approximately 7 of p 0 the length of the axial force release section l f 2 is equal to l c when the maximum axial force release due to buckling is assumed to be p 0 thus the critical length of the pipe is slightly larger than the actual critical length recorded as the upper limit critical length l tm the expression is as follows 5 l t m 4 l c substituting the parameters in tables 1 and 2 into equations 3 and 5 the upper limit critical length is obtained as l tm 12119 2 m l tm is 2 76 and 2 88 larger than the critical lengths calculated by equation 2 and the fea method respectively the disparities are less than 5 for a pipeline with two fixed ends and an initial imperfection in the middle fig 7 the upper limit critical length equation can also be deduced from the law of pipe axial pressure release when analysing the axial force release path of segment ac the axial force can only release through buckling from point c as the pipe end is completely fixed therefore there is no axial force release before the temperature rises to the value that causes the critical buckling load p the axial force release through the global buckling is p 0 p from the analysis above the upper limit critical length of segment ac is equal to l c thus when the length of segment ac is longer than l c the axial force release through the global buckling cannot extend to point a and no axial force is released at the pipe end ensuring that the maximum axial force p m is equal to p 0 because segment cb is symmetrical to segment ac l t m of the following model can be expressed as 6 l t m 2 l c for an asymmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and free ends fig 8 each segment should be assessed as a long tube or short tube because the lengths of the segments on both sides of the initial imperfection are unequal according to the aforementioned axial force release theory the maximum critical lengths of segments ac and cb are both 2l c therefore the maximum critical length of the pipe is given by segment ac l t m 2 l c 7 segment bc l t m 2 l c the boundary conditions and laying mode of the pipeline in actual engineering applications may be one of the aforementioned situations or a combination of a variety of conditions however the law of pipe axial pressure release due to global buckling is still correct and thus the derivation of the equation for the upper limit critical length is still applicable therefore a unified expression for the upper limit critical length is 8 l t m n l c from the above equation the upper limit critical length of the pipe is determined by n and l c the parameter n is determined by the boundary conditions and the laying mode of the pipeline and the parameter l c is determined mainly by the design temperature the friction between the pipe and soil foundation and the submerged weight per unit length of pipe l c is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the friction between the pipe and soil foundation and the submerged weight per unit length of pipe when the above parameters of the model change the upper limit critical length of pipe will change accordingly and the long tube and short tube can be converted to each other 4 determination of the model length for both the long pipe and short pipe five models with pipe lengths ranging from 6 to 14 km at 2 km intervals are used to simulate the global buckling to study the influence of the pipe length on global buckling and to study the law of the global buckling of the long tube and short tube the parameters of these models are shown in tables 1 and 2 and fig 3 the axial stress along the pipe models of different lengths when setting the origin of the x axis at the midpoint of the initial imperfection is shown in fig 9 a based on the above analysis the critical length is l t 11780 m therefore the 6 8 and 10 km models belong to the short pipe whereas the 12 and 14 km models belong to the long pipe fig 9 a shows that the short pipes have no fully constrained section and the pipe axial force varies significantly with the change in the pipe length l m in contrast all long pipes contain the fully constrained sections the anchor positions in the long pipes with different lengths are completely coincident on the x axis and the axial force curves of the 12 and 14 km models between the anchors are completely coincident to further analyse the relationship between the pipe length l m and its axial force the relationship between the pipe length and axial force p m of the virtual anchor as shown in fig 9 b is extracted according to the diagram in fig 9 a the axial force p m at the virtual anchors of the different short pipes with various lengths increases linearly with increases in the pipe length l m and increases to p 0 when the pipe length l m increases to the critical length by contrast the axial force p m of the anchors of the different long pipes with various lengths is the definite value p 0 fig 9 a also shows that the x coordinate values of the virtual anchors of the 6 8 and 10 km models are 1 42 1 92 and 2 42 km respectively for the 12 and 14 km models the x coordinates of the anchors are both equal to 2 86 km given the relationship between virtual anchor spacing and the pipe length l m fig 9 c the virtual anchor spacing increases linearly with increases in the pipe length l m and increases to l f as l m increases to the critical length the anchor spacing of different long pipes with various lengths is the definite value l f setting the origin of the x axis at the midpoint of the initial imperfection the lateral displacement amplitude is expressed by v and the maximum buckling amplitude is expressed by v m the lateral displacements of pipes with different lengths are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a shows that the buckling amplitudes of the short pipes increase as the pipe length l m ranges from 6 to 10 km however the lateral displacement curves of the 12 and 14 km models coincide completely fig 10 b shows that the maximum buckling amplitude of the pipe grows at a decreasing rate as the length of the model increases when the length of the model reaches the critical length the growth rate decreases to zero and the maximum buckling amplitude increases to a definite value therefore the critical length is not only the critical point of the pipeline axial force distribution change but also the critical point that the global buckling amplitude of pipes with different lengths will no longer increase with further increases in l m fig 11 shows the distribution of the axial strain ε along the buckling pipes with different lengths fig 11 shows that the axial strain curves of all long pipe and short pipe models are symmetrical about the initial imperfections the axial strain fluctuates considerably in the buckling section and the maximum values of both tensile and compressive strains appear in the buckling section the axial strain ε at the buckling section of different short pipes with various lengths increases with increases in the pipe length l m by contrast the axial strain curves at the buckling sections of different long pipes with various lengths coincide completely for the non buckling section the 6 8 and 10 km models all contain an extreme point on the positive x axis the corresponding x axis coordinates are 1 42 1 92 and 2 42 km respectively the axial strain at the virtual anchor of the short pipe models with different lengths increases with increases in the pipe length for long pipes both the 12 and 14 km models contain segments with no axial strain located near the end of the slip section the x coordinate of the end of the slip section is 2 86 km corresponding to the anchor positions of the long pipes in the free end axial force releasing section the axial strain curves on all pipes with different lengths are parallel and the axial strains at the end of pipes are equal the axial displacements along buckling pipelines of different lengths are shown in fig 12 fig 12 illustrates that the axial displacements of the short pipes at the virtual anchor and the long pipes in the fully constrained segment are zero the law for the axial displacement of the long and short pipes is summarized as the following two points the axial displacement graph of each model is symmetrical about the initial imperfection the axial displacement direction of the buckling and sliding sections is towards the initial imperfection whereas the axial displacement direction of the free end axial force releasing section deviates from the initial imperfection the axial displacement direction is denoted by arrows in the figure the difference in the axial displacement of the long and short pipes can be summarized as follows the axial displacement at the end of different short pipes increases with increases in the pipe length but the axial displacements at the end of the long pipes with different lengths are equal for short pipes the axial displacement between the two virtual anchors increases with increases in the pipe length however the axial displacement curves of long pipes with different lengths completely overlap between the two anchors the above analysis demonstrates that the global buckling law of a short pipe differs from that of a long pipe for the short pipe the buckling amplitude axial pressure axial displacement and axial strain vary with the pipe length when global buckling occurs however the buckling amplitude axial pressure axial displacement and axial strain of long pipes with various lengths are all equal between their anchors the 6 km short pipe model and 14 km long pipe model were selected for a comparative analysis to study the cause of the significant difference between the long and short pipe buckling results fig 13 shows the axial strain axial displacement and axial pressure of the 6 and 14 km models fig 13 a shows that the maximum axial force extreme axial strain and critical axial displacement appear at the same point in the pipeline which has no axial displacement but has axial force release and axial strain therefore the point is considered a virtual anchor the distance between the virtual anchors in different short pipes of various lengths is unequal and thus the axial force p m and the axial strain ε are unequal this inequality causes the difference between the buckling amplitude and stress of short pipes with various lengths fig 13 b shows that the constant axial force section axial strain free section and non axial displacement section appear at the same position of the pipe which has no axial force release no axial strain and no axial displacement therefore the pipe segment is completely restrained the end of the slip section that is the start of the segment noted above is considered an anchor the distance between the anchors in long pipes of various lengths is equal and the axial force p m and axial strain ε are also equal therefore the buckling amplitude and stress of long pipes with various lengths are identical the pipeline length l m is determined by the following two factors in the simulation of the pipeline buckling the actual situation of the pipe should be simulated to the extent possible that is using the real pipe length to simulate the global buckling however an excessively long pipe model may lead to non convergence of the calculation due to the limitation of the finite element software itself furthermore the computing costs should be considered when considering the length of the pipe model used to simulate the global buckling therefore when the fea method is used to study the global buckling of submarine pipelines one must first assess whether the object is a long pipe or short pipe if it is a short pipe the pipeline model length should be equal to the actual length of the research object if it is a long pipe the model length should be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length considering the difficulty of calculating the critical length we recommended using the upper limit critical length to determine the pipe model length the specific steps are as follows the parameters n and l c of the upper limit critical length nl c are determined by analysing the pipeline boundary conditions the length of the research object should then be compared with nl c if the research object is larger than nl c it is a long pipe in this case the pipe model length l m only needs to be equal to or slightly larger than nl c another case is that the object is a short pipe or a long pipe with a very short fully constrained segment because its length is shorter than nl c therefore the actual length of the research object should be taken as the pipe model length thus the global buckling of the object can be simulated accurately the drawback of this approach is that the pipe model length determined by nl c may be larger than that calculated by the critical length when it is a long pipe with a short fully constrained segment the largest waste of computing costs is the difference between nl c and l t the third quarter analysis indicated that the difference does not exceed 5 the flowchart for determining the pipeline model length in the numerical simulation of pipe buckling is shown in fig 14 5 engineering application the boundary conditions and laying modes of pipelines include free ends fixed ends symmetrical models and asymmetrical models pipeline engineering may consider one of the situations above or a combination of a variety of conditions the application of the method for determining the pipe model length will be presented by analysing the three basic pipe laying modes highlighted above 1 for a symmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and free ends fig 3 the fourth chapter of the application of the method for determining the pipe model lengths is applicable 2 for a symmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and fixed ends fig 15 the upper limit critical length l tm 2l c from equation 6 and is equal to 60539 6 m when equation 3 is introduced into equation 6 this value is considerably smaller than the actual length of 20 km in fig 15 therefore the subject is a long pipe and the pipe model length for the fea should be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length considering the convenience factor this model length is set at 7 km the axial pressure and horizontal displacement of the 7 km pipe are extracted with the midpoint of the initial defect as the x axis origin to compare it with the result of the 14 km pipe with free ends the axial force and horizontal displacement diagrams of the 7 and 14 km models are shown in fig 16 fig 16 a shows that the curve of the axial force along the 7 km model contains a fully constrained segment indicating that it is a long pipe and the 7 km length of the pipe model reasonably reflects the buckling regularity and can reduce the calculation cost compared to the full length model fig 16 a and b shows that the axial force and horizontal displacement curves of the 7 and 14 km models coincide completely indicating that the buckling results in the 7 km pipe with fixed ends and the 14 km pipe with free ends are identical therefore when the finite element method is used to study the global buckling of the submarine pipeline the cost can be reduced by adding a fixed constraint to the pipe end 3 for an asymmetrical pipeline with initial imperfections and free ends fig 17 the upper limit critical length l tm is determined by equation 7 which is expressed as l tm 2l c for segments ac and bc the upper limit critical length l tm is equal to 60539 6 m when equation 3 is introduced into equation 7 segment ac is a long pipe because its 15 km length is longer than 60539 6 m therefore the pipe model length for the fea can be equal to or slightly longer than l tm the length of the ac segment pipeline is considered to be 7 km for convenience segment bc is a short pipe or a long pipe with a short fully constrained segment because its 3 km length is shorter than 60539 6 m therefore the actual length of 3 km is taken as the length of the bc segment pipe as shown in fig 18 the axial pressure and horizontal displacement of the pipe are extracted with the midpoint of the initial imperfection as the x axis origin segment ac is a long pipe because its axial force curve contains a fully constrained segment and segment bc is a short pipe because its axial force curve contains a virtual anchor indicating that the length of the pipe model is selected correctly as shown in fig 18 b the horizontal displacement curve of the pipe is extracted and compared to the horizontal displacements of the aforementioned 14 and 6 km symmetrical pipe models at a distance from the x axis origin the horizontal displacement curve of the ac segment pipe and the 14 km pipe model coincide with each other and the horizontal displacement curve of the bc segment pipe coincides with the 6 km pipe model showing that the buckling law of the long or short pipe is applicable to the asymmetrical pipe segment with assessing a long or short pipe in a certain range near the x axis origin the horizontal displacement amplitude of this model is between the 14 and 6 km models which indicates that the buckling of this segment of the asymmetrical pipe is a combination of the left and right pipes 6 conclusions based on the analysis of the buckling behaviour of different length pipes this paper proposes the method of calculating the critical length l t and upper limit critical length l tm and establishes a method of determining the length of the pipeline with different laying modes during global buckling simulated by the fea method under the regularity of the global buckling of long and short pipes the conclusions are as follows 1 from the distribution law of the pipeline axial force given by the classical analytical solution the length of the pipeline characterized by l d 0 and p m p 0 is defined as the critical length the critical length is related to the pipe operating temperature pipe soil friction coefficient unit weight and boundary conditions of the pipe the equations for the critical length and upper limit critical length of the pipeline are established 2 in the numerical analysis the length of the pipe model has a significant effect on the global buckling deformation the buckling amplitude and axial force of different short pipes change with changes in the pipe length l m when global buckling occurs in contrast the buckling amplitude and axial force of long pipes do not change with variations in the pipe length 3 the critical length is the criterion for assessing whether a pipe is a long or short pipe it is also an important basis for determining the length of the model in the numerical simulation of pipe buckling for a short pipe the model length should be equal to the actual length of the research object for a long pipe the model length only needs to be equal to or slightly larger than the critical length the method for calculating the critical length can be greatly simplified by using the upper limit critical length calculation method moreover the difference in the results from these two methods is minor the upper limit critical length is applicable for calculating the model length of pipelines with different boundary conditions laying modes and multiple defect combinations 
23569,this paper focuses on the application of low cost sensors for autonomous underwater vehicle auv we propose an intelligent assistance positioning methodology by combining the modified incremental smoothing and mapping isam and constrained optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm for low cost sensors which makes full use of gps data and produce a variety of correction models compared to relinearizing and variable reordering by period batch step in the original isam modified isam is implemented variable reordering alone and conducted adaptive relinearization when the value of local chi square exceeded a certain threshold meanwhile a novel constrained op elm is presented by mapping the output to the constraint space which provides full guarantee for generating reliable correction model when gps is valid the constrained op elm is applied to the low cost sensors to generate correction model simultaneous the correction model of measurement for modified isam is also given by this way once gps becomes invalid the correction models are used to amend the low cost sensors data and measurement model for getting more accurate location information experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional algorithm which rmse can improve by at most 83 8 than extended kalman filter s ekf keywords auv low cost sensors op elm isam sensors correction model 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an indispensable instrument for using in the complex underwater environment such as the ocean survey due to its flexibility and autonomy although gps is used as a significant sensor in unmanned vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles uav it is limited or even unusable for auv however simultaneous localization and mapping slam bailey and durrant whyte 2006 cheeseman et al 1987 durrant whyte and bailey 2006 leonard et al 1992 thrun 2002 can create a consistent map in real time and can acquire estimated position information simultaneously even under water therefore slam which can provide feasible solution for the realization of autonomous navigation has received considerable attention for mobile robot in unknown environment bonin font et al 2015 chen and guo 2014 lee et al 2012 newman and leonard 2003 newman et al 2005 ribas et al 2006 wen et al 2015 simultaneous localization and mapping slam also plays an important role in autonomous navigation for auv extended kalman filter ekf bonnabel and slotine 2015 kalman 1960 is a classical method because the theory of this algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement however the main problem of ekf is the existence of accumulated error which is generated in linearization processing subsequently to improve the drawback of ekf slam many algorithms such as particle filter pf liu and chen 1998 and unscented kalman filter ukf kitagawa 1996 were proposed these algorithms still have a certain negative effect the increased computational complexity or the loss of computational stability are the problems which these algorithms are facing with furthermore sparse extended information filters seif thrun et al 2004 gets the approximation map of environment in fixed time step and suffers from poorly consequence when confronts with a closed loop incremental smoothing and mapping isam kaess et al 2008 which focuses on improving the accumulated errors was proposed by michael kaess in 2008 while filtering may bring unbounded accumulated errors by marginalizing previous pose isam recovers the complete trajectory and the map to avoid the problem in non linear system isam adopt periodic variable reordering together with relinearization isam 2 kaess et al 2011 was proposed according this principle by using the bayes tree to perform the process of relinearization and variable reordering in where it is needed however no matter what kind of slam algorithm koch et al 2017 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in practical slam applications high quality sensors and accurate measurement model are more beneficial to improve the navigation performance however the high cost of high quality sensors impede the widely research on auv furthermore the complex process to determine the measurement model not only costs a lot of manpower and resources but also has very poor versatility once the sensor in auv is replaced or the position of sensors changes the accurate measurement model has to readjust accordingly it greatly delays the development time of auv compared to high quality sensors the low cost sensors are cheap but has the characteristics of low accuracy since the sensor data has a crucial impact on the navigation for auv how to deal with the data of low cost sensors is the key process for using them by slam for auv meanwhile how to quickly and efficiently build the accurate measurement model are also important to the proper usage of slam since the valid gps signal can provide more accurate track than low cost sensors during the last few years the vast majority of algorithms devote to integrate gps and low cost sensors using artificial neural network ann demuth et al 2014 semeniuk and noureldin 2006 sharaf and noureldin 2007 sharaf et al 2005 however these algorithms are mostly applicable to vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles when referred to auv which can only receive little or no valid gps signals few work is reported the classical ann algorithms include least squares support vector machine ls svm ghaedi et al 2014 suykens et al 2002 yang et al 2002 random forest regression rfr liaw and wiener 2002 lindner et al 2015 radial basis function rbf lei and li 2013 sharaf and noureldin 2007 and so on usually according to whether the gps is effective or not there are two different modes of operation learning mode and prediction mode however the input which exceeds the range of learning mode will affect the prediction accuracy xu et al 2016 in 2004 huang huang et al 2004 2006 wan et al 2014 proposed extreme learning machine elm which outperforms traditional algorithm not only in speed but also in generalization performance based on the original elm algorithm optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm is presented to make it more robust and generic similä and tikka 2005 it can be used to provide a better guarantee for the application of auv in practice in this paper we have proposed an intelligent assistance positioning methodology which combines modified isam and constrained op elm we perform variable reordering alone and conduct adaptive relinearization for isam when the value of local chi square exceeds a certain threshold without operating bayes tree simultaneously a constrained op elm is proposed to generate correction model for low cost sensor data while the accurate measurement model is also given by the constrained op elm by combining the corrected model with modified isam the more accurate position of auv will be offered the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the overview of proposed intelligent assistance positioning methodology the principle of the modified isam and the constrained op elm are introduced in section 3 in section 4 experiments with different datasets will be carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm finally we draw the main conclusions of this work 2 overview of proposed intelligent assistance position methodology traditionally when auv sails on the surface of the water gps receiver which is located in auv receives signal from the satellite at this time gps data is valid and can provide accurate position information for auv although other sensors such as ahrs or dvl also keep working during this process the position calculated by these sensors usually may not be used or may be used only when gps outages happens due to the low accuracy of the sensors on the other hand in addition to providing a more accurate initial values gps data has no effect to calculate underwater auv position which become invalid in this circumstance so it is significant to make a compromise between the inadequate usage of data and performance improvement of low cost sensor in this paper a novel intelligent assistance positioning methodology based on modified isam and constrained op elm for auv is proposed to correct low cost sensor data and get accurate measurement correction model the whole propose intelligent assistance positioning methodology is illustrated in fig 1 by inputting the sensors data such as ahrs or dvl into constrained op elm we get the corresponding correction model of low cost sensor then the sensor information is considered to be compensated by combining sensors data with correction model as the direct nonlinear relationship between the output value and the true value is obtained by the correction model the correction model in some sense is the mapping of all errors and noises on output in other words sensor data corrected by correction model is thought to have eliminated the interference of other factors when the corrected data is sent into modified isam the trajectory should have been equivalent close to the real track however there is still difference between the trajectory which is generated by modified isam and the real one we suppose that the reason for this situation is caused by inprecise measurement model hence similar to sensors the measurement model is obtained by correction of constrained op elm once auv sneaks into the water the gps becomes invalid immediately and the learning process of correction models is over angle correction model would be used to correct the ahrs angle as an auxiliary input simultaneously the dvl data would also be corrected by the velocity correction model after dealing with the corrected sensors data the modified isam can estimate the rough position of auv at last the rough position is processed by the measurement correction model and more accurate position information can be achieved even when the system suffers from invalid of gps 3 the principle of the modified isam and the constrained op elm 3 1 review of modified isam in the process of practical application slam problems are usually faced with nonlinear measurement function instead of linear measurement function it is essential to linearize the nonlinear measurement function in a reasonable and timely way however it is not necessary to perform relinearization step by step because the measurement is typically fairly accurate on a local scale therefore kaess performed relinearization with periodic variable reordering in a constant interval steps kaess et al 2008 though periodic relinearization can achieve linearization processing it executes linearizaiton just according to steps moreover periodic relinearization neglects whether the linearization need to be performed or not at the current linearization point the circumstance usually occurs when auv carry out tasks with a simple linear trajectory which will lead to more computing time compared with isam kaess proposed incremental smoothing and mapping using the bayes tree isam2 in 2011 which performs fluid relinearization kaess et al 2011 similarly the proposed modified isam own the same principle with isam2 to achieve flexible linearization but use a more compact and practical way for auv in a mission the error is acceptable if it is in the accuracy requirement this is our basis of executing the linearization in practical application chi square error describes similarity between the current estimation with the direct observation the modified isam algorithm with flexible relinearization takes advantage of the chi square error which compares with a threshold to decide when linearization is implemented the modified isam is shown as follow in algorithm 1 the threshold β is determined by two parameters the maximum error of navigation and the closed loop number 3 2 constrained op elm op elm is presented as a more robust methodology which is based on the original elm algorithm elm was proposed by huang and the main novelty introduced by the elm is randomly selecting the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes instead of learning these parameters the output of signal hidden layer feed forward neural networks slfns with n hidden nodes can be presented as follow 1 f n x i 1 n β i g ω i b i x x r n ω i r n β r n where g ω i b i x is the ith output of hidden layer neurons corresponding to the input β β i 1 β i 2 β i m t represents the connecting link between the ith hidden layer neurons and weight vector of output neurons for n arbitrary input sample where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n r n and t i t i 1 t i 2 t i n r n given n hidden layer neurons and activation function g ω i b i x β i ω i and b i can be found out to make slfns close to the n samples with zero error 2 j 1 n β j g ω j b j x i t i i 1 2 n to simplify the above equation 2 can be written equivalently as 3 h β t h ω 1 ω n b i b n x 1 x n g ω 1 b 1 x 1 g ω n b n x 1 g ω 1 b 1 x n g ω n b n x n n n 4 β β 1 t β n t n m t t t 1 t t n t n m t in formula 4 h is the hidden output matrix of the neural network the ith column of h is the ith output of hidden layer neurons corresponding to inputs the training process of slfns is equivalent to find the least squares solution of linear system h β t it has been proved that the global optimal output weights can be written as 5 β ˆ h r where h is moore penrose inverse matrix of the hidden layer output matrix h to remove the useless neurons of the hidden layer op elm ranks the best neurons by multi response sparse regression mrsr as an extension of least angle regression lars mrsr provides a ranking of the kernels finally the leave one out loo validation method was used to select the actual best number of neurons the most specific details of the mrsr algorithm and loo algorithm can be found from two reported papers similä and tikka 2005 vehtari et al 2016 respectively although there are some deviations between the low cost sensor data and real data which is provided by gps the error is limited by the accuracy and cannot be arbitrary according to this principle we constrained the output of op elm using the low cost sensors precision by mapping the output to the constraint space in other word the output of op elm is constrained by the maximum error of the corresponding sensor the flow chart of constrained op elm is shown in fig 2 experimental results and analysis show that the constrained op elm can get a better correction model for auv than the original op elm the experimental analysis and results will be described in detail in section 4 3 3 the selection of input for intelligent assistance positioning methodology for intelligent assistance positioning methodology the selection of input for correction model is essential the correct input has a positive effect on generating the precise correction model for sensors while the incorrect input is not only harmful to constitute correction model but also increase the computational complexity for the proposed methodology the only input for correction model of measurement is the rough position of auv which is calculated by modified isam therefore we merely discuss the input of the angle and velocity correction models since the heading data has the greatest influence on navigation in two dimensional plane and in order to avoid the interaction of too many variables we choose heading data as the representative of the angle 3 3 1 the selection of input for correction model of heading ahrs consists of gyroscope and accelerometer and the measurement error of gyroscope mainly results from four aspects fixed deviation deviation related to acceleration error of scale factor and mutual coupling error the fixed deviation is equal to the output when there is no input the causes of this deviation contains mechanical coupling errors residual stress in the framework of the sensor and the gradient effects of temperature this error is independent to the various motion states of the gyroscope the deviation is related to acceleration it represents an output which is proportional to acceleration amplitude that the gyroscope is forced it is caused by mismatching between the barycenter and core of vibration components the scale factor usually refers to the ratio relationship between input and output thus the error is proportional to the input value it results from the nonlinear or asymmetry of scale factor mutual coupling error is the output which results from the input of insensitive axis in the situation that no input of sensitive axis the error is related to the shape of the vibration components moreover it may also generate by installation errors in fact the impact of the error sources to the output also include non equal elasticity error and orthogonal elastic deformation error these factors can be ignored since the accuracy of gyro is not high and these values are relatively smaller based on the above analysis we use the following error model of gyro 6 δ ω z b b g a x a y a z s ω z m y ω y m x ω x where b is a fixed deviation term b g represents the coefficient of acceleration related error s is the scale factor m x m y are the coefficients which is related to the mutual coupling error a x a y a z are the acceleration inputs along the sensitive axis ω x ω y ω z are angular inputs in the direction of the sensitive axis the corresponding error of heading angle can be given by the integral type of the above formula 7 δ h w z d t b t b g v x v y v z s h m y p m x r v x v y v z are the velocity inputs along the sensitive axis h p r are angle inputs along the sensitive axis in general according to the experimental calibration we can determine the coefficient for each type of error to compensate for the impact of various types of errors however since this process is too cumbersome and time consuming we used the variables as a network input to learn the corresponding error parameters through the machine learning network according to the above equation we choose v x v y v z h p r as the inputs of heading angle error 3 3 2 the selection of input for correction model of velocity dvl uses the doppler effect of sound waves to measure ship speed the main factors which influence the precision of velocity measurement in doppler system include the error caused by the instability of auv motion state which results from sea stormy waves and surges the error caused by sound velocity variation and the error caused by beam widening etc in this paper we mainly focus on the errors caused by the instability of auv motion when the auv is running it is affected by sea waves and surges as a result the fluctuation and sway of the auv will lead to the unsteadiness of the beam inclination which will make the measurement error increase and the accuracy decrease in fact all the movement of auv can be divided into yaw roll trim and translational when the auv does not swing and fluctuate the doppler frequency is shown as follow 8 f d 1 2 v x c f o c o s α 9 f d 2 2 v x c f o c o s α if the pitch of the auv is δ α and the vertical velocity v z is not equal to 0 the doppler shift measured by the heading beam is as follow 10 f d 1 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o c o s θ 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o s i n α δ α and the doppler frequency shift measured by the stern beam is as equation 11 11 f d 2 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o c o s θ 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o s i n α δ α meanwhile the difference of beam frequency is 12 f d f d 1 f d 2 4 v x c f o c o s α c o s δ α v z v x s i n δ α when δ α 0 v x 0 the doppler frequency error is 13 δ δ f d f d f d f d f d c o s δ α v z v x s i n δ α 1 if v z is 0 there is only pitch and no up down motion then 14 δ f d f d c o s δ α 1 when δ α is 5 the error is about 0 3 when δ α is 10 the error is up to 1 5 in general the pitch roll and up down fluctuations play a major role in the speed error in order to reduce the error caused by the auv motion the dvl velocity is compensated by auv attitude angle based on the above analysis therefore we select the v x r p as the speed error model inputs 3 4 the selection of the type of kernel and the number of neurons take the heading data as an example we explain the selection of kernel type and neurons number in this section the type of kernels mainly includes linear kernel l sigmoid kernel s and gaussian kernel g l g represents the combination of linear kernel and gassuian kernel while l s g represents the combination of linear kernel sigmoid kernel and gassuian kernel miche et al 2008 different kernel structure of op elm are shown in table 1 we assume that the type of kernels in constrained op elm for the same auv under same condition is consistent and this is the premise of selection for kernel during the process of kernels selection we focus on the time consumption and accuracy of different kernels in fig 3 the time consumption of different neurons number with different kernel is presented which covers the training time and testing time and the values in fig 3 are the average of ten values which were gotten from the same condition in general as the number of neurons increases the time consumption will also increase it is because too much neurons in the same kernels are involved in the calculation it seems that the less neurons are chosen the better timeliness the algorithm spends however we can see the rmse of corrected heading using l or s kernel is less effective than that of ahrs heading which is illustrated in fig 4 so we draw a conclusion that the l and s kernel is not suitable for generating the correction model of heading although they cost less time more neurons in different modes will no longer be considered because they have a higher requirement for system configuration so in order to select the type of kernel more reasonably we defined the cost function κ as follow 15 κ k e r i i 1 n 1 ε t k e r i j ε e r r o r k e r i j where k e r i represents the ith type of kernel t k e r i j is the time which constrained op elm uses kernel ith with different neurons for intelligent assistance positioning methodology and e r r o r k e r i j is the root mean square error corresponding to t k e r i j ε is the weight factor as shown in fig 5 the constrained op elm with kernel l s g g and l g has obvious advantages than directly using data of low cost sensor among them the constrained op elm using kernel l g has the lowest cost value and becomes the optimal choice for the kernel in similarity the chosen of number of neurons is also determined by defining a cost function θ as follow 16 θ k e r i 1 η t k e r i η e r r o r k e r i where t k e r i is the time consumption which constrained op elm use kernel ith and e r r o r k e r i is the corresponding root mean square error η is the weight factor ε and η are set to 0 5 in this paper in fig 6 with the increasing of the neurons number the general trend of the value of cost function decreases the model of angles become more complicated while the angle become closer to the real value in the actual system the number of neurons would not increase without limitation because of microprocessor performance therefore the number of neurons is set to be 70 3 5 performance evaluation the performance of the intelligent assistance positioning methodology is evaluated by the root mean square error rmse the corresponding formula of rmse is defined as equation 17 e t r a c k i 1 n y ˆ i t r a c k y i t r a c k t r u e n where e t r a c k is the value of rmse for the intelligent assistance positioning methodology y ˆ i t r a c k represents the vector of estimated state which is produced by the proposed intelligent fusion module while y i t r a c k t r u e is the ground truth of the state vector and n stands for the dimension of y 4 evaluation of intelligent assistance position methodology 4 1 experiment platform for intelligent assistance positioning methodology the datasets used in this paper were collected by sailfish auv the specifications of the auv are displayed in table 2 in sailfish auv the capacity of microprocessor is 32 g which loaded a 120 g hard disk and the ram of microprocessor is 4 g the intelligent position algorithm runs correctly in real time applications on this hardware platform the specifications of low cost sensors are shown in support material 4 2 performance comparison of isam and modified isam 4 2 1 verification of modified isam with simulated datasets in order to evaluate the performance of modified isam a series of experiments are illustrated to validate the proposed approach our evaluations were performed respectively on five standard simulated datasets sphere400 kaess et al 2011 sphere2500 kaess et al 2012 manhattanolson olson et al 2006 city10k kaess et al 2011 and trous10000 kaess et al 2012 and one real world datasets intel dataset kaess et al 2012 the length of dataset is listed in table 3 these standard datasets are general datasets which length has not been changed the experimental results are shown as fig 7 in fact instead of the response time for once we calculate the total running time of steps which is more reasonable for evaluation the performance of the algorithm in fig 7 it seems that the original isam performs different for example the total running time of dataset trous10000 is about seven times than that of dataset city10k with the same data length however it does not mean that the original isam algorithms is not suitable for dataset trous10000 the difference between dataset trous10000 and dataset city10k in running time is due to the number of closed loops and environmental features therefore the response time in different conditions with different closed loops is not comparable in addition isam algorithm recovers the complete robot trajectory and map to avoid unbounded errors for large scale problems the jacobian matrices a of isam would expand with the extension of time the later process of relinearization would cost more time than former relinearization process so kaess compared the total running time rather than response time for different datasets kaess et al 2011 lastly single response time for slam algorithm is not exactly the same and the long term efficiency and stability of slam is more important than the short term s for the navigation of robot this avoids the situation of system crash which results from long time running although it has a quick instantaneous efficiency therefore we only need to compare the performance of proposed method with that of the original isam in the same datasets in total the modified isam has obviously advantage than isam in effectiveness in this fig 7 the former two groups of data are three dimension while the latter ones are based on two dimensional plane for the two dimensional data the range of efficiency for modified isam is from 1 7 to 13 9 furthermore with regard to three dimensional data the time consuming of modified isam is 39 less than that of isam experimental results verified that the modified isam is more favorable for complex environment application 4 2 2 verification of modified isam with sea trial datasets we have conducted a series of experiments at yellow sea fig 8 as the ground truth gps is used as evaluation criterion for other algorithms in each loop the angle data and velocity data is sent into modified isam and the constrained op elm methods in real time applications the min input data is data collected by ahrs 100 and dvl in 1 10 s which is consistent with data collecting frequency of the sensors performance on each dataset are shown in fig 9 since the accumulated error of ekf increases with time the accuracy of trajectory which is generated by ekf decreases with time however by recovering the complete trajectory and the map isam significant avoid the problem of accumulated error and have achieved better results it is worth to be noted that in two datasets the trajectory implemented modified isam is almost completely coincident with that of isam which also fits the gps trajectory better it means that the modified isam has comparable accuracy with isam however modified isam has advantage than isam in the aspect of running time fig 10 which efficiency can be increased by 18 9 or even 25 2 the length of dataset for fig 10 is listed in table 4 basing on the above analysis we can come to a conclusion that modified isam significantly outperformed the original isam in terms of efficiency on the premise of no loss of accuracy all the experimental results presented above convincingly demonstrate that modified isam is appropriate to be adopted as a method of slam estimation to put into applications widely such as using for auv although both are important components of intelligent positioning methodology the performance of modified isam and constrained op elm are completely different in terms of time consumption unlike filtering algorithm which compute only the current pose of the robot and are not suitable for most real world problems isam recovers the complete robot trajectory and map in order to avoid accumulated errors therefore time which is cost by relinearization process of isam increases over time however time spent by constrained op elm would not change with time since op elm takes less than one percent of isam s time it can also be ignored the running time of proposed method is approximately equal to the time of running modified isam algorithm therefore the time consumption of isam shown in fig 10 can be considered as the running time of intelligent positioning methodology 4 3 performance comparison of correction model using op elm and constrained op elm to evaluate the superior performance of our new algorithm versus the state of the art op elm we analyze the two methods in terms of accuracy we use gps heading and velocity as the ground truth according to fig 11 a sensors data were sent into op elm and constrained op elm respectively to generate corresponding correction model when the heading correction model is gotten it would be used to correct or compensate the ahrs angle although the gps is invalid in fig 11 the trajectories corresponding to different heading correction model or not are shown it is illustrated that the other angle is less effective than the angle which uses heading correction model generated by constrained op elm it also consistent with our previous analysis theoretically when it does not exist sudden change in velocity there is also no obvious difference between constrained op elm and op elm as shown in fig 12 the velocity deviation of op elm and that of op elm is almost the same their accuracy values are still better than ekf s when refers to the measurement correction model it is obtained in the same way by learning the gps position data and the estimated position with constrained op elm as there is no sudden jump in the location information so constrained op elm coincides with op elm similar to correction model of velocity the trajectory corrected by measurement correction model which is produced by constrained op elm is closer to the gps trajectory than trajectory without using measurement correction model the experimental results are shown as fig 13 and this process will not be elaborated 4 4 performance comparison of intelligent assistance positioning methodology and traditional algorithm the sensors date corrected by constrained op elm are inputted into modified isam algorithm the modified isam estimates the corrected sensors data and give a rough estimate for auv combined with the measurement correction model finally we get a more accurate position as illustrated in fig 14 the trajectory using modified isam combined with constrained op elm is the closest to the real trajectory due to the uncertain nonlinear drift of low cost sensors the error of trajectory continues to accumulate with the increasing of time for ekf algorithm however even in the same circumstances the modified isam using constrained op elm can make full use of correction model and achieve good positioning result the rmse corresponding to different algorithm is shown in fig 15 the rmse of proposed methodology is improved by 63 9 and 83 8 than ekf respectively 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed an intelligent assistance positioning methodology to improve the navigation accuracy for auv firstly we have used a series of experiments to illustrate the validation of modified isam and its efficiency increased by at least 18 than original isam then the correction models are generated by constrained op elm which is demonstrated to be better than op elm in terms of accuracy lastly the performance comparison of intelligent assistance positioning methodology and traditional algorithm is provided compared to the direct using of low cost sensors data to execute ekf algorithm the proposed method exhibits better accuracy in the complex conditions which rmse can improved by more than 60 than ekf the experimental results verify the

23569,this paper focuses on the application of low cost sensors for autonomous underwater vehicle auv we propose an intelligent assistance positioning methodology by combining the modified incremental smoothing and mapping isam and constrained optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm for low cost sensors which makes full use of gps data and produce a variety of correction models compared to relinearizing and variable reordering by period batch step in the original isam modified isam is implemented variable reordering alone and conducted adaptive relinearization when the value of local chi square exceeded a certain threshold meanwhile a novel constrained op elm is presented by mapping the output to the constraint space which provides full guarantee for generating reliable correction model when gps is valid the constrained op elm is applied to the low cost sensors to generate correction model simultaneous the correction model of measurement for modified isam is also given by this way once gps becomes invalid the correction models are used to amend the low cost sensors data and measurement model for getting more accurate location information experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional algorithm which rmse can improve by at most 83 8 than extended kalman filter s ekf keywords auv low cost sensors op elm isam sensors correction model 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an indispensable instrument for using in the complex underwater environment such as the ocean survey due to its flexibility and autonomy although gps is used as a significant sensor in unmanned vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles uav it is limited or even unusable for auv however simultaneous localization and mapping slam bailey and durrant whyte 2006 cheeseman et al 1987 durrant whyte and bailey 2006 leonard et al 1992 thrun 2002 can create a consistent map in real time and can acquire estimated position information simultaneously even under water therefore slam which can provide feasible solution for the realization of autonomous navigation has received considerable attention for mobile robot in unknown environment bonin font et al 2015 chen and guo 2014 lee et al 2012 newman and leonard 2003 newman et al 2005 ribas et al 2006 wen et al 2015 simultaneous localization and mapping slam also plays an important role in autonomous navigation for auv extended kalman filter ekf bonnabel and slotine 2015 kalman 1960 is a classical method because the theory of this algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement however the main problem of ekf is the existence of accumulated error which is generated in linearization processing subsequently to improve the drawback of ekf slam many algorithms such as particle filter pf liu and chen 1998 and unscented kalman filter ukf kitagawa 1996 were proposed these algorithms still have a certain negative effect the increased computational complexity or the loss of computational stability are the problems which these algorithms are facing with furthermore sparse extended information filters seif thrun et al 2004 gets the approximation map of environment in fixed time step and suffers from poorly consequence when confronts with a closed loop incremental smoothing and mapping isam kaess et al 2008 which focuses on improving the accumulated errors was proposed by michael kaess in 2008 while filtering may bring unbounded accumulated errors by marginalizing previous pose isam recovers the complete trajectory and the map to avoid the problem in non linear system isam adopt periodic variable reordering together with relinearization isam 2 kaess et al 2011 was proposed according this principle by using the bayes tree to perform the process of relinearization and variable reordering in where it is needed however no matter what kind of slam algorithm koch et al 2017 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in practical slam applications high quality sensors and accurate measurement model are more beneficial to improve the navigation performance however the high cost of high quality sensors impede the widely research on auv furthermore the complex process to determine the measurement model not only costs a lot of manpower and resources but also has very poor versatility once the sensor in auv is replaced or the position of sensors changes the accurate measurement model has to readjust accordingly it greatly delays the development time of auv compared to high quality sensors the low cost sensors are cheap but has the characteristics of low accuracy since the sensor data has a crucial impact on the navigation for auv how to deal with the data of low cost sensors is the key process for using them by slam for auv meanwhile how to quickly and efficiently build the accurate measurement model are also important to the proper usage of slam since the valid gps signal can provide more accurate track than low cost sensors during the last few years the vast majority of algorithms devote to integrate gps and low cost sensors using artificial neural network ann demuth et al 2014 semeniuk and noureldin 2006 sharaf and noureldin 2007 sharaf et al 2005 however these algorithms are mostly applicable to vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles when referred to auv which can only receive little or no valid gps signals few work is reported the classical ann algorithms include least squares support vector machine ls svm ghaedi et al 2014 suykens et al 2002 yang et al 2002 random forest regression rfr liaw and wiener 2002 lindner et al 2015 radial basis function rbf lei and li 2013 sharaf and noureldin 2007 and so on usually according to whether the gps is effective or not there are two different modes of operation learning mode and prediction mode however the input which exceeds the range of learning mode will affect the prediction accuracy xu et al 2016 in 2004 huang huang et al 2004 2006 wan et al 2014 proposed extreme learning machine elm which outperforms traditional algorithm not only in speed but also in generalization performance based on the original elm algorithm optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm is presented to make it more robust and generic similä and tikka 2005 it can be used to provide a better guarantee for the application of auv in practice in this paper we have proposed an intelligent assistance positioning methodology which combines modified isam and constrained op elm we perform variable reordering alone and conduct adaptive relinearization for isam when the value of local chi square exceeds a certain threshold without operating bayes tree simultaneously a constrained op elm is proposed to generate correction model for low cost sensor data while the accurate measurement model is also given by the constrained op elm by combining the corrected model with modified isam the more accurate position of auv will be offered the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the overview of proposed intelligent assistance positioning methodology the principle of the modified isam and the constrained op elm are introduced in section 3 in section 4 experiments with different datasets will be carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm finally we draw the main conclusions of this work 2 overview of proposed intelligent assistance position methodology traditionally when auv sails on the surface of the water gps receiver which is located in auv receives signal from the satellite at this time gps data is valid and can provide accurate position information for auv although other sensors such as ahrs or dvl also keep working during this process the position calculated by these sensors usually may not be used or may be used only when gps outages happens due to the low accuracy of the sensors on the other hand in addition to providing a more accurate initial values gps data has no effect to calculate underwater auv position which become invalid in this circumstance so it is significant to make a compromise between the inadequate usage of data and performance improvement of low cost sensor in this paper a novel intelligent assistance positioning methodology based on modified isam and constrained op elm for auv is proposed to correct low cost sensor data and get accurate measurement correction model the whole propose intelligent assistance positioning methodology is illustrated in fig 1 by inputting the sensors data such as ahrs or dvl into constrained op elm we get the corresponding correction model of low cost sensor then the sensor information is considered to be compensated by combining sensors data with correction model as the direct nonlinear relationship between the output value and the true value is obtained by the correction model the correction model in some sense is the mapping of all errors and noises on output in other words sensor data corrected by correction model is thought to have eliminated the interference of other factors when the corrected data is sent into modified isam the trajectory should have been equivalent close to the real track however there is still difference between the trajectory which is generated by modified isam and the real one we suppose that the reason for this situation is caused by inprecise measurement model hence similar to sensors the measurement model is obtained by correction of constrained op elm once auv sneaks into the water the gps becomes invalid immediately and the learning process of correction models is over angle correction model would be used to correct the ahrs angle as an auxiliary input simultaneously the dvl data would also be corrected by the velocity correction model after dealing with the corrected sensors data the modified isam can estimate the rough position of auv at last the rough position is processed by the measurement correction model and more accurate position information can be achieved even when the system suffers from invalid of gps 3 the principle of the modified isam and the constrained op elm 3 1 review of modified isam in the process of practical application slam problems are usually faced with nonlinear measurement function instead of linear measurement function it is essential to linearize the nonlinear measurement function in a reasonable and timely way however it is not necessary to perform relinearization step by step because the measurement is typically fairly accurate on a local scale therefore kaess performed relinearization with periodic variable reordering in a constant interval steps kaess et al 2008 though periodic relinearization can achieve linearization processing it executes linearizaiton just according to steps moreover periodic relinearization neglects whether the linearization need to be performed or not at the current linearization point the circumstance usually occurs when auv carry out tasks with a simple linear trajectory which will lead to more computing time compared with isam kaess proposed incremental smoothing and mapping using the bayes tree isam2 in 2011 which performs fluid relinearization kaess et al 2011 similarly the proposed modified isam own the same principle with isam2 to achieve flexible linearization but use a more compact and practical way for auv in a mission the error is acceptable if it is in the accuracy requirement this is our basis of executing the linearization in practical application chi square error describes similarity between the current estimation with the direct observation the modified isam algorithm with flexible relinearization takes advantage of the chi square error which compares with a threshold to decide when linearization is implemented the modified isam is shown as follow in algorithm 1 the threshold β is determined by two parameters the maximum error of navigation and the closed loop number 3 2 constrained op elm op elm is presented as a more robust methodology which is based on the original elm algorithm elm was proposed by huang and the main novelty introduced by the elm is randomly selecting the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes instead of learning these parameters the output of signal hidden layer feed forward neural networks slfns with n hidden nodes can be presented as follow 1 f n x i 1 n β i g ω i b i x x r n ω i r n β r n where g ω i b i x is the ith output of hidden layer neurons corresponding to the input β β i 1 β i 2 β i m t represents the connecting link between the ith hidden layer neurons and weight vector of output neurons for n arbitrary input sample where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n r n and t i t i 1 t i 2 t i n r n given n hidden layer neurons and activation function g ω i b i x β i ω i and b i can be found out to make slfns close to the n samples with zero error 2 j 1 n β j g ω j b j x i t i i 1 2 n to simplify the above equation 2 can be written equivalently as 3 h β t h ω 1 ω n b i b n x 1 x n g ω 1 b 1 x 1

layer neurons corresponding to inputs the training process of slfns is equivalent to find the least squares solution of linear system h β t it has been proved that the global optimal output weights can be written as 5 β ˆ h r where h is moore penrose inverse matrix of the hidden layer output matrix h to remove the useless neurons of the hidden layer op elm ranks the best neurons by multi response sparse regression mrsr as an extension of least angle regression lars mrsr provides a ranking of the kernels finally the leave one out loo validation method was used to select the actual best number of neurons the most specific details of the mrsr algorithm and loo algorithm can be found from two reported papers similä and tikka 2005 vehtari et al 2016 respectively although there are some deviations between the low cost sensor data and real data which is provided by gps the error is limited by the accuracy and cannot be arbitrary according to this principle we constrained the output of op elm using the low cost sensors precision by mapping the output to the constraint space in other word the output of op elm is constrained by the maximum error of the corresponding sensor the flow chart of constrained op elm is shown in fig 2 experimental results and analysis show that the constrained op elm can get a better correction model for auv than the original op elm the experimental analysis and results will be described in detail in section 4 3 3 the selection of input for intelligent assistance positioning methodology for intelligent assistance positioning methodology the selection of input for correction model is essential the correct input has a positive effect on generating the precise correction model for sensors while the incorrect input is not only harmful to constitute correction model but also increase the computational complexity for the proposed methodology the only input for correction model of measurement is the rough position of auv which is calculated by modified isam therefore we merely discuss the input of the angle and velocity correction models since the heading data has the greatest influence on navigation in two dimensional plane and in order to avoid the interaction of too many variables we choose heading data as the representative of the angle 3 3 1 the selection of input for correction model of heading ahrs consists of gyroscope and accelerometer and the measurement error of gyroscope mainly results from four aspects fixed deviation deviation related to acceleration error of scale factor and mutual coupling error the fixed deviation is equal to the output when there is no input the causes of this deviation contains mechanical coupling errors residual stress in the framework of the sensor and the gradient effects of temperature this error is independent to the various motion states of the gyroscope the deviation is related to acceleration it represents an output which is proportional to acceleration amplitude that the gyroscope is forced it is caused by mismatching between the barycenter and core of vibration components the scale factor usually refers to the ratio relationship between input and output thus the error is proportional to the input value it results from the nonlinear or asymmetry of scale factor mutual coupling error is the output which results from the input of insensitive axis in the situation that no input of sensitive axis the error is related to the shape of the vibration components moreover it may also generate by installation errors in fact the impact of the error sources to the output also include non equal elasticity error and orthogonal elastic deformation error these factors can be ignored since the accuracy of gyro is not high and these values are relatively smaller based on the above analysis we use the following error model of gyro 6 δ ω z b b g a x a y a z s ω z m y ω y m x ω x where b is a fixed deviation term b g represents the coefficient of acceleration related error s is the scale factor m x m y are the coefficients which is related to the mutual coupling error a x a y a z are the acceleration inputs along the sensitive axis ω x ω y ω z are angular inputs in the direction of the sensitive axis the corresponding error of heading angle can be given by the integral type of the above formula 7 δ h w z d t b t b g v x v y v z s h m y p m x r v x v y v z are the velocity inputs along the sensitive axis h p r are angle inputs along the sensitive axis in general according to the experimental calibration we can determine the coefficient for each type of error to compensate for the impact of various types of errors however since this process is too cumbersome and time consuming we used the variables as a network input to learn the corresponding error parameters through the machine learning network according to the above equation we choose v x v y v z h p r as the inputs of heading angle error 3 3 2 the selection of input for correction model of velocity dvl uses the doppler effect of sound waves to measure ship speed the main factors which influence the precision of velocity measurement in doppler system include the error caused by the instability of auv motion state which results from sea stormy waves and surges the error caused by sound velocity variation and the error caused by beam widening etc in this paper we mainly focus on the errors caused by the instability of auv motion when the auv is running it is affected by sea waves and surges as a result the fluctuation and sway of the auv will lead to the unsteadiness of the beam inclination which will make the measurement error increase and the accuracy decrease in fact all the movement of auv can be divided into yaw roll trim and translational when the auv does not swing and fluctuate the doppler frequency is shown as follow 8 f d 1 2 v x c f o c o s α 9 f d 2 2 v x c f o c o s α if the pitch of the auv is δ α and the vertical velocity v z is not equal to 0 the doppler shift measured by the heading beam is as follow 10 f d 1 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o c o s θ 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o s i n α δ α and the doppler frequency shift measured by the stern beam is as equation 11 11 f d 2 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o c o s θ 2 v x c f o c o s α δ α 2 v z c f o s i n α δ α meanwhile the difference of beam frequency is 12 f d f d 1 f d 2 4 v x c f o c o s α c o s δ α v z v x s i n δ α when δ α 0 v x 0 the doppler frequency error is 13 δ δ f d f d f d f d f d c o s δ α v z v x s i n δ α 1 if v z is 0 there is only pitch and no up down motion then 14 δ f d f d c o s δ α 1 when δ α is 5 the error is about 0 3 when δ α is 10 the error is up to 1 5 in general the pitch roll and up down fluctuations play a major role in the speed error in order to reduce the error caused by the auv motion the dvl velocity is compensated by auv attitude angle based on the above analysis therefore we select the v x r p as the speed error model inputs 3 4 the selection of the type of kernel and the number of neurons take the heading data as an example we explain the selection of kernel type and neurons number in this section the type of kernels mainly includes linear kernel l sigmoid kernel s and gaussian kernel g l g represents the combination of linear kernel and gassuian kernel while l s g represents the combination of linear kernel sigmoid kernel and gassuian kernel miche et al 2008 different kernel structure of op elm are shown in table 1 we assume that the type of kernels in constrained op elm for the same auv under same condition is consistent and this is the premise of selection for kernel during the process of kernels selection we focus on the time consumption and accuracy of different kernels in fig 3 the time consumption of different neurons number with different kernel is presented which covers the training time and testing time and the values in fig 3 are the average of ten values which were gotten from the same condition in general as the number of neurons increases the time consumption will also increase it is because too much neurons in the same kernels are involved in the calculation it seems that the less neurons are chosen the better timeliness the algorithm spends however we can see the rmse of corrected heading using l or s kernel is less effective than that of ahrs heading which is illustrated in fig 4 so we draw a conclusion that the l and s kernel is not suitable for generating the correction model of heading although they cost less time more neurons in different modes will no longer be considered because they have a higher requirement for system configuration so in order to select the type of kernel more reasonably we defined the cost function κ as follow 15 κ k e r i i 1 n 1 ε t k e r i j ε e r r o r k e r i j where k e r i represents the ith type of kernel t k e r i j is the time which constrained op elm uses kernel ith with different neurons for intelligent assistance positioning methodology and e r r o r k e r i j is the root mean square error corresponding to t k e r i j ε is the weight factor as shown in fig 5 the constrained op elm with kernel l s g g and l g has obvious advantages than directly using data of low cost sensor among them the constrained op elm using kernel l g has the lowest cost value and becomes the optimal choice for the kernel in similarity the chosen of number of neurons is also determined by defining a cost function θ as follow 16 θ k e r i 1 η t k e r i η e r r o r k e r i where t k e r i is the time consumption which constrained op elm use kernel ith and e r r o r k e r i is the corresponding root mean square error η is the weight factor ε and η are set to 0 5 in this paper in fig 6 with the increasing of the neurons number the general trend of the value of cost function decreases the model of angles become more complicated while the angle become closer to the real value in the actual system the number of neurons would not increase without limitation because of microprocessor performance therefore the number of neurons is set to be 70 3 5 performance evaluation the performance of the intelligent assistance positioning methodology is evaluated by the root mean square error rmse the corresponding formula of rmse is defined as equation 17 e t r a c k i 1 n y ˆ i t r a c k y i t r a c k t r u e n where e t r a c k is the value of rmse for the intelligent assistance positioning methodology y ˆ i t r a c k represents the vector of estimated state which is produced by the proposed intelligent fusion module while y i t r a c k t r u e is the ground truth of the state vector and n stands for the dimension of y 4 evaluation of intelligent assistance position methodology 4 1 experiment platform for intelligent assistance positioning methodology the datasets used in this paper were collected by sailfish auv the specifications of the auv are displayed in table 2 in sailfish auv the capacity of microprocessor is 32 g which loaded a 120 g hard disk and the ram of microprocessor is 4 g the intelligent position algorithm runs correctly in real time applications on this hardware platform the specifications of low cost sensors are shown in support material 4 2 performance comparison of isam and modified isam 4 2 1 verification of modified isam with simulated datasets in order to evaluate the performance of modified isam a series of experiments are illustrated to validate the proposed approach our evaluations were performed respectively on five standard simulated datasets sphere400 kaess et al 2011 sphere2500 kaess et al 2012 manhattanolson olson et al 2006 city10k kaess et al 2011 and trous10000 kaess et al 2012 and one real world datasets intel dataset kaess et al 2012 the length of dataset is listed in table 3 these standard datasets are general datasets which length has not been changed the experimental results are shown as fig 7 in fact instead of the response time for once we calculate the total running time of steps which is more reasonable for evaluation the performance of the algorithm in fig 7 it seems that the original isam performs different for example the total running time of dataset trous10000 is about seven times than that of dataset city10k with the same data length however it does not mean that the original isam algorithms is not suitable for dataset trous10000 the difference between dataset trous10000 and dataset city10k in running time is due to the number of closed loops and environmental features therefore the response time in different conditions with different closed loops is not comparable in addition isam algorithm recovers the complete robot trajectory and map to avoid unbounded errors for large scale problems the jacobian matrices a of isam would expand with the extension of time the later process of relinearization would cost more time than former relinearization process so kaess compared the total running time rather than response time for different datasets kaess et al 2011 lastly single response time for slam algorithm is not exactly the same and the long term efficiency and stability of slam is more important than the short term s for the navigation of robot this avoids the situation of system crash which results from long time running although it has a quick instantaneous efficiency therefore we only need to compare the performance of proposed method with that of the original isam in the same datasets in total the modified isam has obviously advantage than isam in effectiveness in this fig 7 the former two groups of data are three dimension while the latter ones are based on two dimensional plane for the two dimensional data the range of efficiency for modified isam is from 1 7 to 13 9 furthermore with regard to three dimensional data the time consuming of modified isam is 39 less than that of isam experimental results verified that the modified isam is more favorable for complex environment application 4 2 2 verification of modified isam with sea trial datasets we have conducted a series of experiments at yellow sea fig 8 as the ground truth gps is used as evaluation criterion for other algorithms in each loop the angle data and velocity data is sent into modified isam and the constrained op elm methods in real time applications the min input data is data collected by ahrs 100 and dvl in 1 10 s which is consistent with data collecting frequency of the sensors performance on each dataset are shown in fig 9 since the accumulated error of ekf increases with time the accuracy of trajectory which is generated by ekf decreases with time however by recovering the complete trajectory and the map isam significant avoid the problem of accumulated error and have achieved better results it is worth to be noted that in two datasets the trajectory implemented modified isam is almost completely coincident with that of isam which also fits the gps trajectory better it means that the modified isam has comparable accuracy with isam however modified isam has advantage than isam in the aspect of running time fig 10 which efficiency can be increased by 18 9 or even 25 2 the length of dataset for fig 10 is listed in table 4 basing on the above analysis we can come to a conclusion that modified isam significantly outperformed the original isam in terms of efficiency on the premise of no loss of accuracy all the experimental results presented above convincingly demonstrate that modified isam is appropriate to be adopted as a method of slam estimation to put into applications widely such as using for auv although both are important components of intelligent positioning methodology the performance of modified isam and constrained op elm are completely different in terms of time consumption unlike filtering algorithm which compute only the current pose of the robot and are not suitable for most real world problems isam recovers the complete robot trajectory and map in order to avoid accumulated errors therefore time which is cost by relinearization process of isam increases over time however time spent by constrained op elm would not change with time since op elm takes less than one percent of isam s time it can also be ignored the running time of proposed method is approximately equal to the time of running modified isam algorithm therefore the time consumption of isam shown in fig 10 can be considered as the running time of intelligent positioning methodology 4 3 performance comparison of correction model using op elm and constrained op elm to evaluate the superior performance of our new algorithm versus the state of the art op elm we analyze the two methods in terms of accuracy we use gps heading and velocity as the ground truth according to fig 11 a sensors data were sent into op elm and constrained op elm respectively to generate corresponding correction model when the heading correction model is gotten it would be used to correct or compensate the ahrs angle although the gps is invalid in fig 11 the trajectories corresponding to different heading correction model or not are shown it is illustrated that the other angle is less effective than the angle which uses heading correction model generated by constrained op elm it also consistent with our previous analysis theoretically when it does not exist sudden change in velocity there is also no obvious difference between constrained op elm and op elm as shown in fig 12 the velocity deviation of op elm and that of op elm is almost the same their accuracy values are still better than ekf s when refers to the measurement correction model it is obtained in the same way by learning the gps position data and the estimated position with constrained op elm as there is no sudden jump in the location information so constrained op elm coincides with op elm similar to correction model of velocity the trajectory corrected by measurement correction model which is produced by constrained op elm is closer to the gps trajectory than trajectory without using measurement correction model the experimental results are shown as fig 13 and this process will not be elaborated 4 4 performance comparison of intelligent assistance positioning methodology and traditional algorithm the sensors date corrected by constrained op elm are inputted into modified isam algorithm the modified isam estimates the corrected sensors data and give a rough estimate for auv combined with the measurement correction model finally we get a more accurate position as illustrated in fig 14 the trajectory using modified isam combined with constrained op elm is the closest to the real trajectory due to the uncertain nonlinear drift of low cost sensors the error of trajectory continues to accumulate with the increasing of time for ekf algorithm however even in the same circumstances the modified isam using constrained op elm can make full use of correction model and achieve good positioning result the rmse corresponding to different algorithm is shown in fig 15 the rmse of proposed methodology is improved by 63 9 and 83 8 than ekf respectively 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed an intelligent assistance positioning methodology to improve the navigation accuracy for auv firstly we have used a series of experiments to illustrate the validation of modified isam and its efficiency increased by at least 18 than original isam then the correction models are generated by constrained op elm which is demonstrated to be better than op elm in terms of accuracy lastly the performance comparison of intelligent assistance positioning methodology and traditional algorithm is provided compared to the direct using of low cost sensors data to execute ekf algorithm the proposed method exhibits better accuracy in the complex conditions which rmse can improved by more than 60 than ekf the experimental results verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed method for auv acknowledgement the paper is partially supported by the natural science foundation of china 41176076 31202036 51379198 and the high technology
