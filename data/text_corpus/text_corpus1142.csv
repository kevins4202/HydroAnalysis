5710,underground contaminants such as non aqueous phase liquids napls or volatile organic compounds vocs threaten public safety and health the presence of fractures or regions of high permeability significantly limits the recovery due to the contrast in the capillary pressures of the low and high permeability regions we previously proposed a methodology to improve the recovery of liquids upon gas injection process from a porous system with a percolating network of fractures this methodology uses a high capillary pressure skin at the production well and controls the injection pressure below a threshold value for the breakthrough in this paper a mixed finite element method is employed to model the gas water drainage process in a porous medium containing matrix fracture and skin an additional mixed layer is also used to account for the mixing of the solid particles at the boundaries between the matrix fracture and skin the mathematical model for immiscible gas water displacement in the heterogeneous porous medium is implemented in comsol multiphysics the model successfully captures the dynamics of the injection pressure and fluid recovery with and without gravitational effects the model is developed to predict the injection pressure corresponding to gas breakthrough by injecting the gas phase at a pressure below this threshold value the gas breakthrough can be significantly postponed during this delayed time more liquid recovery is expected the model is verified with experiments using a constant injection rate scheme we also study the optimal operation by considering recovery factor and process time as the variables in horizontal gas injection case without the use of high capillary pressure skin and pressure control scheme the ultimate recovery from porous medium is limited to that from the fracture only approximately 9 pore volume or pv using the skin and pressure control the model predicts the recovery values to be increased by one order of magnitude which is in agreement with the experimental data the computational fluid dynamic cfd model can be used for process control and optimization to achieve optimal recovery conditions in

heterogeneous porous media is essential in various applications such as remediation geological co2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery eor contamination of porous media by pollutants such as volatile organic compounds vocs non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminants and heavy metals is of great interest as it may considerably affect the public health and safety han et al 2016 while the remediation of contaminants in the homogeneous porous systems has become a routine practice it is practically insignificant when applied to highly fractured porous media systematic practical and theoretical frameworks have not been proposed yet to develop effective methods for improvement of the remediation performance in heterogeneous systems national academies of sciences 2015 furthermore although most of the contaminant volume in a fractured medium resides in the matrix its recovery is minor by conventional methods due to the contrast in the capillary pressure of the matrix and that of the fracture national academies of sciences 2015 for example utilization of the pump and treat method that is commonly used to recover free phase contaminants is costly and inefficient in heterogeneous media marley et al 1992 one of the disadvantages of injecting water for remediation is complications with the downstream water treatment which is reviewed in igunnu and chen 2012 air sparging has been introduced as an alternative remediation process to recover the contaminants it is found effective in both unsaturated and saturated zones and it features a better strategy in terms of economic perspective forsyth and shao 1991 however the process of gas injection to recover liquids oil in eor and or liquid contaminants in remediation from porous media still suffers from the adverse mobility ratio between the displacing gas and displaced liquid fluids the presence of fractures and interconnected regions of high permeability triggers the mobility problem resulting in an even lower recovery performance for the liquids dullien 2012 despite the failure of the remediation performance in fractured porous media there are severe public health hazards from various contaminants in this type of sediments as a few examples in canada 40 000 l of poorly characterized chemical mostly chlorinated solvents acids and organic solvents was spilled into a highly fractured sediment 1 km ne of the town of smithville ontario and 15 km sw of the lake of ontario for which the pump and treat technique was found ineffective by analyzing 15 year sampling data 1994 2008 mclaren et al 2012 also water resource contamination by chlorinated solvents and pesticides point source occurred in fractured sediments 400 km long swath 50 m to 100 m deep extending from niagara falls to the bruce peninsula which was reported in the silurian dolostone fractured bedrock in ontario perrin et al 2011 arsenic as contaminants above the canadian guideline value of 10 mg l were found in fractured crystalline bedrock in the private water wells in the western quebec bondu et al 2017 recently a research study by javed and siddique 2016 showed a greater level of arsenic as in the groundwater aquifer near the thermal recovery sites in the cold lake oilfields alberta canada the contamination level was up to three times higher in the fractured sediments compared to homogeneous aquifers in a recent experimental study we proposed a methodology to improve the breakthrough recovery from a highly heterogeneous porous medium upon gas injection where a fracture interconnected the injection and production wells rezaei et al 2018 an exceptionally high recovery performance was achieved by adding a high capillary pressure skin to the production well and by continuously controlling the injection pressure below a threshold value to prevent the gas breakthrough rezaei et al 2018 employing this strategy we were able to increase the recovery factor from about 9 pore volume pv which was present in the percolating fracture network only to over 90 and 93 pv by horizontal and vertical gas injection modes respectively rezaei et al 2018 in the current research we conduct a follow up study using computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling to predict the threshold pressure condition and to propose an optimal operation the literature study on macro scale modeling of gas liquid drainage flow in porous media is extensive in areas such as enhanced oil recovery kazemi et al 1976 wu and pruess 1998 hoteit and firoozabadi 2006 ho and webb 2006 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 hoteit

2019 in the past decade there has been a significant improvement in the modeling performance of fluid flow in fractured porous media conventionally the multi phase flow in a heterogeneous medium is simulated by single porosity ghorayeb and firoozabadi 2000 and dual porosity warren and root 1963 kazemi 1969 models the single porosity models allow a sharp change in the petrophysical properties of the matrix and fracture domains however the ill condition in the numerical computation significantly limits the performance of the single porosity models ghorayeb and firoozabadi 2000 although the dual porosity models feature a better numerical performance they demand a matrix fracture transfer function so called transmissibility term which depends on the porous medium petrophysical and fluid properties reducing the generalization capability of the model hoteit and firoozabadi 2006 the use of mixed finite element method is found to reduce the problems with matrix fracture discontinuity furthermore with discontinuous galerkin finite element method numerical dispersion in the simulation can be avoided hoteit and firoozabadi 2006 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 in the framework of implicit pressure explicit composition impec higher order compositional modeling of 3d fractured media was also developed that improved the numerical performance of simulators in enhanced oil recovery and co2 storage applications moortgat and firoozabadi 2013 using mixed hybrid finite element with discontinuous galerkin formulation and by considering molecular diffusion gravity compositional and capillarity effects the higher order compositional models mimic the physics of process better moortgat and firoozabadi 2013 shahraeeni et al 2015 lately with the economic viability of recovering hydrocarbons from shale formations mathematical modeling of the gas flow in mesoscale fractured media has been advanced this progress is achieved by considering the nano confinement effects on the thermodynamic behavior jin et al 2013 jin and firoozabadi 2016 sandoval et al 2016 sandoval et al 2018 as well as the effects of knudsen diffusion and gas adsorption on the dynamics of the gas flow in fractured porous media swami et al 2013 lunati and lee 2014 wan et al 2015 song et al 2015 sun et al 2015 wu et al 2016 yu et al 2018 luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 despite significant advancement in the mathematical modeling of the gas flow in fractured porous media the numerical modeling of multi phase flow in systems consisting of matrix fracture and skin under controlled injection scheme is not available in the literature in this paper we develop a cfd model to simulate the hydrodynamic flow behavior in the fractured porous media featuring gas injection control with and without the gravitational effects the paper is structured as follows a background on mathematical model for immiscible two phase flow is given in section 2 in section 3 the implementation of developed model in comsol multiphysics software is provided section 4 is dedicated to the results and discussions for horizontal and vertical gas injection scenarios and section 5 includes conclusion remarks 2 mathematical modeling of immiscible two phase flow in porous media the modeling foundation of the immiscible two phase flow in porous media is constructed by the conservation equations for mass and momentum and by including auxiliary models for capillary pressure and relative permeability let the wetting phase to be identified by w and the non wetting phase with n in the following a macroscopic model of the porous medium is given mikyška 2005 the system involves the wetting phase w and the non wetting phase n or the solid phase the amount of mass transfer between the solid and other fluids either w or n is negligible in the case under study therefore the macroscopic mass conservation in phase α can be written as 1 ϕ ρ α s α t ρ α u α ρ α q α α w n where ϕ represents the porosity ρ α refers to the density of phase α s α is the saturation of phase α t is time u α is the velocity of phase α and q α denotes the flow rate of phase α as a sink or source within the domain ω ir d muskat s generalization of darcy s law for flow in porous media can be used for the velocity of each phase u α muskat 1949 2 u α kk r α μ α p α ρ α g where k is the absolute permeability of the porous media k r α is the relative permeability of phase α satisfying the condition 0 k r α 1 μ α introduces the viscosity of phase α p α is the pressure of phase α and g represents the gravity acceleration constant the saturations of both phases satisfy the physical constraint when the mass transfer with the solid phase is insignificant 3 s w s n 1 where s w and s n denote the saturation of wetting and non wetting phases respectively furthermore at thermodynamic equilibrium conditions the capillary pressure p c relates the pressure of the wetting phase p w and that of the non wetting phase p n for a curved interface through the following equation 4 p c s w p n p w for the two phase flow p c is a function of s w or s n 2 1 pressure saturation formulation for two phase flow in porous media eqs 2 4 form the mathematical structure of the immiscible flow in porous media we employ this model for gas injection process in a heterogeneous porous medium with a matrix a fracture and a skin rezaei et al 2018 in applications such as remediation and eor the saturation of the liquids is a key parameter in the case of remediation the saturation of non aqueous phase liquids or napl and in the eor the saturation of oil are of great importance furthermore in a gas injection process the pressure of the gas is critical as it can be related to the injection pressure and back pressure and because the pressure drop in the gas phase is much less than that in the liquid phase therefore in the mathematical formulation we adopt s w and p n as the dependent variables because the range of pressure variations in the experimental case study rezaei et al 2018 is small and that the experiments are conducted under atmospheric conditions we neglect the compressibility effects furthermore the porous medium is assumed to be anisotropic in each of the domains matrix fracture and or skin for which the porosity and permeability do not change with space and time the mobility of phase α is given by λ α k r α μ α for the two phase flow in porous media λ α λ α s α furthermore total mobility is defined as λ t λ w λ n combining eqs 1 and 2 writing equations for both wetting and non wetting phases and implementing the assumptions result in 5 ϕ s w t k λ w p w ρ w g q w 6 ϕ s n t k λ n p n ρ n g q n by considering the physical constraint see eq 3 and assuming that the equilibrium condition holds it follows that s w t s n t total flow rate can be defined as q t q w q n therefore by adding eqs 5 and 6 the first term in the left hand side will be eliminated to obtain the equations in terms of p n we use eq 4 which results in p w p n p c because p c p c s w then p c dp c ds w s w by adding eqs 5 and 6 and then manipulating the mathematical expressions the following equations are obtained 7 ϕ s w t k λ w p n dp c ds w s w ρ w g q w 8 k λ t p n k λ w dp c ds w s w k λ w ρ w g k λ n ρ n g q t eqs 7 and 8 provide the formulation in terms of p n and s w the model needs equations to correlate the capillary pressure and relative permeability to the saturation of wetting phase the auxiliary flow models express the capillary pressure p c p c s w and relative permeability functions k rw k rw s w and k rn k rn s w in terms of one of the model independent variables s w this correlation is hidden in the terms λ w and λ n in eqs 7 and 8 2 2 auxiliary models both the capillary pressure and relative permeability models use an effective saturation which normalizes the desired reducible saturation e g s w s wr for the wetting phase and s n s nr for the non wetting phase against the overall reducible saturation of both phases e g 1 s wr s nr where s wr and s nr are the residual saturation for the wetting and non wetting phases respectively as given below 9 s ew s w s wr 1 s wr s nr we adopt the capillary pressure from brooks and corey 1964 10 p c p t s ew 1 λ where p t is the non wetting phase threshold pressure from the idealized model required to advance into a completely saturated porous medium as seen in the simulation results the value of p t is different from the entry capillary pressure p e the parameter λ characterizes the pore size distribution of the porous medium usually values of λ range from 0 2 to 5 brooks and corey 1964 higher values of λ are used for highly homogeneous porous media for which the pore size distribution is narrow as the spherical glass beads of narrow size distribution are used in our case study we adopt λ 5 for all domains including matrix fracture and skin we also examine the van genuchten 1980 capillary pressure model for the relative permeability model we adopt the relative permeability model by mualem 1976 which features an extra parameter κ compared to the brooks and corey 1964 relative permeability model accounting for the effects of pore size distribution on the relative permeability 11 k rw s ew 2 5 2 λ 12 k rn 1 s ew κ 1 s ew 1 1 λ 2 as eqs 7 and 8 are expressed in terms of p n and s w the capillary pressure eq 10 and relative permeability models eqs 11 and 12 are all in terms of s w κ can be used as a fitting parameter to improve the relative permeability behavior of the two phase flow in porous media schaap and leij 2000 3 model implementation in comsol multiphysics we use the mathematical model framework explained earlier to model the case of controlled gas injection in heterogeneous porous media incorporating matrix fracture and skin studied by rezaei et al 2018 3 1 porous media properties a schematic of the porous medium used in the case study is given in fig 1 this model includes three main regions namely matrix white region fracture blue hatched and skin red hatched there is also an additional layer identified by filled solid blue at the end of the fracture to account for the effect of mixing glass beads at the neighboring domains to simulate the physical model packing rezaei et al 2018 there are two cylindrical ports considered for the flow inlet and outlet the direction of flow is indicated above fig 1 showing left to right injection the model dimensions are based on the real porous medium in our previous work rezaei et al 2018 all dimensions are in cm the model thickness perpendicular to the plane is approximately 0 3 cm the porosity and permeability of each domain are listed as shown in table 1 in fig 1 the mixed region is included to simulate the change in the porosity and permeability at the boundaries between regions having different bead sizes this mixed boundary is also noticed in the experimental work since loose glass beads of different sizes are packed in one step prior to consolidation at a boundary between two regions smaller beads can fill the pore spaces between the larger beads therefore a sharp interface cannot be obtained in reality this change in the polydispersity of the beads in the mixed zone alters the porous medium properties such as porosity permeability and capillary pressure adding this mixed layer increases the number of model parameters we were able to obtain satisfactory results in terms of recovery without this mixed region however it led to unrealistic parameters for relative permeability and capillary pressure the reason is that without the mixed region a higher polydispersity should be used in the individual domains matrix fracture and skin to compensate for the higher polydispersity that is overlooked at the boundaries the addition of this mixed layer improves the quality of fitting resulting in more meaningful parameters 3 2 mathematical pde equations in comsol multiphysics the general form of partial differential equation pde environment in comsol is given by 13 e a 2 u t 2 d a u t c u α u γ β u au f the interpretation of the terms in eq 13 is found elsewhere nucera and lanza di scalea 2013 for our system of equations defined by eqs 7 and 8 the variables and coefficients are given as follows 14 u p n s w d a 0 0 0 ϕ c k λ w λ t λ w dp c ds w 1 dp c ds w f q t q w γ kg λ w ρ w λ n ρ n λ w ρ w where u is the vector of dependent variables e a is the mass transfer coefficient d a resembles the damping coefficient c represents the diffusion coefficient α is the conservative flux convection coefficient γ is the convection flux source sink term β is the convection coefficient a is absorption coefficient and f introduces the source sink term due to the small thickness of the model its behavior can be described as a 2d model the values of e a α β a 0 the coefficient γ is related to the gravitational effect the magnitude of γ that is shown in eq 14 is for the case of vertical gas injection in the case of horizontal injection γ 0 as the thickness of the model is only 3 mm and that the effect of gravity on phase distribution can be neglected in the simulations the horizontal injection does not include the gravity effects while the vertical injection scenario considers the impact of gravity on pressure and phase saturation 3 3 boundary and initial conditions the initial conditions for the system of two phase flow in porous media described by eqs 7 and 8 are based on the experimental conditions used in the case study where the porous medium is initially saturated completely with the wetting phase water and the system is held at atmospheric back pressure rezaei et al 2018 therefore p n t 0 0 and s w t 0 1 for the boundary conditions the no flow condition applies at the solid boundaries without flow continuity for more details on the boundary conditions and connectivity of the matrix fracture you may refer to zendehboudi et al 2012 upon injecting the gas phase into a fully saturated porous medium the gas breaks through the largest pores at the inlet face decreasing the wetting phase saturation s w towards the residual saturation practically the time for the s w at the inlet face to reach the residual saturation is not comparable to the time frame of the gas injection more details are available elsewhere rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 therefore it is possible to simplify the model by assuming that the injection face is always at the residual saturation s w in 1 s wr for t 0 where s wr is the residual wetting saturation in a specific domain of the porous medium matrix fracture or skin because the input ports are located in the fracture as seen in fig 1 this condition first applies to the fracture inlet face as it has significantly larger pore sizes compared to those in the matrix it follows that the wetting phase saturation at the fracture inlet face will reach residual saturation while the matrix and skin can be still fully saturated with the wetting phase at the outlet face the boundary condition s w out fixed applies before the gas breakthrough for a strongly liquid wet system it can be assumed that s w out 1 s wr after the gas breakthrough for p n the inlet condition is dictated by either constant injection rate where p n fixed or by constant injection pressure where p n fixed the outlet condition for pressure is dictated by the back pressure which is atmospheric in the case study rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 3 4 model discretization and mesh geometry triangular elements are used as the geometry of the mesh element initially the quality of the overall mesh is set to be extra fine comsol default with a maximum element size of 1 mm then the number of nodes at each boundary is doubled because p n is large at the boundaries as demonstrated in fig 2 initially we did not include the mixed region shown with a filled blue region in fig 1 and realistic modeling of the experiments could not be materialized one issue was related to the mixing of the large glass beads in the fracture with the smaller beads in the matrix and smaller ones in the skin the addition of this mixed layer at the end of the fracture helped to capture the physics and involved momentum transfer of process better 4 results and discussions in the following section we show the results of the cfd model that was developed in the previous section backward differential formula bdf solver is used as a dynamic implicit solver for the set of differential algebraic equations daes a tolerance of 1 10 6 is used for the absolute error the processing time for an equivalent of one second gas injection of the described model with 30 000 nodes is ranged from 100 to 1 200 ms depending on the operating conditions on a workstation with 8 cores i7 6700 cpu 3 41 ghz processor and 16 gb memory 4 1 parameter estimation the mathematical framework of flow in porous media that was described earlier needs auxiliary models for two phase capillary pressure see eq 10 and two phase relative permeability functions see eqs 11 and 12 these models include parameters such as the entry pressure for the non wetting phase p n connectivity factor κ pore size distribution parameter λ as well as parameters related to the gas liquid process in eq 9 such as the residual saturation for the wetting s wr and non wetting s nr phases in the absence of direct measurements of capillary pressure and relative permeability for each domain matrix fracture and skin of the heterogeneous model the parameter estimation is only possible from a back calculation using pressure and recovery experimental data rezaei et al 2018 to evaluate the relative significance of viscous and capillary pressure it is possible to assess the capillary number which is defined as the ratio of viscous to capillary forces for a drainage system where the non wetting phase is displacing the wetting phase the capillary number n c can be defined as chatzis and morrow 1984 15 n c drainage u n μ n ϕ σ wn q n μ n ϕ a σ wn where u n introduces the darcy velocity for the non wetting phase μ n is the viscosity of the non wetting phase σ wn resembles the surface tension between the wetting and non wetting phases ϕ symbolizes the porosity a is the cross section area for the displacement and q n is the flow rate of the non wetting phase using the lowest flow rate used in the experiments performed by rezaei et al 2018 which is q n 5 cm3 h the cross section area for the fracture zone where initial displacement occurs a 0 96 0 3 cm2 a porosity value of ϕ 0 35 in the fracture surface tension of σ 72 dyne cm and viscosity of the non wetting phase at room conditions μ n 0 02 cp the capillary number is n c 4 10 8 assuming that the non wetting phase initially invades the fracture only under this low capillary number chatzis and morrow 1984 the viscous forces can be neglected for the fracture similar calculations show the same result for the matrix the calculation procedure for the skin is not straightforward as the cross section area a is not known for the percolating non wetting interface due to this low capillary number it is feasible to obtain the entry pressure p e from the pressure signal related to the intrusion of the non wetting phase into each part matrix fracture and skin we change the entry pressure to fit the pressure difference that enables gas invasion into a finer less permeable region therefore by fitting the pressure signal at a low injection rate we obtain the entry pressure of all domains as summarized in table 2 for all regions the parameter λ 5 is considered this parameter dictates the shape of capillary pressure curve and is more affected by the pore size distribution rather than the mean pore size in the experiments highly spherical glass beads with narrow size distributions are used hence the assumption of λ 5 for all model parts zones to simulate the experimental conditions seems reasonable although is not perfectly realistic when capillary pressure measurements are not available for the individual domains the value of κ is obtained by fitting the pressure and recovery data rezaei et al 2018 to identify the parameters we initially set the connectivity factor and entry pressure at a guessed value and then change the entry pressure by δ p t 0 1 kpa increments until the slope of pressure versus time during the gas invasion into the fracture matches the experimental values then the connectivity factor is changed by δ κ 1 increments and the injection pressure results from the model at 5 cm3 h which is the lowest value used in the experiments are fitted to those of the experimental pressure data rezaei et al 2018 the values of p t in table 2 are higher than the p e for the invasion of the non wetting phase into the different regions of the model for example we observe gas breakthrough at a pressure drop 3 1 kpa while the p t value of the skin from brooks and corey s capillary pressure model is 10 5 kpa therefore for p n 10 5 kpa no breakthrough is expected based on the model while in reality it happens even at 3 1 kpa the reason for such a discrepancy is related to using the idealized capillary pressures by brooks and corey which dismisses the initial non linear increase in p c with s w at s w 1 we also use the capillary pressure by van genuchten 1980 that considers a smooth increase in capillary pressure at s w 1 however the model causes the development of the non wetting phase in the matrix and skin due to numerical dispersion 4 2 model validation after constructing the mathematical model its accuracy is validated with experimental data for further sensitivity analysis investigation the model validation stage is conducted by comparing the experimental results for both horizontal and vertical gas injection tests conducted at a constant injection rate with those from the numerical simulation 4 2 1 horizontal drainage the horizontal drainage tests are conducted at constant injection rates of 5 10 20 and 30 cm3 h we compare the experimental and cfd results for the horizontal injection case at a constant injection rate in fig 3 showing an excellent fit between the injection pressure data obtained in the experiments and the cfd model the model is capable of capturing different features of the injection pressure as depicted in fig 3 this includes an early increase in the pressure to make feasible the gas penetration into the fracture another pressure jump is observed when the fracture is completely invaded leading to advancement of the non wetting phase into the matrix then pressure stays constant as the matrix is homogeneous and the viscous pressure drop is insignificant due to small capillary number n c 10 8 10 7 as the saturation of the non wetting phase at the outlet face of matrix increases the mobility of the wetting phase λ n decreases quickly rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 therefore the gas will be pressurized to enable fluid invasion into the skin this is due to the contrast in the capillary pressures of the matrix and skin at this stage a sudden increase in the pressure is observed without controlling the injection pressure the non wetting phase will break through the skin during this later pressurization stage the cfd model can accurately estimate the breakthrough pressure as observed in fig 3 the estimation of threshold pressure is important as the recovery enhancement mechanism relies on controlling the injection pressure below this threshold value in fig 4 a comparison is made between the horizontal drainage test and the cfd model where an injection rate of 30 cm3 h is set in the experiments rezaei et al 2018 the flow rate is successively reduced to half to avoid the injection pressure exceeding the threshold pressure for the breakthrough condition rezaei et al 2018 controlled the pressure within a 10 safe margin from the threshold breakthrough capillary pressure in the cfd modeling we drop the injection flow rate at corresponding simulation time similar to that in the experiment according to fig 4 the pressure drop behavior upon flow rate manipulation is not exactly followed by the model initially when the pressure varies rapidly at a later stage t 300 min the system dynamics becomes considerably slower and the model can simulate the stabilized pressure behavior another essential criterion for the model validity is the capability of the cfd model to estimate the recovery behavior of the wetting phase upon gas injection a comparison is made in fig 5 implying that the recovery factor is initially calculated better by the cfd model although the pore volume pv of the matrix fracture and skin are individually known in the experiments performed by rezaei et al 2018 their porosity values are now individually measured uncertainties exist for the thickness of the model 0 3 mm in the sintering process the model thickness will not remain constant because of the gravity effect as well as the differences in the sintering dynamics for glass beads of different sizes in these three regions the initial recovery is achieved from the fracture after some time the recovery from the matrix starts because the matrix contributes to the majority of the model pv a small error in the estimation of matrix porosity will cause error propagation in the cumulative recovery plot as shown in fig 5 we also compare the saturation distributions from cfd model with those from experiments rezaei et al 2018 this comparison is shown in fig 6 based on the saturation of the wetting and non wetting phases for the horizontal gas injection process conducted at a constant flow rate of 10 cm3 h in the experiments by rezaei et al 2018 pictures were occasionally captured during the displacement process in fig 6 the cfd model results are compared with those from the experiments at six different injection times after 8 5 min figs 6 a and 6 b 17 5 min figs 6 c and 6 d 30 5 min figs 6 e and 6 f 40 5 min figs 6 g and 6 h 60 5 min figs 6 i and 6 j and 120 5 min figs 6 k and 6 l the snapshots from the simulation exhibit good agreement between the recovery values as well as the fluid distribution behavior see fig 6 referring to the reasons stated earlier the idealized model does not perfectly match the behavior due to lack of understanding about the real porosity permeability and model thickness in each domain furthermore in the experiments minor heterogeneities exist in each domain during the model packing however the critical times for the matrix fracture and skin gas invasion are captured by the model for example pannels a and b of fig 6 both show that initially the fracture is invaded without any intrusion of the gas phase into the matrix fig 6 a is slightly behind the experiment as compared to fig 6 b after 30 5 min the fracture is completely invaded and invasion into matrix starts as demonstrated in figs 6 e and 6 f furthermore after 40 5 min both the cfd model and the experiment show the arrival of the gas phase at the skin side without any invasion into the skin after about two hours both the model and experiment predict that the gas phase occupies the entire outlet face of the matrix without having a breakthrough at this time the recovery values from the model and experiment are 0 452 and 0 498 pv respectively figs 6 f l reveal minor packing non homogeneity from the signatures of the developed fingers and bypassed regions of the non wetting phase gas trapped in the continuum of the water phase we compare the recovery results from the vertical model conducted at different constant injection rates in the range 10 50 cm3 h as seen in fig 8 the model underestimates the recovery data especially at a low injection rate e g 10 cm3 h based on fig 8 similar to the case of pressure shown in fig 7 the cfd results at high injection rates 40 and 50 cm3 h exhibit a better match for the recovery factor with respect to the experimental results used in the current study one of the reasons that may contribute to a better match at high injection rates is that the flow communication between matrix and fracture is less pronounced under high injection rate conditions at extreme cases the gas only goes into the fracture without any recovery from the matrix further information is available elsewhere zendehboudi et al 2012 in the actual experiments rezaei et al 2018 the fracture is idealized by packing of higher permeability at the matrix fracture boundary the mixing of small beads in the matrix and large beads in fracture increases the polydispersity for a thin layer of mixed beads with different porosity and permeability values the flow communication between the matrix and fracture is affected by this uncertainty related to the resistance at the border of matrix and fracture parts thus the higher injection rate simulations are expected to represent the tests better as a result of lower matrix fracture flow communication 4 2 2 vertical drainage we also compare the cfd model and experimental results in vertical drainage displacement conducted at constant injection rates similar to the case of horizontal injection we present the results of injection pressure recovery and saturation for the vertical drainage system in the vertical drainage mode the gravity helps the communication between the matrix and fracture providing a higher driving force compared to the gradient of capillary pressure which acts in horizontal injection tests zendehboudi et al 2012 a comparison between the real and simulation injection pressures in the vertical mode is given in fig 7 showing the dynamics of gas injection pressure at five different injection rates 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm3 h the experimental data are taken from our previous research investigation presented in rezaei et al 2018 fig 7 reveals that at higher injection rates a better match is obtained also the model is capable of predicting the breakthrough pressure therefore by adjusting the injection pressure below this threshold value the breakthrough can be delayed according to fig 7 an initial negative pressure is noticed this condition happens if the rate of injection is less than the rate obtained by the free fall gravity drainage process zendehboudi et al 2012 the cfd model can forecast the time for a rapid increase in pressure with time this rapid pressurization is due to the accumulation of the non wetting phase at skin in this case there is no sufficient pressure gradient across the skin to maintain the breakthrough condition rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 the evolution of the gas saturation based on the cfd model is depicted in fig 9 for the case of vertical injection at a constant injection rate of 10 cm3 h initially an invasion of the fracture is only observed when the driving force in the fracture hydrostatic height decreases a higher driving force in the matrix can compensate for its higher resistance e g lower permeability compared to the fracture at this point the matrix will also be invaded which is in agreement with experiments and simulation results by zendehboudi et al 2012 if there is no skin and that the fracture length is equal to the model length it starts from top to bottom of the model the breakthrough condition happens as the interface reaches the bottom of the model in the fracture the presence of skin delays the gas breakthrough and a high recovery factor of about 87 is predicted from the simulation results this value is 93 in the experiments both the simulation and experimental results confirm the viability of controlled gas injection with a thin layer of skin applied to the production well for improving the recovery upon gas injection the cfd model will provide a general framework for the operation of injection processes to maximize the recovery even at the cost of reduced recovery rate this proposed strategy might not be interesting in the eor projects because of the increased pressure drop at the skin that decreases the oil production rate however the process mechanism is of great interest in processes such as remediation and membrane separation a summary of results for gas injection with and without the gravity effects is presented in table 3 based on the simulation runs and experimental work the average absolute deviations aads attained in estimating the injection pressure in kpa and recovery factor in fraction of the pv data are listed in table 3 these results cover the constant injection flow rate in the range of 5 50 cm3 h 4 3 optimal operation the simulation results that are presented up to this section are obtained by the model after it was tuned with the experimental data of rezaei et al 2018 it is possible to inject the gas phase at a controlled pressure less than the threshold breakthrough pressure from the beginning of injection in the experimental work constant injection pumps were not available and as a results this objective is studied through mathematical simulation after the performance of the numerical model is verified with the experimental data we use the tuned model as a predictive tool to study the effect of injection pressure on the recovery performance this case study simulates a constant injection pressure scenario and provides insight into the optimal operation of the gas injection process with maximized breakthrough recovery factor providing further clarifications the constant injection rate case is used to simulate the experimental data for the model calibration and validation purposes however the constant injection pressure simulations are used for the parametric sensitivity analysis simulation studies are conducted at an injection pressure in the range p inj 3 1 3 9 kpa the recovery factor at breakthrough rf b and the time to reach breakthrough t b are compared in fig 10 showing that with a decrease in the injection pressure the recovery factor and the time to reach breakthrough increase as it is expected however it seems to be an optimal value by considering both factors rf b and t b at p inj 3 1 and 3 3 kpa rf b 0 808 and 0 785 pv respectively with 3 relative difference however the breakthrough occurs after 176 min at 3 3 kpa and 432 min at 3 1 kpa injection pressure respectively therefore operating the system at p inj 3 3 kpa is more practical as the recovery process is 2 45 times faster the dynamic behavior of the recovery factor in pv for different gas injection simulation cases at constant injection pressures is shown in fig 11 at an injection pressure of 3 kpa a breakthrough is not possible within the simulation time frame up to 450 min as observed in fig 11 although the recovery takes longer the production rate beyond this time is not practically significant a comparison between the injection pressure data 3 1 3 9 kpa shows that with increasing the injection pressure the time for the non wetting phase to reach the skin is shorter and a lower recovery value is obtained however this is not the case for the injection pressure in the range 3 1 3 3 kpa for which the recovery factor at breakthrough does not change considerably all recovery plots demonstrate a similar trend up to the point where the non wetting phase reaches the skin with increasing the injection pressure the fingering mechanism becomes more pronounced contributing to earlier breakthrough with increasing pressure the magnitudes of breakthrough recovery obtained from the cfd model for the constant injection rate and constant injection pressure cases are reported in fig 12 for the horizontal injection system with and without the pressure control the recovery dynamics of the constant injection pressure at 3 kpa is also depicted in fig 12 for comparison at this injection pressure breakthrough does not occur within the time frame of 450 min as it is observed in fig 12 rf b for constant injection pressure values of 3 9 and 3 5 kpa are similar to those at constant injection rates of 30 and 20 cm3 h respectively the deviation between the performance of the constant injection rate and constant injection pressure occurs at an injection pressure of p inj 3 5 kpa in general the magnitudes of rf b for constant injection pressure cases are more than those for the constant injection rate scenarios interestingly the values of rf b for the case of constant injection rate both with and without flow control fall on the recovery plot obtained for injection at the lowest pressure value of 3 kpa where the breakthrough event is not noticed as it is expected those tests with controlling the flow rate have a higher recovery performance for example at the injection rate of 10 cm3 h the recovery value increases from 0 681 pv to 0 756 pv when the injection flow rate is manipulated to control the injection pressure below the threshold value for the breakthrough condition in the experiments these recovery values are 0 739 pv without control and 0 881 with control respectively rezaei et al 2018 there is a gas continuum in the fracture starting from the injection side because the gas phase does not hold a significant pressure gradient by imposing a higher injection pressure a large pressure gradient will also apply across the skin this condition will facilitate the onset of breakthrough whenever the pressure difference across the skin overcomes the breakthrough capillary pressure plus viscous pressure drop of the advancing interface in the skin the breakthrough condition occurs for this reason the gas breakthrough is experienced at a lower recovery value by increasing the injection pressure 5 conclusions an implicit pressure explicit composition impec mathematical model is used to capture the gas injection dynamics in a porous medium consisting of matrix fracture and skin parts based on the methodology proposed in this study the injection pressure can be controlled below a threshold value to delay the breakthrough condition leading to an increase in the recovery at breakthrough the following conclusions are made from this computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling study the mixed finite element framework predicts the optimal injection pressure to attain the maximum recovery through a faster recovery process compared to the case of constant injection rate the cfd mathematical model captures features of the multi phase flow such as the injection pressure and recovery dynamics in a porous system with matrix fracture and skin for different injection rates and model orientations the cfd model can accurately forecast the injection pressure corresponding to the breakthrough condition knowledge of this threshold pressure is necessary for a controlled injection strategy to increase the recovery from highly fractured porous media a thin layer with intermediate petrophysical properties is required in addition to matrix fracture and skin to resemble the mixing of beads at the interface between two regions by operating the injection gas at a threshold pressure value below the breakthrough capillary threshold a high recovery factor of more than 80 pv is achieved from the mathematical model without using skin and controlled pressure scheme this recovery value based on simulation runs is limited to only 9 which is the pore volume pv corresponding to the fracture the mathematical cfd approach can model the gas injection process using successively decreasing injection rates starting from the highest possible flow rate that is practical the mathematical model can be employed to determine the duration of fluid flow in different heterogeneous regions which is useful in making effective and meaningful control decisions credit authorship contribution statement

5710,underground contaminants such as non aqueous phase liquids napls or volatile organic compounds vocs threaten public safety and health the presence of fractures or regions of high permeability significantly limits the recovery due to the contrast in the capillary pressures of the low and high permeability regions we previously proposed a methodology to improve the recovery of liquids upon gas injection process from a porous system with a percolating network of fractures this methodology uses a high capillary pressure skin at the production well and controls the injection pressure below a threshold value for the breakthrough in this paper a mixed finite element method is employed to model the gas water drainage process in a porous medium containing matrix fracture and skin an additional mixed layer is also used to account for the mixing of the solid particles at the boundaries between the matrix fracture and skin the mathematical model for immiscible gas water displacement in the heterogeneous porous medium is implemented in comsol multiphysics the model successfully captures the dynamics of the injection pressure and fluid recovery with and without gravitational effects the model is developed to predict the injection pressure corresponding to gas breakthrough by injecting the gas phase at a pressure below this threshold value the gas breakthrough can be significantly postponed during this delayed time more liquid recovery is expected the model is verified with experiments using a constant injection rate scheme we also study the optimal operation by considering recovery factor and process time as the variables in horizontal gas injection case without the use of high capillary pressure skin and pressure control scheme the ultimate recovery from porous medium is limited to that from the fracture only approximately 9 pore volume or pv using the skin and pressure control the model predicts the recovery values to be increased by one order of magnitude which is in agreement with the experimental data the computational fluid dynamic cfd model can be used for process control and optimization to achieve optimal recovery conditions in

heterogeneous porous media is essential in various applications such as remediation geological co2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery eor contamination of porous media by pollutants such as volatile organic compounds vocs non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminants and heavy metals is of great interest as it may considerably affect the public health and safety han et al 2016 while the remediation of contaminants in the homogeneous porous systems has become a routine practice it is practically insignificant when applied to highly fractured porous media systematic practical and theoretical frameworks have not been proposed yet to develop effective methods for improvement of the remediation performance in heterogeneous systems national academies of sciences 2015 furthermore although most of the contaminant volume in a fractured medium resides in the matrix its recovery is minor by conventional methods due to the contrast in the capillary pressure of the matrix and that of the fracture national academies of sciences 2015 for example utilization of the pump and treat method that is commonly used to recover free phase contaminants is costly and inefficient in heterogeneous media marley et al 1992 one of the disadvantages of injecting water for remediation is complications with the downstream water treatment which is reviewed in igunnu and chen 2012 air sparging has been introduced as an alternative remediation process to recover the contaminants it is found effective in both unsaturated and saturated zones and it features a better strategy in terms of economic perspective forsyth and shao 1991 however the process of gas injection to recover liquids oil in eor and or liquid contaminants in remediation from porous media still suffers from the adverse mobility ratio between the displacing gas and displaced liquid fluids the presence of fractures and interconnected regions of high permeability triggers the mobility problem resulting in an even lower recovery performance for the liquids dullien 2012 despite the failure of the remediation performance in fractured porous media there are severe public health hazards from various contaminants in this type of sediments as a few examples in canada 40 000 l of poorly characterized chemical mostly chlorinated solvents acids and organic solvents was spilled into a highly fractured sediment 1 km ne of the town of smithville ontario and 15 km sw of the lake of ontario for which the pump and treat technique was found ineffective by analyzing 15 year sampling data 1994 2008 mclaren et al 2012 also water resource contamination by chlorinated solvents and pesticides point source occurred in fractured sediments 400 km long swath 50 m to 100 m deep extending from niagara falls to the bruce peninsula which was reported in the silurian dolostone fractured bedrock in ontario perrin et al 2011 arsenic as contaminants above the canadian guideline value of 10 mg l were found in fractured crystalline bedrock in the private water wells in the western quebec bondu et al 2017 recently a research study by javed and siddique 2016 showed a greater level of arsenic as in the groundwater aquifer near the thermal recovery sites in the cold lake oilfields alberta canada the contamination level was up to three times higher in the fractured sediments compared to homogeneous aquifers in a recent experimental study we proposed a methodology to improve the breakthrough recovery from a highly heterogeneous porous medium upon gas injection where a fracture interconnected the injection and production wells rezaei et al 2018 an exceptionally high recovery performance was achieved by adding a high capillary pressure skin to the production well and by continuously controlling the injection pressure below a threshold value to prevent the gas breakthrough rezaei et al 2018 employing this strategy we were able to increase the recovery factor from about 9 pore volume pv which was present in the percolating fracture network only to over 90 and 93 pv by horizontal and vertical gas injection modes respectively rezaei et al 2018 in the current research we conduct a follow up study using computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling to predict the threshold pressure condition and to propose an optimal operation the literature study on macro scale modeling of gas liquid drainage flow in porous media is extensive in areas such as enhanced oil recovery kazemi et al 1976 wu and pruess 1998 hoteit and firoozabadi 2006 ho and webb 2006 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 hoteit

2019 in the past decade there has been a significant improvement in the modeling performance of fluid flow in fractured porous media conventionally the multi phase flow in a heterogeneous medium is simulated by single porosity ghorayeb and firoozabadi 2000 and dual porosity warren and root 1963 kazemi 1969 models the single porosity models allow a sharp change in the petrophysical properties of the matrix and fracture domains however the ill condition in the numerical computation significantly limits the performance of the single porosity models ghorayeb and firoozabadi 2000 although the dual porosity models feature a better numerical performance they demand a matrix fracture transfer function so called transmissibility term which depends on the porous medium petrophysical and fluid properties reducing the generalization capability of the model hoteit and firoozabadi 2006 the use of mixed finite element method is found to reduce the problems with matrix fracture discontinuity furthermore with discontinuous galerkin finite element method numerical dispersion in the simulation can be avoided hoteit and firoozabadi 2006 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 in the framework of implicit pressure explicit composition impec higher order compositional modeling of 3d fractured media was also developed that improved the numerical performance of simulators in enhanced oil recovery and co2 storage applications moortgat and firoozabadi 2013 using mixed hybrid finite element with discontinuous galerkin formulation and by considering molecular diffusion gravity compositional and capillarity effects the higher order compositional models mimic the physics of process better moortgat and firoozabadi 2013 shahraeeni et al 2015 lately with the economic viability of recovering hydrocarbons from shale formations mathematical modeling of the gas flow in mesoscale fractured media has been advanced this progress is achieved by considering the nano confinement effects on the thermodynamic behavior jin et al 2013 jin and firoozabadi 2016 sandoval et al 2016 sandoval et al 2018 as well as the effects of knudsen diffusion and gas adsorption on the dynamics of the gas flow in fractured porous media swami et al 2013 lunati and lee 2014 wan et al 2015 song et al 2015 sun et al 2015 wu et al 2016 yu et al 2018 luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 despite significant advancement in the mathematical modeling of the gas flow in fractured porous media the numerical modeling of multi phase flow in systems consisting of matrix fracture and skin under controlled injection scheme is not available in the literature in this paper we develop a cfd model to simulate the hydrodynamic flow behavior in the fractured porous media featuring gas injection control with and without the gravitational effects the paper is structured as follows a background on mathematical model for immiscible two phase flow is given in section 2 in section 3 the implementation of developed model in comsol multiphysics software is provided section 4 is dedicated to the results and discussions for horizontal and vertical gas injection scenarios and section 5 includes conclusion remarks 2 mathematical modeling of immiscible two phase flow in porous media the modeling foundation of the immiscible two phase flow in porous media is constructed by the conservation equations for mass and momentum and by including auxiliary models for capillary pressure and relative permeability let the wetting phase to be identified by w and the non wetting phase with n in the following a macroscopic model of the porous medium is given mikyška 2005 the system involves the wetting phase w and the non wetting phase n or the solid phase the amount of mass transfer between the solid and other fluids either w or n is negligible in the case under study therefore the macroscopic mass conservation in phase α can be written as 1 ϕ ρ α s α t ρ α u α ρ α q α α w n where ϕ represents the porosity ρ α refers to the density of phase α s α is the saturation of phase α t is time u α is the velocity of phase α and q α denotes the flow rate of phase α as a sink or source within the domain ω ir d muskat s generalization of darcy s law for flow in porous media can be used for the velocity of each phase u α muskat 1949 2 u α kk r α μ α p α ρ α g where k is the absolute permeability of the porous media k r α is the relative permeability of phase α satisfying the condition 0 k r α 1 μ α introduces the viscosity of phase α p α is the pressure of phase α and g represents the gravity acceleration constant the saturations of both phases satisfy the physical constraint when the mass transfer with the solid phase is insignificant 3 s w s n 1 where s w and s n denote the saturation of wetting and non wetting phases respectively furthermore at thermodynamic equilibrium conditions the capillary pressure p c relates the pressure of the wetting phase p w and that of the non wetting phase p n for a curved interface through the following equation 4 p c s w p n p w for the two phase flow p c is a function of s w or s n 2 1 pressure saturation formulation for two phase flow in porous media eqs 2 4 form the mathematical structure of the immiscible flow in porous media we employ this model for gas injection process in a heterogeneous porous medium with a matrix a fracture and a skin rezaei et al 2018 in applications such as remediation and eor the saturation of the liquids is a key parameter in the case of remediation the saturation of non aqueous phase liquids or napl and in the eor the saturation of oil are of great importance furthermore in a gas injection process the pressure of the gas is critical as it can be related to the injection pressure and back pressure and because the pressure drop in the gas phase is much less than that in the liquid phase therefore in the mathematical formulation we adopt s w and p n as the dependent variables because the range of pressure variations in the experimental case study rezaei et al 2018 is small and that the experiments are conducted under atmospheric conditions we neglect the compressibility effects furthermore the porous medium is assumed to be anisotropic in each of the domains matrix fracture and or skin for which the porosity and permeability do not change with space and time the mobility of phase α is given by λ α k r α μ α for the two phase flow in porous media λ α λ α s α furthermore total mobility is defined as λ t λ w λ n combining eqs 1 and 2 writing equations for both wetting and non wetting phases and implementing the assumptions result in 5 ϕ s w t k λ w p w ρ w g q w 6 ϕ s n t k λ n p n ρ n g q n by considering the physical constraint see eq 3 and assuming that the equilibrium condition holds it follows that s w t s n t total flow rate can be defined as q t q w q n therefore by adding eqs 5 and 6 the first term in the left hand side will be eliminated to obtain the equations in terms of p n we use eq 4 which results in p w p n p c because p c p c s w then p c dp c ds w s w by adding eqs 5 and 6 and then manipulating the mathematical expressions the following equations are obtained 7 ϕ s w t k λ w p n dp c ds w s w ρ w g q w 8 k λ t p n k λ w dp c ds w s w k λ w ρ w g k λ n ρ n g q t eqs 7 and 8 provide the formulation in terms of p n and s w the model needs equations to correlate the capillary pressure and relative permeability to the saturation of wetting phase the auxiliary flow models express the capillary pressure p c p c s w and relative permeability functions k rw k rw s w and k rn k rn s w in terms of one of the model independent variables s w this correlation is hidden in the terms λ w and λ n in eqs 7 and 8 2 2 auxiliary models both the capillary pressure and relative permeability models use an effective saturation which normalizes the desired reducible saturation e g s w s wr for the wetting phase and s n s nr for the non wetting phase against the overall reducible saturation of both phases e g 1 s wr s nr where s wr and s nr are the residual saturation for the wetting and non wetting phases respectively as given below 9 s ew s w s wr 1 s wr s nr we adopt the capillary pressure from brooks and corey 1964 10 p c p t s ew 1 λ where p t is the non wetting phase threshold pressure from the idealized model required to advance into a completely saturated porous medium as seen in the simulation results the value of p t is different from the entry capillary pressure p e the parameter λ characterizes the pore size distribution of the porous medium usually values of λ range from 0 2 to 5 brooks and corey 1964 higher values of λ are used for highly homogeneous porous media for which the pore size distribution is narrow as the spherical glass beads of narrow size distribution are used in our case study we adopt λ 5 for all domains including matrix fracture and skin we also examine the van genuchten 1980 capillary pressure model for the relative permeability model we adopt the relative permeability model by mualem 1976 which features an extra parameter κ compared to the brooks and corey 1964 relative permeability model accounting for the effects of pore size distribution on the relative permeability 11 k rw s ew 2 5 2 λ 12 k rn 1 s ew κ 1 s ew 1 1 λ 2 as eqs 7 and 8 are expressed in terms of p n and s w the capillary pressure eq 10 and relative permeability models eqs 11 and 12 are all in terms of s w κ can be used as a fitting parameter to improve the relative permeability behavior of the two phase flow in porous media schaap and leij 2000 3 model implementation in comsol multiphysics we use the mathematical model framework explained earlier to model the case of controlled gas injection in heterogeneous porous media incorporating matrix fracture and skin studied by rezaei et al 2018 3 1 porous media properties a schematic of the porous medium used in the case study is given in fig 1 this model includes three main regions namely matrix white region fracture blue hatched and skin red hatched there is also an additional layer identified by filled solid blue at the end of the fracture to account for the effect of mixing glass beads at the neighboring domains to simulate the physical model packing rezaei et al 2018 there are two cylindrical ports considered for the flow inlet and outlet the direction of flow is indicated above fig 1 showing left to right injection the model dimensions are based on the real porous medium in our previous work rezaei et al 2018 all dimensions are in cm the model thickness perpendicular to the plane is approximately 0 3 cm the porosity and permeability of each domain are listed as shown in table 1 in fig 1 the mixed region is included to simulate the change in the porosity and permeability at the boundaries between regions having different bead sizes this mixed boundary is also noticed in the experimental work since loose glass beads of different sizes are packed in one step prior to consolidation at a boundary between two regions smaller beads can fill the pore spaces between the larger beads therefore a sharp interface cannot be obtained in reality this change in the polydispersity of the beads in the mixed zone alters the porous medium properties such as porosity permeability and capillary pressure adding this mixed layer increases the number of model parameters we were able to obtain satisfactory results in terms of recovery without this mixed region however it led to unrealistic parameters for relative permeability and capillary pressure the reason is that without the mixed region a higher polydispersity should be used in the individual domains matrix fracture and skin to compensate for the higher polydispersity that is overlooked at the boundaries the addition of this mixed layer improves the quality of fitting resulting in more meaningful parameters 3 2 mathematical pde equations in comsol multiphysics the general form of partial differential equation pde environment in comsol is given by 13 e a 2 u t 2 d a u t c u α u γ β u au f the interpretation of the terms in eq 13 is found elsewhere nucera and lanza di scalea 2013 for our system of equations defined by eqs 7 and 8 the variables and coefficients are given as follows 14 u p n s w d a 0 0 0 ϕ c k λ w λ t λ w dp c ds w 1 dp c ds w f q t q w γ kg λ w ρ w λ n ρ n λ w ρ w where u is the vector of dependent variables e a is the mass transfer coefficient d a resembles the damping coefficient c represents the diffusion coefficient α is the conservative flux convection coefficient γ is the convection flux source sink term β is the convection coefficient a is absorption coefficient and f introduces the source sink term due to the small thickness of the model its behavior can be described as a 2d model the values of e a α β a 0 the coefficient γ is related to the gravitational effect the magnitude of γ that is shown in eq 14 is for the case of vertical gas injection in the case of horizontal injection γ 0 as the thickness of the model is only 3 mm and that the effect of gravity on phase distribution can be neglected in the simulations the horizontal injection does not include the gravity effects while the vertical injection scenario considers the impact of gravity on pressure and phase saturation 3 3 boundary and initial conditions the initial conditions for the system of two phase flow in porous media described by eqs 7 and 8 are based on the experimental conditions used in the case study where the porous medium is initially saturated completely with the wetting phase water and the system is held at atmospheric back pressure rezaei et al 2018 therefore p n t 0 0 and s w t 0 1 for the boundary conditions the no flow condition applies at the solid boundaries without flow continuity for more details on the boundary conditions and connectivity of the matrix fracture you may refer to zendehboudi et al 2012 upon injecting the gas phase into a fully saturated porous medium the gas breaks through the largest pores at the inlet face decreasing the wetting phase saturation s w towards the residual saturation practically the time for the s w at the inlet face to reach the residual saturation is not comparable to the time frame of the gas injection more details are available elsewhere rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 therefore it is possible to simplify the model by assuming that the injection face is always at the residual saturation s w in 1 s wr for t 0 where s wr is the residual wetting saturation in a specific domain of the porous medium matrix fracture or skin because the input ports are located in the fracture as seen in fig 1 this condition first applies to the fracture inlet face as it has significantly larger pore sizes compared to those in the matrix it follows that the wetting phase saturation at the fracture inlet face will reach residual saturation while the matrix and skin can be still fully saturated with the wetting phase at the outlet face the boundary condition s w out fixed applies before the gas breakthrough for a strongly liquid wet system it can be assumed that s w out 1 s wr after the gas breakthrough for p n the inlet condition is dictated by either constant injection rate where p n fixed or by constant injection pressure where p n fixed the outlet condition for pressure is dictated by the back pressure which is atmospheric in the case study rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 3 4 model discretization and mesh geometry triangular elements are used as the geometry of the mesh element initially the quality of the overall mesh is set to be extra fine comsol default with a maximum element size of 1 mm then the number of nodes at each boundary is doubled because p n is large at the boundaries as demonstrated in fig 2 initially we did not include the mixed region shown with a filled blue region in fig 1 and realistic modeling of the experiments could not be materialized one issue was related to the mixing of the large glass beads in the fracture with the smaller beads in the matrix and smaller ones in the skin the addition of this mixed layer at the end of the fracture helped to capture the physics and involved momentum transfer of process better 4 results and discussions in the following section we show the results of the cfd model that was developed in the previous section backward differential formula bdf solver is used as a dynamic implicit solver for the set of differential algebraic equations daes a tolerance of 1 10 6 is used for the absolute error the processing time for an equivalent of one second gas injection of the described model with 30 000 nodes is ranged from 100 to 1 200 ms depending on the operating conditions on a workstation with 8 cores i7 6700 cpu 3 41 ghz processor and 16 gb memory 4 1 parameter estimation the mathematical framework of flow in porous media that was described earlier needs auxiliary models for two phase capillary pressure see eq 10 and two phase relative permeability functions see eqs 11 and 12 these models include parameters such as the entry pressure for the non wetting phase p n connectivity factor κ pore size distribution parameter λ as well as parameters related to the gas liquid process in eq 9 such as the residual saturation for the wetting s wr and non wetting s nr phases in the absence of direct measurements of capillary pressure and relative permeability for each domain matrix fracture and skin of the heterogeneous model the parameter estimation is only possible from a back calculation using pressure and recovery experimental data rezaei et al 2018 to evaluate the relative significance of viscous and capillary pressure it is possible to assess the capillary number which is defined as the ratio of viscous to capillary forces for a drainage system where the non wetting phase is displacing the wetting phase the capillary number n c can be defined

resembles the surface tension between the wetting and non wetting phases ϕ symbolizes the porosity a is the cross section area for the displacement and q n is the flow rate of the non wetting phase

wetting phase initially invades the fracture only under this low capillary number chatzis and morrow 1984 the viscous forces can be neglected for the fracture similar calculations show the same result for the matrix the calculation procedure for the skin is not straightforward as the cross section area a is not known for the percolating non wetting interface due to this low capillary number it is feasible to obtain the entry pressure p e from the pressure signal related to the intrusion of the non wetting phase into each part matrix fracture and skin we change the entry pressure to fit the pressure difference that enables gas invasion into a finer less permeable region therefore by fitting the pressure signal at a low injection rate we obtain the entry pressure of all domains as summarized in table 2 for all regions the parameter λ 5 is considered this parameter dictates the shape of capillary pressure curve and is more affected by the pore size distribution rather than the mean pore size in the experiments highly spherical glass beads with narrow size distributions are used hence the assumption of λ 5 for all model parts zones to simulate the experimental conditions seems reasonable although is not perfectly realistic when capillary pressure measurements are not available for the individual domains the value of κ is obtained by fitting the pressure and recovery data rezaei et al 2018 to identify the parameters we initially set the connectivity factor and entry pressure at a guessed value and then change the entry pressure by δ p t 0 1 kpa increments until the slope of pressure versus time during the gas invasion into the fracture matches the experimental values then the connectivity factor is changed by δ κ 1 increments and the injection pressure results from the model at 5 cm3 h which is the lowest value used in the experiments are fitted to those of the experimental pressure data rezaei et al 2018 the values of p t in table 2 are higher than the p e for the invasion of the non wetting phase into the different regions of the model for example we observe gas breakthrough at a pressure drop 3 1 kpa while the p t value of the skin from brooks and corey s capillary pressure model is 10 5 kpa therefore for p n 10 5 kpa no breakthrough is expected based on the model while in reality it happens even at 3 1 kpa the reason for such a discrepancy is related to using the idealized capillary pressures by brooks and corey which dismisses the initial non linear increase in p c with s w at s w 1 we also use the capillary pressure by van genuchten 1980 that considers a smooth increase in capillary pressure at s w 1 however the model causes the development of the non wetting phase in the matrix and skin due to numerical dispersion 4 2 model validation after constructing the mathematical model its accuracy is validated with experimental data for further sensitivity analysis investigation the model validation stage is conducted by comparing the experimental results for both horizontal and vertical gas injection tests conducted at a constant injection rate with those from the numerical simulation 4 2 1 horizontal drainage the horizontal drainage tests are conducted at constant injection rates of 5 10 20 and 30 cm3 h we compare the experimental and cfd results for the horizontal injection case at a constant injection rate in fig 3 showing an excellent fit between the injection pressure data obtained in the experiments and the cfd model the model is capable of capturing different features of the injection pressure as depicted in fig 3 this includes an early increase in the pressure to make feasible the gas penetration into the fracture another pressure jump is observed when the fracture is completely invaded leading to advancement of the non wetting phase into the matrix then pressure stays constant as the matrix is homogeneous and the viscous pressure drop is insignificant due to small capillary number n c 10 8 10 7 as the saturation of the non wetting phase at the outlet face of matrix increases the mobility of the wetting phase λ n decreases quickly rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 therefore the gas will be pressurized to enable fluid invasion into the skin this is due to the contrast in the capillary pressures of the matrix and skin at this stage a sudden increase in the pressure is observed without controlling the injection pressure the non wetting phase will break through the skin during this later pressurization stage the cfd model can accurately estimate the breakthrough pressure as observed in fig 3 the estimation of threshold pressure is important as the recovery enhancement mechanism relies on controlling the injection pressure below this threshold value in fig 4 a comparison is made between the horizontal drainage test and the cfd model where an injection rate of 30 cm3 h is set in the experiments rezaei et al 2018 the flow rate is successively reduced to half to avoid the injection pressure exceeding the threshold pressure for the breakthrough condition rezaei et al 2018 controlled the pressure within a 10 safe margin from the threshold breakthrough capillary pressure in the cfd modeling we drop the injection flow rate at corresponding simulation time similar to that in the experiment according to fig 4 the pressure drop behavior upon flow rate manipulation is not exactly followed by the model initially when the pressure varies rapidly at a later stage t 300 min the system dynamics becomes considerably slower and the model can simulate the stabilized pressure behavior another essential criterion for the model validity is the capability of the cfd model to estimate the recovery behavior of the wetting phase upon gas injection a comparison is made in fig 5 implying that the recovery factor is initially calculated better by the cfd model although the pore volume pv of the matrix fracture and skin are individually known in the experiments performed by rezaei et al 2018 their porosity values are now individually measured uncertainties exist for the thickness of the model 0 3 mm in the sintering process the model thickness will not remain constant because of the gravity effect as well as the differences in the sintering dynamics for glass beads of different sizes in these three regions the initial recovery is achieved from the fracture after some time the recovery from the matrix starts because the matrix contributes to the majority of the model pv a small error in the estimation of matrix porosity will cause error propagation in the cumulative recovery plot as shown in fig 5 we also compare the saturation distributions from cfd model with those from experiments rezaei et al 2018 this comparison is shown in fig 6 based on the saturation of the wetting and non wetting phases for the horizontal gas injection process conducted at a constant flow rate of 10 cm3 h in the experiments by rezaei et al 2018 pictures were occasionally captured during the displacement process in fig 6 the cfd model results are compared with those from the experiments at six different injection times after 8 5 min figs 6 a and 6 b 17 5 min figs 6 c and 6 d 30 5 min figs 6 e and 6 f 40 5 min figs 6 g and 6 h 60 5 min figs 6 i and 6 j and 120 5 min figs 6 k and 6 l the snapshots from the simulation exhibit good agreement between the recovery values as well as the fluid distribution behavior see fig 6 referring to the reasons stated earlier the idealized model does not perfectly match the behavior due to lack of understanding about the real porosity permeability and model thickness in each domain furthermore in the experiments minor heterogeneities exist in each domain during the model packing however the critical times for the matrix fracture and skin gas invasion are captured by the model for example pannels a and b of fig 6 both show that initially the fracture is invaded without any intrusion of the gas phase into the matrix fig 6 a is slightly behind the experiment as compared to fig 6 b after 30 5 min the fracture is completely invaded and invasion into matrix starts as demonstrated in figs 6 e and 6 f furthermore after 40 5 min both the cfd model and the experiment show the arrival of the gas phase at the skin side without any invasion into the skin after about two hours both the model and experiment predict that the gas phase occupies the entire outlet face of the matrix without having a breakthrough at this time the recovery values from the model and experiment are 0 452 and 0 498 pv respectively figs 6 f l reveal minor packing non homogeneity from the signatures of the developed fingers and bypassed regions of the non wetting phase gas trapped in the continuum of the water phase we compare the recovery results from the vertical model conducted at different constant injection rates in the range 10 50 cm3 h as seen in fig 8 the model underestimates the recovery data especially at a low injection rate e g 10 cm3 h based on fig 8 similar to the case of pressure shown in fig 7 the cfd results at high injection rates 40 and 50 cm3 h exhibit a better match for the recovery factor with respect to the experimental results used in the current study one of the reasons that may contribute to a better match at high injection rates is that the flow communication between matrix and fracture is less pronounced under high injection rate conditions at extreme cases the gas only goes into the fracture without any recovery from the matrix further information is available elsewhere zendehboudi et al 2012 in the actual experiments rezaei et al 2018 the fracture is idealized by packing of higher permeability at the matrix fracture boundary the mixing of small beads in the matrix and large beads in fracture increases the polydispersity for a thin layer of mixed beads with different porosity and permeability values the flow communication between the matrix and fracture is affected by this uncertainty related to the resistance at the border of matrix and fracture parts thus the higher injection rate simulations are expected to represent the tests better as a result of lower matrix fracture flow communication 4 2 2 vertical drainage we also compare the cfd model and experimental results in vertical drainage displacement conducted at constant injection rates similar to the case of horizontal injection we present the results of injection pressure recovery and saturation for the vertical drainage system in the vertical drainage mode the gravity helps the communication between the matrix and fracture providing a higher driving force compared to the gradient of capillary pressure which acts in horizontal injection tests zendehboudi et al 2012 a comparison between the real and simulation injection pressures in the vertical mode is given in fig 7 showing the dynamics of gas injection pressure at five different injection rates 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm3 h the experimental data are taken from our previous research investigation presented in rezaei et al 2018 fig 7 reveals that at higher injection rates a better match is obtained also the model is capable of predicting the breakthrough pressure therefore by adjusting the injection pressure below this threshold value the breakthrough can be delayed according to fig 7 an initial negative pressure is noticed this condition happens if the rate of injection is less than the rate obtained by the free fall gravity drainage process zendehboudi et al 2012 the cfd model can forecast the time for a rapid increase in pressure with time this rapid pressurization is due to the accumulation of the non wetting phase at skin in this case there is no sufficient pressure gradient across the skin to maintain the breakthrough condition rezaei and firoozabadi 2014 the evolution of the gas saturation based on the cfd model is depicted in fig 9 for the case of vertical injection at a constant injection rate of 10 cm3 h initially an invasion of the fracture is only observed when the driving force in the fracture hydrostatic height decreases a higher driving force in the matrix can compensate for its higher resistance e g lower permeability compared to the fracture at this point the matrix will also be invaded which is in agreement with experiments and simulation results by zendehboudi et al 2012 if there is no skin and that the fracture length is equal to the model length it starts from top to bottom of the model the breakthrough condition happens as the interface reaches the bottom of the model in the fracture the presence of skin delays the gas breakthrough and a high recovery factor of about 87 is predicted from the simulation results this value is 93 in the experiments both the simulation and experimental results confirm the viability of controlled gas injection with a thin layer of skin applied to the production well for improving the recovery upon gas injection the cfd model will provide a general framework for the operation of injection processes to maximize the recovery even at the cost of reduced recovery rate this proposed strategy might not be interesting in the eor projects because of the increased pressure drop at the skin that decreases the oil production rate however the process mechanism is of great interest in processes such as remediation and membrane separation a summary of results for gas injection with and without the gravity effects is presented in table 3 based on the simulation runs and experimental work the average absolute deviations aads attained in estimating the injection pressure in kpa and recovery factor in fraction of the pv data are listed in table 3 these results cover the constant injection flow rate in the range of 5 50 cm3 h 4 3 optimal operation the simulation results that are presented up to this section are obtained by the model after it was tuned with the experimental data of rezaei et al 2018 it is possible to inject the gas phase at a controlled pressure less than the threshold breakthrough pressure from the beginning of injection in the experimental work constant injection pumps were not available and as a results this objective is studied through mathematical simulation after the performance of the numerical model is verified with the experimental data we use the tuned model as a predictive tool to study the effect of injection pressure on the recovery performance this case study simulates a constant injection pressure scenario and provides insight into the optimal operation of the gas injection process with maximized breakthrough recovery factor providing further clarifications the constant injection rate case is used to simulate the experimental data for the model calibration and validation purposes however the constant injection pressure simulations are used for the parametric sensitivity analysis simulation studies are conducted at an injection pressure in the range p inj 3 1 3 9 kpa the recovery factor at breakthrough rf b and the time to reach breakthrough t b are compared in fig 10 showing that with a decrease in the injection pressure the recovery factor and the time to reach breakthrough increase as it is expected however it seems to be an optimal value by considering both factors rf b and t b at p inj 3 1 and 3 3 kpa rf b 0 808 and 0 785 pv respectively with 3 relative difference however the breakthrough occurs after 176 min at 3 3 kpa and 432 min at 3 1 kpa injection pressure respectively therefore operating the system at p inj 3 3 kpa is more practical as the recovery process is 2 45 times faster the dynamic behavior of the recovery factor in pv for different gas injection simulation cases at constant injection pressures is shown in fig 11 at an injection pressure of 3 kpa a breakthrough is not possible within the simulation time frame up to 450 min as observed in fig 11 although the recovery takes longer the production rate beyond this time is not practically significant a comparison between the injection pressure data 3 1 3 9 kpa shows that with increasing the injection pressure the time for the non wetting phase to reach the skin is shorter and a lower recovery value is obtained however this is not the case for the injection pressure in the range 3 1 3 3 kpa for which the recovery factor at breakthrough does not change considerably all recovery plots demonstrate a similar trend up to the point where the non wetting phase reaches the skin with increasing the injection pressure the fingering mechanism becomes more pronounced contributing to earlier breakthrough with increasing pressure the magnitudes of breakthrough recovery obtained from the cfd model for the constant injection rate and constant injection pressure cases are reported in fig 12 for the horizontal injection system with and without the pressure control the recovery dynamics of the constant injection pressure at 3 kpa is also depicted in fig 12 for comparison at this injection pressure breakthrough does not occur within the time frame of 450 min as it is observed in fig 12 rf b for constant injection pressure values of 3 9 and 3 5 kpa are similar to those at constant injection rates of 30 and 20 cm3 h respectively the deviation between the performance of the constant injection rate and constant injection pressure occurs at an injection pressure of p inj 3 5 kpa in general the magnitudes of rf b for constant injection pressure cases are more than those for the constant injection rate scenarios interestingly the values of rf b for the case of constant injection rate both with and without flow control fall on the recovery plot obtained for injection at the lowest pressure value of 3 kpa where the breakthrough event is not noticed as it is expected those tests with controlling the flow rate have a higher recovery performance for example at the injection rate of 10 cm3 h the recovery value increases from 0 681 pv to 0 756 pv when the injection flow rate is manipulated to control the injection pressure below the threshold value for the breakthrough condition in the experiments these recovery values are 0 739 pv without control and 0 881 with control respectively rezaei et al 2018 there is a gas continuum in the fracture starting from the injection side because the gas phase does not hold a significant pressure gradient by imposing a higher injection pressure a large pressure gradient will also apply across the skin this condition will facilitate the onset of breakthrough whenever the pressure difference across the skin overcomes the breakthrough capillary pressure plus viscous pressure drop of the advancing interface in the skin the breakthrough condition occurs for this reason the gas breakthrough is experienced at a lower recovery value by increasing the injection pressure 5 conclusions an implicit pressure explicit composition impec mathematical model is used to capture the gas injection dynamics in a porous medium consisting of matrix fracture and skin parts based on the methodology proposed in this study the injection pressure can be controlled below a threshold value to delay the breakthrough condition leading to an increase in the recovery at breakthrough the following conclusions are made from this computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling study the mixed finite element framework predicts the optimal injection pressure to attain the maximum recovery through a faster recovery process compared to the case of constant injection rate the cfd mathematical model captures features of the multi phase flow such as the injection pressure and recovery dynamics in a porous system with matrix fracture and skin for different injection rates and model orientations the cfd model can accurately forecast the injection pressure corresponding to the breakthrough condition knowledge of this threshold pressure is necessary for a controlled injection strategy to increase the recovery from highly fractured porous media a thin layer with intermediate petrophysical properties is required in addition to matrix fracture and skin to resemble the mixing of beads at the interface between two regions by operating the injection gas at a threshold pressure value below the breakthrough capillary threshold a high recovery factor of more than 80 pv is achieved from the mathematical model without using skin and controlled pressure scheme this recovery value based on simulation runs is limited to only 9 which is the pore volume pv corresponding to the fracture the mathematical cfd approach can model the gas injection process using successively decreasing injection rates starting from the highest possible flow rate that is practical the mathematical model can be employed to determine the duration of fluid flow in different heterogeneous regions which is useful in making effective and meaningful control decisions credit authorship contribution statement

5711,understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale over a long time period is challenging due to the lack of data and effective statistical approaches to characterize complex natural processes and anthropogenic activities we applied a recently developed cluster analysis method to investigate spatial and temporal patterns and controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry in the confined aquifer of the jianghan plain china the cluster analysis is applied to a dataset of 13 024 groundwater geochemical measurements for 11 geochemical parameters of 1 184 groundwater samples collected over 23 years from 29 monitoring wells distributed over the jianghan plain the cluster analysis yielded a classification of seven clusters and the classification was confirmed by using principal component analysis and stiff and piper diagrams based on the spatial distribution of the seven clusters the jianghan plain is separated into four geochemical zones i e recharge zone transition zone flow through zone and discharge mixing zone along the regional groundwater flow path which has not been attempted in the past the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry are controlled by short and long term factors of water rock interactions and anthropogenic activities a particular finding of this study is that the three gorges reservoir has a long term impact on groundwater geochemistry because the reservoir increased river discharge to groundwater after 2009 this study demonstrates that using the cluster analysis method together with hydrogeochemical analysis can identify spatiotemporal patterns and controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale over a long monitoring period keywords statistical analysis geochemical zones water rock interactions jianghan plain three gorges dam 1 introduction a thorough understanding of groundwater geochemistry is critical for protecting groundwater resources under the conditions of changing climate growing population and decreasing freshwater availability cloutier et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 gorelick and zheng 2015 han et al 2016 landon et al 2011 groundwater geochemistry is driven by various natural processes and anthropogenic activities güler and thyne 2004a güler et al 2002 reghunath et al 2002 tóth 1999 2009 and may vary both in space and time understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry not only requires designing a monitoring network to collect the right data in terms of data constitutes collection locations collection times etc for tackling the problem of interest but also requires using appropriate statistical methods to extract the spatial and temporal patterns embedded in measurements of groundwater geochemistry parameters more importantly hydrogeochemical analysis is needed to understand the natural and anthropogenic factors that control the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry while obtaining a large amount of monitoring data for a region scale study is not uncommon e g feyereisen et al 2007 güler and thyne 2004b jessen et al 2017 it is still challenging to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns hidden in the data and to understand the controlling factors of the patterns at the regional scale this study addresses these two challenges by using a recently developed method of cluster analysis together with hydrogeochemical analysis for a regional aquifer in central china using cluster analysis together with hydrogeochemical analysis has advanced our understanding on spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry cloutier et al 2008 kim et al 2003 nguyen et al 2015 shrestha and kazama 2007 simeonov et al 2003 wang et al 2015 this is always done in two steps in the first step cluster analysis is conducted to classify groundwater geochemical data into a number of clusters each of which reflects its own composition of groundwater geochemistry subsequently hydrogeochemical analysis is conducted for the clusters to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in groundwater geochemistry when dealing with spatiotemporal data obtained from a long term monitoring network many clustering methods have two limitations on how clusters are classified one limitation is that cluster classification is conducted only for temporal means i e the means over the entire sampling period e g qian et al 2007 sayemuzzaman et al 2018 while this kind of cluster analysis can help identify spatial patterns it cannot be used to understand temporal patterns the other limitation is that cluster classification is conducted separately to data of different sampling times or hydrological conditions e g hussain et al 2008 thyne et al 2004 this kind of cluster analysis may be inadequate to simultaneously reveal spatial and temporal patterns when groundwater geochemistry substantially changes over time because the number of clusters and the geochemical characteristics of the clusters can be dramatically different before and after the changes addressing the two limitations requires a cluster analysis method that deals with data in space and time simultaneously and can reveal spatial and temporal patterns pacheco castro et al 2018 recently developed a cluster classification method that has the potential to overcome the two limitations discussed above instead of conducting cluster classification for temporal means or data of different sampling times the cluster analysis of pacheco castro et al 2018 is conducted for the entire monitoring data collected at all monitoring wells and sampling times if groundwater samples are collected from m monitoring wells at s sampling times and p geochemical parameters are measured for each of m s groundwater samples the measurements form a matrix that has m s rows and p columns the cluster classification method of pacheco castro et al 2018 yields a column vector of m s elements of clustering index for the combination of sampling wells and sampling times this vector leads to s snapshots of clusters in space since the cluster classification is conducted for all monitoring data the number of clusters and their geochemical characteristics are the same for each snapshot this makes it possible to jointly study the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry linking the snapshots to geological hydrogeological and geochemical knowledge of the site of interest can help understand the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry this can be illustrated in the following two scenarios 1 if the natural and anthropogenic factors controlling groundwater geochemistry are similar at several monitoring wells the geochemistry at the wells should be similar and the wells should belong to the same cluster studying the spatial distribution of the clusters can reveal large scale patterns of groundwater geochemistry which in turn helps identify the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry in space 2 if groundwater geochemistry changes at the wells the wells may belong to another cluster therefore studying the temporal changes of the clusters can reveal temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry which in turn helps identify the factors that control groundwater geochemistry in time pacheco castro et al 2018 applied their cluster classification method to 288 groundwater samples collected over three years 2009 2011 from a karst aquifer in in yucatan mexico they found the following 1 groundwater geochemistry at the west and in the coastal area of the site is controlled by seawater intrusion and sulfate rich groundwater 2 groundwater geochemistry at the middle and east part of the site is controlled by water rock interactions and annual precipitation respectively and 3 groundwater geochemistry at two local areas of the site is controlled by anthropogenic activities they also found that temporal variation of groundwater geochemistry at the site is caused by groundwater dilution due to changes in the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation since the cluster analysis of pacheco castro et al 2018 was for a small dataset collected over a short monitoring period it is necessary to further evaluate their method for a large dataset over a long monitoring period the evaluation was conducted in this study by using a large amount of monitoring data collected from the confined aquifer of jianghan plain an alluvial plain located in central china with an area of approximately 27 400 km2 fig 1 the yangtze river the world s third longest river flows through the plain and the three gorges dam the world s largest hydroelectric project is about 80 km upstream of the plain fig 1 groundwater is mainly of ca mg hco3 water type due to dissolution of carbonate minerals gan et al 2014 yu et al 2017 zhou et al 2012 this area is undergoing extensive agricultural activities and 72 of the land is for agricultural use fig 1 anthropogenic activities have affected groundwater geochemistry of the regional aquifer yang et al 2018 to monitor groundwater quality a monitoring network was established in 1990 and a large amount of monitoring data have been collected during the past three decades for a total of 21 groundwater geochemistry parameters specified by the national quality standard for ground water of china ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china 1994 the 21 parameters are ph temperature alkalinity total dissolved solids tds hardness concentrations of seven major ions ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 and hco3 and concentrations of minor ions and trace constituents no2 no3 nh4 fe3 fe2 fe mn2 f and total as groundwater contaminants reported in literature include arsenic duan et al 2015 2017 gan et al 2014 and wastewater infiltration niu et al 2017 in the confined aquifer and nitrate yang et al 2017 2018 in the shallow aquifer of jianghan plain however there are few published analyses of groundwater geochemistry at the plain scale except the paper of niu et al 2017 who reported the temporal trends of multiple groundwater geochemistry e g cl so4 2 and no3 but did not analyze spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry the overall spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors at the plain scale are still unknown this study used the groundwater geochemistry data collected over the period of 1992 2014 the dataset consists of a total of 13 024 geochemistry measurements for 1 184 groundwater samples each of which has 11 selected groundwater geochemistry parameters ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 nh4 f and fe this large dataset enables us to evaluate whether the cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 can help better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors for a regional aquifer over a long period of 23 years based on the cluster analysis and hydrogeochemical analysis we delineated for the first time four zones of groundwater geochemistry at the site which are related to aquifer recharge regional groundwater flow water rock interactions and anthropogenic activities the four zones should be of value for future study of detailed groundwater geochemistry at the local scale we also identified the long term impacts of the three gorges reservoir on groundwater geochemistry downstream of the reservoir while the impacts of dam construction and operation on river hydrology have been well documented guo et al 2018 nilsson et al 2005 zhou et al 2013 little is known about the impacts on groundwater geochemistry this study provides a new insight on using cluster analysis for understanding long term evolution of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale 2 study area jianghan plain is a semi closed basin with high elevation 350 m in the northwest and low elevation 25 m in the southeast portion of the plain and the regional groundwater flow is from northwest to southeast based on precipitation data from the jingzhou meteorological station provided by the china meteorological data service center available at http data cma cn monthly average precipitation for the period of 1992 2014 ranges from 24 mm in december to 161 mm in july with 41 of precipitation occurring from june to august mean annual rainfall increases from the northwest 950 mm yr to the southeast 1 350 mm yr wang 2009 the quaternary alluvial lacustrine sediments deposited on the top of the bed rocks form the following three aquifers the phreatic aquifer with holocene and upper late pleistocene deposits 0 20 m depth the middle confined aquifer with late pleistocene and middle pleistocene deposits 20 100 m depth and the deep confined aquifer with early pleistocene 100 280 depth the main mineralogical compositions of the aquifer sediments are clay minerals about 29 50 wt and quartz about 31 54 wt high contents of carbonate up to 20 wt and albite up to 21 wt are also detected in the sandy sediments duan et al 2016 2017 discontinuous silty clay and embedded clay lenses 5 10 m in thickness compose as the local aquitards between the phreatic and middle confined aquifer gan et al 2018 the middle confined aquifer is the primary water supply for domestic agricultural and industrial water uses and accounts for 64 of the total groundwater exploitation in jianghan plain zhao 2005 the studies of duan 2016 and gan et al 2014 indicate that the middle confined aquifer is under reducing conditions with an average oxidation reduction potential of 102 mv and that the aquifer is enriched with organic matter with an average concentration of dissolved organic carbon of 6 mg l water geochemistry of the middle confined aquifer is the focus of this study and all groundwater samples considered in this study were taken from this aquifer the middle confined aquifer is referred to herein as the aquifer analyses of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes suggest that rainfall is the main recharge source of the aquifer du et al 2017 groundwater recharge mainly occurs in the west part of the plain where unconfined or semi confined conditions prevail due to outcrops of the aquifer sediments leakage from the yangtze river is another important recharge source as its thalweg elevation is lower than the elevation of the confining layer of the aquifer for most of the river reach downstream from the three gorges dam fig s1 in the supplementary information due to the direct interaction between the yangtze river and the aquifer along the river groundwater discharges to the river during dry seasons and receives recharge from the river during wet seasons he and tang 2017 the invading river water affects groundwater geochemistry in the aquifer by mixing waters with different chemical compositions especially after the quasi normal stage of the three gorges dam as discussed in detail below 3 data and statistical procedures groundwater samples were collected from 29 monitoring wells fig 1 twice a year during 1992 2014 one in the dry season from january to february and the other in the wet season from july to august since not all the wells were sampled regularly over the 23 years the total number of samples is 1 190 less than 1 334 29 23 2 for the 21 groundwater geochemistry parameters 11 parameters were selected for the cluster analysis and they are ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 nh4 f and fe temperature was excluded because it mainly reflects physical characteristic of groundwater but this study is focused on groundwater geochemistry hardness tds and alkalinity were excluded because they can be obtained directly from the 11 parameters for example alkalinity can be approximated by the concentration of hco3 given that ph values for most samples are less than 8 3 appelo and postma 2005 concentrations of mn2 no2 no3 as fe2 and fe3 were excluded because they were not continuously measured over the 23 years since no3 concentrations are of growing concern to groundwater quality we conducted another cluster analysis for a smaller dataset with no3 included as a parameter and the results are compared with those for the 11 parameters in section 5 2 for the 11 selected geochemical parameters censored data measured concentration values below detection limits were reported for 335 groundwater samples for nh4 35 samples for fe 14 samples for so4 2 9 samples for cl and 8 samples for f a common practice of processing censored data is to either exclude them from water quality analysis güler and thyne 2004b or replace them with a value lower than detection limits cloutier et al 2008 sanford et al 1993 to utilize the data to the extent possible and by following vantrump and miesch 1977 we replaced the censored data by 75 of the detection limits afterward the charge balance error of the geochemical measurements was calculated following güler et al 2002 and ghesquière et al 2015 six samples with charge balance error above 10 were excluded from further analysis the final dataset used for the cluster analysis includes 13 024 groundwater geochemical measurements forming a data matrix of 1 184 rows and 11 columns corresponding to 1 184 groundwater samples and 11 geochemical parameters of each sample cluster analysis for this large amount of groundwater geochemical measurements is seldom reported in literature for the 13 024 groundwater geochemical measurements hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were conducted by using python with scipy v0 19 library jones et al 2001 since the two statistical analyses have been well described in literature cloutier et al 2008 güler et al 2002 pant et al 2018 we only describe here how the two analyses were implemented in this study following the literature güler et al 2002 ghesquière et al 2015 pacheco castro et al 2018 qian et al 2007 we first applied the log transformation to the geochemical data and then standardized the transformed data by using the z score calculation subtracting sample mean and dividing the residuals by sample standard deviation to remove the impacts of parameter units on the statistical analysis the hierarchical cluster analysis of this study used the ward s method with euclidean distance ward 1963 which calculates the distance between a pair of water samples in the space of the 11 groundwater geochemical parameters the ward s method uses an analysis of variance approach to evaluate the distances between clusters and minimizes the sum of squares of distance between any two clusters that can be formed at each step of the cluster classification this produces a dendrogram a visual representation of the linkage distance during the history of cluster merging the number of clusters is determined based on the phenon line and changing the location of the phenon line on the dendrogram changes the number of clusters the principal component analysis was conducted independently from the hierarchical cluster analysis to verify whether the determined cluster number is reasonable the principal component analysis is a data transformation technique for reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset by selecting a new set of uncorrelated variables that have lower dimensionality than the original data davis 1990 for our dataset the principal component analysis gave 11 eigenvalues corresponding to the variance of the 11 geochemical parameters and 11 eigenvectors corresponding to 11 components that are linear combinations of the 11 geochemical parameters the number of principal components is determined based on the kaiser criterion according to which only components with eigenvalues greater than one are selected kaiser 1960 using the principal components the scores of the 1 184 groundwater samples are calculated and used to examine whether the determined cluster number is reasonable 4 classified seven clusters this section presents the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis and the results of statistical analysis and geochemical analysis that were used to evaluate whether the classified seven clusters are reasonable fig 2 shows the dendrogram of the hierarchical cluster classification for the 1 184 groundwater samples and the phenon line drawn at the linkage distance of 25 led to seven clusters denoted as cluster c1 c7 to understand the geochemical characteristics of the seven clusters the box plots of the groundwater geochemical parameters are shown in fig 3 for the seven clusters cluster c1 is characterized by low median concentration of f and high median concentrations of ca2 mg2 k hco3 nh4 and fe similar to cluster c1 cluster c2 also has low median concentration of f and high median concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 this is not surprising because of the short linkage distance between clusters c1 and c2 fig 2 cluster c3 is characterized by substantially elevated concentrations of na and cl cluster c4 is characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 for clusters c5 and c6 their median concentrations of the majority of the geochemical parameters are close except that median concentrations of so4 2 and f are significantly smaller in c5 than in c6 cluster c7 is characterized by low concentrations for all the parameters except k cl so4 2 and nh4 the box plots allow a direct comparison of the main geochemical characterizes for the seven clusters hydrogeochemical analysis through stiff and piper diagrams and principal component analysis were used to examine whether the classified seven clusters are reasonable fig 2 plots the stiff diagrams of the seven clusters based on the mean concentrations of the groundwater geochemical parameters the stiff diagrams display similarities and dissimilarities between the seven clusters in particular because of the high mean concentrations of na and cl fig 3 the stiff diagram of cluster c3 is an upside down triangle which is substantially different from the shapes of the other six stiff diagrams it is noted that the stiff diagrams of clusters c2 and c4 c7 are similar the five clusters are separated mainly because of the different concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 as shown in fig 3 for example fig 3 h shows that the hco3 concentrations of cluster c2 are significantly higher than those of clusters c5 c7 fig 4 plots the piper diagram for the seven clusters of the 1 184 groundwater samples to further examine whether the cluster classification is reasonable this figure indicates that the groundwater samples are mainly of the ca mg hco3 water type and this agrees with the findings of gan et al 2014 2018 and zhou et al 2012 the groundwater samples of cluster c3 are separated from those of the other six clusters due to the high concentrations of na and cl of cluster c3 samples in the diamond plot the distinction between the groundwater samples of clusters c4 c7 is observed and this confirms the classification of clusters c4 c7 despite that the stiff diagrams of the four clusters are similar the groundwater samples of clusters c1 and c2 overlap on each other due to similarly high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of the two clusters as explained above as a summary the stiff and piper diagrams suggest that the classification of seven clusters is reasonable with respect to grouping the groundwater geochemical measurements and to revealing specific characteristics of groundwater geochemistry associated with each cluster the principal component analysis was conducted to further examine whether the classification of the seven clusters is reasonable table 1 lists the principal component loadings obtained after the varimax normalized rotation for the first three principal components with eigenvalues greater than one as well as their explained variance following liu et al 2003 the strong loadings with absolute values larger than 0 75 are highlighted component 1 explains 35 of the total variance and is characterized by the high loadings of ca2 mg2 and hco3 component 2 explains 18 of the total variances and is dominated by the high loadings of cl and so4 2 component 3 only explains 10 of the total variance and is thus less important than components 1 and 2 therefore the analysis below is mainly based on components 1 and 2 based on the scores of the two components fig 5 plots the groundwater samples to examine whether the classification of seven clusters is reasonable to give a cloud view of the clustered groundwater geochemical measurements seven ellipses are plotted for the seven clusters with the 80 confidence level based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the principal component analysis the seven clusters are reasonably distinguished from each other in fig 5 despite marginal overlapping indicating that the cluster classification is reasonable with respect to grouping the groundwater geochemical measurements it is worthwhile pointing out the difference between the results cluster analysis and principal component analysis and those of gan et al 2018 based on 457 water samples 21 surface water samples 91 phreatic groundwater samples and 345 confined groundwater samples collected in 2014 and 2015 gan et al 2018 applied cluster analysis and principal component analysis to the geochemical measurements for investigating the hydrogeological evolution in a small portion 1 800 km2 in area of jianghan plain their principal component analysis gave three principal components corresponding to water rock interactions redox conditions and anthropogenic activities the component of redox conditions was associated with the surface water sample and phreatic groundwater samples because the redox conditions in surface water and phreatic groundwater are substantially different from those in confined groundwater all our data are from the confined groundwater in a reducing environment the reducing environment may affect some redox sensitive elements such as no3 and fe2 in groundwater for the no3 concentrations measured for 1 067 groundwater samples 582 measurements were censored i e measured concentrations being lower than detection limit of 0 01 mg l this may be due to denitrification that occurs in reducing environments with enriched organic carbon as in the aquifer of this study for the concentrations of fe2 and fe3 after replacing the censored data by 75 of the detection limits the mean concentrations of fe2 and fe3 are 2 37 mg l and 0 42 mg l respectively the higher concentrations of fe2 indicate a reducing environment in the aquifer which is consistent with the finding of niu et al 2017 and duan 2016 note that due to missing measurements of fe2 and fe3 concentrations we only used total fe concentrations in our study 5 spatial patterns and controlling factors the hierarchical cluster analysis gave an array with 1 184 elements of cluster index c1 c7 for the 1 184 groundwater samples the cluster indices for each sampling time were extracted and plotted as a snapshot to show their spatial distributions at the well locations the snapshots are the basis for investigating the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry 5 1 stable spatial patterns fig 6 illustrates the snapshots of the seven clusters for the dry and wet seasons of the period of 2004 2014 the snapshots for the period of 1992 2003 are shown in fig s2 of the supplementary file a visual comparison of the snapshots leads to a conclusion that for each year the spatial patterns of the dry and wet seasons are similar for example in the both dry and wet seasons the wells of cluster c2 are located in the central part and the wells of cluster c5 in the lower left part of the study site over the 23 years the spatial patterns of the clusters are similar over time only with a few notable exceptions indicating stable groundwater geochemistry table 2 also suggests stability of the groundwater geochemistry at the study site the table lists the number of samples of each cluster for the individual monitoring wells and the last column of the table is the highest relative frequency taking well j1 as an example this well belongs to cluster c7 for 39 times to c6 for 3 times and to c4 for 2 times the highest frequency is 39 and the highest relative frequency is 39 44 89 a higher frequency indicates a more stable condition that groundwater geochemistry changes less frequently over time for 22 out of the 29 monitoring wells the highest frequency is larger than 80 indicating that for 80 of the sampling times the spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry do not change based on the stable spatial patterns and the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry discussed below four zones of groundwater geochemistry were delineated and more details of the delineation are given in in section 6 5 2 controlling factors the two components of principal component analysis table 1 and fig 5 reflect the controlling factors of the groundwater geochemistry component 1 is related to water rock interactions because of its association with ca2 mg2 and hco3 in reference to natural weathering processes of carbonate minerals component 2 is related to the anthropogenic activities due to strong loadings of cl and so4 2 as the two ions are generally originated from anthropogenic activities at the study site gan et al 2018 zhou et al 2012 this section provides detailed hydrogeochemical analysis to investigate the two controlling factors 5 2 1 water rock interactions due to lacking detailed description of mineralogy of the aquifer a full list of geochemical reactions e g carbonate dissolution and silicate hydrolysis are unknown based on the ratios of ion concentrations we postulate the following five groundwater geochemical reactions to understand water rock interactions in the aquifer 1 cac o 3 h 2 o c o 2 g c a 2 2hco 3 2 camg c o 3 2 2 h 2 o 2c o 2 g c a 2 m g 2 4 hco 3 3 n a 1 2 ca x 2 1 2 c a 2 na x 4 nacl n a c l 5 2naals i 3 o 8 11 h 2 o 2c o 2 g 2n a 2hco 3 4 h 4 si o 4 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 the first two reactions are for the dissolution of calcite and dolomite the third reaction is for the cation exchange between na and ca2 x denoting the exchanger resulting in increasing concentration of ca2 the fourth reaction is for the dissolution of halite and the last reaction is for the albite hydrolysis fig 7 examines the above reactions at the study site by using the ion ratios fig 7 a plots the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 and the data except those of cluster c3 fall between the 1 2 and 1 4 lines this is an evidence of calcite and dolomite dissolution wang et al 2006 because the mole ratio of ca2 hco3 is 1 2 for calcite dissolution eq 1 and 1 4 for dolomite dissolution eq 2 fig 7 b plots the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 and shows that the data except those of clusters c3 and c4 fall on the 1 1 line suggesting that the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 can be largely explained by the dissolution of carbonate minerals the data of cluster c3 deviate from the 1 1 line and have larger ca2 concentrations this can be explained by eq 3 of cation exchange appelo and postma 2005 considering that na concentrations of cluster c3 are significantly higher than ca2 concentration fig 3 and that the aquifer is enriched in clay minerals and organic matter the deviation of cluster c4 data may be caused by the high so4 2 concentrations of this cluster fig 7 c that result in low hco3 concentration due to ionic balance fig 7 d shows that na concentrations are larger than cl concentrations in clusters c1 c2 c5 and c6 that are distributed over the study area the larger na concentration is attributed to the dissolution of albite eq 6 because the na and cl concentrations due to the dissolution of halite eq 4 should fall on the 1 1 line rajmohan and elango 2003 rina et al 2012 the albite dissolution may also explain the relatively high hco3 concentrations shown in fig 7 b for clusters c1 c2 c5 and c6 as albite dissolution produces hco3 between calcite dissolution eqs 1 and 2 and albite hydrolysis eq 5 the former is more important than the latter for controlling groundwater geochemistry in the study site for several reasons first silicate hydrolysis requires a weakly acid condition but groundwater in the aquifer is slightly alkaline with average ph of 7 58 which is demonstrated in fig 3 a therefore silicate hydrolysis may not be important for the alkaline groundwater in addition although the weight percentages of albite and carbonate are very close 21 vs 20 the concentration of na ranges between 0 1 and 2 mmol l fig 7 d but the concentration of ca2 ranges between 1 and 5 mmol l fig 7 a this indicates that albite hydrolysis is less important than carbonate dissolution the last line of evidence is shown in fig 7 e and f which plot the relation between the saturation index of calcite dolomite and the concentration of ca2 mg2 in four zones of groundwater geochemistry from the recharge are to the discharge area of the aquifer more details of the four zones are given in section 6 the two figures show that the saturation index and the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 increase gradually along the regional groundwater flow path from zone 1 recharge area to zone iv discharge area indicating that carbonate dissolution occurs along the flow path it should be noted that the five geochemical reactions discussed above may be only a portion of water rock interactions that can explain the ion ratios a full list of geochemical reactions of water rock interactions including those related to the release of as and denitrification is unavailable due to the lack of mineralogical and biogeochemical data of the aquifer sediments if the data were to become available a more quantitative analysis e g geochemical modeling using software such as phreeqc should be performed to better understand the water rock interactions this and collecting more information of the aquifer mineralogy are warranted in a future study 5 2 2 anthropogenic impacts the phrase of anthropogenic impacts is a general term and one specific focus of this study is on the pollution caused by extremely high concentrations of na cl and so4 2 at several wells belonging to clusters c3 and c4 table 2 shows that 34 out of the 35 groundwater samples of cluster c3 are from well j10 whose na and cl concentrations are 20 100 times higher than those of other wells fig 3 e and f since well j10 is located at one of the largest pesticide factories in china the high concentrations of na and cl may be due to wastewater infiltration from the factory to the aquifer groundwater contamination and other environmental problems caused by the factory have been an environmental concern to the public ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china 2011 elevated so4 2 concentration is a geochemical characteristic of cluster c4 fig 3 g and table 2 shows that 43 samples of cluster c4 are from well j9 located in a cotton mill and 18 samples from well j25 located in a water supply plant niu at al 2017 stated that industrial activities and potential leachates from the industrial areas probably accounted for high so4 2 concentrations and a detailed field investigation is warranted in a future study to understand the exact reasons for the elevated so4 2 concentrations another specific focus of this study is on nitrate concentrations that are always closely related to anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer use in agricultural lands the major land use in the study site to determine whether nitrate is a controlling factor of groundwater geochemistry the cluster and principal component analyses were conducted twice for two different datasets without and with nitrate concentrations the results discussed above are based on the dataset without nitrate concentrations nitrate was excluded from the analysis for the following two reasons 1 nitrate concentrations were not continuously measured among the 1 184 groundwater samples nitrate concentrations were not measured for 117 samples about 10 of the samples and 2 nitrate concentrations measured for 582 samples were censored i e measured concentrations being lower than detection limit of 0 01 mg l to include nitrate concentrations into the cluster and principal component analyses the censored nitrate concentrations were replaced by 75 of the detection limit resulting in a smaller dataset of 1 067 groundwater samples and 12 groundwater geochemical parameters the original 11 ones plus nitrate for the dataset with nitrate seven clusters were also classified based on the dendrogram plotted in fig s3 the seven clusters are denoted as cs1 cs7 and table s1 lists the number of samples of each cluster for the individual monitoring wells clusters cs1 cs7 are equivalent to clusters c1 c7 in terms of the wells included in the clusters for example table 2 shows that wells j18 and j21 belong to cluster c1 and the same two wells belong to cluster cs1 as shown in table s1 comparing tables 2 and s1 for all the clusters indicates that including nitrate concentrations in the cluster analysis did not change the spatial distribution of the cluster 1s this is further conformed by comparing the snapshots of clusters cs1 cs7 plotted in figs s4 and s5 with the snapshots of clusters c1 c7 plotted in figs 6 and s2 despite of small variation the spatial distribution of the clusters does not change after including nitrate concentration in the cluster analysis therefore the analysis below is still based on the seven clusters classified by using the 1 184 water samples with 11 groundwater geochemistry parameters with nitrate excluded the anthropogenic impacts discussed in this section are relevant to several findings of niu et al 2017 for example niu et al 2017 found that industrial wastewater is responsible to increased cl and so4 2 concentrations at several wells and this is used in this study to understand why cluster c3 is characterized with high cl concentrations and cluster c4 with high so4 2 concentrations however since our study differs from niu et al 2017 in terms of their purposes and scopes certain findings of the two studies are not directly comparable for example niu et al 2017 found that no3 concentrations has been increasing due to extensive fertilizer use but we found that no3 concentrations are not important to cluster classification because measured concentrations are low which may be due to denitrification given the reducing environment and high concentration of organic carbon in the aquifer as explained in section 2 therefore we did not intensively compare the results of our study with those of niu et al 2017 6 four zones of groundwater geochemistry based on the highest frequency data listed in table 2 and the understanding of the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry discussed above four groundwater geochemical zones were delineated and shown in fig 8 the figure also plots spatial distribution of sediment outcrops at land surface which was also used for delineating the four zones the delineation of the four zones is a major contribution of this study for understanding groundwater geochemistry at the study site the zone delineation started with the wells belonging to the same cluster for example table 2 indicates that wells j18 and j21 belong to the same groundwater geochemistry zone because 22 out of the 26 samples at well j18 belong to cluster c1 and 31 out of 45 samples at well j21 belong to cluster c1 several clusters were combined into one groundwater geochemistry zones based on the hydrogeochemical analysis explained in detail below zone i is the recharge zone of the aquifer and the groundwater samples of this zone are from well j1 of cluster c7 table 2 as shown in fig 8 the aquifer sediments q3 and q2 are exposed at land surface and an unconfined condition prevails in zone i therefore precipitation can directly recharge the aquifer and groundwater geochemistry in this zone is mainly of recharge water with weak water rock interactions as a result groundwater geochemistry of zone i is characterized by lowest concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 fig 3 this is also consistent with the results of principal component analysis fig 5 as the groundwater samples of cluster c7 have the lowest scores of component 1 i e the water rock interactions component the boundary of zone i was determined by the geological boundary between q2 q3 and qh sediments where the hydrogeological conditions may change from unconfined to confined conditions zone ii is the transition zone between the recharge zone zone i and the flow through zone zone iii groundwater samples from this zone mainly belong to clusters c5 and c6 wells j4 j11 j16 j17 and j27 are c5 wells and wells j2 j3 j5 j6 j28 and j29 are c6 wells after precipitation infiltrates into the aquifer at the mountain area zone i and flows downgradient to the flat area zone iii of the jianghan plain groundwater continuously reacts with the aquifer sediments this explains the similarity of the ion concentrations between clusters c5 and c6 fig 2 precipitation still affects groundwater geochemistry in the transition zone because the depth of aquifer sediments is shallow generally 5 10 m and precipitation directly recharges groundwater due to discontinuous aquitard and semi confined conditions in zone ii except the wells of clusters c5 and c6 other wells located in zone ii were not used for the delineation of zone ii for example although well j10 of cluster c3 and well j9 of cluster c4 are located in zone ii their groundwater geochemistry is affected mainly by anthropogenic activities as explained above zone iii is the flow through zone before groundwater is discharged out of the study site groundwater samples of this zone are all from c2 wells except well j25 of cluster c4 although well j25 is identified as a c4 well it is possible that this well belongs to cluster c2 if the well is not affected by anthropogenic activities because 18 samples of well j25 belong to cluster c4 and 16 samples to cluster c2 table 2 this flow through zone is confined with the deepest generally 20 40 m aquifer sediments groundwater flows slowly in this zone due to low hydraulic conductivity and small hydraulic gradient zhao 2005 which allows strong interaction between groundwater and aquifer sediments therefore this zone is characterized by higher concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in comparison with their relative concentrations in zones i and ii fig 3 zone iv is the discharge mixing zone before groundwater discharges into the yangtze river groundwater samples from this zone are from wells j18 and j21 of cluster c1 and well j23 of cluster c2 the groundwater geochemistry of this zone is mainly characterized by the highest concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 fig 3 and this can be explained by the continuous water rock interactions along the regional flow path groundwater and surface water interaction also plays an important role in groundwater geochemistry recalling that the aquifer is hydraulically connected to the yangtze river fig s1 groundwater discharges to the river when the river stage is lower than the aquifer head and receives recharge from the river otherwise well j23 is included in this zone due to its close distance 1 4 km to the yangtze river the four zones discussed above provide a conceptual model for understanding the spatial variation of groundwater geochemistry due to water rock interactions taking the tds concentration as an example tds increases along the regional groundwater flow direction from zone i to zone iv due to continuous water rock interactions as shown in fig 3 l when groundwater moves from the northwest to the southeast the average tds concentration is 593 mg l for the wells of cluster c7 in zone i increases to 603 mg l for the wells of clusters c5 and c6 in zone ii further increases to 770 mg l for the wells of cluster c2 in zone iii and finally reaches 859 mg l for the wells of cluster c1 in zone iv the same pattern of spatial variation is also observed for the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 shown in figs 3 and 7 a and b as the four zones of groundwater geochemistry were delineated for the first time more research may be needed to further examine the zone delineation one way to do so is to first develop a regional scale model of groundwater reactive transport based on existing geologic and hydrologic knowledge and data and then use the model to simulate the concentrations of the groundwater geochemistry parameters in the aquifer since the simulated concentrations are for the entire aquifer not limited to monitoring well locations they may be used to examine the spatial distribution of the four zones however developing the groundwater reactive transport model for the regional aquifer is beyond the scope of this study 7 temporal variation and controlling factors although the groundwater geochemistry is generally stable over the 23 years temporal variations are observed by examining the snapshots of the spatial patterns of the clusters fig 6 recalling that changes of clusters indicate changes of groundwater geochemistry a better way of examining the cluster changes is to plot the temporal variation of cluster index for each well as shown in fig 9 the seven wells were selected because of their low relative frequency less than 80 of belonging to one cluster table 2 taking well j8 as an example fig 9 a shows that this well belongs to cluster c7 for 32 times to cluster c4 for 10 times and to cluster c2 for 3 times 7 1 temporal variation fig 9 reveals both short and long term cluster changes a short term change means that a well belongs to a cluster for a short period e g half a year or one year and then changes to another cluster a long term cluster change means that once a well changes to another cluster the well stays in the cluster for a long period of time e g several years in fig 9 the temporal cluster changes are short term for wells j7 and j28 for j7 it occasionally belongs to clusters c6 and c7 for j28 it stays in cluster c6 for most of the time but occasionally belongs to cluster c5 this is not surprising because the two clusters are located in the transition zone zone ii fig 8 and have similar concentrations for the geochemical parameters fig 3 the short term changes at the two wells reflect the fluctuations of groundwater geochemistry in this zone short term cluster changes are affected by multiple factors such as precipitation changes nguyen et al 2015 fertilizer uses niu et al 2017 puckett 1995 and seasonal pumping huang et al 2018 schaefer et al 2016 2017 cheng et al 2017 in addition understanding the short term changes requires collecting data at a short time scale e g monthly since the monitoring data used in this study were collected at the seasonal scale they are not adequate for explaining the short term changes in fig 9 the temporal cluster changes are long term for wells j2 j8 j21 j23 and j25 for these five wells j2 is located in an aquafarm j8 about 300 m away from a cotton mill j23 in a fertilizer plant and j25 in a water supply plant the four wells changed to cluster c4 characterized by high so4 2 concentrations in the last several years suggesting the long term impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater geochemistry the long term cluster changes may reflect water type changes taking well j8 as an example its water type changes from ca hco3 to ca hco3 so4 since 2010 this is consistent with the cluster change shown in fig 9 a in that since 2010 well j8 changes to cluster c4 that is characterized with high so4 2 concentration fig 3 however since the anthropogenic activities are not documented detailed study of their impacts is difficult if not impossible the long term change for well j21 is attributed to the impacts of the three gorges reservoir because the well changes from cluster c1 to cluster c2 after 2010 fig 9 b when the reservoir operation started 7 2 impacts of three gorges dam depending on the difference of water levels between the yangtze river and the aquifer the river aquifer interactions change temporally and spatially and the change substantially influences the recharge discharge dynamics of the aquifer in the upper reach of the yangtze river upstream of the ouchikou site see its location in fig 1 the river stage is constantly higher than the groundwater level and the aquifer receives recharge from the yangtze river even in the dry seasons this is illustrated in fig s6 a that plots the river stage at the shashi station see its location in fig 1 and the nearby well j10 in the upstream reach of the river in the lower reach of the yangtze river downstream of the ouchikou the difference of water levels between the river and the aquifer changes in dry and wet seasons during the dry seasons from december to march of next year the groundwater levels are higher than the river stages and groundwater discharges to the river during the wet seasons from april to november the groundwater levels are lower than the river stages and groundwater is recharged by the river this is illustrated in fig s6 b that plots the river stage at the luoshan station see its location in fig 1 and the nearby well j23 in the downstream reach of the river it is expected that the recharge discharge dynamics have more substantial impacts on groundwater geochemistry in the downstream reach than in the upstream reach of the river this is supported by the fact that there are essentially no cluster changes at upstream wells j9 j12 and j13 for wells j2 j8 j21 j23 and j25 with long term cluster changes shown in fig 9 only well j21 is located near the downstream reach of the yangtze river and it is the focus of the analysis below since groundwater level at well j21 was not measured we assume that the groundwater discharge recharge dynamics at this well is similar to that of well j23 shown in fig s6 b fig 9 b shows that well j21 mostly belonged to cluster c1 from 1992 to 2008 but changed to cluster c4 in the dry period of 2009 fluctuated between c1 and c2 from the wet period of 2009 to the wet period of 2011 and then remains as c2 afterward these changes are also observed in the snapshots plotted in fig 6 we attribute these changes to the construction and operation of the three gorges dam the operation history of the three gorges dam during 2003 2014 can be separated into four stages i e initial stage transitional stage quasi normal stage and normal stage deng et al 2016 tang et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the water level in the reservoir fluctuated seasonally but increased gradually from 135 m to 175 m from june 2003 to october 2010 175 m being the normal water level of the reservoir fig s7 of the supplementary file deng et al 2016 reported that while the reservoir construction and operation did not have remarkable impacts on water cycle of the yangtze river for the first two stages the river stages were significantly increased in the latter two stages in the dry seasons according to wang et al 2013 the river stage increased about 0 33 m in the upper reach and 0 38 m in the lower reach of the yangtze river after 2009 considering that the yangtze river penetrates into the aquifer and that the river stage is higher than the confining layer fig s1 it is reasonable to expect that during the quasi normal and normal stages of the reservoir the aquifer receives more recharge from the yangtze river due to the river stage increase he and tang 2017 in particular the start of the quasi normal stage of the reservoir in october 2008 appears to correspond to the change of well j21 from cluster c1 to other clusters starting from the dry period of 2009 the normal stage of the reservoir starting from october 2010 appears to correspond to the well s permanent change from cluster c1 to cluster c2 to quantify the mixing of groundwater and river water the mixing fraction of river water was calculated by using a two end member mixing model crandall et al 1999 6 f rw c gw c m c gw c rw where frw is the mixing factor of river water i e the portion of river water in the mixed groundwater and river water and cm crw and cgw denote the concentrations of a geochemical parameter in the mixed water river water and groundwater respectively the mixing factor of river water was calculated for cl ca2 mg2 and hco3 as a conservative tracer cl is commonly used for determining water mixing crandall et al 1999 kirchner et al 2010 ca2 mg2 and hco3 were chosen because they are the major ions produced by the water rock interactions the groundwater concentrations of the four parameters were set as the mean concentrations of the groundwater geochemistry measurements at well j21 before 2009 the corresponding river water concentrations were based on the data of sample cj23 list in table 1 of li et al 2014 who studied water quality of the yangtze river this sample was selected because its sample location is close to well j21 it should be noted that since the river sample was collected in the wet season of 2013 the calculated mixing factor of river water may not accurately reflect the temporal variation of the factor fig 10 shows the calculated mixing factors of river water for cl ca2 mg2 and hco3 during the period of 2010 2014 generally speaking except that of mg2 in 2014 the mixing factors of the four geochemical parameters are similar suggesting a consistent effect of river recharge on the groundwater geochemical parameters in the dry periods of 2010 and 2011 the mixing factor is near zero this explains why well j21 returned to cluster c1 in the two periods fig 9 starting from the wet season of 2011 the mixing factor remains more or less stable except the mixing factor of mg2 in 2014 and this corresponds to the normal stage of the three gorges dam it is thus concluded that the dilution of groundwater by yangtze river water is the major reason for the temporal change of groundwater geochemistry it is reasonable to expect that the impacts of the three gorges dam on the groundwater geochemistry will continue after 2014 it is worth mentioning that the mixing factor was calculated only for well j21 not for well j18 another c1 well because geochemical measurements at well j18 after 2010 are not available the deviation of the mixing fraction of mg2 after 2013 may be caused by the relatively large changes of mg2 concentration and or the approximate values used for crw and cgw an improved understanding of the deviation may be gained in a future study niu et al 2017 also reported the impacts of the three gorges reservoir on the groundwater geochemistry in the jianghan plain however their rationale is different from ours in that their conclusion is based on the trend analysis for the increase of ph increase of no3 n concentrations and decrease of nh4 n concentrations in addition their reported starting time of the impacts is 2003 whereas ours is 2009 another difference is that their conclusion is based on the spatial mean values i e the mean over all the 29 monitoring wells whereas our conclusion is based on the data of well j21 near the yangtze river using the data of individual wells may be more reasonable because it is unlikely that the three gorges reservoir affects all the 29 monitoring wells especially those far from the yangtze river the impacts of the three gorges reservoir on the groundwater geochemistry in the jianghan plain is sophisticated and to fully understand the impacts may require installing monitoring wells along a transect away from the river conducting hydrodynamics modeling and or stable isotope analysis which however is beyond the scope of this study 8 comparison with conventional cluster analysis the cluster analysis method used in this study enabled us to simultaneously identify the spatial and temporal patterns and controlling factors of the groundwater geochemistry the simultaneous identification may not be achieved by using conventional methods of cluster analysis this is illustrated by comparing the results of our cluster analysis with those obtained by using a conventional cluster analysis that uses temporal averages to identify spatial patterns for each groundwater geochemistry parameter its temporal average was calculated over the entire monitoring period resulting in a data matrix of 29 rows and 11 columns corresponding to 29 wells and 11 groundwater geochemistry parameters for this data matrix the same procedure of hierarchical cluster analysis was performed and the 29 wells were also classified into seven clusters the phenon line was drawn at linkage distance of 5 denoted as cluster g1 g7 based on the dendrogram plotted in fig s8 the last snapshot of fig 6 plots the well locations of clusters g1 g7 while this snapshot cannot be compared with any snapshot of clusters c1 c7 shown in figs 6 and s2 for individual sampling times roughly speaking the spatial pattern shown in this snapshot is similar to that of clusters c1 c7 shown in figs 6 and s2 this is not surprising because the spatial pattern is stable as discussed in section 5 1 however the cluster analysis based on temporal averages cannot reveal temporal changes for the wells that belong to different clusters due to changes of groundwater geochemistry taking well j23 as an example in the cluster analysis based on temporal averages this well belongs to cluster g4 characterized by high so4 2 concentrations in comparison with other g clusters in our cluster analysis this well was classified into c2 for 2times and into c4 for 16 times table 2 the snapshots of clusters c1 c7 in fig 6 show that this well was classified into c4 since 2006 the reason is that so4 2 concentration changed dramatically after 2006 the mean so4 2 concentrations for the period of 1992 2005 is 3 76 mg l but increased dramatically to 104 40 mg l for the period of 2006 2014 the change of so4 2 concentration over time was ignored in the cluster analysis based on temporal mean but captured in our cluster analysis this problem may become severe if groundwater geochemistry changes more frequent than in our study 9 conclusions a recently developed cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 was used in this study for understanding the spatial and temporal patterns and controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry in the regional aquifer of the jianghan plain china this cluster analysis method can handle the large dataset with 13 024 measurements of 1 184 groundwater samples collected over a long period of time 1992 2014 from 29 monitoring wells distributed over the jianghan plain the major conclusions related to understanding the regional scale groundwater geochemistry in the confined aquifer of jianghan plain are as follows 1 the cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 can be applied to a large dataset e g the one used in this study for investigating both spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry this is done by first classifying monitoring data of groundwater geochemistry into clusters and then examining spatial and temporal variations of the clusters to understand controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry based on hydrogeochemical analysis the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry identified by using the cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 cannot be revealed by the conventional cluster analysis based on temporal averages 2 in this study the hierarchical cluster analysis yielded seven clusters c1 c7 for the 1 184 groundwater samples the principal component analysis of the 1 184 samples and hydrogeochemical analyses through stiff and piper diagrams indicate that the classified seven clusters are statistically and geochemically reasonable 3 based on spatial distribution of the seven clusters and hydrogeochemical analysis mainly water rock interactions for the seven clusters jianghan plain was separated into four geochemical zones along the regional groundwater flow path which is a major contribution of this study for the water rock interactions the dissolution of calcite and dolomite is the most dominant controlling factor of groundwater geochemistry followed by the albite hydrolysis 4 anthropogenic activities caused high concentrations of cl na and so4 2 due to industrial production in a pesticides factory a cotton mill and a water supply plant nitrate concentrations are not an important factor to spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry the cluster analysis revealed the temporal variation of the seven clusters controlled by the three gorges reservoir since 2009 the interactions between groundwater and the yangtze river are confirmed by the calculated mixing fraction of the yangtze river the findings above for understanding the spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale are useful for water resource management such as designing future groundwater quality monitoring networks however it should be noted that variations of groundwater geochemistry at small scales and their controlling factors are more complex and more intensive groundwater samples are necessary for a detailed study in the future the impacts of the three gorges reservoir on groundwater geochemistry is of particular use since the reservoir is the largest hydropower plant in the world and the yangtze river is vulnerable to contamination further study of the impacts is warranted by other means such as calculating the mixing fraction using stable isotope data which are currently unavailable

5711,understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale over a long time period is challenging due to the lack of data and effective statistical approaches to characterize complex natural processes and anthropogenic activities we applied a recently developed cluster analysis method to investigate spatial and temporal patterns and controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry in the confined aquifer of the jianghan plain china the cluster analysis is applied to a dataset of 13 024 groundwater geochemical measurements for 11 geochemical parameters of 1 184 groundwater samples collected over 23 years from 29 monitoring wells distributed over the jianghan plain the cluster analysis yielded a classification of seven clusters and the classification was confirmed by using principal component analysis and stiff and piper diagrams based on the spatial distribution of the seven clusters the jianghan plain is separated into four geochemical zones i e recharge zone transition zone flow through zone and discharge mixing zone along the regional groundwater flow path which has not been attempted in the past the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry are controlled by short and long term factors of water rock interactions and anthropogenic activities a particular finding of this study is that the three gorges reservoir has a long term impact on groundwater geochemistry because the reservoir increased river discharge to groundwater after 2009 this study demonstrates that using the cluster analysis method together with hydrogeochemical analysis can identify spatiotemporal patterns and controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale over a long monitoring period keywords statistical analysis geochemical zones water rock interactions jianghan plain three gorges dam 1 introduction a thorough understanding of groundwater geochemistry is critical for protecting groundwater resources under the conditions of changing climate growing population and decreasing freshwater availability cloutier et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 gorelick and zheng 2015 han et al 2016 landon et al 2011 groundwater geochemistry is driven by various natural processes and anthropogenic activities güler and thyne 2004a güler et al 2002 reghunath et al 2002 tóth 1999 2009 and may vary both in space and time understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry not only requires designing a monitoring network to collect the right data in terms of data constitutes collection locations collection times etc for tackling the problem of interest but also requires using appropriate statistical methods to extract the spatial and temporal patterns embedded in measurements of groundwater geochemistry parameters more importantly hydrogeochemical analysis is needed to understand the natural and anthropogenic factors that control the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry while obtaining a large amount of monitoring data for a region scale study is not uncommon e g feyereisen et al 2007 güler and thyne 2004b jessen et al 2017 it is still challenging to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns hidden in the data and to understand the controlling factors of the patterns at the regional scale this study addresses these two challenges by using a recently developed method of cluster analysis together with hydrogeochemical analysis for a regional aquifer in central china using cluster analysis together with hydrogeochemical analysis has advanced our understanding on spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry cloutier et al 2008 kim et al 2003 nguyen et al 2015 shrestha and kazama 2007 simeonov et al 2003 wang et al 2015 this is always done in two steps in the first step cluster analysis is conducted to classify groundwater geochemical data into a number of clusters each of which reflects its own composition of groundwater geochemistry subsequently hydrogeochemical analysis is conducted for the clusters to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in groundwater geochemistry when dealing with spatiotemporal data obtained from a long term monitoring network many clustering methods have two limitations on how clusters are classified one limitation is that cluster classification is conducted only for temporal means i e the means over the entire sampling period e g qian et al 2007 sayemuzzaman et al 2018 while this kind of cluster analysis can help identify spatial patterns it cannot be used to understand temporal patterns the other limitation is that cluster classification is conducted separately to data of different sampling times or hydrological conditions e g hussain et al 2008 thyne et al 2004 this kind of cluster analysis may be inadequate to simultaneously reveal spatial and temporal patterns when groundwater geochemistry substantially changes over time because the number of clusters and the geochemical characteristics of the clusters can be dramatically different before and after the changes addressing the two limitations requires a cluster analysis method that deals with data in space and time simultaneously and can reveal spatial and temporal patterns pacheco castro et al 2018 recently developed a cluster classification method that has the potential to overcome the two limitations discussed above instead of conducting cluster classification for temporal means or data of different sampling times the cluster analysis of pacheco castro et al 2018 is conducted for the entire monitoring data collected at all monitoring wells and sampling times if groundwater samples are collected from m monitoring wells at s sampling times and p geochemical parameters are measured for each of m s groundwater samples the measurements form a matrix that has m s rows and p columns the cluster classification method of pacheco castro et al 2018 yields a column vector of m s elements of clustering index for the combination of sampling wells and sampling times this vector leads to s snapshots of clusters in space since the cluster classification is conducted for all monitoring data the number of clusters and their geochemical characteristics are the same for each snapshot this makes it possible to jointly study the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry linking the snapshots to geological hydrogeological and geochemical knowledge of the site of interest can help understand the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry this can be illustrated in the following two scenarios 1 if the natural and anthropogenic factors controlling groundwater geochemistry are similar at several monitoring wells the geochemistry at the wells should be similar and the wells should belong to the same cluster studying the spatial distribution of the clusters can reveal large scale patterns of groundwater geochemistry which in turn helps identify the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry in space 2 if groundwater geochemistry changes at the wells the wells may belong to another cluster therefore studying the temporal changes of the clusters can reveal temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry which in turn helps identify the factors that control groundwater geochemistry in time pacheco castro et al 2018 applied their cluster classification method to 288 groundwater samples collected over three years 2009 2011 from a karst aquifer in in yucatan mexico they found the following 1 groundwater geochemistry at the west and in the coastal area of the site is controlled by seawater intrusion and sulfate rich groundwater 2 groundwater geochemistry at the middle and east part of the site is controlled by water rock interactions and annual precipitation respectively and 3 groundwater geochemistry at two local areas of the site is controlled by anthropogenic activities they also found that temporal variation of groundwater geochemistry at the site is caused by groundwater dilution due to changes in the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation since the cluster analysis of pacheco castro et al 2018 was for a small dataset collected over a short monitoring period it is necessary to further evaluate their method for a large dataset over a long monitoring period the evaluation was conducted in this study by using a large amount of monitoring data collected from the confined aquifer of jianghan plain an alluvial plain located in central china with an area of approximately 27 400 km2 fig 1 the yangtze river the world s third longest river flows through the plain and the three gorges dam the world s largest hydroelectric project is about 80 km upstream of the plain fig 1 groundwater is mainly of ca mg hco3 water type due to dissolution of carbonate minerals gan et al 2014 yu et al 2017 zhou et al 2012 this area is undergoing extensive agricultural activities and 72 of the land is for agricultural use fig 1 anthropogenic activities have affected groundwater geochemistry of the regional aquifer yang et al 2018 to monitor groundwater quality a monitoring network was established in 1990 and a large amount of monitoring data have been collected during the past three decades for a total of 21 groundwater geochemistry parameters specified by the national quality standard for ground water of china ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china 1994 the 21 parameters are ph temperature alkalinity total dissolved solids tds hardness concentrations of seven major ions ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 and hco3 and concentrations of minor ions and trace constituents no2 no3 nh4 fe3 fe2 fe mn2 f and total as groundwater contaminants reported in literature include arsenic duan et al 2015 2017 gan et al 2014 and wastewater infiltration niu et al 2017 in the confined aquifer and nitrate yang et al 2017 2018 in the shallow aquifer of jianghan plain however there are few published analyses of groundwater geochemistry at the plain scale except the paper of niu et al 2017 who reported the temporal trends of multiple groundwater geochemistry e g cl so4 2 and no3 but did not analyze spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry the overall spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors at the plain scale are still unknown this study used the groundwater geochemistry data collected over the period of 1992 2014 the dataset consists of a total of 13 024 geochemistry measurements for 1 184 groundwater samples each of which has 11 selected groundwater geochemistry parameters ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 nh4 f and fe this large dataset enables us to evaluate whether the cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 can help better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and their controlling factors for a regional aquifer over a long period of 23 years based on the cluster analysis and hydrogeochemical analysis we delineated for the first time four zones of groundwater geochemistry at the site which are related to aquifer recharge regional groundwater flow water rock interactions and anthropogenic activities the four zones should be of value for future study of detailed groundwater geochemistry at the local scale we also identified the long term impacts of the three gorges reservoir on groundwater geochemistry downstream of the reservoir while the impacts of dam construction and operation on river hydrology have been well documented guo et al 2018 nilsson et al 2005 zhou et al 2013 little is known about the impacts on groundwater geochemistry this study provides a new insight on using cluster analysis for understanding long term evolution of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale 2 study area jianghan plain is a semi closed basin with high elevation 350 m in the northwest and low elevation 25 m in the southeast portion of the plain and the regional groundwater flow is from northwest to southeast based on precipitation data from the jingzhou meteorological station provided by the china meteorological data service center available at http data cma cn monthly average precipitation for the period of 1992 2014 ranges from 24 mm in december to 161 mm in july with 41 of precipitation occurring from june to august mean annual rainfall increases from the northwest 950 mm yr to the southeast 1 350 mm yr wang 2009 the quaternary alluvial lacustrine sediments deposited on the top of the bed rocks form the following three aquifers the phreatic aquifer with holocene and upper late pleistocene deposits 0 20 m depth the middle confined aquifer with late pleistocene and middle pleistocene deposits 20 100 m depth and the deep confined aquifer with early pleistocene 100 280 depth the main mineralogical compositions of the aquifer sediments are clay minerals about 29 50 wt and quartz about 31 54 wt high contents of carbonate up to 20 wt and albite up to 21 wt are also detected in the sandy sediments duan et al 2016 2017 discontinuous silty clay and embedded clay lenses 5 10 m in thickness compose as the local aquitards between the phreatic and middle confined aquifer gan et al 2018 the middle confined aquifer is the primary water supply for domestic agricultural and industrial water uses and accounts for 64 of the total groundwater exploitation in jianghan plain zhao 2005 the studies of duan 2016 and gan et al 2014 indicate that the middle confined aquifer is under reducing conditions with an average oxidation reduction potential of 102 mv and that the aquifer is enriched with organic matter with an average concentration of dissolved organic carbon of 6 mg l water geochemistry of the middle confined aquifer is the focus of this study and all groundwater samples considered in this study were taken from this aquifer the middle confined aquifer is referred to herein as the aquifer analyses of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes suggest that rainfall is the main recharge source of the aquifer du et al 2017 groundwater recharge mainly occurs in the west part of the plain where unconfined or semi confined conditions prevail due to outcrops of the aquifer sediments leakage from the yangtze river is another important recharge source as its thalweg elevation is lower than the elevation of the confining layer of the aquifer for most of the river reach downstream from the three gorges dam fig s1 in the supplementary information due to the direct interaction between the yangtze river and the aquifer along the river groundwater discharges to the river during dry seasons and receives recharge from the river during wet seasons he and tang 2017 the invading river water affects groundwater geochemistry in the aquifer by mixing waters with different chemical compositions especially after the quasi normal stage of the three gorges dam as discussed in detail below 3 data and statistical procedures groundwater samples were collected from 29 monitoring wells fig 1 twice a year during 1992 2014 one in the dry season from january to february and the other in the wet season from july to august since not all the wells were sampled regularly over the 23 years the total number of samples is 1 190 less than 1 334 29 23 2 for the 21 groundwater geochemistry parameters 11 parameters were selected for the cluster analysis and they are ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 nh4 f and fe temperature was excluded because it mainly reflects physical characteristic of groundwater but this study is focused on groundwater geochemistry hardness tds and alkalinity were excluded because they can be obtained directly from the 11 parameters for example alkalinity can be approximated by the concentration of hco3 given that ph values for most samples are less than 8 3 appelo and postma 2005 concentrations of mn2 no2 no3 as fe2 and fe3 were excluded because they were not continuously measured over the 23 years since no3 concentrations are of growing concern to groundwater quality we conducted another cluster analysis for a smaller dataset with no3 included as a parameter and the results are compared with those for the 11 parameters in section 5 2 for the 11 selected geochemical parameters censored data measured concentration values below detection limits were reported for 335 groundwater samples for nh4 35 samples for fe 14 samples for so4 2 9 samples for cl and 8 samples for f a common practice of processing censored data is to either exclude them from water quality analysis güler and thyne 2004b or replace them with a value lower than detection limits cloutier et al 2008 sanford et al 1993 to utilize the data to the extent possible and by following vantrump and miesch 1977 we replaced the censored data by 75 of the detection limits afterward the charge balance error of the geochemical measurements was calculated following güler et al 2002 and ghesquière et al 2015 six samples with charge balance error above 10 were excluded from further analysis the final dataset used for the cluster analysis includes 13 024 groundwater geochemical measurements forming a data matrix of 1 184 rows and 11 columns corresponding to 1 184 groundwater samples and 11 geochemical parameters of each sample cluster analysis for this large amount of groundwater geochemical measurements is seldom reported in literature for the 13 024 groundwater geochemical measurements hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were conducted by using python with scipy v0 19 library jones et al 2001 since the two statistical analyses have been well described in literature cloutier et al 2008 güler et al 2002 pant et al 2018 we only describe here how the two analyses were implemented in this study following the literature güler et al 2002 ghesquière et al 2015 pacheco castro et al 2018 qian et al 2007 we first applied the log transformation to the geochemical data and then standardized the transformed data by using the z score calculation subtracting sample mean and dividing the residuals by sample standard deviation to remove the impacts of parameter units on the statistical analysis the hierarchical cluster analysis of this study used the ward s method with euclidean distance ward 1963 which calculates the distance between a pair of water samples in the space of the 11 groundwater geochemical parameters the ward s method uses an analysis of variance approach to evaluate the distances between clusters and minimizes the sum of squares of distance between any two clusters that can be formed at each step of the cluster classification this produces a dendrogram a visual representation of the linkage distance during the history of cluster merging the number of clusters is determined based on the phenon line and changing the location of the phenon line on the dendrogram changes the number of clusters the principal component analysis was conducted independently from the hierarchical cluster analysis to verify whether the determined cluster number is reasonable the principal component analysis is a data transformation technique for reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset by selecting a new set of uncorrelated variables that have lower dimensionality than the original data davis 1990 for our dataset the principal component analysis gave 11 eigenvalues corresponding to the variance of the 11 geochemical parameters and 11 eigenvectors corresponding to 11 components that are linear combinations of the 11 geochemical parameters the number of principal components is determined based on the kaiser criterion according to which only components with eigenvalues greater than one are selected kaiser 1960 using the principal components the scores of the 1 184 groundwater samples are calculated and used to examine whether the determined cluster number is reasonable 4 classified seven clusters this section presents the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis and the results of statistical analysis and geochemical analysis that were used to evaluate whether the classified seven clusters are reasonable fig 2 shows the dendrogram of the hierarchical cluster classification for the 1 184 groundwater samples and the phenon line drawn at the linkage distance of 25 led to seven clusters denoted as cluster c1 c7 to understand the geochemical characteristics of the seven clusters the box plots of the groundwater geochemical parameters are shown in fig 3 for the seven clusters cluster c1 is characterized by low median concentration of f and high median concentrations of ca2 mg2 k hco3 nh4 and fe similar to cluster c1 cluster c2 also has low median concentration of f and high median concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 this is not surprising because of the short linkage distance between clusters c1 and c2 fig 2 cluster c3 is characterized by substantially elevated concentrations of na and cl cluster c4 is characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 for clusters c5 and c6 their median concentrations of the majority of the geochemical parameters are close except that median concentrations of so4 2 and f are significantly smaller in c5 than in c6 cluster c7 is characterized by low concentrations for all the parameters except k cl so4 2 and nh4 the box plots allow a direct comparison of the main geochemical characterizes for the seven clusters hydrogeochemical analysis through stiff and piper diagrams and principal component analysis were used to examine whether the classified seven clusters are reasonable fig 2 plots the stiff diagrams of the seven clusters based on the mean concentrations of the groundwater geochemical parameters the stiff diagrams display similarities and dissimilarities between the seven clusters in particular because of the high mean concentrations of na and cl fig 3 the stiff diagram of cluster c3 is an upside down triangle which is substantially different from the shapes of the other six stiff diagrams it is noted that the stiff diagrams of clusters c2 and c4 c7 are similar the five clusters are separated mainly because of the different concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 as shown in fig 3 for example fig 3 h shows that the hco3 concentrations of cluster c2 are significantly higher than those of clusters c5 c7 fig 4 plots the piper diagram for the seven clusters of the 1 184 groundwater samples to further examine whether the cluster classification is reasonable this figure indicates that the groundwater samples are mainly of the ca mg hco3 water type and this agrees with the findings of gan et al 2014 2018 and zhou et al 2012 the groundwater samples of cluster c3 are separated from those of the other six clusters due to the high concentrations of na and cl of cluster c3 samples in the diamond plot the distinction between the groundwater samples of clusters c4 c7 is observed and this confirms the classification of clusters c4 c7 despite that the stiff diagrams of the four clusters are similar the groundwater samples of clusters c1 and c2 overlap on each other due to similarly high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of the two clusters as explained above as a summary the stiff and piper diagrams suggest that the classification of seven clusters is reasonable with respect to grouping the groundwater geochemical measurements and to revealing specific characteristics of groundwater geochemistry associated with each cluster the principal component analysis was conducted to further examine whether the classification of the seven clusters is reasonable table 1 lists the principal component loadings obtained after the varimax normalized rotation for the first three principal components with eigenvalues greater than one as well as their explained variance following liu et al 2003 the strong loadings with absolute values larger than 0 75 are highlighted component 1 explains 35 of the total variance and is characterized by the high loadings of ca2 mg2 and hco3 component 2 explains 18 of the total variances and is dominated by the high loadings of cl and so4 2 component 3 only explains 10 of the total variance and is thus less important than components 1 and 2 therefore the analysis below is mainly based on components 1 and 2 based on the scores of the two components fig 5 plots the groundwater samples to examine whether the classification of seven clusters is reasonable to give a cloud view of the clustered groundwater geochemical measurements seven ellipses are plotted for the seven clusters with the 80 confidence level based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the principal component analysis the seven clusters are reasonably distinguished from each other in fig 5 despite marginal overlapping indicating that the cluster classification is reasonable with respect to grouping the groundwater geochemical measurements it is worthwhile pointing out the difference between the results cluster analysis and principal component analysis and those of gan et al 2018 based on 457 water samples 21 surface water samples 91 phreatic groundwater samples and 345 confined groundwater samples collected in 2014 and 2015 gan et al 2018 applied cluster analysis and principal component analysis to the geochemical measurements for investigating the hydrogeological evolution in a small portion 1 800 km2 in area of jianghan plain their principal component analysis gave three principal components corresponding to water rock interactions redox conditions and anthropogenic activities the component of redox conditions was associated with the surface water sample and phreatic groundwater samples because the redox conditions in surface water and phreatic groundwater are substantially different from those in confined groundwater all our data are from the confined groundwater in a reducing environment the reducing environment may affect some redox sensitive elements such as no3 and fe2 in groundwater for the no3 concentrations measured for 1 067 groundwater samples 582 measurements were censored i e measured concentrations being lower than detection limit of 0 01 mg l this may be due to denitrification that occurs in reducing environments with enriched organic carbon as in the aquifer of this study for the concentrations of fe2 and fe3 after replacing the censored data by 75 of the detection limits the mean concentrations of fe2 and fe3 are 2 37 mg l and 0 42 mg l respectively the higher concentrations of fe2 indicate a reducing environment in the aquifer which is consistent with the finding of niu et al 2017 and duan 2016 note that due to missing measurements of fe2 and fe3 concentrations we only used total fe concentrations in our study 5 spatial patterns and controlling factors the hierarchical cluster analysis gave an array with 1 184 elements of cluster index c1 c7 for the 1 184 groundwater samples the cluster indices for each sampling time were extracted and plotted as a snapshot to show their spatial distributions at the well locations the snapshots are the basis for investigating the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry 5 1 stable spatial patterns fig 6 illustrates the snapshots of the seven clusters for the dry and wet seasons of the period of 2004 2014 the snapshots for the period of 1992 2003 are shown in fig s2 of the supplementary file a visual comparison of the snapshots leads to a conclusion that for each year the spatial patterns of the dry and wet seasons are similar for example in the both dry and wet seasons the wells of cluster c2 are located in the central part and the wells of cluster c5 in the lower left part of the study site over the 23 years the spatial patterns of the clusters are similar over time only with a few notable exceptions indicating stable groundwater geochemistry table 2 also suggests stability of the groundwater geochemistry at the study site the table lists the number of samples of each cluster for the individual monitoring wells and the last column of the table is the highest relative frequency taking well j1 as an example this well belongs to cluster c7 for 39 times to c6 for 3 times and to c4 for 2 times the highest frequency is 39 and the highest relative frequency is 39 44 89 a higher frequency indicates a more stable condition that groundwater geochemistry changes less frequently over time for 22 out of the 29 monitoring wells the highest frequency is larger than 80 indicating that for 80 of the sampling times the spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry do not change based on the stable spatial patterns and the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry discussed below four zones of groundwater geochemistry were delineated and more details of the delineation are given in in section 6 5 2 controlling factors the two components of principal component analysis table 1 and fig 5 reflect the controlling factors of the groundwater geochemistry component 1 is related to water rock interactions because of its association with ca2 mg2 and hco3 in reference to natural weathering processes of carbonate minerals component 2 is related to the anthropogenic activities due to strong loadings of cl and so4 2 as the two ions are generally originated from anthropogenic activities at the study site gan et al 2018 zhou et al 2012 this section provides detailed hydrogeochemical analysis to investigate the two controlling factors 5 2 1 water rock interactions due to lacking detailed description of mineralogy of the aquifer a full list of geochemical reactions e g carbonate dissolution and silicate hydrolysis are unknown based on the ratios of ion concentrations we postulate the following five groundwater geochemical reactions to understand water rock interactions in the aquifer 1 cac o 3 h 2 o c o 2 g c a 2 2hco 3 2 camg c o 3 2 2 h 2 o 2c o 2 g c a 2 m g 2 4 hco 3 3 n a 1 2 ca x 2 1 2 c a 2 na x 4 nacl n a c l 5 2naals i 3 o 8 11 h 2 o 2c o 2 g 2n a 2hco 3 4 h 4 si o 4 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 the first two reactions are for the dissolution of calcite and dolomite the third reaction is for the cation exchange between na and ca2 x denoting the exchanger resulting in increasing concentration of ca2 the fourth reaction is for the dissolution of halite and the last reaction is for the albite hydrolysis fig 7 examines the above reactions at the study site by using the ion ratios fig 7 a plots the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 and the data except those of cluster c3 fall between the 1 2 and 1 4 lines this is an evidence of calcite and dolomite dissolution wang et al 2006 because the mole ratio of ca2 hco3 is 1 2 for calcite dissolution eq 1 and 1 4 for dolomite dissolution eq 2 fig 7 b plots the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 and shows that the data except those of clusters c3 and c4 fall on the 1 1 line suggesting that the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 can be largely explained by the dissolution of carbonate minerals the data of cluster c3 deviate from the 1 1 line and have larger ca2 concentrations this can be explained by eq 3 of cation exchange appelo and postma 2005 considering that na concentrations of cluster c3 are significantly higher than ca2 concentration fig 3 and that the aquifer is enriched in clay minerals and organic matter the deviation of cluster c4 data may be caused by the high so4 2 concentrations of this cluster fig 7 c that result in low hco3 concentration due to ionic balance fig 7 d shows that na concentrations are larger than cl concentrations in clusters c1 c2 c5 and c6 that are distributed over the study area the larger na concentration is attributed to the dissolution of albite eq 6 because the na and cl concentrations due to the dissolution of halite eq 4 should fall on the 1 1 line rajmohan and elango 2003 rina et al 2012 the albite dissolution may also explain the relatively high hco3 concentrations shown in fig 7 b for clusters c1 c2 c5 and c6 as albite dissolution produces hco3 between calcite dissolution eqs 1 and 2 and albite hydrolysis eq 5 the former is more important than the latter for controlling groundwater geochemistry in the study site for several reasons first silicate hydrolysis requires a weakly acid condition but groundwater in the aquifer is slightly alkaline with average ph of 7 58 which is demonstrated in fig 3 a therefore silicate hydrolysis may not be important for the alkaline groundwater in addition although the weight percentages of albite and carbonate are very close 21 vs 20 the concentration of na ranges between 0 1 and 2 mmol l fig 7 d but the concentration of ca2 ranges between 1 and 5 mmol l fig 7 a this indicates that albite hydrolysis is less important than carbonate dissolution the last line of evidence is shown in fig 7 e and f which plot the relation between the saturation index of calcite dolomite and the concentration of ca2 mg2 in four zones of groundwater geochemistry from the recharge are to the discharge area of the aquifer more details of the four zones are given in section 6 the two figures show that the saturation index and the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 increase gradually along the regional groundwater flow path from zone 1 recharge area to zone iv discharge area indicating that carbonate dissolution occurs along the flow path it should be noted that the five geochemical reactions discussed above may be only a portion of water rock interactions that can explain the ion ratios a full list of geochemical reactions of water rock interactions including those related to the release of as and denitrification is unavailable due to the lack of mineralogical and biogeochemical data of the aquifer sediments if the data were to become available a more quantitative analysis e g geochemical modeling using software such as phreeqc should be performed to better understand the water rock interactions this and collecting more information of the aquifer mineralogy are warranted in a future study 5 2 2 anthropogenic impacts the phrase of anthropogenic impacts is a general term and one specific focus of this study is on the pollution caused by extremely high concentrations of na cl and so4 2 at several wells belonging to clusters c3 and c4 table 2 shows that 34 out of the 35 groundwater samples of cluster c3 are from well j10 whose na and cl concentrations are 20 100 times higher than those of other wells fig 3 e and f since well j10 is located at one of the largest pesticide factories in china the high concentrations of na and cl may be due to wastewater infiltration from the factory to the aquifer groundwater contamination and other environmental problems caused by the factory have been an environmental concern to the public ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china 2011 elevated so4 2 concentration is a geochemical characteristic of cluster c4 fig 3 g and table 2 shows that 43 samples of cluster c4 are from well j9 located in a cotton mill and 18 samples from well j25 located in a water supply plant niu at al 2017 stated that industrial activities and potential leachates from the industrial areas probably accounted for high so4 2 concentrations and a detailed field investigation is warranted in a future study to understand the exact reasons for the elevated so4 2 concentrations another specific focus of this study is on nitrate concentrations that are always closely related to anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer use in agricultural lands the major land use in the study site to determine whether nitrate is a controlling factor of groundwater geochemistry the cluster and principal component analyses were conducted twice for two different datasets without and with nitrate concentrations the results discussed above are based on the dataset without nitrate concentrations nitrate was excluded from the analysis for the following two reasons 1 nitrate concentrations were not continuously measured among the 1 184 groundwater samples nitrate concentrations were not measured for 117 samples about 10 of the samples and 2 nitrate concentrations measured for 582 samples were censored i e measured concentrations being lower than detection limit of 0 01 mg l to include nitrate concentrations into the cluster and principal component analyses the censored nitrate concentrations were replaced by 75 of the detection limit resulting in a smaller dataset of 1 067 groundwater samples and 12 groundwater geochemical parameters the original 11 ones plus nitrate for the dataset with nitrate seven clusters were also classified based on the dendrogram plotted in fig s3 the seven clusters are denoted as cs1 cs7 and table s1 lists the number of samples of each cluster for the individual monitoring wells clusters cs1 cs7 are equivalent to clusters c1 c7 in terms of the wells included in the clusters for example table 2 shows that wells j18 and j21 belong to cluster c1 and the same two wells belong to cluster cs1 as shown in table s1 comparing tables 2 and s1 for all the clusters indicates that including nitrate concentrations in the cluster analysis did not change the spatial distribution of the cluster 1s this is further conformed by comparing the snapshots of clusters cs1 cs7 plotted in figs s4 and s5 with the snapshots of clusters c1 c7 plotted in figs 6 and s2 despite of small variation the spatial distribution of the clusters does not change after including nitrate concentration in the cluster analysis therefore the analysis below is still based on the seven clusters classified by using the 1 184 water samples with 11 groundwater geochemistry parameters with nitrate excluded the anthropogenic impacts discussed in this section are relevant to several findings of niu et al 2017 for example niu et al 2017 found that industrial wastewater is responsible to increased cl and so4 2 concentrations at several wells and this is used in this study to understand why cluster c3 is characterized with high cl concentrations and cluster c4 with high so4 2 concentrations however since our study differs from niu et al 2017 in terms of their purposes and scopes certain findings of the two studies are not directly comparable for example niu et al 2017 found that no3 concentrations has been increasing due to extensive fertilizer use but we found that no3 concentrations are not important to cluster classification because measured concentrations are low which may be due to denitrification given the reducing environment and high concentration of organic carbon in the aquifer as explained in section 2 therefore we did not intensively compare the results of our study with those of niu et al 2017 6 four zones of groundwater geochemistry based on the highest frequency data listed in table 2 and the understanding of the controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry discussed above four groundwater geochemical zones were delineated and shown in fig 8 the figure also plots spatial distribution of sediment outcrops at land surface which was also used for delineating the four zones the delineation of the four zones is a major contribution of this study for understanding groundwater geochemistry at the study site the zone delineation started with the wells belonging to the same cluster for example table 2 indicates that wells j18 and j21 belong to the same groundwater geochemistry zone because 22 out of the 26 samples at well j18 belong to cluster c1 and 31 out of 45 samples at well j21 belong to cluster c1 several clusters were combined into one groundwater geochemistry zones based on the hydrogeochemical analysis explained in detail below zone i is the recharge zone of the aquifer and the groundwater samples of this zone are from well j1 of cluster c7 table 2 as shown in fig 8 the aquifer sediments q3 and q2 are exposed at land surface and an unconfined condition prevails in zone i therefore precipitation can directly recharge the aquifer and groundwater geochemistry in this zone is mainly of recharge water with weak water rock interactions as a result groundwater geochemistry of zone i is characterized by lowest concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 fig 3 this is also consistent with the results of principal component analysis fig 5 as the groundwater samples of cluster c7 have the lowest scores of component 1 i e the water rock interactions component the boundary of zone i was determined by the geological boundary between q2 q3 and qh sediments where the hydrogeological conditions may change from unconfined to confined conditions zone ii is the transition zone between the recharge zone zone i and the flow through zone zone iii groundwater samples from this zone mainly belong to clusters c5 and c6 wells j4 j11 j16 j17 and j27 are c5 wells and wells j2 j3 j5 j6 j28 and j29 are c6 wells after precipitation infiltrates into the aquifer at the mountain area zone i and flows downgradient to the flat area zone iii of the jianghan plain groundwater continuously reacts with the aquifer sediments this explains the similarity of the ion concentrations between clusters c5 and c6 fig 2 precipitation still affects groundwater geochemistry in the transition zone because the depth of aquifer sediments is shallow generally 5 10 m and precipitation directly recharges groundwater due to discontinuous aquitard and semi confined conditions in zone ii except the wells of clusters c5 and c6 other wells located in zone ii were not used for the delineation of zone ii for example although well j10 of cluster c3 and well j9 of cluster c4 are located in zone ii their groundwater geochemistry is affected mainly by anthropogenic activities as explained above zone iii is the flow through zone before groundwater is discharged out of the study site groundwater samples of this zone are all from c2 wells except well j25 of cluster c4 although well j25 is identified as a c4 well it is possible that this well belongs to cluster c2 if the well is not affected by anthropogenic activities because 18 samples of well j25 belong to cluster c4 and 16 samples to cluster c2 table 2 this flow through zone is confined with the deepest generally 20 40 m aquifer sediments groundwater flows slowly in this zone due to low hydraulic conductivity and small hydraulic gradient zhao 2005 which allows strong interaction between groundwater and aquifer sediments therefore this zone is characterized by higher concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in comparison with their relative concentrations in zones i and ii fig 3 zone iv is the discharge mixing zone before groundwater discharges into the yangtze river groundwater samples from this zone are from wells j18 and j21 of cluster c1 and well j23 of cluster c2 the groundwater geochemistry of this zone is mainly characterized by the highest concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 fig 3 and this can be explained by the continuous water rock interactions along the regional flow path groundwater and surface water interaction also plays an important role in groundwater geochemistry recalling that the aquifer is hydraulically connected to the yangtze river fig s1 groundwater discharges to the river when the river stage is lower than the aquifer head and receives recharge from the river otherwise well j23 is included in this zone due to its close distance 1 4 km to the yangtze river the four zones discussed above provide a conceptual model for understanding the spatial variation of groundwater geochemistry due to water rock interactions taking the tds concentration as an example tds increases along the regional groundwater flow direction from zone i to zone iv due to continuous water rock interactions as shown in fig 3 l when groundwater moves from the northwest to the southeast the average tds concentration is 593 mg l for the wells of cluster c7 in zone i increases to 603 mg l for the wells of clusters c5 and c6 in zone ii further increases to 770 mg l for the wells of cluster c2 in zone iii and finally reaches 859 mg l for the wells of cluster c1 in zone iv the same pattern of spatial variation is also observed for the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 shown in figs 3 and 7 a and b as the four zones of groundwater geochemistry were delineated for the first time more research may be needed to further examine the zone delineation one way to do so is to first develop a regional scale model of groundwater reactive transport based on existing geologic and hydrologic knowledge and data and then use the model to simulate the concentrations of the groundwater geochemistry parameters in the aquifer since the simulated concentrations are for the entire aquifer not limited to monitoring well locations they may be used to examine the spatial distribution of the four zones however developing the groundwater reactive transport model for the regional aquifer is beyond the scope of this study 7 temporal variation and controlling factors although the groundwater geochemistry is generally stable over the 23 years temporal variations are observed by examining the snapshots of the spatial patterns of the clusters fig 6 recalling that changes of clusters indicate changes of groundwater geochemistry a better way of examining the cluster changes is to plot the temporal variation of cluster index for each well as shown in fig 9 the seven wells were selected because of their low relative frequency less than 80 of belonging to one cluster table 2 taking well j8 as an example fig 9 a shows that this well belongs to cluster c7 for 32 times to cluster c4 for 10 times and to cluster c2 for 3 times 7 1 temporal variation fig 9 reveals both short and long term cluster changes a short term change means that a well belongs to a cluster for a short period e g half a year or one year and then changes to another cluster a long term cluster change means that once a well changes to another cluster the well stays in the cluster for a long period of time e g several years in fig 9 the temporal cluster changes are short term for wells j7 and j28 for j7 it occasionally belongs to clusters c6 and c7 for j28 it stays in cluster c6 for most of the time but occasionally belongs to cluster c5 this is not surprising because the two clusters are located in the transition zone zone ii fig 8 and have similar concentrations for the geochemical parameters fig 3 the short term changes at the two wells reflect the fluctuations of groundwater geochemistry in this zone short term cluster changes are affected by multiple factors such as precipitation changes nguyen et al 2015 fertilizer uses niu et al 2017 puckett 1995 and seasonal pumping huang et al 2018 schaefer et al 2016 2017 cheng et al 2017 in addition understanding the short term changes requires collecting data at a short time scale e g monthly since the monitoring data used in this study were collected at the seasonal scale they are not adequate for explaining the short term changes in fig 9 the temporal cluster changes are long term for wells j2 j8 j21 j23 and j25 for these five wells j2 is located in an aquafarm j8 about 300 m away from a cotton mill j23 in a fertilizer plant and j25 in a water supply plant the four wells changed to cluster c4 characterized by high so4 2 concentrations in the last several years suggesting the long term impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater geochemistry the long term cluster changes may reflect water type changes taking well j8 as an example its water type changes from ca hco3 to ca hco3 so4 since 2010 this is consistent with the cluster change shown in fig 9 a in that since 2010 well j8 changes to cluster c4 that is characterized with high so4 2 concentration fig 3 however since the anthropogenic activities are not documented detailed study of their impacts is difficult if not impossible the long term change for well j21 is attributed to the impacts of the three gorges reservoir because the well changes from cluster c1 to cluster c2 after 2010 fig 9 b when the reservoir operation started 7 2 impacts of three gorges dam depending on the difference of water levels between the yangtze river and the aquifer the river aquifer interactions change temporally and spatially and the change substantially influences the recharge discharge dynamics of the aquifer in the upper reach of the yangtze river upstream of the ouchikou site see its location in fig 1 the river stage is constantly higher than the groundwater level and the aquifer receives recharge from the yangtze river even in the dry seasons this is illustrated in fig s6 a that plots the river stage at the shashi station see its location in fig 1 and the nearby well j10 in the upstream reach of the river in the lower reach of the yangtze river downstream of the ouchikou the difference of water levels between the river and the aquifer changes in dry and wet seasons during the dry seasons from december to march of next year the groundwater levels are higher than the river stages and groundwater discharges to the river during the wet seasons from april to november the groundwater levels are lower than the river stages and groundwater is recharged by the river this is illustrated in fig s6 b that plots the river stage at the luoshan station see its location in fig 1 and the nearby well j23 in the downstream reach of the river it is expected that the recharge discharge dynamics have more substantial impacts on groundwater geochemistry in the downstream reach than in the upstream reach of the river this is supported by the fact that there are essentially no cluster changes at upstream wells j9 j12 and j13 for wells j2 j8 j21 j23 and j25 with long term cluster changes shown in fig 9 only well j21 is located near the downstream reach of the yangtze river and it is the focus of the analysis below since groundwater level at well j21 was not measured we assume that the groundwater discharge recharge dynamics at this well is similar to that of well j23 shown in fig s6 b fig 9 b shows that well j21 mostly belonged to cluster c1 from 1992 to 2008 but changed to cluster c4 in the dry period of 2009 fluctuated between c1 and c2 from the wet period of 2009 to the wet period of 2011 and then remains as c2 afterward these changes are also observed in the snapshots plotted in fig 6 we attribute these changes to the construction and operation of the three gorges dam the operation history of the three gorges dam during 2003 2014 can be separated into four stages i e initial stage transitional stage quasi normal stage and normal stage deng et al 2016 tang et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the water level in the reservoir fluctuated seasonally but increased gradually from 135 m to 175 m from june 2003 to october 2010 175 m being the normal water level of the reservoir fig s7 of the supplementary file deng et al 2016 reported that while the reservoir construction and operation did not have remarkable impacts on water cycle of the yangtze river for the first two stages the river stages were significantly increased in the latter two stages in the dry seasons according to wang et al 2013 the river stage increased about 0 33 m in the upper reach and 0 38 m in the lower reach of the yangtze river after 2009 considering that the yangtze river penetrates into the aquifer and that the river stage is higher than the confining layer fig s1 it is reasonable to expect that during the quasi normal and normal stages of the reservoir the aquifer receives more recharge from the yangtze river due to the river stage increase he and tang 2017 in particular the start of the quasi normal stage of the reservoir in october 2008 appears to correspond to the change of well j21 from cluster c1 to other clusters starting from the dry period of 2009 the normal stage of the reservoir starting from october 2010 appears to correspond to the well s permanent change from cluster c1 to cluster c2 to quantify the mixing of groundwater and river water the mixing fraction of river water was calculated by using a two end member mixing model crandall et al 1999 6 f rw c gw c m c gw c rw where frw is the mixing factor of river water i e the portion of river water in the mixed groundwater and river water and cm crw and cgw denote the concentrations of a geochemical parameter in the mixed water river water and groundwater respectively the mixing factor of river water was calculated for cl ca2 mg2 and hco3 as a conservative tracer cl is commonly used for determining water mixing crandall et al 1999 kirchner et al 2010 ca2 mg2 and hco3 were chosen because they are the major ions produced by the water rock interactions the groundwater concentrations of the four parameters were set as the mean concentrations of the groundwater geochemistry measurements at well j21 before 2009 the corresponding river water concentrations were based on the data of sample cj23 list in table 1 of li et al 2014 who studied water quality of the yangtze river this sample was selected because its sample location is close to well j21 it should be noted that since the river sample was collected in the wet season of 2013 the calculated mixing factor of river water may not accurately reflect the temporal variation of the factor fig 10 shows the calculated mixing factors of river water for cl ca2 mg2 and hco3 during the period of 2010 2014 generally speaking except that of mg2 in 2014 the mixing factors of the four geochemical parameters are similar suggesting a consistent effect of river recharge on the groundwater geochemical parameters in the dry periods of 2010 and 2011 the mixing factor is near zero this explains why well j21 returned to cluster c1 in the two periods fig 9 starting from the wet season of 2011 the mixing factor remains more or less stable except the mixing factor of mg2 in 2014 and this corresponds to the normal stage of the three gorges dam it is thus concluded that the dilution of groundwater by yangtze river water is the major reason for the temporal change of groundwater geochemistry it is reasonable to expect that the impacts of the three gorges dam on the groundwater geochemistry will continue after 2014 it is worth mentioning that the mixing factor was calculated only for well j21 not for well j18 another c1 well because geochemical measurements at well j18 after 2010 are not available the deviation of the mixing fraction of mg2 after 2013 may be caused by the relatively large changes of mg2 concentration and or the approximate values used for crw and cgw an improved understanding of the deviation may be gained in a future study niu et al 2017 also reported the impacts of the three gorges reservoir on the groundwater geochemistry in the jianghan plain however their rationale is different from ours in that their conclusion is based on the trend analysis for the increase of ph increase of no3 n concentrations and decrease of nh4 n concentrations in addition their reported starting time of the impacts is 2003 whereas ours is 2009 another difference is that their conclusion is based on the spatial mean values i e the mean over all the 29 monitoring wells whereas our conclusion is based on the data of well j21 near the yangtze river using the data of individual wells may be more reasonable because it is unlikely that the three gorges reservoir affects all the 29 monitoring wells especially those far from the yangtze river the impacts of the three gorges reservoir on the groundwater geochemistry in the jianghan plain is sophisticated and to fully understand the impacts may require installing monitoring wells along a transect away from the river conducting hydrodynamics modeling and or stable isotope analysis which however is beyond the scope of this study 8 comparison with conventional cluster analysis the cluster analysis method used in this study enabled us to simultaneously identify the spatial and temporal patterns and controlling factors of the groundwater geochemistry the simultaneous identification may not be achieved by using conventional methods of cluster analysis this is illustrated by comparing the results of our cluster analysis with those obtained by using a conventional cluster analysis that uses temporal averages to identify spatial patterns for each groundwater geochemistry parameter its temporal average was calculated over the entire monitoring period resulting in a data matrix of 29 rows and 11 columns corresponding to 29 wells and 11 groundwater geochemistry parameters for this data matrix the same procedure of hierarchical cluster analysis was performed and the 29 wells were also classified into seven clusters the phenon line was drawn at linkage distance of 5 denoted as cluster g1 g7 based on the dendrogram plotted in fig s8 the last snapshot of fig 6 plots the well locations of clusters g1 g7 while this snapshot cannot be compared with any snapshot of clusters c1 c7 shown in figs 6 and s2 for individual sampling times roughly speaking the spatial pattern shown in this snapshot is similar to that of clusters c1 c7 shown in figs 6 and s2 this is not surprising because the spatial pattern is stable as discussed in section 5 1 however the cluster analysis based on temporal averages cannot reveal temporal changes for the wells that belong to different clusters due to changes of groundwater geochemistry taking well j23 as an example in the cluster analysis based on temporal averages this well belongs to cluster g4 characterized by high so4 2 concentrations in comparison with other g clusters in our cluster analysis this well was classified into c2 for 2times and into c4 for 16 times table 2 the snapshots of clusters c1 c7 in fig 6 show that this well was classified into c4 since 2006 the reason is that so4 2 concentration changed dramatically after 2006 the mean so4 2 concentrations for the period of 1992 2005 is 3 76 mg l but increased dramatically to 104 40 mg l for the period of 2006 2014 the change of so4 2 concentration over time was ignored in the cluster analysis based on temporal mean but captured in our cluster analysis this problem may become severe if groundwater geochemistry changes more frequent than in our study 9 conclusions a recently developed cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 was used in this study for understanding the spatial and temporal patterns and controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry in the regional aquifer of the jianghan plain china this cluster analysis method can handle the large dataset with 13 024 measurements of 1 184 groundwater samples collected over a long period of time 1992 2014 from 29 monitoring wells distributed over the jianghan plain the major conclusions related to understanding the regional scale groundwater geochemistry in the confined aquifer of jianghan plain are as follows 1 the cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 can be applied to a large dataset e g the one used in this study for investigating both spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry this is done by first classifying monitoring data of groundwater geochemistry into clusters and then examining spatial and temporal variations of the clusters to understand controlling factors of groundwater geochemistry based on hydrogeochemical analysis the temporal changes of groundwater geochemistry identified by using the cluster analysis method of pacheco castro et al 2018 cannot be revealed by the conventional cluster analysis based on temporal averages 2 in this study the hierarchical cluster analysis yielded seven clusters c1 c7 for the 1 184 groundwater samples the principal component analysis of the 1 184 samples and hydrogeochemical analyses through stiff and piper diagrams indicate that the classified seven clusters are statistically and geochemically reasonable 3 based on spatial distribution of the seven clusters and hydrogeochemical analysis mainly water rock interactions for the seven clusters jianghan plain was separated into four geochemical zones along the regional groundwater flow path which is a major contribution of this study for the water rock interactions the dissolution of calcite and dolomite is the most dominant controlling factor of groundwater geochemistry followed by the albite hydrolysis 4 anthropogenic activities caused high concentrations of cl na and so4 2 due to industrial production in a pesticides factory a cotton mill and a water supply plant nitrate concentrations are not an important factor to spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry the cluster analysis revealed the temporal variation of the seven clusters controlled by the three gorges reservoir since 2009 the interactions between groundwater and the yangtze river are confirmed by the calculated mixing fraction of the yangtze river the findings above for understanding the spatial patterns of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale are useful for water resource management such as designing future groundwater quality monitoring networks however it should be noted that variations of groundwater geochemistry at small scales and their controlling factors are more complex and more intensive groundwater samples are necessary for a detailed study in the future the impacts of the three gorges reservoir on groundwater geochemistry is of particular use since the reservoir is the largest hydropower plant in the world and the yangtze river is vulnerable to contamination further study of the impacts is warranted by other means such as calculating the mixing fraction using stable isotope data which are currently unavailable

5712,moisture sources affect the temporal variations of the elevation effects on the stable isotopes in monsoon precipitation however whether it will lead to spatial variations and form a specific spatial temporal heterogeneity pattern remains to be explored based on the monthly precipitation samples collected in ailao mountains of east asian monsoon region we computed and identified five moisture source regions to facilitate its comparison to the monthly oxygen isotope composition δ 18o of precipitation with hysplit model we analysed the influence mechanisms of the moisture sources on the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effect on the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes during dry and rainy seasons we found that the temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effects on the precipitation 18o depends on the proportion of the moisture sources in the dominant direction and as the proportion increases the elevation effect becomes more significant the spatial heterogeneity depends on the combination complexity of the moisture sources the simpler the combinations the more significant the elevation effects the results demonstrate that for precipitation δ 18o in ailao mountains the dominant of monsoon moisture sources the ratio higher than 50 can result in significant elevation effects while the mixtures of multiple moisture sources and the dominant of local moisture sources will lead to no elevation effects future studies should pay more attention to the influence mechanism of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effects on a relatively larger or global scale keywords hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in precipitation elevation effect moisture source temporal and spatial heterogeneity influence mechanism 1 introduction as the primary method of tracing the water cycle the atmospheric precipitation isotopes of 18o and 2h have the characteristic of changing with time and space which is reflected in the continental effect latitude effect altitude elevation effect and seasonal effect craig 1961 dansgaared 1964 li et al 2016 koster et al 1986 jodar et al 2016 the temporal and spatial variability of the composition of the stable isotopes present in the precipitation in the asian monsoon regions has long been a prominent topic in academia rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 araguás araguás et al 1998 influenced by the third pole of the earth there are complex elevation effects on the composition of the stable isotopes present in the precipitation in the tibetan plateau and its surrounding mountain areas therefore it is difficult to describe the complexity of the spatial and temporal variations concurrently exploring its influence mechanism can be used to guide the water resource management in this area particularly the countermeasures for flood and drought disasters under extreme weather conditions the elevation effect on precipitation isotopes is the phenomenon in which 18o and 2h are gradually depleted as the elevation increases dansgaared 1964 garzione et al 2015 koeniger et al 2016 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 tang et al 2015 the elevation effect was first discovered in δ 18o and δ 2h in the summer precipitation on the alps with a gradient of 0 2 100 m 1 ambach et al 1968 peng et al 2011 subsequently the research results from 68 mountains worldwide have revealed that except for some high latitude or high altitude mountain areas elevation effects can be found on δ 18o in most of the mountain areas moreover their gradients have no significant difference ranging from 0 5 100 m 1 to 0 15 100 m 1 with an average of 0 28 100 m 1 poage and chamberlain 2001 numerous studies have shown that the elevation effect varies with time and space owing to the influence of the temperature rainfall and moisture sources andreo et al 2004 liebminger et al 2006 jódar et al 2016 its temporal variation includes numerous time scales such as the year gonfiantini et al 2001 season bortolami et al 1979 and month yang et al 2009 whereas its spatial variation is more complex some studies have exhibited that under the influence of a single or dominant moisture source the δ 18o and δ 2h present in the precipitation in mountain areas shows significant elevation effects gat 1996 kurita et al 2005 however in some alpine areas when disturbed by the mixing processes of an airflow over mountain on the leeward slopes siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 blisniuk and stern 2005 secondary evaporation moisture under the clouds froehlich et al 2008 and multicomponent moisture holdsworth and krouse 2002 bershaw et al 2012 the elevation effects on the δ 2h and δ 18o present in the precipitation will become insignificant there may even be an anti elevation effect on the mountaintop and a significant elevation effect below the mountaintop niewodnizanski discovered this phenomenon in 1981 however up to now most scholars believe that this is caused by the interference of local or other moisture sources on the normal elevation effect kong and pang 2016 ren et al 2017 some studies discussed the effect of a combination of moisture sources on the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect and its mechanism e g qu et al 2018 jiao et al 2019 studied the stable isotopes present in the precipitation during the rainy season in ailao mountain according to the results the elevation effect in this area showed dynamic changes from being significant to being insignificant during one season owing to the influences of various spatial and temporal combinations of the over peak moisture and local moisture spatially there were remarkable anti elevation effects at the mountaintop and normal elevation effects below the mountaintop therefore more research needs to be performed to further explore whether the elevation effect on the different isotopes has similar temporal and spatial variations and determine the influence mechanism of the moisture sources during a dry season or even throughout the year in this area in this study the effects of the moisture sources on the elevation effect on the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes present in the precipitation in the hani terrace of ailao mountain were analysed by combining the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model and two component mixing model of isotopes the main focuses included 1 the elevation effect and gradient of δ 18o present in precipitation on three scales year dry and rainy seasons and month 2 the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effects on δ 18o present in the precipitation during the dry and rainy seasons 3 the influence mechanism of the moisture sources on the spatial temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect and its spatial temporal combination pattern finally it provided a regional case for the spatial and temporal complexity of the elevation effect on δ 18o present in the precipitation in the mountains within the asian monsoon regions moreover this study also yielded the decision making basis for the hani terrace heritage to deal with drought and extreme rainfall events 2 study area the study area is the quanfuzhuang watershed with an area of 11 km2 located within the core area of the honghe hani terrace cultural landscape heritage in the southern section of ailao mountain in southwest china its longitude and latitude ranges are 102 43 16 102 50 39 e and 23 5 20 23 13 18 n respectively fig 1 the area has a subtropical mountain monsoon climate with an annual precipitation of 1754 mm evaporation of 929 mm annual average humidity of 90 3 and annual average temperature of 14 2 affected by the east asian monsoon the dry season and rainy season are distinct the rainy season from may to october is controlled by the warm and humid air masses from the southwest monsoon and southeast monsoon the precipitation is abundant accounting for 80 of the annual precipitation the dry season from november to april is controlled by the dry and cold air masses from the inland with the precipitation accounting for only 20 of the annual precipitation 38735258762500 the small watershed belongs to a primary tributary of the red river it covers an area of 13 92 km2 and is fan shaped its topography is high in the south and low in the north and decreases stepwise from the south to north the elevation of the watershed is between 1450 m and 2261 m at high elevations h 1900 m there are mainly forest areas at middle elevations 1700 m 1900 m and low elevations h 1700 m there are rice terrace areas the villages are concentrated between 1700 m and 1800 m according to research the southwest warm and humid air flow from the indian ocean always crosses the mountaintops during the rainy season bringing 1400 mm of abundant precipitation in the high elevation section of the quanfuzhuang river basin jiao et al 2019 however during the dry season the precipitation formed by the evaporation of the terrace water surface is the main source with an average rainfall of 351 mm jiao et al 2019 3 data and methods 3 1 acquisition and processing of samples and data during the period from may 2015 to april 2016 precipitation samples were collected from seven sampling points point 1 1468 m point 2 1663 m point 3 1798 m point 4 1889 m point 5 1957 m point 6 2004 m and point 7 2024 m distributed according to the elevation gradient fig 1 table 1 totally 84 valid samples were collected the sample collection equipment was a self made rainwater collector according to iaea gnip precipitation sampling guide http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf at the end of the month water samples were collected and the water volume was recorded the samples were packed in 100 ml polyethylene bottles before the sampling the bottles were washed thrice with rain water and then rapidly filled after ensuring that there were no bubbles in the bottles they were sealed with a sealant and labelled for reserve the hydrogen and oxygen isotope tests were conducted in the key laboratory of plateau lake ecology and global change yunnan normal university using a picarro l2130 i ultra high precision liquid water and moisture isotope analyser the measurement accuracy of 18o and d of the instrument was 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the final analysis results were expressed by the thousandth difference relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as follows δ 18 o r sample r v s m o w 1 1000 where rsample and rv smow represent the oxygen stable isotope ratios of r 18o 16o in the water samples and v smow respectively meteorological data were acquired by the automatic weather station installed at sampling point 3 the parameters included precipitation temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and air pressure the locations of the sampling points were determined by a hand held gps and the topographic maps were provided by the local government and distribution maps of the sampling points were drawn by the arcgis 10 0 software 3 2 hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model the simulation results of the moisture source trajectory of the precipitation at different times were based on the hysplit model the model was developed jointly by the air resources laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa of the united states and the australian bureau of meteorology for the calculation and analysis of the atmospheric pollutant transport and diffusion trajectories it could also forecast the wind field in real time and study the moisture transport trajectory the initial time of the model running was at the zero hour of the utc time and the height was 500 m from the ground of the study area the initial location was sampling point 3 located in the middle of the sample points in the study area the tracing dates were around the 30th 20th and 10th days of each month with backward tracing for 10 days 240 h the tracing dates changed according to the days of each month accordingly continuous precipitation could be covered and the accuracy of tracing the moisture sources could be improved for determine the direction of a moisture source the west and east quadrants were delineated with the study area as the origin moreover the number of moisture trajectories in each quadrant represented the moisture input on the west and east sides of ailao mountain respectively 3 3 two component mixing model 1 transformed two component mixing model 1 f δ pv δ re δ adv δ re where

results and analysis 4 1 statistical analysis of δ 18o and δd in precipitation 4 1 1 local meteoric water line the stable isotope data of the precipitation from may 2015 to april 2016 yields the local meteoric water line lmwl equation δ 2h 8 31 0 15 δ 18o 21 88 1 4 r2 0 97 n 84 fig 2 the slope and intercept are larger than this of the global meteoric water line gmwl equations δ 2h 8 14 0 02 δ 18o 10 9 0 2 r 0 98 gourcy et al 2005 the slope and intercept are also larger than those of the china meteoric water line cmwl equation δ 2h 7 48δ 18o 1 01 based on the stable 2h and 18o values in the precipitation that was collected from 2005 to 2010 at 29 chnip stations liu et al 2014 the results show that the study area is affected by the subtropical monsoon climate the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation are remarkably different in the dry and rainy seasons they are depleted in the rainy season and enriched in the dry season which is consistent with the chinese monsoon region e g peng et al 2010 li et al 2017 in addition the lmwl equations during the rainy and dry seasons in the study area are δ 2h 6 51δ 18o 1 19 r2 0 94 n 42 and δ 2h 7 31δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 94 n 42 respectively it can be seen that the slope and intercept of the lmwl during the dry season are notably larger than those during the rainy season and the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation during the dry season are more abundant than in that those during the rainy season to avoid shifts along the gwml causing by seasonal changes liu et al 2014 boschetti et al 2019 the local meteoric water line equation obtained by amount weighted regression is gmwle δ 2h 8 40 0 39 δ 18o 22 77 3 50 r2 0 97 n 84 the slope and intercept of gmwle is similar to that of the gmwl overall considering the dominant impact of moisture sources on water isotopes and deuterium excess each region has unique features of spatial distribution and seasonal variation for stable precipitation isotopes and deuterium excess kong et al 2019 therefore the geographical pattern and meteorological hydrological process are the key factors impacting on the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of precipitation isotopes in monsoon china zhang and wang 2016 4 1 2 spatial and temporal differentiation of δ 18o and δ 2h in the mean stable isotope composition of the global precipitation the ranges of δ 18o and δ 2h are 50 10 and 350 50 lin 2013 the variation ranges of the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation in the study area are 15 46 0 92 and 99 55 13 77 respectively the average values are 7 97 and 44 42 respectively in addition the dry and rainy seasons are distinct during the rainy season the variation ranges of δ 18o and δ 2h are 15 46 7 69 and 99 55 48 85 respectively the average values are 11 47 and 75 91 respectively during the dry season the variation ranges of δ 18o and δ 2h are 10 14 0 92 and 99 55 13 77 respectively the average values are 4 56 and 13 58 respectively in terms of time fig 3 the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation tend to be depleted during the rainy season and enriched continuously during the dry season the rainy season can be divided into three periods the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation are the highest in the first period from may to june during the second period from july to september they become lower and during the third period october the values are the lowest the dry season can be divided into two periods the first period from november to january of the following year the values decrease rapidly and during the second period from february to april in the following year the decrease speed declines the spatial distributions of the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation in the study area are different fig 3 and the difference during the rainy season is more notable than that during the dry season the interquartile range iqr of δ 18o and δ 2h during the rainy season is large which indicates a large spatial difference however the iqr is small during the dry season which suggests that the spatial difference is small it can be seen that the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation in the study area have the same spatial and temporal variation characteristics therefore only δ 18o was analysed in the following study 4 2 temporal change in elevation effect and gradient of δ 18o in precipitation 4 2 1 rainy season the elevation effect correlation and gradient analysis results of the δ 18o present in the precipitation during the rainy season at the seven sampling points in the study area are summarized in table 2 the δ 18o in the precipitation in most months during the rainy season has a significant elevation effect and its gradient is between 0 36 100 m 1 and 0 15 100 m 1 which is within the range of the currently recognized global elevation gradient of δ 18o in a precipitation 0 5 100 m 1 0 15 100 m 1 the average value is equal to the global average of 0 28 100 m 1 poage and chamberlain 2001 in addition the elevation gradient of the δ 18o in the precipitation varies dynamically during the rainy season it is near the global average from may to august whereas it is near the lower limit of the global value range in october in addition there is no elevation effect in september indicating that precipitations in september and october may be affected by different moisture sources 4 2 2 dry season table 1 shows that there is no significant elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation during the entire dry season and its gradient range is from 0 07 100 m 1 to 0 20 100 m 1 which is outside the global range and tends to be zero it indicates that the stable isotope composition in the precipitation at different elevations during the dry season is relatively consistent which is a result of the mixing of the multiple moisture sources the elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation throughout the year is not significant table 2 and its elevation gradient of 0 09 100 m 1 also tends to zero it indicates that the δ 18o in the precipitation is affected by multiple moisture sources in most months of the year based on which the moisture source in the study area was analysed 4 3 simulation and calculation of moisture sources of δ 18o in precipitation during dry and rainy seasons 4 3 1 moisture sources of precipitation indicated by deuterium excess the concept of deuterium excess or d excess hereinafter referred to as d value was first proposed by dansgaared 1964 to evaluate the extent of the regional atmospheric precipitation deviation from the gmwl due to geographical and climatic factors its expression is d δd 8δ 18o the d value in the study area ranged from 8 53 to 31 11 with an average of 19 38 the range of the d value during the rainy season was from 8 53 to 24 71 with an average of 15 88 and during the dry season it was from 19 46 to 31 11 with an average of 22 87 the d value during the rainy season was significantly lower than that during the dry season according to the year round change fig 4 the d value from may to september is small and its change over time is gradual however the spatial difference is large which indicates that the precipitation in these months is mainly external moisture with numerous source directions from october to march of the following year the d value becomes larger and varies significantly over time however its spatial difference reduces which indicates that the moisture source of precipitation has gradually changed to local and relatively single sources in these months the spatial variation of the d value in april of the following year is consistent with that from may to september which indicates that the moisture source has changed to external moisture again 4 3 2 analysis of external moisture source of the precipitation using hysplit model the trajectory simulation fig 5 of the moisture source in the study area by the hysplit model shows that the moisture mainly comes from five directions the southwestern indian ocean sw south eastern pacific ocean se the north eastern inland ne southern branch of the westerlies sb and northern branch of the westerlies nb the southwestern indian ocean accounts for 65 of the moisture transported throughout the year making it the main source of the transported moisture when there are dominant moisture sources during the rainy season the elevation effect on the 18o in the precipitation is significant in the study area for example in may and june the southwest monsoon is the only moisture source in july the northeast monsoon is the dominant moisture source and in august the southwest monsoon is the dominant moisture source the correlation between the δ 18o in the precipitation and elevation in these months has passed the test concurrently the elevation gradient is also near the global average of 0 28 100 m 1 in the absence of dominant moisture sources the elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation in the study area is not significant for example the southwest and southeast monsoons affect the precipitation in september whereas the southwest southeast and northeast monsoons affect the precipitation in october thus the correlation of the elevation effect in september is not significant for october the elevation gradient is at the lower limit of the global value although the correlation is significant however during the dry season these effects seem to become incorrect as shown in fig 5 the southwest monsoon is the dominant moisture source for each month during the dry season but the elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation is not significant which is related to the local moisture source of the precipitation generally the local moisture source of the precipitation mainly originates from a mixture of the external moisture and recycling moisture van et al 2010 wang et al 2016 therefore it is also necessary to analyse the proportion of the recycled moisture present in the study area to determine its impact on the elevation effect 4 3 3 calculation of ratios of moisture sources of precipitation using two component mixing model the calculation results of the mixing ratio of the external to the local moisture based on a two component mixing model of the isotopes are summarized in table 3 according to the results the mixing ratios of the local and external moisture in the study area are 65 and 35 respectively throughout the year during the rainy season the external moisture accounts for 79 and local circulation moisture accounts for 21 of the total moisture during the dry season the external moisture is 51 and the local circulation moisture is 49 of the total moisture it can be seen that the elevation effect is not notable during the dry season with a dominant local moisture during the rainy season the proportion of the local circulation moisture is relatively small and the precipitation is dominated by the external moisture therefore the elevation effect is remarkable this further shows that the study of the moisture sources not only includes the external moisture but also the local moisture cycle fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 effects of moisture sources on temporal heterogeneity of elevation effects on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation it is generally believed that the regional elevation effect under the effect of the dominant moisture source is relatively significant whereas that under the influence of multiple moisture sources is not significant kurita et al 2005 yang et al 2009 from the analysis it can be seen that the elevation effect in the study area has a temporal heterogeneity and its influence mechanism depends fundamentally on the types of moisture sources of the precipitation and their combinations the combinations of the local moisture and external moisture lead to three moisture source models dominant external moisture multiple external moistures and local external mixed moisture which result in the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect and gradient of the δ 18o in the precipitation in the study area the mechanism is presented in detail in fig 7 specifically the precipitation in the study area has a significant difference during the dry and rainy seasons during the rainy season the external moisture is the main source proportion 65 whereas during the dry season both the external moisture 65 and local circulation moisture 35 exert joint influences therefore the difference in the moisture sources during the dry and rainy seasons is the reason that affects the variation in the elevation effect on the isotopes in the precipitation in the study area during the rainy season from june to august the southwest monsoon dominates the external moisture with a proportion of more than 50 and the remaining moisture ratio is less than 40 however in september and october there is no dominant moisture and the proportion of each external moisture source is less than 50 which forms two source patterns of external dominant moisture and multiple external moistures during the rainy season the rainfall during the dry season is always controlled by both the external and local moisture sources neither of which is the dominant source therefore there is no elevation effect 5 2 spatial heterogeneity patterns of elevation and anti elevation effects during dry and rainy seasons it is a consensus that the elevation effect on the stable isotopes in a precipitation can reflect the complexity of the moisture sources to a certain extent in the presence of a dominant moisture source there will be significant elevation effects otherwise no elevation effects or no significant elevation effects will occur e g bortolami et al 1979 poage and chamberlain 2001 kurita et al 2005 yang et al 2009 some scholars have found that the elevation effects on the stable isotopes in a precipitation will not be significant alternatively even anti elevation effects can occur moran et al 2007 kong et al 2011 under the conditions of the moisture on the windward slope crossing the mountaintop and precipitating on the leeward slope blisniuk and stern 2005 secondary evaporation under clouds froehlich et al 2008 or moisture from different sources being mixed holdsworth and krouse 2002 bershaw et al 2012 based on the existing results of the study area jiao et al 2019 and analysis of this study it is concluded that the change from the elevation effect to an anti elevation effect in the study area is related to the spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effect under ideal conditions fig 8 a there is only one moisture source in the study area and it moves along the hillside to form an orographic precipitation the δ 18o in the precipitation is continuously depleted with the elevation increase the elevation gradient is equivalent to the global average of 0 28 100 m 1 but the intercept is different the observed results fig 8 b show that 18o is continuously depleted with the increase in the elevation however spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the elevation effect occur at middle and high elevations owing to the effects of other moisture sources this can be concretely summarized as the combination of three types of moisture sources the dominant external moisture type fig 8 c multiple external moisture type fig 8 d and external local moisture type fig 8 e at high elevations h 1900 m middle elevations 1700 1900 m and low elevations h 1700 m respectively 12700281813000at high elevations the 18o in the precipitation is enriched and an anti elevation effect jiao et al 2019 occurs owing to the influence of multiple moisture sources such as the over peak moisture and local moisture in addition this anti elevation effect will increase as the local circulation intensity increases resulting in no significant elevation effect at middle elevations 18o in the precipitation is depleted with the elevation increase resulting in an elevation effect for most of the time however with high local circulation intensity there is no elevation effect when the elevation gradient tends to zero when the elevation gradient is positive there is an anti elevation effect at low elevations the 18o in precipitation is continuously depleted as the elevation rises demonstrating significant elevation effects 5 3 sensitivity analysis of precipitation isotopic altitude effects in rainy season to estimate the accuracy of the precipitation isotopic altitude effects derived from isotope data a sensitivity analysis of precipitation isotopic altitude effects was used to assess the sensitivity to elevation changes in rainy season due to its significant correlation between precipitation isotopic altitude effects and elevation during the sampling period elevation ranges from 1500 m to 2024 m with a mean of 1836 m totally there are eight scenarios of elevation variation from decreasing by to increasing by 40 with a step width of 10 were used to analyse the sensitivity fig 8 table 3 when the elevation increase by 10 20 30 and 40 the δ 18o of rainy season will increase 2 17 4 23 6 29 and 8 35 respectively which obviously shows high sensitivity of rainy season this is consistent with the previous analysis of the positive correlation between precipitation isotopic altitude effects and elevation in rainy season 6 conclusion in the hani terrace of the red river in the southern section of ailao mountain the elevation effect on 18o during dry and rainy seasons has a significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity which is caused by the difference in the moisture sources in addition the local circulation has an important influence the temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect on the 18o in the precipitation depends on the proportion of the moisture sources in the dominant direction as the proportion of the moisture in the dominant direction becomes larger the elevation effect becomes more remarkable during the rainy season that has dominant external moisture 65 the overall elevation effect is more notable and there is no elevation effect in dry season from may to august when the proportion of the moisture in the dominant direction is 50 and that in other directions is less than 40 the elevation effect on the 18o present in precipitation in the study area is the most significant there is no elevation effect from september to october when there is no moisture in the dominant direction proportion of moisture in each direction is less than 40 during the dry season when the local moisture 35 and external moisture 65 act together the 18o in the precipitation has no significant elevation effect owing to the lack of moisture in the dominant direction the spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effect on the 18o present in the precipitation depends on the spatial combination of the moisture sources an anti elevation effect occurs at high elevations under the influence of multiple moisture sources and it increases as the local circulation intensity increases the fluctuation in the elevation effect at middle elevations is due to the difference between the dominant and non dominant moisture intensities at low elevations with significant dominant moisture sources the elevation effect is remarkable the temporal variation of the moisture source ratios and spatial heterogeneity of the combinations result in three different spatial temporal heterogeneity patterns of the elevation effect i e dominant external moisture type multiple moisture type and external local moisture type in the future we should prove the effects of moisture sources on the spatial temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect on a relatively larger or global scale verify the spatial temporal heterogeneity patterns proposed in this

5712,moisture sources affect the temporal variations of the elevation effects on the stable isotopes in monsoon precipitation however whether it will lead to spatial variations and form a specific spatial temporal heterogeneity pattern remains to be explored based on the monthly precipitation samples collected in ailao mountains of east asian monsoon region we computed and identified five moisture source regions to facilitate its comparison to the monthly oxygen isotope composition δ 18o of precipitation with hysplit model we analysed the influence mechanisms of the moisture sources on the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effect on the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes during dry and rainy seasons we found that the temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effects on the precipitation 18o depends on the proportion of the moisture sources in the dominant direction and as the proportion increases the elevation effect becomes more significant the spatial heterogeneity depends on the combination complexity of the moisture sources the simpler the combinations the more significant the elevation effects the results demonstrate that for precipitation δ 18o in ailao mountains the dominant of monsoon moisture sources the ratio higher than 50 can result in significant elevation effects while the mixtures of multiple moisture sources and the dominant of local moisture sources will lead to no elevation effects future studies should pay more attention to the influence mechanism of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effects on a relatively larger or global scale keywords hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in precipitation elevation effect moisture source temporal and spatial heterogeneity influence mechanism 1 introduction as the primary method of tracing the water cycle the atmospheric precipitation isotopes of 18o and 2h have the characteristic of changing with time and space which is reflected in the continental effect latitude effect altitude elevation effect and seasonal effect craig 1961 dansgaared 1964 li et al 2016 koster et al 1986 jodar et al 2016 the temporal and spatial variability of the composition of the stable isotopes present in the precipitation in the asian monsoon regions has long been a prominent topic in academia rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 araguás araguás et al 1998 influenced by the third pole of the earth there are complex elevation effects on the composition of the stable isotopes present in the precipitation in the tibetan plateau and its surrounding mountain areas therefore it is difficult to describe the complexity of the spatial and temporal variations concurrently exploring its influence mechanism can be used to guide the water resource management in this area particularly the countermeasures for flood and drought disasters under extreme weather conditions the elevation effect on precipitation isotopes is the phenomenon in which 18o and 2h are gradually depleted as the elevation increases dansgaared 1964 garzione et al 2015 koeniger et al 2016 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 tang et al 2015 the elevation effect was first discovered in δ 18o and δ 2h in the summer precipitation on the alps with a gradient of 0 2 100 m 1 ambach et al 1968 peng et al 2011 subsequently the research results from 68 mountains worldwide have revealed that except for some high latitude or high altitude mountain areas elevation effects can be found on δ 18o in most of the mountain areas moreover their gradients have no significant difference ranging from 0 5 100 m 1 to 0 15 100 m 1 with an average of 0 28 100 m 1 poage and chamberlain 2001 numerous studies have shown that the elevation effect varies with time and space owing to the influence of the temperature rainfall and moisture sources andreo et al 2004 liebminger et al 2006 jódar et al 2016 its temporal variation includes numerous time scales such as the year gonfiantini et al 2001 season bortolami et al 1979 and month yang et al 2009 whereas its spatial variation is more complex some studies have exhibited that under the influence of a single or dominant moisture source the δ 18o and δ 2h present in the precipitation in mountain areas shows significant elevation effects gat 1996 kurita et al 2005 however in some alpine areas when disturbed by the mixing processes of an airflow over mountain on the leeward slopes siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 blisniuk and stern 2005 secondary evaporation moisture under the clouds froehlich et al 2008 and multicomponent moisture holdsworth and krouse 2002 bershaw et al 2012 the elevation effects on the δ 2h and δ 18o present in the precipitation will become insignificant there may even be an anti elevation effect on the mountaintop and a significant elevation effect below the mountaintop niewodnizanski discovered this phenomenon in 1981 however up to now most scholars believe that this is caused by the interference of local or other moisture sources on the normal elevation effect kong and pang 2016 ren et al 2017 some studies discussed the effect of a combination of moisture sources on the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect and its mechanism e g qu et al 2018 jiao et al 2019 studied the stable isotopes present in the precipitation during the rainy season in ailao mountain according to the results the elevation effect in this area showed dynamic changes from being significant to being insignificant during one season owing to the influences of various spatial and temporal combinations of the over peak moisture and local moisture spatially there were remarkable anti elevation effects at the mountaintop and normal elevation effects below the mountaintop therefore more research needs to be performed to further explore whether the elevation effect on the different isotopes has similar temporal and spatial variations and determine the influence mechanism of the moisture sources during a dry season or even throughout the year in this area in this study the effects of the moisture sources on the elevation effect on the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes present in the precipitation in the hani terrace of ailao mountain were analysed by combining the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model and two component mixing model of isotopes the main focuses included 1 the elevation effect and gradient of δ 18o present in precipitation on three scales year dry and rainy seasons and month 2 the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effects on δ 18o present in the precipitation during the dry and rainy seasons 3 the influence mechanism of the moisture sources on the spatial temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect and its spatial temporal combination pattern finally it provided a regional case for the spatial and temporal complexity of the elevation effect on δ 18o present in the precipitation in the mountains within the asian monsoon regions moreover this study also yielded the decision making basis for the hani terrace heritage to deal with drought and extreme rainfall events 2 study area the study area is the quanfuzhuang watershed with an area of 11 km2 located within the core area of the honghe hani terrace cultural landscape heritage in the southern section of ailao mountain in southwest china its longitude and

annual average humidity of 90 3 and annual average temperature of 14 2 affected by the east asian monsoon the dry season and rainy season are distinct the rainy season from may to october is controlled by the warm and humid air masses from the southwest monsoon and southeast monsoon the precipitation is abundant accounting for 80 of the annual precipitation the dry season from november to

villages are concentrated between 1700 m and 1800 m according to research the southwest warm and humid air flow from the indian ocean always crosses the mountaintops during the rainy season bringing 1400 mm of abundant precipitation in the high elevation section of the quanfuzhuang river basin jiao et al 2019 however during the dry season the precipitation formed by the evaporation of the terrace water surface is the main source with an average rainfall of 351 mm jiao et al 2019 3 data and methods 3 1 acquisition and processing of samples and data during the period from may 2015 to april 2016 precipitation samples were collected from seven sampling points point 1 1468 m point 2 1663 m point 3 1798 m point 4 1889 m point 5 1957 m point 6 2004 m and point 7 2024 m distributed according to the elevation gradient fig 1 table 1 totally 84 valid samples were collected the sample collection equipment was a self made rainwater collector according to iaea gnip precipitation sampling guide http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf at the end of the month water samples were collected and the water volume was recorded the samples were packed in 100 ml polyethylene bottles before the sampling the bottles were washed thrice with rain water and then rapidly filled after ensuring that there were no bubbles in the bottles they were sealed with a sealant and labelled for reserve the hydrogen and oxygen isotope tests were conducted in the key laboratory of plateau lake ecology and global change yunnan normal university using a picarro l2130 i ultra high precision liquid water and moisture isotope analyser the measurement accuracy of 18o and d of the instrument was 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the final analysis results were expressed by the thousandth difference relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as follows δ 18 o r sample r v s m o w 1 1000 where rsample and rv smow represent the oxygen stable isotope ratios of r 18o 16o in the water samples and v smow respectively meteorological data were acquired by the automatic weather station installed at sampling point 3 the parameters included precipitation temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and air pressure the locations of the sampling points were determined by a hand held gps and the topographic maps were provided by the local government and distribution maps of the sampling points were drawn by the arcgis 10 0 software 3 2 hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model the simulation results of the moisture source trajectory of the precipitation at different times were based on the hysplit model the model was developed jointly by the air resources laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa of the united states and the australian bureau of meteorology for the calculation and analysis of the atmospheric pollutant transport and diffusion trajectories it could also forecast the wind field in real time and study the moisture transport trajectory the initial time of the model running was at the zero hour of the utc time and the height was 500 m from the ground of the study area the initial location was sampling point 3 located in the middle of the sample points in the study area the tracing dates were around the 30th 20th and 10th days of each month with backward tracing for 10 days 240 h the tracing dates changed according to the days of each month accordingly continuous precipitation could be covered and the accuracy of tracing the moisture sources could be improved for determine the direction of a moisture source the west and east quadrants were delineated with the study area as the origin moreover the number of moisture trajectories in each quadrant represented the moisture input on the west and east sides of ailao mountain respectively 3 3 two component mixing model 1 transformed two component mixing model 1 f δ pv δ re δ adv δ re where

results and analysis 4 1 statistical analysis of δ 18o and δd in precipitation 4 1 1 local meteoric water line the stable isotope data of the precipitation from may 2015 to april 2016 yields the local meteoric water line lmwl equation δ 2h 8 31 0 15 δ 18o 21 88 1 4 r2 0 97 n 84 fig 2 the slope and intercept are larger than this of the global meteoric water line gmwl equations δ 2h 8 14 0 02 δ 18o 10 9 0 2 r 0 98 gourcy et al 2005 the slope and intercept are also larger than those of the china meteoric water line cmwl equation δ 2h 7 48δ 18o 1 01 based on the stable 2h and 18o values in the precipitation that was collected from 2005 to 2010 at 29 chnip stations liu et al 2014 the results show that the study area is affected by the subtropical monsoon climate the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation are remarkably different in the dry and rainy seasons they are depleted in the rainy season and enriched in the dry season which is consistent with the chinese monsoon region e g peng et al 2010 li et al 2017 in addition the lmwl equations during the rainy and dry seasons in the study area are δ 2h 6 51δ 18o 1 19 r2 0 94 n 42 and δ 2h 7 31δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 94 n 42 respectively it can be seen that the slope and intercept of the lmwl during the dry season are notably larger than those during the rainy season and the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation during the dry season are more abundant than in that those during the rainy season to avoid shifts along the gwml causing by seasonal changes liu et al 2014 boschetti et al 2019 the local meteoric water line equation obtained by amount weighted regression is gmwle δ 2h 8 40 0 39 δ 18o 22 77 3 50 r2 0 97 n 84 the slope and intercept of gmwle is similar to that of the gmwl overall considering the dominant impact of moisture sources on water isotopes and deuterium excess each region has unique features of spatial distribution and seasonal variation for stable precipitation isotopes and deuterium excess kong et al 2019 therefore the geographical pattern and meteorological hydrological process are the key factors impacting on the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of precipitation isotopes in monsoon china zhang and wang 2016 4 1 2 spatial and temporal differentiation of δ 18o and δ 2h in the mean stable isotope composition of the global precipitation the ranges of δ 18o and δ 2h are 50 10 and 350 50 lin 2013 the variation ranges of the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation in the study area are 15 46 0 92 and 99 55 13 77 respectively the average values are 7 97 and 44 42 respectively in addition the dry and rainy seasons are distinct during the rainy season the variation ranges of δ 18o and δ 2h are 15 46 7 69 and 99 55 48 85 respectively the average values are 11 47 and 75 91 respectively during the dry season the variation ranges of δ 18o and δ 2h are 10 14 0 92 and 99 55 13 77 respectively the average values are 4 56 and 13 58 respectively in terms of time fig 3 the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation tend to be depleted during the rainy season and enriched continuously during the dry season the rainy season can be divided into three periods the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation are the highest in the first period from may to june during the second period from july to september they become lower and during the third period october the values are the lowest the dry season can be divided into two periods the first period from november to january of the following year the values decrease rapidly and during the second period from february to april in the following year the decrease speed declines the spatial distributions of the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation in the study area are different fig 3 and the difference during the rainy season is more notable than that during the dry season the interquartile range iqr of δ 18o and δ 2h during the rainy season is large which indicates a large spatial difference however the iqr is small during the dry season which suggests that the spatial difference is small it can be seen that the δ 18o and δ 2h in the precipitation in the study area have the same spatial and temporal variation characteristics therefore only δ 18o was analysed in the following study 4 2 temporal change in elevation effect and gradient of δ 18o in precipitation 4 2 1 rainy season the elevation effect correlation and gradient analysis results of the δ 18o present in the precipitation during the rainy season at the seven sampling points in the study area are summarized in table 2 the δ 18o in the precipitation in most months during the rainy season has a significant elevation effect and its gradient is between 0 36 100 m 1 and 0 15 100 m 1 which is within the range of the currently recognized global elevation gradient of δ 18o in a precipitation 0 5 100 m 1 0 15 100 m 1 the average value is equal to the global average of 0 28 100 m 1 poage and chamberlain 2001 in addition the elevation gradient of the δ 18o in the precipitation varies dynamically during the rainy season it is near the global average from may to august whereas it is near the lower limit of the global value range in october in addition there is no elevation effect in september indicating that precipitations in september and october may be affected by different moisture sources 4 2 2 dry season table 1 shows that there is no significant elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation during the entire dry season and its gradient range is from 0 07 100 m 1 to 0 20 100 m 1 which is outside the global range and tends to be zero it indicates that the stable isotope composition in the precipitation at different elevations during the dry season is relatively consistent which is a result of the mixing of the multiple moisture sources the elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation throughout the year is not significant table 2 and its elevation gradient of 0 09 100 m 1 also tends to zero it indicates that the δ 18o in the precipitation is affected by multiple moisture sources in most months of the year based on which the moisture source in the study area was analysed 4 3 simulation and calculation of moisture sources of δ 18o in precipitation during dry and rainy seasons 4 3 1 moisture sources of precipitation indicated by deuterium excess the concept of deuterium excess or d excess hereinafter referred to as d value was first proposed by dansgaared 1964 to evaluate the extent of the regional atmospheric precipitation deviation from the gmwl due to geographical and climatic factors its expression is d δd 8δ 18o the d value in the study area ranged from 8 53 to 31 11 with an average of 19 38 the range of the d value during the rainy season was from 8 53 to 24 71 with an average of 15 88 and during the dry season it was from 19 46 to 31 11 with an average of 22 87 the d value during the rainy season was significantly lower than that during the dry season according to the year round change fig 4 the d value from may to september is small and its change over time is gradual however the spatial difference is large which indicates that the precipitation in these months is mainly external moisture with numerous source directions from october to march of the following year the d value becomes larger and varies significantly over time however its spatial difference reduces which indicates that the moisture source of precipitation has gradually changed to local and relatively single sources in these months the spatial variation of the d value in april of the following year is consistent with that from may to september which indicates that the moisture source has changed to external moisture again 4 3 2 analysis of external moisture source of the precipitation using hysplit model the trajectory simulation fig 5 of the moisture source in the study area by the hysplit model shows that the moisture mainly comes from five directions the southwestern indian ocean sw south eastern pacific ocean se the north eastern inland ne southern branch of the westerlies sb and northern branch of the westerlies nb the southwestern indian ocean accounts for 65 of the moisture transported throughout the year making it the main source of the transported moisture when there are dominant moisture sources during the rainy season the elevation effect on the 18o in the precipitation is significant in the study area for example in may and june the southwest monsoon is the only moisture source in july the northeast monsoon is the dominant moisture source and in august the southwest monsoon is the dominant moisture source the correlation between the δ 18o in the precipitation and elevation in these months has passed the test concurrently the elevation gradient is also near the global average of 0 28 100 m 1 in the absence of dominant moisture sources the elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation in the study area is not significant for example the southwest and southeast monsoons affect the precipitation in september whereas the southwest southeast and northeast monsoons affect the precipitation in october thus the correlation of the elevation effect in september is not significant for october the elevation gradient is at the lower limit of the global value although the correlation is significant however during the dry season these effects seem to become incorrect as shown in fig 5 the southwest monsoon is the dominant moisture source for each month during the dry season but the elevation effect on the δ 18o in the precipitation is not significant which is related to the local moisture source of the precipitation generally the local moisture source of the precipitation mainly originates from a mixture of the external moisture and recycling moisture van et al 2010 wang et al 2016 therefore it is also necessary to analyse the proportion of the recycled moisture present in the study area to determine its impact on the elevation effect 4 3 3 calculation of ratios of moisture sources of precipitation using two component mixing model the calculation results of the mixing ratio of the external to the local moisture based on a two component mixing model of the isotopes are summarized in table 3 according to the results the mixing ratios of the local and external moisture in the study area are 65 and 35 respectively throughout the year during the rainy season the external moisture accounts for 79 and local circulation moisture accounts for 21 of the total moisture during the dry season the external moisture is 51 and the local circulation moisture is 49 of the total moisture it can be seen that the elevation effect is not notable during the dry season with a dominant local moisture during the rainy season the proportion of the local circulation moisture is relatively small and the precipitation is dominated by the external moisture therefore the elevation effect is remarkable this further shows that the study of the moisture sources not only includes the external moisture but also the local moisture cycle fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 effects of moisture sources on temporal heterogeneity of elevation effects on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation it is generally believed that the regional elevation effect under the effect of the dominant moisture source is relatively significant whereas that under the influence of multiple moisture sources is not significant kurita et al 2005 yang et al 2009 from the analysis it can be seen that the elevation effect in the study area has a temporal heterogeneity and its influence mechanism depends fundamentally on the types of moisture sources of the precipitation and their combinations the combinations of the local moisture and external moisture lead to three moisture source models dominant external moisture multiple external moistures and local external mixed moisture which result in the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect and gradient of the δ 18o in the precipitation in the study area the mechanism is presented in detail in fig 7 specifically the precipitation in the study area has a significant difference during the dry and rainy seasons during the rainy season the external moisture is the main source proportion 65 whereas during the dry season both the external moisture 65 and local circulation moisture 35 exert joint influences therefore the difference in the moisture sources during the dry and rainy seasons is the reason that affects the variation in the elevation effect on the isotopes in the precipitation in the study area during the rainy season from june to august the southwest monsoon dominates the external moisture with a proportion of more than 50 and the remaining moisture ratio is less than 40 however in september and october there is no dominant moisture and the proportion of each external moisture source is less than 50 which forms two source patterns of external dominant moisture and multiple external moistures during the rainy season the rainfall during the dry season is always controlled by both the external and local moisture sources neither of which is the dominant source therefore there is no elevation effect 5 2 spatial heterogeneity patterns of elevation and anti elevation effects during dry and rainy seasons it is a consensus that the elevation effect on the stable isotopes in a precipitation can reflect the complexity of the moisture sources to a certain extent in the presence of a dominant moisture source there will be significant elevation effects otherwise no elevation effects or no significant elevation effects will occur e g bortolami et al 1979 poage and chamberlain 2001 kurita et al 2005 yang et al 2009 some scholars have found that the elevation effects on the stable isotopes in a precipitation will not be significant alternatively even anti elevation effects can occur moran et al 2007 kong et al 2011 under the conditions of the moisture on the windward slope crossing the mountaintop and precipitating on the leeward slope blisniuk and stern 2005 secondary evaporation under clouds froehlich et al 2008 or moisture from different sources being mixed holdsworth and krouse 2002 bershaw et al 2012 based on the existing results of the study area jiao et al 2019 and analysis of this study it is concluded that the change from the elevation effect to an anti elevation effect in the study area is related to the spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effect under ideal conditions fig 8 a there is only one moisture source in the study area and it moves along the hillside to form an orographic precipitation the δ 18o in the precipitation is continuously depleted with the elevation increase the elevation gradient is equivalent to the global average of 0 28 100 m 1 but the intercept is different the observed results fig 8 b show that 18o is continuously depleted with the increase in the elevation however spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the elevation effect occur at middle and high elevations owing to the effects of other moisture sources this can be concretely summarized as the combination of three types of moisture sources the dominant external moisture type fig 8 c multiple external moisture type fig 8 d and external local moisture type fig 8 e at high elevations h 1900 m middle elevations 1700 1900 m and low elevations h 1700 m respectively 12700281813000at high elevations the 18o in the precipitation is enriched and an anti elevation effect jiao et al 2019 occurs owing to the influence of multiple moisture sources such as the over peak moisture and local moisture in addition this anti elevation effect will increase as the local circulation intensity increases resulting in no significant elevation effect at middle elevations 18o in the precipitation is depleted with the elevation increase resulting in an elevation effect for most of the time however with high local circulation intensity there is no elevation effect when the elevation gradient tends to zero when the elevation gradient is positive there is an anti elevation effect at low elevations the 18o in precipitation is continuously depleted as the elevation rises demonstrating significant elevation effects 5 3 sensitivity analysis of precipitation isotopic altitude effects in rainy season to estimate the accuracy of the precipitation isotopic altitude effects derived from isotope data a sensitivity analysis of precipitation isotopic altitude effects was used to assess the sensitivity to elevation changes in rainy season due to its significant correlation between precipitation isotopic altitude effects and elevation during the sampling period elevation ranges from 1500 m to 2024 m with a mean of 1836 m totally there are eight scenarios of elevation variation from decreasing by to increasing by 40 with a step width of 10 were used to analyse the sensitivity fig 8 table 3 when the elevation increase by 10 20 30 and 40 the δ 18o of rainy season will increase 2 17 4 23 6 29 and 8 35 respectively which obviously shows high sensitivity of rainy season this is consistent with the previous analysis of the positive correlation between precipitation isotopic altitude effects and elevation in rainy season 6 conclusion in the hani terrace of the red river in the southern section of ailao mountain the elevation effect on 18o during dry and rainy seasons has a significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity which is caused by the difference in the moisture sources in addition the local circulation has an important influence the temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect on the 18o in the precipitation depends on the proportion of the moisture sources in the dominant direction as the proportion of the moisture in the dominant direction becomes larger the elevation effect becomes more remarkable during the rainy season that has dominant external moisture 65 the overall elevation effect is more notable and there is no elevation effect in dry season from may to august when the proportion of the moisture in the dominant direction is 50 and that in other directions is less than 40 the elevation effect on the 18o present in precipitation in the study area is the most significant there is no elevation effect from september to october when there is no moisture in the dominant direction proportion of moisture in each direction is less than 40 during the dry season when the local moisture 35 and external moisture 65 act together the 18o in the precipitation has no significant elevation effect owing to the lack of moisture in the dominant direction the spatial heterogeneity of the elevation effect on the 18o present in the precipitation depends on the spatial combination of the moisture sources an anti elevation effect occurs at high elevations under the influence of multiple moisture sources and it increases as the local circulation intensity increases the fluctuation in the elevation effect at middle elevations is due to the difference between the dominant and non dominant moisture intensities at low elevations with significant dominant moisture sources the elevation effect is remarkable the temporal variation of the moisture source ratios and spatial heterogeneity of the combinations result in three different spatial temporal heterogeneity patterns of the elevation effect i e dominant external moisture type multiple moisture type and external local moisture type in the future we should prove the effects of moisture sources on the spatial temporal heterogeneity of the elevation effect on a relatively larger or global scale verify the spatial temporal heterogeneity patterns proposed in this

5713,large earthquakes change the hydrogeological properties of aquifer systems such as permeability and cause changes that impact groundwater flow to understand these changes in mountain aquifer systems we analyzed stable isotopic ratios of water molecular δd and δ18o of h2o and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs concentrations of natural spring waters and compared these values between before 2009 and after 2017 the 2016 kumamoto crustal earthquake sequence in kumamoto aso area southern japan stable isotope ratios were used to identify the spring source characteristics that reflected recharge elevations whereas cfc age tracers were applied to evaluate the contribution of earthquake induced additional waters from different pathways shorter or longer and or cfc enriched contaminated surface waters in general spring waters after the earthquake became more depleted in water isotopic compositions than those before the earthquake suggesting an increased contribution of waters recharged from higher elevations across the area in addition changes observed in cfc 12 concentrations were classified into several increasing decreasing patterns defined by the contribution of additional waters from different flow paths such as older groundwater with longer flow paths younger groundwater from shorter flow paths and cfc enriched contaminated water released from shallow aquifers and soils these isotopic and chemical features when combined with previously documented seismotectonic surface rupture distributions demonstrated the occurrence of coseismic mountain water release due to enhanced permeability these findings enabled us to document how groundwater flow changes in mountain aquifers although cfc age markers have rarely been applied as a tool to investigate coseismic hydrological changes our study exemplifies their usefulness in combination with stable isotope ratios in such investigations keywords earthquake stable isotope cfcs spring water 1 introduction numerous studies have reported changes of spring discharge rate after large earthquakes e g manga and rowland 2009 sato et al 2000 tokunaga 1999 wang and manga 2015 wood et al 1985 these changes are attributed to coseismic changes in the hydrogeological properties of aquifer systems such as permeability and pore pressure and changes in the capacity of the unsaturated zone to store and transmit water manga and wang 2015 the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios δd and δ18o of water h2o can be used as tracers to identify the origin of new waters that alter spring discharge systems manga and rowland 2009 as well as to understand other coseismic hydrological hydro chemical changes e g claesson et al 2004 onda et al 2018 wang and manga 2015 in some cases changes in isotopic compositions continue over a year after the earthquake occurrence because hydrogeological conditions do not recover quickly and waters from other sources with different isotopic compositions are continuously added claesson et al 2004 sato et al 2000 wang et al 2005 these studies successfully demonstrate the usefulness of stable isotope ratios for understanding coseismic hydrological changes although it is possible to perform detailed isotopic monitoring of new and increased discharges after an earthquake manga and rowland 2009 manga and wang 2015 coherent datasets collected both pre and post earthquake are however rare this makes isotopic comparisons difficult moreover the number of springs wells used for isotopic comparisons in previous studies is generally too small to depict the spatial distributions of such changes major ion and trace metal concentrations can be used in a similar to stable isotopes to identify the origin of new waters especially the contributions of highly condensed deep fluids and geothermal waters e g barberio et al 2017 inan et al 2012 hosono et al 2018 tsunogai and wakita 1995 contrary to these non meteoric forms of groundwater mixing of the meteorologically mediated active groundwater proved the difficulty of the detection of newly additional groundwater because of the similarity of each chemical composition related to its origin unless monitoring is continuous or intermittent an alternative approach is to assume that dissolved gas concentrations typically applied for groundwater age determination for active flow systems chambers et al 2018 darling et al 2012 can be used to identify changes in groundwater flow paths after earthquakes chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are chemically stable synthetic gases which are widely produced and used worldwide for refrigeration heat insulation and industrial solvents because of their chemical stability cfcs do not react with aquifer materials except during microbial degradation atmospheric concentrations of cfcs have increased steadily from the 1950s until the 1990s chambers et al 2018 surface water that recharges groundwater is in equilibrium with atmospheric cfc concentrations and their concentrations are almost stable until discharge consequently cfc concentrations in spring water can be used to identify groundwater residence time for groundwater younger than 55 years in mountain aquifers in areas where contamination from anthropogenic activity and or anaerobic microbial degradation is negligible international atomic energy agency iaea 2006 in contrast surface waters in urban areas generally have a high cfc concentration as a result of contamination and concentrations are sometimes a few orders of magnitude greater than atmospheric equilibrium cfc ranges the mixing of shallow contaminated groundwater in deep aquifers can therefore be accurately detected kagabu et al 2013 taufiq et al 2017 for example kagabu et al 2013 reported how excessive pumping caused highly contaminated cfc concentrations in the deep confined aquifers under the jakarta urban area cfc concentrations can also be used to examine groundwater flow changes caused by underground construction and facilities hagiwara et al 2015 mahara et al 2001 these studies demonstrate the potential usefulness of cfc concentrations in spring waters for obtaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of groundwater flow change in response to earthquakes to the best of our knowledge no studies exist in the literature that discuss coseismic cfc concentration changes in groundwater the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence began with a mw 6 2 foreshock on april 14 followed by a mw 7 0 main shock on april 16 the active futagawa hinagu fault system is located in the kumamoto plain and extends eastwards through the northern part of the aso caldera fig 1 a coseismic hydrological changes have recently been documented for the kumamoto regional groundwater flow systems based on groundwater levels in monitoring wells 250 m depth and river discharge hosono et al 2019 briefly surface and aquifer waters were reduced within 35 min after the main shock owing to water drawdown along newly formed open crustal ruptures suizenji fault zone fig 1 after this initial water drop the water level rose in the groundwater recharge area at the plateaus with an elevation of 50 200 m located adjacent to the plain area possibly owing to coseismic mountain water release hosono et al 2019 the water level continued to rise for 2 years after the main shock kagabu et al 2020 however coseismic hydrological changes in the mountain aquifer systems located around the regional groundwater flow systems fig 1 above 150 m however have not yet been discussed natural spring waters were sampled before the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in 2009 over the kumamoto aso mountain areas and measured for ion and cfc concentrations and stable isotope ratios these data allow a comparison with data collected after the main shock in 2017 the present study seeks to clarify the coseismic hydrological changes in mountain groundwater flows on the basis of comparison of stable isotopic compositions and cfc concentrations of natural spring waters between pre and post seismic collection times over a regional catchment scale a few natural springs within the plateaus and plains are also discussed this paper presents an unique approach for identifying coseismic hydrological changes by using cfc tracer 2 geological background 2 1 topographic and hydrological setting the study area is located in

were relatively high when compared with the average annual temperatures the temperatures for the other years were within 0 5 c of the average in the kumamoto aso area aso volcanic rocks of quaternary age and terrace alluvium deposits overlay a basement of paleozoic to mesozoic metamorphic rocks and tertiary quaternary pre aso volcanic rocks fig 1b the aso volcanic rocks that form the main body of the quaternary aso volcanoes are found on at the eastern side of mt kinpo and at the western foot of the caldera somma mountains and consist of plateaus and hills recharge to the regional groundwater flow system mainly occurs through pyroclastic flow deposits beneath the kumamoto plain hosono et al 2013 less permeable older volcanic units pre aso volcanic rocks are exposed in and around mt kinpo and the caldera somma mountains many natural spring waters occur in these volcanic aquifer areas fig 1 driven by active hydrological cycles the springs flowed continuously before and after the earthquakes there are only a few springs that were empty after the earthquakes one of the dried up springs located in the southern part of the aso caldera watershed discharged a few cubic meters per minute in the pre seismic stage and then remained dry for over two years after the earthquake mountain springs may have dried up because permeability changes caused a temporary lowering of water levels the reduction in the discharge rates of other springs may have been caused by the same process 2 2 distribution and hydrology of the investigated springs most sampled springs are located around the mountains the western slope of the aso caldera somma mountains s07 s08 s09 s10 s16 s17 and s41 mt kinpo s23 s25 s26 s27 s28 s29 s58 and s59 east of the aso caldera somma to the kujyu mountains s71 s72 s73 and s74 and within the aso caldera watershed s01 s02 s04 s05 s06 s65 s66 s68 and s70 the first springs are recharged from the caldera somma mountains and seep from downslope areas at altitudes around 100 600 m these springs and those around mt kinpo are characterized by seepage flows from fractures and joints of pre aso volcanic rocks shimano 2000 the springs near the caldera somma s01 s06 s65 s66 s68 and s70 and central volcanic mountains s02 s04 s05 are predominantly recharged from their respective mountain watersheds hosono et al 2018 kagabu et al 2011 in general the former waters show shorter residence time 20 y that flow along relatively shorter groundwater flow paths while the latter waters show longer residence times 40 y with longer groundwater flow paths kagabu et al 2011 apart from the aforementioned volcanic mountain slope springs there are several springs that seep in the plateaus and plain areas within the aso pyroclastic flow deposits s11 s12 s13 s19 s21 and s22 because there are no high mountains near the plateaus it is reasonable to assume that the springs are recharged from the local hills with elevations of less than 300 m the springs located in the plateaus s11 s12 s13 and s22 originate from unconfined groundwater of the kumamoto regional groundwater systems shimano 2000 there are large spring fed lakes ezu and kashima lakes fig 1 on the downslopes of the kumamoto plain which are sourced from confined groundwaters 30 200 m depth hosono et al 2013 we sampled one of the spring sources from each lake s19 and s21 more features of these spring lakes are detailed in ono et al 2013 industrial and residential areas are widely distributed across the kumamoto plain and can also be found in the mountainous areas kagabu et al 2017 showed aquifer systems under the plains are highly contaminated by cfcs possibly as a result of industrial activities and domestic drainage other studies have found similar relationships between cfc contamination and human activities busenberg and plummer 1992 hohener et al 2002 morris et al 2006 the contamination by cfc pollutants makes it impossible to determine groundwater flow ages in these area alternatively the highly contaminated properties of the shallow waters can be effectively used as indicators of the downward flux of shallow water into deep confined groundwaters taufiq et al 2017 the 2016 destructive kumamoto inland earthquakes revealed many new faults and rupture systems especially near ezu lake the northwestern aso caldera mountains and partly in mt kinpo fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 fig 1 this suggests permeability changes in the mountain aquifer systems the isotopic and cfc concentrations of spring waters can be effectively applied to test this hypothesis 3 materials and methods natural spring water samples were collected from 39 spring sites in the study area before in 2009 and after in 2017 the 2016 kumamoto earthquake fig 1 a sample of mountain

advantec japan before storage for stable isotope and major ion analysis samples for cfc analysis were stored in 125 ml glass bottles without filtering for cfc sampling sample bottles were flushed with approximately 1 l of the sample water then filled and capped underwater to prevent contact of the water sample with the atmosphere all collected water samples were analyzed at kumamoto university japan table 1 the results from 32 springs were used to compare spring water obtained before and after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake we also used supplemental repeated sampling and analysis data gathered at 25 points in the pre seismic period november 2008 to july 2011 table s1 data from samples taken before and after the rainy season were used to consider seasonal variability the hydrogen

waters bu and warner 1995 iaea 2006 warner and weiss 1985 electrical conductivity values measured in the studied spring waters were sufficiently low 314 µs cm 1 to ignore the effects of salinity to

temperature of the recharge water was estimated using a local air temperature lapse rate of 0 55 c 100 m kagabu et al 2017 and the local surface temperature see appendix a we adopted the northern hemisphere average usgs 2016 atmospheric cfc profile for comparison with the eac values of the springs in the present study because the northern hemisphere average is uniform over a wide area iaea 2006 of the three cfc profiles that can be used for groundwater age dating cfc 12 has the largest increase trend there is no local atmospheric cfc profile dataset for the study area but the long term trend from 1990 to 2010 in other japanese cities does not deviate substantially sumimoto et al 2012 tanimura et al 1997 the peak atmospheric concentration for japanese cities is 1 3 times higher than the northern hemisphere average the peak value of the atmospheric profile may have therefore temporarily increased to 700 pptv 4 results and discussion 4 1 field parameters table 1 compares the results of field and laboratory measurements for pre and post seismic events 2009 vs 2017 the range of electrical conductivities for each spring survey is similar for the two years 2009 73 314 µs cm 1 2017 78 306 µs cm 1 the temperature range is also stable over time 2009 12 9 24 5 c 2017 13 6 24 2 c a comparison of the field parameters for the two sampling campaigns show that almost all springs do not deviate from the 1 1 line plotted in the scatter diagrams figs s1a b except for some samples that show a slight decrease in electrical conductivity after the earthquake in general it has been observed that the ion concentrations of spring discharges are constant in hydrological cycles in the study area for the seasons and years studied shimano 2000 1996 however observed similarities between the pre and post earthquake data does not imply that distinct hydrological changes did not occur hydro chemical compositions are homogeneous in volcanic aquifer systems because the aquifer geology consists of similar volcanic materials ide et al 2018 and hydro chemical properties of the springs except for appropriate tracers may not significantly change even if changes occur in the flow path or if mixing between waters from different areas occurs it is therefore difficult to precisely determine a signal of coseismic change using only field measurements the major ion chemistry did not show any significant changes except in a few cases fig s1 which will be discussed later in this section the measured high do and the positive orp results 2009 98 300 mv 2017 73 361 mv show that the observed springs are associated with aquifers under aerobic conditions and thus no microbial degradation of cfcs should be expected iaea 2006 4 2 stable isotope ratios the range of stable isotope ratios in 2009 table 1 are 8 4 to 6 4 for δ18o and 55 4 to 42 4 for δd however the 2017 results table 1 show lower isotopic compositions δ18o 8 9 to 7 0 δd 56 4 to 45 0 compared with the 2009 results fig 2 the values of the results from the sampling analyses done before the kumamoto earthquake indicate that the post seismic isotopic change is larger than the fluctuations in δ18o during the pre seismic period table s1 and fig s2 including those caused by seasonality these isotopic shifts suggest the mixing of water with a lower isotopic composition into the original groundwater for most springs in the study area in fig 2 the isotopic compositions of springs before the earthquake plot close to the local summer high recharge season meteoric water line fig 2a after the earthquake the plots shift toward lower isotope ratios especially for the oxygen isotope ratio changes in the stable isotopic compositions of aquifer waters may be explained by several reasons such as evaporation before recharge gat et al 1994 mixing of deep fluids with magmatic constituents simmons and brown 2006 and the mixing of surface waters from different pathways yeh et al 2009 however fig 2b clearly shows that the evaporation effect and the mixing of deep magmatic fluids is insufficient to explain the observed compositional changes in addition isotopic changes except during mixing after recharge are only known to occur in the case of stagnant water with a small water rock ratio clark and fritz 2013 cole and ohmoto 1986 and are unlikely to occur in the case of actively flowing groundwater the isotopic composition of spring discharge commonly reflects the recharge elevation of the source water namely recharged waters from higher elevations tend to show lower isotopic compositions e g fontes 1980 kelly and glenn 2015 scholl et al 2002 and thus observed isotope ratio changes imply the mixing of groundwater recharged at higher elevation sources in addition fig 2a shows that the isotopic composition of the tunnel excavation spring ts01 plots as an extension of the changing trend from 2009 to 2017 for vicinity spring s09 the change in isotope ratios of the mountain foot springs is therefore considered to be caused by the contribution of additional waters inside the mountain at higher elevation the mixing rate calculation to quantitatively evaluate this contribution requires spring isotope data from before and after the earthquake and additional water isotope data the scarcity of mountain groundwater data at higher elevations than the spring makes it difficult to obtain the end member to explain the isotopic change in most of the springs ts01 discharges groundwater that was intercepted during the excavation of a road tunnel and belongs to the same catchment as the lower elevation spring s09 therefore ts01 and s09 could be regarded as reasonable end members based on topographical location i e elevation and distance the possible end member components are s09 sampled in 2009 for the original water without earthquake effects and ts01 as the additional water component the straight line drawn from the isotopic compositions of these two sources can be used to depict the mixing line fig 2c the mixing ratio of the newly added water from ts01 at s09 after the earthquake was estimated using the mixing line and was about 40 50 although this calculation does not yield a quantitative evaluation for most of the springs the distribution of the isotope ratio changes between the two periods fig 3 and verifies that isotope ratios were depleted in all of the spring waters and were caused by groundwater mixing the unified decreasing shift is not displayed in the other hydrochemical parameters e g ion concentrations in fig s1 which might reflect the homogeneity of the geological distributions the aforementioned new water supply requires the formation of pathways that lead waters of higher recharge origins to be involved owing to permeability enhancement the occurrence of recently recognized seismic rupture systems fujiwara et al 2016 that crosscut mountainous areas fig 1 supports this hypothesis in the vicinity of mt kinpo isotopic changes for the springs were 0 6 or less which was smaller than for the other springs this implies that there was smaller elevation gap between the original and additional source waters which may correspond to the smaller mountain scale and or possibly owing to less permeable features of the aquifers and less destruction by seismic deformation in the mountains nevertheless our results suggest that mountain aquifer waters recharged from higher elevations were involved in the original discharge systems after the earthquake and the changes were sustained for at least 1 y after the main shock 4 3 coseismic changes in cfcs 4 3 1 analytical results for cfcs we analyzed three types of cfcs cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 table 1 the cfc concentrations measured in the 2009 sampling varied from 259 to 2 569 976 pg kg 1 for cfc 11 87 to 4139 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 and 21 to 10 639 169 pg kg 1 for cfc 113 the 2017 sampling results ranged from 195 to 1 174 140 pg kg 1 for cfc 11 136 to 1848 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 and 16 to 2 955 734 pg kg 1 for cfc 113 table 1 showing similar concentrations with the 2009 results the calculated eac values for spring sites from both sampling campaigns are shown in table 2 a number of samples had concentrations several orders of magnitude greater than atmospheric concentrations at the sampling time this is attributed to the pre earthquake influence of anthropogenic contamination from urban and industrial areas kagabu et al 2017 the multi tracer approach uses several cfcs to verify the different mixing processes and estimate the groundwater age darling et al 2012 gooddy et al 2006 han et al 2012 plummer et al 2001 but high eac values make this evaluation difficult a comparison of the cfc concentration levels for each sampling campaign showed that most samples had qualitatively similar values table 2 however for several samples the increasing and decreasing trends were not the same for three cfc compounds the difference in trends was caused by the different cfc sources cfc 11 and cfc 113 originate from former commercial use from business or industrial purposes e g industrial degreaser refrigerant in industrial air conditioners whereas the cfc 12 source is the refrigerant of home electric devices because of the different trends caused by the different contaminant sources the multi tracer cfc method was impractical to use in this study fewer springs were contaminated by cfc 12 than cfc 11 and cfc 113 kagabu et al 2017 before the earthquake event and cfc 12 s atmospheric profile has the largest increase of the cfc compounds therefore we focused more on the cfc 12 results in our analysis and discussion 4 3 2 pre seismic spring discharge system based on cfc 12 results the distribution of cfc 12 concentrations in the 2009 spring waters are shown in fig 4 eight spring samples black circles in fig 4 clearly exceed the eac concentrations more than the atmospheric concentration 700 pptv of these springs the seven springs with the highest ranges are located in and around the kumamoto urbanized areas s10 s12 s13 s19 s21 s22 and s30 while one spring s65 is located in a residential area within the aso caldera watershed kagabu et al 2017 attributed the elevated cfc 12 concentrations in the kumamoto plain to leakage from urbanized lands local point or non point sources such as drains from private homes iaea 2006 and leakage pesticides from farm lands plummer et al 2000 can also elevate the cfc 12 concentrations of underground waters thus these eight springs show excess cfc 12 signatures influenced by local anthropogenic contamination the eac values for the other springs do not exceed atmospheric cfc 12 concentrations of these 12 springs gray circles in fig 4 show relatively high cfc 12 concentrations 500 pptv and are mostly distributed at the foot of mt kujyu s70 s73 and s74 within the aso caldera watershed s05 s66 and s68 and at the southwestern foot of the aso caldera and other mountains s11 s17 s25 s31 s38 and s59 these high cfc 12 values correspond to recent i e 1990s atmospheric concentrations which suggests that these springs are sourced from groundwaters with faster shorter residence time flow paths if the effect of anthropogenic contamination in these remote spring possible recharge sites is neglected fig 4 in contrast with the aforementioned cfc enriched springs some springs at the western slope of the aso caldera somma mountains s09 s16 show significantly lower cfc 12 values implying that they originate from longer flow paths with older groundwater residence times among the studied springs the same typical mountain foot springs with moderate cfc 12 concentrations bold circles in fig 4 prevail around mt kinpo s23 s27 and s29 as mentioned previously the springs around mt kinpo flow out through small fractures from relatively inactive aquifer systems with relatively impermeable structures compared with those in the aso mountainous areas which are relatively large scale active groundwater flow systems shimano 2000 the cfc 12 results for both mountain springs correspond well with the differences in their hydrogeological settings in summary the cfc 12 concentrations of the springs during the pre seismic period reflect the magnitude of the flow path length and permeability which are influenced by the topographical and geological conditions of the mountain aquifer systems 4 3 3 shift in cfc 12 concentrations after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake the atmospheric cfc profile shows a steady increase from the 1950s to the 1990s fig 5 b cfc concentrations in spring waters commonly reflect atmospheric concentrations at the time of recharge the time dependent and increasing spring water cfc trends do not seem to be altered in the volcanic aquifer systems over several years ide et al 2016 unless new waters contributed from different origins and shallow contaminated soil pore groundwaters are present using the cfc 12 values for the case without coseismic changes we estimated 2017 values for each spring corresponding to atmospheric values of 8 y after the 2009 eac results table 2 if no change occurred in the flow dynamics related to spring discharge the cfc concentrations in the post earthquake spring samples would increase which reflects the increasing atmospheric cfc concentrations for waters recharged during 1950 1990 and without direct contamination from land sources blue bar in fig 5b in other words if an abnormal shift in cfc concentration is detected it may reflect a change in flow dynamics caused by the earthquake our results show that cfc concentrations in ten springs remain unchanged s10 s12 s25 s38 and s70 or their cfc 12 signatures changed in accord with their age evolutions s4 s5 s6 s31 and s72 fig 5 these cfc signatures probably indicate that significant changes in the flow dynamics have not occurred however the stable isotope ratio results clearly indicate an increased contribution of waters from higher recharge elevations the eac values of the cfcs do not directly indicate volumetric information such as aquifer volume permeability or flow rate although newly added water has a higher recharge elevation path the groundwater age might be the same as the pre seismic spring discharge system because of this unknown volumetric property thus we can conclude that these cfc 12 results are indicative of newly added waters that contained similar cfc concentrations to the original groundwaters in contrast other springs show clear changes in their cfc 12 signatures that cannot simply be explained by age evolution ten springs showed decreasing cfc 12 concentrations after the earthquake fig 5 of which the cfc 12 values of six springs s02 s16 s23 s27 s28 and s29 are lower than the estimated values shown in blue bars whereas the other four springs s11 s13 s30 and s65 show decreasing trends consistent with the range of excess locally contaminated cfc 12 concentrations in natural systems cfc concentrations in waters can be depleted during anaerobic microbial degradation oremland et al 1996 zheng et al 2008 or sorption in a solid phase matrix with high organic carbon content e g silty sand aquifer iaea 2006 however the orp and do results table 1 indicate that all the waters in the present study occur under substantially aerobic conditions and thus the occurrence of anaerobic microbial degradation is unlikely the high do results also indicate low organic carbon content in the flow path and thus sorption iaea 2006 is unlikely hence the contribution of waters from different origins is the only possible explanation for the cfc 12 decline observed in the former group of springs which are distributed mainly at the foot of mt kinpo and locally at the foot of the aso caldera somma mountains fig 5a it is suggested that mixing in for these springs new water released from higher elevation aquifers with longer flow paths of older ages mixed after the earthquake the appearance of several rupture systems after the earthquake suggests that the permeability of the mountain aquifers was enhanced which led to the transportation of these waters fig 6 a 6b these results correspond well with previous implications of coseismic mountain water release hosono et al 2019 and phenomena described in other areas chia et al 2001 rosen et al 2018 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wang and manga 2015 the latter group of springs are distributed mostly at the end of mountain slopes with several similar surrounding rupture systems contributions of either less contaminated waters or older cfc 12 depleted waters are suggested for these springs however the stable isotopic ratios provide evidence of water contributions from higher elevation recharge sources and that such waters can travel over longer flow paths to reach the spring sites we thus interpret that the additional water source is derived from deeper longer flow paths as a same mechanism proposed for the former group of springs fig 6c the remaining 12 springs show increased cfc 12 concentrations over the atmospheric ranges s01 s17 s19 s21 s22 s59 s66 s68 s71 s73 and s74 except for spring s09 in which the 2017 data is higher than the estimated value but lower than the atmospheric concentration springs with moderate increases 550 700 pptv s17 s66 s68 can be explained by the temporal atmospheric excessive concentration for the other springs increased cfc 12 concentrations exceeding the atmospheric ranges can only be explained by increased contamination of anthropogenic source waters from shallow contaminated soils groundwaters e g chambers et al 2018 kagabu et al 2017 whereas increased cfc 12 concentrations lower than atmospheric concentrations can be explained by contributions from either local anthropogenic contamination or from younger shallow groundwater because spring s09 is typical mountain water without any possible contamination sources in or around its catchment area it is highly probable that the new water with a younger age close to atmospheric equilibrium recharge water was transferred from higher elevations see fig 2 through new rupture systems that appeared on the northwestern aso caldera somma mountains fig 5 evidence for groundwater contributions from the mountain to spring s09 can be obtained using cfc end member mixing calculations and is based on the same approach used for isotopes fig 5c the end member component of the mountain groundwater is the same as the stable isotope part ts01 but the other component was obtained using the estimated eac value for 2017 for the original component instead of the 2009 eac value of spring s09 this was done to take into account the 8 y difference the obtained mixing ratio for the newly added water component around 70 was dissimilar to that obtained from isotopes which suggests that the end member was not sufficiently representative for quantitative evaluations nevertheless the mixing ratio clearly shows the contribution of mountain groundwater to quantitatively evaluate the amount of added groundwater from other flow paths from mountain groundwater requires the integration of our data with volumetric information this will allow full use of the relevant modeling and simulation technologies the majority of the springs with increased cfc 12 are located in the kumamoto plain near an extension of the suizenji fault system futagawa hinagu fault system and epicenters s19 s21 and s22 these springs are located in urban areas and were highly contaminated cfc 12 signatures 900 pptv before the earthquake hosono et al 2019 reported coseismic surface and subsurface groundwater drawdown into the deep crust along the suizenji fault system with the constraint from isotopic compositional changes for these spring waters the observed cfc 12 increase can be explained by the mixing of surface pore waters groundwaters with highly concentrated cfc 12 sources into the aquifer systems even though this surface water mixing was volumetrically less important compared with the coseismically released mountain water contribution that is the major cause of the shift in isotopic ratios fig 6b the original cfc 12 concentrations for six springs s01 s17 s59 s71 s73 and s74 are typical for spring discharge systems with groundwater residence times of 55 y fig 5b except for the moderately increased values for spring s17 cfc 12 values shifted to in excess of the atmospheric peak 700 to 1000pptv after the earthquake this can only be explained by the addition of local anthropogenic contamination sources from the surface although the exact sources of the observed anthropogenic contamination are unclear one possible source is local domestic effluent morris et al 2006 groundwater cfc concentrations may be sensitively contaminated far above the atmospheric level in even sparsely populated non urbanized areas where only a single point source of contamination is expected within the catchment area these springs are located in somewhat remote and mountainous areas but there are some houses and small factories thus we suggest that shallow contaminated waters leaked into the aquifer waters through the seismologically rupture systems and small cracks formed during the seismic vibrations similarly to the water flow path changes found in the kumamoto plain area the previously mentioned occurrence of additional water flows and mixing processes may cause a change in the hydrochemical compositions of the springs however in contrast to this assumption the major dissolved ions do not show remarkable changes because of the compositional homogeneity of volcanic aquifer materials with the exception of a few springs fig s1 there are several exceptional samples that show hydrochemical changes that correspond well with the cfc 12 tracer results two springs s02 and s29 show decreased concentrations of multiple ions and total components fig s1 suggesting dilution by mixing with more diluted waters this corresponds with the cfc 12 results supporting the occurrence of newly added waters from mountains of higher elevation presumably with lower solute concentrations for these two springs a similar declining trend was observed for chloride ion concentrations from continuous monitoring results of the kumamoto regional groundwater flow systems hosono and masaki 2020 in contrast increased chloride concentrations were also found in two springs s58 and s59 located at the northern foot of mt kinpo fig s1f there are four possible mixing sources that could have increased the chloride ion concentrations deep fluids hydrothermal waters marine clay pore waters and surface waters containing sewage the results of cfc 12 analysis at spring s59 suggest local anthropogenic contamination from the surface which probably correspond with the observed chloride ion concentration increases in the last scenario hence the observed chemical compositional changes in the springs corroborate the cfc 12 results and imply coseismic mountain aquifer water release and contamination from shallower waters two springs s58 and s59 did not show at nitrate ion shift fig s1h which might be indicative of differences in the type of pollutant source the area is well known for its citrus fruit production and many distributed springs show detectable concentrations of nitrate which is an indicator of local anthropogenic contamination before the pre seismic period kagabu et al 2010 nitrate concentrations were caused from chemical fertilizers used in citrus cultivation and therefore did not shift as a result of coseismic groundwater change 4 4 groundwater flow change mechanisms several mechanisms have been invoked to explain observed coseismic hydrological changes manga and wang 2015 these mechanisms include pore pressure changes from elastic strain changes akita and matsumoto 2004 jónsson et al 2003 muir wood and king 1993 the addition of deep crustal and hydrothermal waters e g hosono et al 2018 muir wood and king 1993 wang et al 2004 pore pressure changes from liquefaction and consolidation e g manga 2003 2001 montgomery and manga 2003 soil pore water leaking from the unsaturated zone into the aquifer systems by seismic vibrations e g manga and rowland 2009 mohr et al 2012 water drawdown though crustal ruptures into the deep crust hosono et al 2019 and coseismic mountain aquifer water release as a result of permeability enhancement e g shi et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wang and manga 2015 the observed changes in water isotope composition across the study area figs 2 and 3 suggest the occurrence of water mixing from different water sources along original flow paths eliminating the possibility of the first scenario observed shits in coseismic isotopic composition in spring waters fig 2 and the characteristics of the ions fig 7 do not support the occurrence of deep fluids and hydrothermal water intrusions into the mountain aquifer systems in the present study numerous occurrences of liquefaction were observed after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake mostly in the plain areas wakamatsu et al 2017 occurrence of liquefaction are however rarely reported in mountainous areas which suggests that the third scenario is unlikely one of the major hydrological changes to the studied springs was the intrusion of relatively older groundwater recharged at higher elevations that had traveled along relatively long original flow paths fig 6a 6b it is plausible that these intruded waters were transported through newly formed structural deformations which enhanced permeability in the mountain aquifers fujiwara et al 2016 similar groundwater intrusion with younger ages and shorter flow paths has also identified fig 6c rupture systems fujiwara et al 2016 and or surface landslides dang et al 2016 might lead to the enhancement of subsurface permeability coseismic increases in cfc 12 concentrations from surface water contamination is most apparent in and around the suizenji faults in the urban areas and is also found in less urbanized areas in remote locations there is clear evidence of material gas transport from shallow contaminated soil pore waters and or aquifer waters possibly triggered by surface water drawdown along crustal ruptures hosono et al 2019 and soil water release from upper unsaturated zones through preferential pore spaces enhanced by seismic vibrations and or new cracks as confirmed using other tracers including co2 gas nitrate and organic matters hosono and masaki 2020 fig 6b thus the fourth fifth and last scenarios seem to be the major mechanisms to explain the observed isotopic and chemical changes in the studied volcanic mountain aquifer systems 5 conclusions we compared stable isotopic compositions and cfc concentrations from spring water samples collected before and after the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake over the kumamoto aso area in southern japan to better understand the processes and mechanisms of hydrogeological change for volcanic mountain aquifer systems in response to large seismotectonic impacts three major groundwater flow changes were identified fig 6 1 intrusion of new waters from deeper and longer flow paths than the original flows as a result of enhanced permeability in the mountain aquifers 2 addition of new waters from shallower and shorter flow paths as in bypass flow than the original flows owing to enhanced permeability in mountain surface areas including landslides and 3 release of unsaturated soil pore waters shallow groundwaters into deeper aquifers though open crustal ruptures and cracks and or as a result of seismic vibrations this study demonstrated the usefulness of cfc analysis and by extension other age tracers such as sf6 and 85kr in combination with stable isotope ratios to obtain a better understanding of coseismic hydrological changes the proposed coseismic hydrogeological change mechanisms and approaches to identify these changes should be informative for further investigations in other areas especially in young volcanic regions along continental margins and island arcs the results of this study are also useful for understanding the coseismic leaking of surface contamination in residential areas the coseismically enhanced permeability of mountain aquifers is expected to recover over time continuous monitoring of isotopic and age tracers is therefore needed to further identify the rehabilitation process of aquifer systems after a large seismic event declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

elevation and ground temperature a 1 t m lr h k where tm describes the recharge temperature c lr is the local air temperature lapse rate c m 1 and h is the altitude m k is the constant value obtained by substitution of the altitude and representative temperature of kumamoto meteorological station h 38 m to eq a 1 the weighted average annual temperature in terms of monthly precipitation was assigned to tm as the representative temperature value furthermore the selected climatic data used for the weighted average calculation were the long term averaged value referred to as climatic normal values the selection accounts for the fact that there might be a time gap of several decades for the temperature of the recharged year in the long term climate trends the climatic normal values are the averages of observed data over a consecutive period of 30 y and are updated every decade japan meteorological agency 2011 we selected a period with values covered in each sampling period for the 2009 sampling data we used the normal value for 1970 2000 and for the 2019 sampling data we used the 1980 2010 value the annual temperature rose by 0 3 c over these two periods because of global warming in summer when the impact of precipitation was large there was an increase exceeding 0 6 c at the maximum japan meteorological agency 2011 and is reflected in the long term temperature trends

5713,large earthquakes change the hydrogeological properties of aquifer systems such as permeability and cause changes that impact groundwater flow to understand these changes in mountain aquifer systems we analyzed stable isotopic ratios of water molecular δd and δ18o of h2o and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs concentrations of natural spring waters and compared these values between before 2009 and after 2017 the 2016 kumamoto crustal earthquake sequence in kumamoto aso area southern japan stable isotope ratios were used to identify the spring source characteristics that reflected recharge elevations whereas cfc age tracers were applied to evaluate the contribution of earthquake induced additional waters from different pathways shorter or longer and or cfc enriched contaminated surface waters in general spring waters after the earthquake became more depleted in water isotopic compositions than those before the earthquake suggesting an increased contribution of waters recharged from higher elevations across the area in addition changes observed in cfc 12 concentrations were classified into several increasing decreasing patterns defined by the contribution of additional waters from different flow paths such as older groundwater with longer flow paths younger groundwater from shorter flow paths and cfc enriched contaminated water released from shallow aquifers and soils these isotopic and chemical features when combined with previously documented seismotectonic surface rupture distributions demonstrated the occurrence of coseismic mountain water release due to enhanced permeability these findings enabled us to document how groundwater flow changes in mountain aquifers although cfc age markers have rarely been applied as a tool to investigate coseismic hydrological changes our study exemplifies their usefulness in combination with stable isotope ratios in such investigations keywords earthquake stable isotope cfcs spring water 1 introduction numerous studies have reported changes of spring discharge rate after large earthquakes e g manga and rowland 2009 sato et al 2000 tokunaga 1999 wang and manga 2015 wood et al 1985 these changes are attributed to coseismic changes in the hydrogeological properties of aquifer systems such as permeability and pore pressure and changes in the capacity of the unsaturated zone to store and transmit water manga and wang 2015 the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios δd and δ18o of water h2o can be used as tracers to identify the origin of new waters that alter spring discharge systems manga and rowland 2009 as well as to understand other coseismic hydrological hydro chemical changes e g claesson et al 2004 onda et al 2018 wang and manga 2015 in some cases changes in isotopic compositions continue over a year after the earthquake occurrence because hydrogeological conditions do not recover quickly and waters from other sources with different isotopic compositions are continuously added claesson et al 2004 sato et al 2000 wang et al 2005 these studies successfully demonstrate the usefulness of stable isotope ratios for understanding coseismic hydrological changes although it is possible to perform detailed isotopic monitoring of new and increased discharges after an earthquake manga and rowland 2009 manga and wang 2015 coherent datasets collected both pre and post earthquake are however rare this makes isotopic comparisons difficult moreover the number of springs wells used for isotopic comparisons in previous studies is generally too small to depict the spatial distributions of such changes major ion and trace metal concentrations can be used in a similar to stable isotopes to identify the origin of new waters especially the contributions of highly condensed deep fluids and geothermal waters e g barberio et al 2017 inan et al 2012 hosono et al 2018 tsunogai and wakita 1995 contrary to these non meteoric forms of groundwater mixing of the meteorologically mediated active groundwater proved the difficulty of the detection of newly additional groundwater because of the similarity of each chemical composition related to its origin unless monitoring is continuous or intermittent an alternative approach is to assume that dissolved gas concentrations typically applied for groundwater age determination for active flow systems chambers et al 2018 darling et al 2012 can be used to identify changes in groundwater flow paths after earthquakes chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are chemically stable synthetic gases which are widely produced and used worldwide for refrigeration heat insulation and industrial solvents because of their chemical stability cfcs do not react with aquifer materials except during microbial degradation atmospheric concentrations of cfcs have increased steadily from the 1950s until the 1990s chambers et al 2018 surface water that recharges groundwater is in equilibrium with atmospheric cfc concentrations and their concentrations are almost stable until discharge consequently cfc concentrations in spring water can be used to identify groundwater residence time for groundwater younger than 55 years in mountain aquifers in areas where contamination from anthropogenic activity and or anaerobic microbial degradation is negligible international atomic energy agency iaea 2006 in contrast surface waters in urban areas generally have a high cfc concentration as a result of contamination and concentrations are sometimes a few orders of magnitude greater than atmospheric equilibrium cfc ranges the mixing of shallow contaminated groundwater in deep aquifers can therefore be accurately detected kagabu et al 2013 taufiq et al 2017 for example kagabu et al 2013 reported how excessive pumping caused highly contaminated cfc concentrations in the deep confined aquifers under the jakarta urban area cfc concentrations can also be used to examine groundwater flow changes caused by underground construction and facilities hagiwara et al 2015 mahara et al 2001 these studies demonstrate the potential usefulness of cfc concentrations in spring waters for obtaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of groundwater flow change in response to earthquakes to the best of our knowledge no studies exist in the literature that discuss coseismic cfc concentration changes in groundwater the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence began with a mw 6 2 foreshock on april 14 followed by a mw 7 0 main shock on april 16 the active futagawa hinagu fault system is located in the kumamoto plain and extends eastwards through the northern part of the aso caldera fig 1 a coseismic hydrological changes have recently been documented for the kumamoto regional groundwater flow systems based on groundwater levels in monitoring wells 250 m depth and river discharge hosono et al 2019 briefly surface and aquifer waters were reduced within 35 min after the main shock owing to water drawdown along newly formed open crustal ruptures suizenji fault zone fig 1 after this initial water drop the water level rose in the groundwater recharge area at the plateaus with an elevation of 50 200 m located adjacent to the plain area possibly owing to coseismic mountain water release hosono et al 2019 the water level continued to rise for 2 years after the main shock kagabu et al 2020 however coseismic hydrological changes in the mountain aquifer systems located around the regional groundwater flow systems fig 1 above 150 m however have not yet been discussed natural spring waters were sampled before the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in 2009 over the kumamoto aso mountain areas and measured for ion and cfc concentrations and stable isotope ratios these data allow a comparison with data collected after the main shock in 2017 the present study seeks to clarify the coseismic hydrological changes in mountain groundwater flows on the basis of comparison of stable isotopic compositions and cfc concentrations of natural spring waters between pre and post seismic collection times over a regional catchment scale a few natural springs within the plateaus and plains are also discussed this paper presents an unique approach for identifying coseismic hydrological changes by using cfc tracer 2 geological background 2 1 topographic and hydrological setting the study area is located in central kyushu and encompasses an area 2000 km2 that includes mt kinpo 665 m peak altitude on the coastal side the kumamoto plain and plateau hills around the plain and the aso caldera watershed fig 1 the western foot of mt kujyu is the eastern boundary of the study area and the ariake sea marks the western boundary the aso caldera watershed 380 km2 is developed within a large caldera 25 18 km and the ring shaped caldera somma ridge highest peak 1154 m forms the watershed divide the central volcanic mountains highest peak 1592 m and the caldera somma mountains are the main recharge areas within the caldera watershed the annual average precipitation in the kumamoto plain and aso areas are 1986 and 2832 mm y 1 respectively with an average temperature of 16 9 and 12 9 c 1981 2010 weather time j net 2019 respectively the rainy season june july accounts for 40 of the total annual precipitation annual precipitation measurements over a decade 2008 2017 including the sampling event reveal the two highest precipitation years the heavy rain disasters of 2012 3620 mm aso and 2016 2504 mm kumamoto plain and 3708 mm aso although the annual temperatures for 2016 18 0 c kumamoto plain and 14 1 c aso were relatively high when compared with the average annual temperatures the temperatures for the other years were within 0 5 c of the average in the kumamoto aso area aso volcanic rocks of quaternary age and terrace alluvium deposits overlay a basement of paleozoic to mesozoic metamorphic rocks and tertiary quaternary pre aso volcanic rocks fig 1b the aso volcanic rocks that form the main body of the quaternary aso volcanoes are found on at the eastern side of mt kinpo and at the western foot of the caldera somma mountains and consist of plateaus and hills recharge to the regional groundwater flow system mainly occurs through pyroclastic flow deposits beneath the kumamoto plain hosono et al 2013 less permeable older volcanic units pre aso volcanic rocks are exposed in and around mt kinpo and the caldera somma mountains many natural spring waters occur in these volcanic aquifer areas fig 1 driven by active hydrological cycles the springs flowed continuously before and after the earthquakes there are only a few springs that were empty after the earthquakes one of the dried up springs located in the southern part of the aso caldera watershed discharged a few cubic meters per minute in the pre seismic stage and then remained dry for over two years after the earthquake mountain springs may have dried up because permeability changes caused a temporary lowering of water levels the reduction in the discharge rates of other springs may have been caused by the same process 2 2 distribution and hydrology of the investigated springs most sampled springs are located around the mountains the western slope of the aso caldera somma mountains s07 s08 s09 s10 s16 s17 and s41 mt kinpo s23 s25 s26 s27 s28 s29 s58 and s59 east of the aso caldera somma to the kujyu mountains s71 s72 s73 and s74 and within the aso caldera watershed s01 s02 s04 s05 s06 s65 s66 s68 and s70 the first springs are recharged from the caldera somma mountains and seep from downslope areas at altitudes around 100 600 m these springs and those around mt kinpo are characterized by seepage flows from fractures and joints of pre aso volcanic rocks shimano 2000 the springs near the caldera somma s01 s06 s65 s66 s68 and s70 and central volcanic mountains s02 s04 s05 are predominantly recharged from their respective mountain watersheds hosono et al 2018 kagabu et al 2011 in general the former waters show shorter residence time 20 y that flow along relatively shorter groundwater flow paths while the latter waters show longer residence times 40 y with longer groundwater flow paths kagabu et al 2011 apart from the aforementioned volcanic mountain slope springs there are several springs that seep in the plateaus and plain areas within the aso pyroclastic flow deposits s11 s12 s13 s19 s21 and s22 because there are no high mountains near the plateaus it is reasonable to assume that the springs are recharged from the local hills with elevations of less than 300 m the springs located in the plateaus s11 s12 s13 and s22 originate from unconfined groundwater of the kumamoto regional groundwater systems shimano 2000 there are large spring fed lakes ezu and kashima lakes fig 1 on the downslopes of the kumamoto plain which are sourced from confined groundwaters 30 200 m depth hosono et al 2013 we sampled one of the spring sources from each lake s19 and s21 more features of these spring lakes are detailed in ono et al 2013 industrial and residential areas are widely distributed across the kumamoto plain and can also be found in the mountainous areas kagabu et al 2017 showed aquifer systems under the plains are highly contaminated by cfcs possibly as a result of industrial activities and domestic drainage other studies have found similar relationships between cfc contamination and human activities busenberg and plummer 1992 hohener et al 2002 morris et al 2006 the contamination by cfc pollutants makes it impossible to determine groundwater flow ages in these area alternatively the highly contaminated properties of the shallow waters can be effectively used as indicators of the downward flux of shallow water into deep confined groundwaters taufiq et al 2017 the 2016 destructive kumamoto inland earthquakes revealed many new faults and rupture systems especially near ezu lake the northwestern aso caldera mountains and partly in mt kinpo fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 fig 1 this suggests permeability changes in the mountain aquifer systems the isotopic and cfc concentrations of spring waters can be effectively applied to test this hypothesis 3 materials and methods natural spring water samples were collected from 39 spring sites in the study area before in 2009 and after in 2017 the 2016 kumamoto earthquake fig 1 a sample of mountain aquifer water was collected from inside a tunnel in the northwestern caldera somma mountains at about 50 m below the surface sample no ts01 fig 1 electrical conductivity temperature ph oxygen

sampling but changes were not visible in the field table 1 lists detailed location information sampling days and measurement results water samples were filtered through a 0 20 μm pore filter dismic 25 advantec japan before storage for stable isotope and major ion analysis samples for cfc analysis were stored in 125 ml glass bottles without filtering for cfc sampling sample bottles were flushed with approximately 1 l of the sample water then filled and capped underwater to prevent contact of the water sample with the atmosphere all collected water samples were analyzed at kumamoto university japan table 1 the results from 32 springs were used to compare spring water obtained before and after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake we also used supplemental repeated sampling and analysis data gathered at 25 points in the pre seismic period november 2008 to july 2011 table s1 data from samples taken before and after the rainy season were used to consider seasonal variability the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic ratios of water molecular were determined using a continuous flow gas ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific usa both isotope ratios are expressed using the delta notation δ and per mill units with respect to the international standards of the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical precision for δd and δ18o measurements

waters bu and warner 1995 iaea 2006 warner and weiss 1985 electrical conductivity values measured in the studied spring waters were sufficiently low 314 µs cm 1 to ignore the effects of salinity to estimate the recharge elevation we adopted a previously established relationship between recharge elevations and δd kagabu et al 2011 2 δ d 0 0270 h 43 372 where h is the recharge elevation m the temperature of the recharge water was estimated using a local air temperature lapse rate of 0 55 c 100 m kagabu et al 2017 and the local surface temperature see appendix a we adopted the northern hemisphere average usgs 2016 atmospheric cfc profile for comparison with the eac values of the springs in the present study because the northern hemisphere average is uniform over a wide area iaea 2006 of the three cfc profiles that can be used for groundwater age dating cfc 12 has the largest increase trend there is no local atmospheric cfc profile dataset for the study area but the long term trend from 1990 to 2010 in other japanese cities does not deviate substantially sumimoto et al 2012 tanimura et al 1997 the peak atmospheric concentration for japanese cities is 1 3 times higher than the northern hemisphere average the peak value of the atmospheric profile may have therefore temporarily increased to 700 pptv 4 results and discussion 4 1 field parameters table 1 compares the results of field and laboratory measurements for pre and post seismic events 2009 vs 2017 the range of electrical conductivities for each spring survey is similar for the two years 2009 73 314 µs cm 1 2017 78 306 µs cm 1 the temperature range is also stable over time 2009 12 9 24 5 c 2017 13 6 24 2 c a comparison of the field parameters for the two sampling campaigns show that almost all springs do not deviate from the 1 1 line plotted in the scatter diagrams figs s1a b except for some samples that show a slight decrease in electrical conductivity after the earthquake in general it has been observed that the ion concentrations of spring discharges are constant in hydrological cycles in the study area for the seasons and years studied shimano 2000 1996 however observed similarities between the pre and post earthquake data does not imply that distinct hydrological changes did not occur hydro chemical compositions are homogeneous in volcanic aquifer systems because the aquifer geology consists of similar volcanic materials ide et al 2018 and hydro chemical properties of the springs except for appropriate tracers may not significantly change even if changes occur in the flow path or if mixing between waters from different areas occurs it is therefore difficult to precisely determine a signal of coseismic change using only field measurements the major ion chemistry did not show any significant changes except in a few cases fig s1 which will be discussed later in this section the measured high do and the positive orp results 2009 98 300 mv 2017 73 361 mv show that the observed springs are associated with aquifers under aerobic conditions and thus no microbial degradation of cfcs should be expected iaea 2006 4 2 stable isotope ratios the range of stable isotope ratios in 2009 table 1 are 8 4 to 6 4 for δ18o and 55 4 to 42 4 for δd however the 2017 results table 1 show lower isotopic compositions δ18o 8 9 to 7 0 δd 56 4 to 45 0 compared with the 2009 results fig 2 the values of the results from the sampling analyses done before the kumamoto earthquake indicate that the post seismic isotopic change is larger than the fluctuations in δ18o during the pre seismic period table s1 and fig s2 including those caused by seasonality these isotopic shifts suggest the mixing of water with a lower isotopic composition into the original groundwater for most springs in the study area in fig 2 the isotopic compositions of springs before the earthquake plot close to the local summer high recharge season meteoric water line fig 2a after the earthquake the plots shift toward lower isotope ratios especially for the oxygen isotope ratio changes in the stable isotopic compositions of aquifer waters may be explained by several reasons such as evaporation before recharge gat et al 1994 mixing of deep fluids with magmatic constituents simmons and brown 2006 and the mixing of surface waters from different pathways yeh et al 2009 however fig 2b clearly shows that the evaporation effect and the mixing of deep magmatic fluids is insufficient to explain the observed compositional changes in addition isotopic changes except during mixing after recharge are only known to occur in the case of stagnant water with a small water rock ratio clark and fritz 2013 cole and ohmoto 1986 and are unlikely to occur in the case of actively flowing groundwater the isotopic composition of spring discharge commonly reflects the recharge elevation of the source water namely recharged waters from higher elevations tend to show lower isotopic compositions e g fontes 1980 kelly and glenn 2015 scholl et al 2002 and thus observed isotope ratio changes imply the mixing of groundwater recharged at higher elevation sources in addition fig 2a shows that the isotopic composition of the tunnel excavation spring ts01 plots as an extension of the changing trend from 2009 to 2017 for vicinity spring s09 the change in isotope ratios of the mountain foot springs is therefore considered to be caused by the contribution of additional waters inside the mountain at higher elevation the mixing rate calculation to quantitatively evaluate this contribution requires spring isotope data from before and after the earthquake and additional water isotope data the scarcity of mountain groundwater data at higher elevations than the spring makes it difficult to obtain the end member to explain the isotopic change in most of the springs ts01 discharges groundwater that was intercepted during the excavation of a road tunnel and belongs to the same catchment as the lower elevation spring s09 therefore ts01 and s09 could be regarded as reasonable end members based on topographical location i e elevation and distance the possible end member components are s09 sampled in 2009 for the original water without earthquake effects and ts01 as the additional water component the straight line drawn from the isotopic compositions of these two sources can be used to depict the mixing line fig 2c the mixing ratio of the newly added water from ts01 at s09 after the earthquake was estimated using the mixing line and was about 40 50 although this calculation does not yield a quantitative evaluation for most of the springs the distribution of the isotope ratio changes between the two periods fig 3 and verifies that isotope ratios were depleted in all of the spring waters and were caused by groundwater mixing the unified decreasing shift is not displayed in the other hydrochemical parameters e g ion concentrations in fig s1 which might reflect the homogeneity of the geological distributions the aforementioned new water supply requires the formation of pathways that lead waters of higher recharge origins to be involved owing to permeability enhancement the occurrence of recently recognized seismic rupture systems fujiwara et al 2016 that crosscut mountainous areas fig 1 supports this hypothesis in the vicinity of mt kinpo isotopic changes for the springs were 0 6 or less which was smaller than for the other springs this implies that there was smaller elevation gap between the original and additional source waters which may correspond to the smaller mountain scale and or possibly owing to less permeable features of the aquifers and less destruction by seismic deformation in the mountains nevertheless our results suggest that mountain aquifer waters recharged from higher elevations were involved in the original discharge systems after the earthquake and the changes were sustained for at least 1 y after the main shock 4 3 coseismic changes in cfcs 4 3 1 analytical results for cfcs we analyzed three types of cfcs cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 table 1 the cfc concentrations measured in the 2009 sampling varied from 259 to 2 569 976 pg kg 1 for cfc 11 87 to 4139 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 and 21 to 10 639 169 pg kg 1 for cfc 113 the 2017 sampling results ranged from 195 to 1 174 140 pg kg 1 for cfc 11 136 to 1848 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 and 16 to 2 955 734 pg kg 1 for cfc 113 table 1 showing similar concentrations with the 2009 results the calculated eac values for spring sites from both sampling campaigns are shown in table 2 a number of samples had concentrations several orders of magnitude greater than atmospheric concentrations at the sampling time this is attributed to the pre earthquake influence of anthropogenic contamination from urban and industrial areas kagabu et al 2017 the multi tracer approach uses several cfcs to verify the different mixing processes and estimate the groundwater age darling et al 2012 gooddy et al 2006 han et al 2012 plummer et al 2001 but high eac values make this evaluation difficult a comparison of the cfc concentration levels for each sampling campaign showed that most samples had qualitatively similar values table 2 however for several samples the increasing and decreasing trends were not the same for three cfc compounds the difference in trends was caused by the different cfc sources cfc 11 and cfc 113 originate from former commercial use from business or industrial purposes e g industrial degreaser refrigerant in industrial air conditioners whereas the cfc 12 source is the refrigerant of home electric devices because of the different trends caused by the different contaminant sources the multi tracer cfc method was impractical to use in this study fewer springs were contaminated by cfc 12 than cfc 11 and cfc 113 kagabu et al 2017 before the earthquake event and cfc 12 s atmospheric profile has the largest increase of the cfc compounds therefore we focused more on the cfc 12 results in our analysis and discussion 4 3 2 pre seismic spring discharge system based on cfc 12 results the distribution of cfc 12 concentrations in the 2009 spring waters are shown in fig 4 eight spring samples black circles in fig 4 clearly exceed the eac concentrations more than the atmospheric concentration 700 pptv of these springs the seven springs with the highest ranges are located in and around the kumamoto urbanized areas s10 s12 s13 s19 s21 s22 and s30 while one spring s65 is located in a residential area within the aso caldera watershed kagabu et al 2017 attributed the elevated cfc 12 concentrations in the kumamoto plain to leakage from urbanized lands local point or non point sources such as drains from private homes iaea 2006 and leakage pesticides from farm lands plummer et al 2000 can also elevate the cfc 12 concentrations of underground waters thus these eight springs show excess cfc 12 signatures influenced by local anthropogenic contamination the eac values for the other springs do not exceed atmospheric cfc 12 concentrations of these 12 springs gray circles in fig 4 show relatively high cfc 12 concentrations 500 pptv and are mostly distributed at the foot of mt kujyu s70 s73 and s74 within the aso caldera watershed s05 s66 and s68 and at the southwestern foot of the aso caldera and other mountains s11 s17 s25 s31 s38 and s59 these high cfc 12 values correspond to recent i e 1990s atmospheric concentrations which suggests that these springs are sourced from groundwaters with faster shorter residence time flow paths if the effect of anthropogenic contamination in these remote spring possible recharge sites is neglected fig 4 in contrast with the aforementioned cfc enriched springs some springs at the western slope of the aso caldera somma mountains s09 s16 show significantly lower cfc 12 values implying that they originate from longer flow paths with older groundwater residence times among the studied springs the same typical mountain foot springs with moderate cfc 12 concentrations bold circles in fig 4 prevail around mt kinpo s23 s27 and s29 as mentioned previously the springs around mt kinpo flow out through small fractures from relatively inactive aquifer systems with relatively impermeable structures compared with those in the aso mountainous areas which are relatively large scale active groundwater flow systems shimano 2000 the cfc 12 results for both mountain springs correspond well with the differences in their hydrogeological settings in summary the cfc 12 concentrations of the springs during the pre seismic period reflect the magnitude of the flow path length and permeability which are influenced by the topographical and geological conditions of the mountain aquifer systems 4 3 3 shift in cfc 12 concentrations after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake the atmospheric cfc profile shows a steady increase from the 1950s to the 1990s fig 5 b cfc concentrations in spring waters commonly reflect atmospheric concentrations at the time of recharge the time dependent and increasing spring water cfc trends do not seem to be altered in the volcanic aquifer systems over several years ide et al 2016 unless new waters contributed from different origins and shallow contaminated soil pore groundwaters are present using the cfc 12 values for the case without coseismic changes we estimated 2017 values for each spring corresponding to atmospheric values of 8 y after the 2009 eac results table 2 if no change occurred in the flow dynamics related to spring discharge the cfc concentrations in the post earthquake spring samples would increase which reflects the increasing atmospheric cfc concentrations for waters recharged during 1950 1990 and without direct contamination from land sources blue bar in fig 5b in other words if an abnormal shift in cfc concentration is detected it may reflect a change in flow dynamics caused by the earthquake our results show that cfc concentrations in ten springs remain unchanged s10 s12 s25 s38 and s70 or their cfc 12 signatures changed in accord with their age evolutions s4 s5 s6 s31 and s72 fig 5 these cfc signatures probably indicate that significant changes in the flow dynamics have not occurred however the stable isotope ratio results clearly indicate an increased contribution of waters from higher recharge elevations the eac values of the cfcs do not directly indicate volumetric information such as aquifer volume permeability or flow rate although newly added water has a higher recharge elevation path the groundwater age might be the same as the pre seismic spring discharge system because of this unknown volumetric property thus we can conclude that these cfc 12 results are indicative of newly added waters that contained similar cfc concentrations to the original groundwaters in contrast other springs show clear changes in their cfc 12 signatures that cannot simply be explained by age evolution ten springs showed decreasing cfc 12 concentrations after the earthquake fig 5 of which the cfc 12 values of six springs s02 s16 s23 s27 s28 and s29 are lower than the estimated values shown in blue bars whereas the other four springs s11 s13 s30 and s65 show decreasing trends consistent with the range of excess locally contaminated cfc 12 concentrations in natural systems cfc concentrations in waters can be depleted during anaerobic microbial degradation oremland et al 1996 zheng et al 2008 or sorption in a solid phase matrix with high organic carbon content e g silty sand aquifer iaea 2006 however the orp and do results table 1 indicate that all the waters in the present study occur under substantially aerobic conditions and thus the occurrence of anaerobic microbial degradation is unlikely the high do results also indicate low organic carbon content in the flow path and thus sorption iaea 2006 is unlikely hence the contribution of waters from different origins is the only possible explanation for the cfc 12 decline observed in the former group of springs which are distributed mainly at the foot of mt kinpo and locally at the foot of the aso caldera somma mountains fig 5a it is suggested that mixing in for these springs new water released from higher elevation aquifers with longer flow paths of older ages mixed after the earthquake the appearance of several rupture systems after the earthquake suggests that the permeability of the mountain aquifers was enhanced which led to the transportation of these waters fig 6 a 6b these results correspond well with previous implications of coseismic mountain water release hosono et al 2019 and phenomena described in other areas chia et al 2001 rosen et al 2018 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wang and manga 2015 the latter group of springs are distributed mostly at the end of mountain slopes with several similar surrounding rupture systems contributions of either less contaminated waters or older cfc 12 depleted waters are suggested for these springs however the stable isotopic ratios provide evidence of water contributions from higher elevation recharge sources and that such waters can travel over longer flow paths to reach the spring sites we thus interpret that the additional water source is derived from deeper longer flow paths as a same mechanism proposed for the former group of springs fig 6c the remaining 12 springs show increased cfc 12 concentrations over the atmospheric ranges s01 s17 s19 s21 s22 s59 s66 s68 s71 s73 and s74 except for spring s09 in which the 2017 data is higher than the estimated value but lower than the atmospheric concentration springs with moderate increases 550 700 pptv s17 s66 s68 can be explained by the temporal atmospheric excessive concentration for the other springs increased cfc 12 concentrations exceeding the atmospheric ranges can only be explained by increased contamination of anthropogenic source waters from shallow contaminated soils groundwaters e g chambers et al 2018 kagabu et al 2017 whereas increased cfc 12 concentrations lower than atmospheric concentrations can be explained by contributions from either local anthropogenic contamination or from younger shallow groundwater because spring s09 is typical mountain water without any possible contamination sources in or around its catchment area it is highly probable that the new water with a younger age close to atmospheric equilibrium recharge water was transferred from higher elevations see fig 2 through new rupture systems that appeared on the northwestern aso caldera somma mountains fig 5 evidence for groundwater contributions from the mountain to spring s09 can be obtained using cfc end member mixing calculations and is based on the same approach used for isotopes fig 5c the end member component of the mountain groundwater is the same as the stable isotope part ts01 but the other component was obtained using the estimated eac value for 2017 for the original component instead of the 2009 eac value of spring s09 this was done to take into account the 8 y difference the obtained mixing ratio for the newly added water component around 70 was dissimilar to that obtained from isotopes which suggests that the end member was not sufficiently representative for quantitative evaluations nevertheless the mixing ratio clearly shows the contribution of mountain groundwater to quantitatively evaluate the amount of added groundwater from other flow paths from mountain groundwater requires the integration of our data with volumetric information this will allow full use of the relevant modeling and simulation technologies the majority of the springs with increased cfc 12 are located in the kumamoto plain near an extension of the suizenji fault system futagawa hinagu fault system and epicenters s19 s21 and s22 these springs are located in urban areas and were highly contaminated cfc 12 signatures 900 pptv before the earthquake hosono et al 2019 reported coseismic surface and subsurface groundwater drawdown into the deep crust along the suizenji fault system with the constraint from isotopic compositional changes for these spring waters the observed cfc 12 increase can be explained by the mixing of surface pore waters groundwaters with highly concentrated cfc 12 sources into the aquifer systems even though this surface water mixing was volumetrically less important compared with the coseismically released mountain water contribution that is the major cause of the shift in isotopic ratios fig 6b the original cfc 12 concentrations for six springs s01 s17 s59 s71 s73 and s74 are typical for spring discharge systems with groundwater residence times of 55 y fig 5b except for the moderately increased values for spring s17 cfc 12 values shifted to in excess of the atmospheric peak 700 to 1000pptv after the earthquake this can only be explained by the addition of local anthropogenic contamination sources from the surface although the exact sources of the observed anthropogenic contamination are unclear one possible source is local domestic effluent morris et al 2006 groundwater cfc concentrations may be sensitively contaminated far above the atmospheric level in even sparsely populated non urbanized areas where only a single point source of contamination is expected within the catchment area these springs are located in somewhat remote and mountainous areas but there are some houses and small factories thus we suggest that shallow contaminated waters leaked into the aquifer waters through the seismologically rupture systems and small cracks formed during the seismic vibrations similarly to the water flow path changes found in the kumamoto plain area the previously mentioned occurrence of additional water flows and mixing processes may cause a change in the hydrochemical compositions of the springs however in contrast to this assumption the major dissolved ions do not show remarkable changes because of the compositional homogeneity of volcanic aquifer materials with the exception of a few springs fig s1 there are several exceptional samples that show hydrochemical changes that correspond well with the cfc 12 tracer results two springs s02 and s29 show decreased concentrations of multiple ions and total components fig s1 suggesting dilution by mixing with more diluted waters this corresponds with the cfc 12 results supporting the occurrence of newly added waters from mountains of higher elevation presumably with lower solute concentrations for these two springs a similar declining trend was observed for chloride ion concentrations from continuous monitoring results of the kumamoto regional groundwater flow systems hosono and masaki 2020 in contrast increased chloride concentrations were also found in two springs s58 and s59 located at the northern foot of mt kinpo fig s1f there are four possible mixing sources that could have increased the chloride ion concentrations deep fluids hydrothermal waters marine clay pore waters and surface waters containing sewage the results of cfc 12 analysis at spring s59 suggest local anthropogenic contamination from the surface which probably correspond with the observed chloride ion concentration increases in the last scenario hence the observed chemical compositional changes in the springs corroborate the cfc 12 results and imply coseismic mountain aquifer water release and contamination from shallower waters two springs s58 and s59 did not show at nitrate ion shift fig s1h which might be indicative of differences in the type of pollutant source the area is well known for its citrus fruit production and many distributed springs show detectable concentrations of nitrate which is an indicator of local anthropogenic contamination before the pre seismic period kagabu et al 2010 nitrate concentrations were caused from chemical fertilizers used in citrus cultivation and therefore did not shift as a result of coseismic groundwater change 4 4 groundwater flow change mechanisms several mechanisms have been invoked to explain observed coseismic hydrological changes manga and wang 2015 these mechanisms include pore pressure changes from elastic strain changes akita and matsumoto 2004 jónsson et al 2003 muir wood and king 1993 the addition of deep crustal and hydrothermal waters e g hosono et al 2018 muir wood and king 1993 wang et al 2004 pore pressure changes from liquefaction and consolidation e g manga 2003 2001 montgomery and manga 2003 soil pore water leaking from the unsaturated zone into the aquifer systems by seismic vibrations e g manga and rowland 2009 mohr et al 2012 water drawdown though crustal ruptures into the deep crust hosono et al 2019 and coseismic mountain aquifer water release as a result of permeability enhancement e g shi et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wang and manga 2015 the observed changes in water isotope composition across the study area figs 2 and 3 suggest the occurrence of water mixing from different water sources along original flow paths eliminating the possibility of the first scenario observed shits in coseismic isotopic composition in spring waters fig 2 and the characteristics of the ions fig 7 do not support the occurrence of deep fluids and hydrothermal water intrusions into the mountain aquifer systems in the present study numerous occurrences of liquefaction were observed after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake mostly in the plain areas wakamatsu et al 2017 occurrence of liquefaction are however rarely reported in mountainous areas which suggests that the third scenario is unlikely one of the major hydrological changes to the studied springs was the intrusion of relatively older groundwater recharged at higher elevations that had traveled along relatively long original flow paths fig 6a 6b it is plausible that these intruded waters were transported through newly formed structural deformations which enhanced permeability in the mountain aquifers fujiwara et al 2016 similar groundwater intrusion with younger ages and shorter flow paths has also identified fig 6c rupture systems fujiwara et al 2016 and or surface landslides dang et al 2016 might lead to the enhancement of subsurface permeability coseismic increases in cfc 12 concentrations from surface water contamination is most apparent in and around the suizenji faults in the urban areas and is also found in less urbanized areas in remote locations there is clear evidence of material gas transport from shallow contaminated soil pore waters and or aquifer waters possibly triggered by surface water drawdown along crustal ruptures hosono et al 2019 and soil water release from upper unsaturated zones through preferential pore spaces enhanced by seismic vibrations and or new cracks as confirmed using other tracers including co2 gas nitrate and organic matters hosono and masaki 2020 fig 6b thus the fourth fifth and last scenarios seem to be the major mechanisms to explain the observed isotopic and chemical changes in the studied volcanic mountain aquifer systems 5 conclusions we compared stable isotopic compositions and cfc concentrations from spring water samples collected before and after the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake over the kumamoto aso area in southern japan to better understand the processes and mechanisms of hydrogeological change for volcanic mountain aquifer systems in response to large seismotectonic impacts three major groundwater flow changes were identified fig 6 1 intrusion of new waters from deeper and longer flow paths than the original flows as a result of enhanced permeability in the mountain aquifers 2 addition of new waters from shallower and shorter flow paths as in bypass flow than the original flows owing to enhanced permeability in mountain surface areas including landslides and 3 release of unsaturated soil pore waters shallow groundwaters into deeper aquifers though open crustal ruptures and cracks and or as a result of seismic vibrations this study demonstrated the usefulness of cfc analysis and by extension other age tracers such as sf6 and 85kr in combination with stable isotope ratios to obtain a better understanding of coseismic hydrological changes the proposed coseismic hydrogeological change mechanisms and approaches to identify these changes should be informative for further investigations in other areas especially in young volcanic regions along continental margins and island arcs the results of this study are also useful for understanding the coseismic leaking of surface contamination in residential areas the coseismically enhanced permeability of mountain aquifers is expected to recover over time continuous monitoring of isotopic and age tracers is therefore needed to further identify the rehabilitation process of aquifer systems after a large seismic event declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

elevation and ground temperature a 1 t m lr h k where tm describes the recharge temperature c lr is the local air temperature lapse rate c m 1 and h is the altitude m k is the constant value obtained by substitution of the altitude and representative temperature of kumamoto meteorological station h 38 m to eq a 1 the weighted average annual temperature in terms of monthly precipitation was assigned to tm as the representative temperature value furthermore the selected climatic data used for the weighted average calculation were the long term averaged value referred to as climatic normal values the selection accounts for the fact that there might be a time gap of several decades for the temperature of the recharged year in the long term climate trends the climatic normal values are the averages of observed data over a consecutive period of 30 y and are updated every decade japan meteorological agency 2011 we selected a period with values covered in each sampling period for the 2009 sampling data we used the normal value for 1970 2000 and for the 2019 sampling data we used the 1980 2010 value the annual temperature rose by 0 3 c over these two periods because of global warming in summer when the impact of precipitation was large there was an increase exceeding 0 6 c at the maximum japan meteorological agency 2011 and is reflected in the long term temperature trends the recharge temperature might not always correspond with recharge elevation shifts that were used to reflect these long term temperature trends appendix b supplementary data supplementary data to

5714,high arsenic as groundwater has posed a serious threat to human health due to the complex spatial temporal distributions of dissolved as the influence of groundwater extraction on as enrichment has attracted great attention to ascertain spatial temporal variations in dissolved as and driving mechanisms impacted by extraction we monitored groundwater levels and chemicals in different aquifers in the western hetao basin china results revealed that groundwater levels decreased during irrigation season in both shallow 40 m below land surface bls and deep 42 m bls aquifers and the decreases in deep aquifer were more evident during irrigation the estimated proportion of recharge from shallow groundwater to affected deep groundwater around 45 m bls increased from 21 to 53 in the distal of the alluvial fan and sharply from 53 to 86 in the flat plain in the distal of the alluvial fan the vertical recharge of shallow groundwater with low as concentrations 10 μg l directly decreased dissolved as concentrations in deep groundwater and the introduced oxygen containing groundwater promoted as fixation in the flat plain as concentrations of affected deep groundwater increased by around 80 during irrigation which may result from the direct introduction of dissolved as labile organic matter and high na ca0 5 molar ratio from shallow groundwater the latter two promoted as release by enhanced dissimilatory reduction of fe oxyhydroxides and as desorption respectively the two year monitoring data of conservative tracers and dissolved as concentrations in irrigation wells also validated the hypothesis this study highlights the different variation patterns of deep groundwater as concentration impacted by extraction in different hydrogeological units and provides an insight into mechanisms of as variations impacted by anthropogenic activity keywords dynamic desorption dissolved organic matter fixation mobilization water level 1 introduction high arsenic as groundwater has been found worldwide smedley and kinniburgh 2002 harvey et al 2002 fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 arsenic desorption and reductive dissolution of its host minerals such as fe oxides have emerged as the leading mechanisms for the release of as into groundwater islam et al 2004 masue et al 2007 postma et al 2012 guo et al 2013 bhattacharya et al 2014 those processes depend on the quality and quantity of available organic matter polizzotto et al 2008 mladenov et al 2009 lawson et al 2016 eiche et al 2017 local geomorphologic characteristics postma et al 2016 stahl et al 2016 and anthropogenic activities harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 radloff et al 2011 lawson et al 2013 desbarats et al 2014 schaefer et al 2016 2017 knappett et al 2016 harvey et al 2002 2006 showed that fresh organic matter was introduced into aquifers due to irrigation pumping and mobilized geogenic as in bangladesh as electron donor for microbially induced reduction of as bearing fe oxides neumann et al 2014 believed that the physical disturbance of excessive pumping destabilized the mineral associated sedimentary organic matter and the latter contributed to as release excessive extraction of deep groundwater caused subsequent drawdown of as rich shallow groundwater into deep aquifers in the bengal basin burgess et al 2010 khan et al 2016 however in the jianghan plain pumping drew oxygen rich surface water into anoxic aquifers which promoted a transient drop in as concentrations schaefer et al 2016 overall the changes in local groundwater flow patterns cause diverse temporal variations in as concentrations in aquifers from river deltas but more is required to reveal mechanisms of as variations impacted by extraction furthermore in inland basins with different climatic conditions and geochemical characteristics from river deltas the response of as behavior to the extraction is still a matter of speculation and certainly needs further investigations the hetao basin is a typical sediment filled inland basin in the northwest china with groundwater as concentrations between 0 33 and 857 μg l guo et al 2008a previous studies have focused on as concentrations and geochemical processes jia et al 2014 guo et al 2012 dissolved as was believed to originate from exchangeable as and fe mn oxide binding as in the aquifer sediments which was confirmed by a microcosm study guo et al 2008b and isotopic evidences guo et al 2013 guo et al 2016b zhang et al 2013 showed that high as was usually related to low hydraulic gradients however little is known about the impacts of extraction on as behavior in the groundwater irrigated area of the hetao basin therefore the basin is the best area to reveal mechanisms of as variations for developing effective strategies for sustainable usage of low as groundwater in as affected areas of the northwest china the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate temporal variations of groundwater levels in different aquifers 2 assess the impacts of extraction on water chemistry and as concentrations and 3 evaluate mechanisms of dissolved as variations induced by extraction 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the hetao basin a sw to ne tilting flat plain lies in the western fringe of inner mongolia boarded by the langshan mountains to the north and by the yellow river to the south fig 1 a and b the climate is semi arid to arid with average annual precipitation of 130 220 mm mainly during july to september and annual evaporation rates of about 2000 2500 mm guo et al 2008a the study area of about 18 km2 lies to the north of the main drainage channel in the western hetao basin and mainly consists of alluvial fans and a flat plain in the alluvial fans aquifers comprise coarse sand gravel sand and sand while in the flat plain aquifers are mainly composed of shallow alluvial lacustrine alluvial pluvial fine sand silty sand and muddy clay with few interlayers of peat fig 2 from the alluvial fans to the flat plain the aquifer types vary from unconfined to leaky confined the groundwater depths generally decrease from around 20 m below land surface bls in the alluvial fans to around 2 0 m bls in the flat plain groundwater is mainly recharged through fractures along the mountain front in the alluvial fans and vertical infiltration of precipitation ditch water irrigation channels and irrigation water in the flat plain and discharged mainly via evapotranspiration drainage and extraction for at least 50 years the diverted yellow river water has predominately been used for agricultural irrigation in the basin guo et al 2011 since it is unavailable near the mountains due to the high elevation 1038 m above mean sea level amsl and overuse of the water in the upstream of the irrigation channels deep groundwater 42 m bls has recently been extracted for both irrigation and drinking in the study area from more than 5000 wells guo et al 2016a irrigation mainly occurs in spring from mid april to early september owing to the gentle hydraulic gradient and fine grained aquifers extremely low flow rates of groundwater make water levels vulnerable to the extraction according to six year monitoring data of groundwater levels the study area is divided into two zones zone i is located in the distal of the alluvial fan where the groundwater flows from northwest to southeast and zone ii is located in the flat plain where the flow is from southeast to northwest fig 1c zhang et al 2018 2 2 well construction two deep boreholes were drilled with depths around 80 m bls in zone i and zone ii b1 and b2 respectively in july 2015 using a rotary drill method fig 1c multilevel wells were then installed in the boreholes by using a high density polyethylene hdpe pipe with seven isolated partitions fig 1d and used to take groundwater samples at different depths table s1 the screened interval of each sampler was around 1 0 m clay balls were backfilled at the top and the bottom of the quartz sand around each sampler to minimize groundwater recharge from other layers after the installation pumping lasted more than 20 min in each sampler until clear groundwater was obtained 2 3 sediment sampling and analysis aquifer sediment samples were collected during borehole drilling the sampling interval was around 1 0 m and additional samples were taken near lithological boundaries seventy nine samples were taken from borehole b1 and seventy three samples from borehole b2 for chemical characterization immediately collected from the boreholes sediment samples were wrapped tightly with tinfoil sealed in sterile plastic bags filled with pure n2 99 999 and kept at 20 after transported to laboratory they were frozen at 80 before analysis in the laboratory the difference in diffuse spectral reflectance between 530 nm and 520 nm r530 520 as an indicator of the degree of reduction of fe oxyhydroxides horneman et al 2004 was measured with a spectrocolorimeter cm 700d konica minolta after being freeze dried disaggregated and milled sediment samples were measured by energy dispersive x ray fluorescence xrf xl3t800 niton to determine as fe and mn contents two certified reference standards gbw07303 and gbw07305 were used to assure the quality of xrf data showing the accuracies within 10 in addition toc analyzer multi n c 2100 s analytikjena was used to determine sedimentary organic carbon soc prior to analysis sediments were treated with 0 5 m hcl to remove inorganic carbon brodie et al 2011 2 4 groundwater level monitoring water levels of fourteen piezometers for two multilevel wells b1 and b2 and eight irrigation wells iw1 to iw8 fig 1c were measured with an electronic water sensor model 101b solinst in april may august and october 2016 and april 2017 four irrigation wells iw1 iw2 iw3 and iw4 are located near b1 with depths between 60 and 100 m bls while other four iw5 iw6 iw7 and iw8 are near b2 with depths between 70 and 85 m bls these irrigation wells usually had long screen lengths 60 70 m the elevations of well heads were measured with a real time kinematic difference global positioning system rtk gps and then used to calibrate water levels to elevations above mean sea level amsl 2 5 water sampling and analysis from april 2016 to november 2017 238 groundwater samples were collected from multilevel wells b1 and b2with a double valve pump model 408 solinst fig 1c seventeen sampling campaigns were carried out six times during non irrigation season and eleven times during irrigation seasons for each multilevel well in addition ten sampling campaigns including four times during non irrigation seasons and six times during irrigation seasons were conducted to take groundwater samples from the irrigation wells fig 1c surface waters including spring water and lake water were sampled in june 2016 fig 1c groundwater samples were taken after pumping for around 20 min until water temperature ph orp oxidation reduction potential and electrical conductivity ec were stabilized a multiparameter portable meter hi 9828 hanna was used to monitor these parameters through an in line flow cell under minimal atmospheric contact after calibrated using standard solutions dissolved oxygen do was measured with a portable dissolved oxygen analyzer ldotm hach all samples were filtered in the field through 0 22 μm membrane filters water samples for major cation and trace element analysis were acidified with ultrapure 6 m hno3 at ph 2 those for analysis of as species were preserved with 0 25 m edta in amber glass bottles samples for anion analysis were taken without being acidified dissolved organic carbon doc samples were collected in 40 ml amber glass bottles and acidified with h3po4 at ph 2 all samples were kept at

and alkalinity using a model 16900 digital titrator hach in the laboratory concentrations of major cations and trace elements were determined using icp aes and icp ms respectively with an analytical precision of 3 0 the detection limit for as was 0 01 μg l arsenic species in groundwater samples were analyzed with hplc hg afs with the detection limits of 2 μg l for as iii and 4 μg l for as v unacidified aliquots were analyzed for major anions with ion chromatography dx 120 dionex with an analytical precision less than 5 0 for most samples ion charge imbalances were less than 5 a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer was used to determine doc concentrations furthermore doc samples taken from the two multilevel wells in 2017 were analyzed for fluorescence spectroscopy measurements with a fluoromax

substances hs mcknight et al 2001 3 results 3 1 surface water chemistry the spring water in the piedmont was of ca hco3 so4 type while the shahai lake water was of na cl so4 type higher orp and do concentration were observed in the spring water than in the lake water showing that the former was under a more oxic environment table 1 generally the lake water had greater doc and fi values than the spring water which indicates that the former was enriched in bioavailable dissolved organic matter dom tds of the lake water was more than twice that of the spring water in addition as concentrations in surface waters were less than 10 μg l and fe2 and nh4 concentrations were below the detection limit table s1 3 2 aquifer architectures and sediment geochemistry the sediments ranged in texture from coarse sand to clay in borehole b1 and from medium sand to clay in borehole b2 the sediments of b1 were mainly composed of sandy clay and silt in the upper 10 m sand from 10 to 41 m clay between 41 and 43 m and sand from 44 to 80 m bls fig 3 a the sediments of b2 contained interbedded clay and silt above 40 m clay between 40 and 42 m and sand at depths of 42 80 m bls mostly fine sand fig 3d these lithology features were similar to other boreholes in the western hetao basin shen et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 an aquitard of around 2 m thick was widely present at a depth around 40 m bls and thus the aquifers were divided into two sub aquifers shallow aquifer above 40 m bls and deep aquifer below 42 m bls which host shallow and deep groundwater respectively arsenic contents ranged from 5 3 to 34 1 μg g with a median of 11 1 μg g in b1 sediments and from 4 6 to 33 1 μg g with a median of 10 4 μg g in b2 sediments for b1 as contents were higher at depths of 0 10 m bls median 17 4 μg g 40 48 m bls median 23 6 μg g and 70 80 m bls median 12 9 μg g fig 3a where clay and or silty sand were observed similar distributions were observed in b2 fig 3d bulk fe contents varied from 9 9 to 60 3 mg g median 22 3 mg g in b1 and from 8 9 to 57 5 mg g median 19 1 mg g in b2 good correlations between as and fe contents were observed r 0 89 for b1 and 0 92 for b2 p 0 01 fig 3b and e indicating that sediment as was mainly associated with fe oxides although the median of soc content in b1 1 9 mg g from 0 5 to10 0 mg g was twice as high as that in b2 0 9 mg g from 0 4 to 5 0 mg g its distributions along the depth were similar good correlations were observed between as and soc in sediments from both boreholes r 0 89 for b1 and 0 92 for b2 p 0 01 fig 3c and f in addition r530 520 were larger in shallow sediments 40 m bls than in deep sediments 42 m bls from both b1 and b2 r530 520 in b1 sediments were generally higher than those in b2 sediments fig 3 indicating higher contents of fe iii oxides in b1 sediments 3 3 variations in groundwater levels water levels in irrigation wells showed an obvious decline during irrigation fig 4 a from april to august 2016 levels in the four irrigation wells of zone i averagely declined from 1028 4 to 1025 1 m amsl while those of zone ii declined from 1030 3 to 1026 4 m amsl the drop of water level in zone ii 3 9 m was greater than that in zone i 3 3 m relative to april 2016 the levels in the irrigation wells of zone i in april 2017 averagely dropped by 0 4 m and in zone ii kept relatively unchanged fig 4a it seemed that precipitation had limited effect on variations in groundwater levels according to the local meteorological department precipitation in 2016 2017 mainly occurred between july and september with a maximum of 46 mm in august fig 4a during irrigation water levels of multilevel well b1 evidently declined the drawdowns in shallow groundwater at depths of 15 16 m bls b1 1 23 24 m bls b1 2 and 38 39 m bls b1 3 were about 4 0 m lower than those 5 0 m in deep groundwater at depths of 46 47 m bls b1 4 56 57 m bls b1 5 63 64 m bls b1 6 and 75 76 m bls b1 7 table s1 fig 4b as the irrigation ceased the water levels gradually recovered within two months until the beginning of the next irrigation season the water levels of seven piezometers were still 0 5 m lower than the original values fig 4b for multilevel well b2 during irrigation in 2016 the drawdowns in shallow groundwater at depths of 15 16 m bls b2 1 20 21 m bls b2 2 and 27 28 m bls b2 3 were around 4 0 m lower than those in deep groundwater at depths of 42 43 m bls b2 4 5 0 m 54 55 m bls b2 5 8 5 m and 66 67 m bls b2 6 5 0 m table s1 fig 4c deep groundwater levels decreased more evidently the drawdowns 5 0 m relative to shallow groundwater levels after the cease of the extraction the water levels generally increased to the original ones at the beginning of the next irrigation season fig 4c 3 4 spatiotemporal variations in groundwater major ions 3 4 1 zone i in zone i shallow groundwater from piezometers b1 1 b1 2 and b1 3 was mainly of na hco3 so4 type during non irrigation season and of na so4 hco3 type during irrigation season fig s1a and b groundwater from piezometer b1 4 was mainly of ca na hco3 type during non irrigation and of ca na so4 hco3 during irrigation which would be affected by shallow groundwater groundwater from piezometers b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 was mainly of ca na hco3 type during both non irrigation and irrigation seasons from non irrigation to irrigation season median tds of shallow groundwater decreased from 480 to 460 mg l fig 5 a but median tds of b1 4 increased from 307 to 380 mg l table s2 there were no temporal variations in tds of b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 table s2 boron as a conservative tracer witnessed a slight increase in b1 4 from non irrigation season median 105 μg l to irrigation season median 113 μg l indicating that the b1 4 might be recharged from shallow groundwater with higher b concentrations mostly 100 μg l during irrigation season fig 5c variations in tds cl and b of irrigation wells in zone i were similar to b1 4 fig s2 tds cl and b slightly increased during irrigation declined to the initial value during non irrigation and slightly increased again in the next irrigation season 3 4 2 zone ii in zone ii shallow groundwater from piezometers b2 1 b2 2 and b2 3 was mainly of na cl so4 type and groundwater of piezometers b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 of na cl hco3 in both non irrigation and irrigation seasons fig s1c and d however from non irrigation season to irrigation season water from piezometer b2 4 changed from na cl hco3 to na cl so4 type shallow groundwater tds during irrigation had a median of 2016 mg l slightly higher than that during non irrigation 1976 mg l no obvious seasonal changes were observed in tds of b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 table s2 however in b2 4 the median tds 2357 mg l during irrigation season was as twice as that during non irrigation season 1253 mg l from non irrigtaion season to irrigation season the median cl concentrations of b2 4 increased from 543 to 670 mg l fig 5e and a noteworthy increase was observed in median b concentrations from 200 to 421 μg l fig 5f additionally average tds cl and b of irrigation wells in the irrigation season were about 2 3 times those of non irrigation season in both 2016 and 2017 fig s2 3 5 spatiotemporal variations in dissolved as and redox sensitive components 3 5 1 zone i vertically total as in multilevel well b1 ranged between 3 0 and 37 7 μg l median 13 9 μg l showing an increasing trend with depth fig 6 a table s3 around 87 of deep groundwater samples exceeded the world health organization provisional guide value 10 μg l who 2011 arsenic v was the dominant as species in shallow groundwater while as iii prevailed in deep one groundwater generally contained low concentrations of fe2 and nh4 with ranges from 0 02 to 0 63 mg l and 0 01 to 0 66 mg l respectively table s3 dissolved fe2 and nh4 generally increased with depth with medians of 0 04 and 0 10 mg l in shallow groundwater 0 10 and 0 36 mg l in b1 4 and 0 12 and 0 44 mg l in deep groundwater respectively fig 6b and c orp and dissolved organic carbon doc showed decreasing trends with depth fig s3a and b from non irrigation to irrigation season median as concentrations decreased from 8 9 to 6 7 μg l in shallow groundwater from 17 9 to 10 7 μg l in b1 4 and from 31 8 to 27 5 μg l in groundwater from b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 table s3 concentrations of fe2 and nh4 showed similar temporal variations to dissolved as fig 6 median fe2 and nh4 concentrations declined from 0 06 to 0 02 and 0 12 to 0 09 mg l in shallow groundwater from 0 19 to 0 02 and 0 35 to 0 28 mg l in b1 4 and from 0 19 to 0 05 and 0 38 to 0 33 mg l in groundwater from b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 respectively fig 6b and c however orp and doc showed opposite variations to dissolved as median orp increased from 53 0 to 11 2 mv in in shallow groundwater from 78 3 to 17 2 mv in b1 4 and from 99 1 to 57 9 mv in groundwater from b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 fig s3a doc concentrations in shallow groundwater increased from non irrigation season median 2 0 mg l to irrigation season median 2 3 mg l fig s3b moreover do increased from 8 2 to 8 7 mg l in b1 1 1 5 to 2 5 mg l in b1 2 0 9 to 2 2 mg l in b1 3 and 0 7 to 1 8 mg l in b1 4 fig 7 a no big seasonal variations in fi were observed in b1 fig 7b average as concentration of the four irrigation wells in zone i were around 25 μg l and presented slight temporal variations fig s4a they had a decreasing trend from the early stage to the middle stage of irrigation season and increased to the initial value after the irrigation ceased variations in dissolved fe2 and nh4 concentrations showed similar trends to dissolved as fig s4b and c 3 5 2 zone ii relatively higher as concentrations were found in zone ii from 8 8 to 176 μg l median 57 3 μg l fig 6d than in zone i dissolved as concentrations decreased with depth in zone ii showing an opposite variation to that from zone i the highest as concentration was observed in b2 1 b2 2 and b2 3 with a range of 59 8 to 176 μg l as iii accounted for 16 100 of total as average 80 dissolved fe2 and nh4 were generally higher than these of zone i with ranges from 0 02 to 4 mg l and 0 01 to 4 mg l respectively table s3 they generally presented decreasing trends with depth fig 6e and f relative to zone i lower orp values were observed in multilevel well b2 ranging from 77 7 to 262 mv median 115 mv and there was a decreasing trend in orp along the depth fig s3c median doc in b2 4 was 2 9 mg l being slightly higher than those in other piezometers fig s3d in addition do declined sharply with depth fig 7a groundwater fi increased first at shallow depths and then decreased at deep depths fig 7b although there were no distinct temporal variations in as concentrations in shallow groundwater increasing trends were observed in the deep one from non irrigation to irrigation season median as concentration increased from 30 9 to 57 4 μg l in b2 4 and from 22 8 to 32 0 μg l in groundwater from b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 decreasing trends in fe2 concentration occurred in b2 1 median from 1 25 to 0 24 mg l and b2 2 median from 0 54 to 0 38 mg l while an increasing trend was observed in b2 3 median from 1 73 to 2 46 mg l fig 6e especially fe2 concentration in b2 4 significantly increased with medians from 0 60 to 0 95 mg l no obvious temporal variations in fe2 concentration were found in groundwater from b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 nh4 concentrations showed similar temporal variations to fe2 concentrations fig 6f no obvious variation was observed about in orp fig s3c moreover median doc increased from 2 0 to 2 6 mg l in shallow groundwater from 2 6 to 3 1 mg l in b2 4 from 2 0 to 2 5 mg l in groundwater from b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 from non irrigation to irrigation season fig s3d there was no seasonal variation in do concentration fig 7a fi values in b2 1 b2 2 b2 3 and b2 4 were obviously higher in irrigation season than those non irrigation season fig 7b being consistent with the observation of multilevel wells high as concentrations were also observed in the four irrigation wells near the multilevel well b2 within two years as concentrations during irrigation season were slightly higher than those during non irrigation season fig s4a in comparison with as concentration temporal variations in fe2 and nh4 concentrations were more evident and they were much higher during irrigation season fig s4b and c 4 discussion 4 1 arsenic release a negative correlation r 0 40 p 0 01 was observed between as concentration and orp fig 8 a showing that as mobilization generally occurred in reducing conditions in the study area a significantly positive correlation was found between as and fe2 r 0 82 p 0 01 fig 8d indicating that the reductive dissolution of fe oxide minerals was one of the causes of as enrichment in groundwater the positive correlation between as and fe in sediments supported this fact fig 3c and e this is consistent with previous investigations guo et al 2013 fendorf et al 2010 showing as release during reductive dissolution of fe oxides nh4 as an indicator of dom degradation postma et al 2012 had a positive correlation with dissolved as r 0 69 p 0 01 fig 8c the positive correlation indicates that microbial oxidation of dom coupled with reductive dissolution of fe oxides promoted the release of as which was supported by the higher bioreactivity of organic matter in the high as groundwater system guo et al 2019 in addition as desorption led to as mobilization in aquifers there was a positive correlation between as concentration and ph r 0 31 p 0 01 fig 8e indicating that the increase in ph caused desorption of as adsorbed on the surface of fe oxide minerals which has been proved in both laboratory experiments and field observation smedley and kinniburgh 2002 podgorski et al 2017 another factor inducing as desorption was the counter ion effect showing that as sorption on fe oxides drastically decreases in near neutral to alkaline water via replacement of bivalent ca2 by monovalent na masue et al 2007 a positive correlation between as and na ca0 5 r 0 52 p 0 01 fig 8f was observed indicating the contribution of counter ion effect to as mobilization this is in line with the observation by raychowdhury et al 2014 showing that the transition of the ca rich water to na rich water leads to counter ion effects and hence as mobilization in the chaco pampean plain of the andean foreland argentina 4 2 arsenic immobilization in deep groundwater from zone i during extraction 4 2 1 vertical recharge of shallow groundwater into deep aquifers the discontinuity of the thin aquitard only 1 2 m in thickness between shallow and deep aquifers fig 2 inner mongolia institute of hydrogeology 1982 provides the possibility of vertical recharge of shallow groundwater into deep aquifer due to higher water levels in shallow aquifers during irrigation season fig 4b after irrigation ceased water levels increased and water levels in deep aquifers recovered more quickly fig 4b the rapid recharge around the well and from the piedmont deep aquifers into deep groundwater could explain this phenomenon vertical recharge of shallow groundwater into neighboring deep aquifers was also evidenced by the increases in tds cl and b in b1 4 during irrigation fig 5a b and c due to the shift in water type from ca na hco3 to ca na so4 hco3 and increases in tds cl and b during irrigation the section 3 4 1 piezometer b1 4 was assumed to be the affected deep groundwater adg however water type and tds cl and b concentrations in piezometers b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 remained unchanged and therefore they were regarded as potentially affected deep groundwater padg since cl and b as two conservative tracers singh et al 2014 were generally constant in padg it was considered as one end member for the mixing model piezometer b1 3 adjacent to b1 4 was regarded as the other end member to determine the recharge percentage of shallow groundwater into adg eqs 1 and 2 1 p 1 b e 2 c l c l e 2 b b e 2 c l e 1 c l e 2 b e 1 2 p 2 b e 1 c l c l e 1 b b e 1 c l e 2 c l e 1 b e 2 where p1 and p2 are the estimated recharge percentages from the end member b1 3 and the end member padg respectively c l and b are c l and b concentrations of adg respectively c l e 1 and b e 1 are c l and b concentrations of the end member b1 3 respectively c l e 2 and b e 2 are c l and b concentrations of the end member padg respectively based on the calculation we found that from non irrigation to irrigation season the average recharge percentage of shallow groundwater to adg increased from 21 range 0 25 to 53 range 27 72 fig 9 a indicating that extraction greatly increased the vertical recharge of shallow groundwater this observation was consistent with the studies in florida where the extensive pumping resulted in the mixing of shallow and deep groundwater pichler et al 2017 4 2 2 arsenic immobilization arsenic concentrations in well b1 showed decreasing trends from non irrigation to irrigation season the most evident decrease occurred in adg with median as concentration decreasing from 17 9 to 10 7 μg l by 40 fig 9b during irrigation the intense extraction 18 million m3 y data from local residents induced an increasing downward recharge of shallow groundwater with low as concentrations into deep aquifer and thus as concentration in adg was diluted according to the calculated recharge percentages of shallow and deep groundwater in adg as mentioned in the section 4 2 1 as concentrations of adg in both non irrigation and irrigation seasons were estimated by using eq 3 only considering the mixture of the two end members 3 as a s e 1 p 1 a s e 2 p 2 where as is estimated as concentration in adg μg l a s e 1 and a s e 2 μg l are as concentrations in the end member b1 3 and the end member padg respectively p1 and p2 are the recharge percentages from b1 3 and padg estimated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively the estimated as concentration of adg was 25 3 μg l during non irrigation and 18 0 μg l during irrigation with a decrease of 29 fig 9b the observed decrease 40 was more obvious than the estimated decrease 29 which might be the result of fe2 oxidation and as sequestration by fe oxides smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2014 furthermore the observed as concentrations were generally lower than estimated ones fig 9b it indicates that dissolved as would be partly adsorbed during vertical infiltration from shallow into deep aquifer this result was consistent with studies by van geen et al 2013 and mai et al 2014 showing that as contamination in deep aquifer as a consequence of vertical recharge was delayed by the retardation of as transport in southeast asia spatial temporal variations in do and fe2 supported fe2 oxidation and as sequestration in adg do concentrations in shallow groundwater median 2 23 mg l were higher than those in deep one median 0 77 mg l fig 7a but fe2 and nh4 were lower in shallow groundwater fig 6b and c the introduction of oxygen rich groundwater oxidized fe2 and led to the formation of fe oxides and thus dissolved as was scavenged into fe oxides masue et al 2007 mai et al 2014 schaefer et al 2017 the increasing do and orp as well as the decreasing fe2 and nh4 also explained the more evident decrease in observed as concentration of adg from non irrigation season to irrigation season relative to the estimated decrease fig 9b 4 3 vulnerability of deep groundwater to as contamination in zone ii 4 3 1 vertical recharge of shallow high as groundwater similar to zone i the water level differences and the discontinuity of the thin aquitard allowed vertical infiltration of shallow groundwater in zone ii fig 4b temporal variations in tds cl and b in deep groundwater also supported the aforementioned fact fig 4d e and f similar to the explanations in the section 4 2 1 piezometer b2 4 was assumed to be adg while piezometers b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 were regarded as padg piezometer b2 3 and padg were considered as two end members with cl and b as two conservative tracers to estimate the recharge percentages of shallow groundwater and padg into b2 4 adg as shown in eqs 1 and 2 calculation showed that during non irrigation the b2 4 adg received the similar amount of recharge from shallow groundwater average 53 range 27 63 and padg average 47 range 37 73 however during irrigation the recharge average 86 range 71 97 from shallow groundwater predominated fig 9c this shift clearly evidenced that extraction greatly induced an increasing recharge of shallow groundwater into b2 4 adg 4 3 2 vulnerability of deep groundwater the recharge of shallow high as groundwater carried dissolved as into deep aquifer according to the recharge percentages of the shallow and deep groundwater in adg calculated by eqs 1 and 2 as concentrations of adg can be estimated by eq 3 only considering the mixture of the two end members the estimated as concentrations of adg were 67 7 μg l in non irrigation season and 92 1 μg l in irrigation season fig 9d similar to zone i the observed as concentrations of adg were lower than the estimated values in both irrigation and non irrigation seasons it indicates that as adsorption onto sediments occurred during the downward migration of shallow high as groundwater however deep groundwater is quite vulnerable to as contamination by shallow one from non irrigation season to irrigation season the observed increase 80 was significantly greater than the estimated increase 36 in as concentrations of adg fig 9d therefore in addition to the direct introduction of dissolved as other processes would be attributed to the increase in as concentration in adg during the vertical recharge of shallow groundwater labile dom was introduced into the adg which was verified by the increase in fi of adg fig 7b the introduced labile dom was ready to fuel dissimilatory reduction of fe oxyhydroxides neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 which was supported by the obvious increases in fe2 and nh4 concentrations in adg fig 6e and f in addition the counter ion effect was another cause of as mobilization as discussed above during irrigation the increase in na ca0 5 in adg induced by the recharge from the high na ca0 5 shallow groundwater promoted mobilization of adsorbed as fig 10 slight increases in as concentrations of padg from non irrigation season to irrigation season indicate that the vertical recharge induced by intensive extraction elevated as concentrations which deteriorated water quality in deep aquifers thus much concern should be paid on extraction in order to sustainably use deep low as groundwater 4 4 implication for sustainable usage of deep groundwater in the four irrigation wells from zone i the calculated leakage recharge of shallow groundwater to deep aquifer showed an increasing trend from the early stage april to the middle stage may july of irrigation season fig s5a since low dissolved as generally occurred in shallow aquifer as concentration of extracted water decreased with the increase in the leakage recharge of shallow groundwater fig s4a although the vertical recharge reduced the deep groundwater as concentrations the intensive extraction negatively affected the sustainable usage of groundwater in zone i water levels did not recover the initial value after the irrigation season fig 4a and b implicating that extraction broke the state of groundwater dynamic equilibrium with a loss of aquifer storage erban et al 2013 additionally over extraction led to the migration of the depression cone toward the alluvial fans zhang et al 2018 and intrusion of the high as groundwater from zone ii would potentially threaten the low as groundwater in zone i mixing calculation showed that the extracted water from the irrigation wells of zone ii was mainly from the deep aquifer during non irrigation and in the early stage of irrigation and came from both deep and shallow aquifers fig s5b during irrigation due to the recharge of shallow high as groundwater the average observed as concentrations of extracted water increased from non irrigation season to irrigation season fig s4a although these temporal variations were not obvious probably because dissolved as was retarded on discontinuously clay layers and aquifer sediments during the downward migration of shallow high as groundwater van geen et al 2013 extraction must be optimized in order to minimize the intrusion of shallow high as groundwater 5 conclusions excessive extraction groundwater led to the drastic declines in water levels and temporal variations in dissolved as and other chemicals in the hetao basin the greater decreases in deep groundwater levels were observed than those in shallow ones which induced the greater hydraulic gradients between shallow and deep aquifers especially in b2 the as variation patterns and their controlling processes were different in the distal of the alluvial fan and the flat plain groundwater extraction obviously decreased concentrations of as nh4 and fe2 in adg around 45 m bls in the distal of the alluvial fan zone i but increased their concentrations in adg in the flat plain zone ii no evident variations in concentrations of chemical compositions were observed in padg at depths 50 to 80 m bls from non irrigation to irrigation season the estimated proportion of recharge from shallow groundwater to the adg increased from 21 to 53 in zone i while it increased sharply from 53 to 86 in zone ii in zone i the more evident decreases in the observed as concentration than the estimated as concentration in adg during irrigation resulted from the introduction of dissolved oxygen fe2 oxidation and as immobilization by fe iii oxides in addition to the increasing recharge from shallow low as groundwater however in zone ii the observed increases in dissolved as in adg were significantly greater than the estimated increases during irrigation which were possibly caused by the enhanced as mobilization via both dissimilatory reduction of fe oxides fueled by the introduced labile organic matter and the counter ion effect of the increase in na ca0 5 molar ratio although this study revealed temporal variations in groundwater levels and as concentrations in different aquifers during two irrigation seasons it is still unknown the long term trends in groundwater levels and as concentrations impacted by extraction therefore long term monitoring is required to better understand the system credit authorship

5714,high arsenic as groundwater has posed a serious threat to human health due to the complex spatial temporal distributions of dissolved as the influence of groundwater extraction on as enrichment has attracted great attention to ascertain spatial temporal variations in dissolved as and driving mechanisms impacted by extraction we monitored groundwater levels and chemicals in different aquifers in the western hetao basin china results revealed that groundwater levels decreased during irrigation season in both shallow 40 m below land surface bls and deep 42 m bls aquifers and the decreases in deep aquifer were more evident during irrigation the estimated proportion of recharge from shallow groundwater to affected deep groundwater around 45 m bls increased from 21 to 53 in the distal of the alluvial fan and sharply from 53 to 86 in the flat plain in the distal of the alluvial fan the vertical recharge of shallow groundwater with low as concentrations 10 μg l directly decreased dissolved as concentrations in deep groundwater and the introduced oxygen containing groundwater promoted as fixation in the flat plain as concentrations of affected deep groundwater increased by around 80 during irrigation which may result from the direct introduction of dissolved as labile organic matter and high na ca0 5 molar ratio from shallow groundwater the latter two promoted as release by enhanced dissimilatory reduction of fe oxyhydroxides and as desorption respectively the two year monitoring data of conservative tracers and dissolved as concentrations in irrigation wells also validated the hypothesis this study highlights the different variation patterns of deep groundwater as concentration impacted by extraction in different hydrogeological units and provides an insight into mechanisms of as variations impacted by anthropogenic activity keywords dynamic desorption dissolved organic matter fixation mobilization water level 1 introduction high arsenic as groundwater has been found worldwide smedley and kinniburgh 2002 harvey et al 2002 fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 arsenic desorption and reductive dissolution of its host minerals such as fe oxides have emerged as the leading mechanisms for the release of as into groundwater islam et al 2004 masue et al 2007 postma et al 2012 guo et al 2013 bhattacharya et al 2014 those processes depend on the quality and quantity of available organic matter polizzotto et al 2008 mladenov et al 2009 lawson et al 2016 eiche et al 2017 local geomorphologic characteristics postma et al 2016 stahl et al 2016 and anthropogenic activities harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 radloff et al 2011 lawson et al 2013 desbarats et al 2014 schaefer et al 2016 2017 knappett et al 2016 harvey et al 2002 2006 showed that fresh organic matter was introduced into aquifers due to irrigation pumping and mobilized geogenic as in bangladesh as electron donor for microbially induced reduction of as bearing fe oxides neumann et al 2014 believed that the physical disturbance of excessive pumping destabilized the mineral associated sedimentary organic matter and the latter contributed to as release excessive extraction of deep groundwater caused subsequent drawdown of as rich shallow groundwater into deep aquifers in the bengal basin burgess et al 2010 khan et al 2016 however in the jianghan plain pumping drew oxygen rich surface water into anoxic aquifers which promoted a transient drop in as concentrations schaefer et al 2016 overall the changes in local groundwater flow patterns cause diverse temporal variations in as concentrations in aquifers from river deltas but more is required to reveal mechanisms of as variations impacted by extraction furthermore in inland basins with different climatic conditions and geochemical characteristics from river deltas the response of as behavior to the extraction is still a matter of speculation and certainly needs further investigations the hetao basin is a typical sediment filled inland basin in the northwest china with groundwater as concentrations between 0 33 and 857 μg l guo et al 2008a previous studies have focused on as concentrations and geochemical processes jia et al 2014 guo et al 2012 dissolved as was believed to originate from exchangeable as and fe mn oxide binding as in the aquifer sediments which was confirmed by a microcosm study guo et al 2008b and isotopic evidences guo et al 2013 guo et al 2016b zhang et al 2013 showed that high as was usually related to low hydraulic gradients however little is known about the impacts of extraction on as behavior in the groundwater irrigated area of the hetao basin therefore the basin is the best area to reveal mechanisms of as variations for developing effective strategies for sustainable usage of low as groundwater in as affected areas of the northwest china the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate temporal variations of groundwater levels in different aquifers 2 assess the impacts of extraction on water chemistry and as concentrations and 3 evaluate mechanisms of dissolved as variations induced by extraction 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the hetao basin a sw to ne tilting flat plain lies in the western fringe of inner mongolia boarded by the langshan mountains to the north and by the yellow river to the south fig 1 a and b the climate is semi arid to arid with average annual precipitation of 130 220 mm mainly during july to september and annual evaporation rates of about 2000 2500 mm guo et al 2008a the study area of about 18 km2 lies to the north of the main drainage channel in the western hetao basin and mainly consists of alluvial fans and a flat plain in the alluvial fans aquifers comprise coarse sand gravel sand and sand while in the flat plain aquifers are mainly composed of shallow alluvial lacustrine alluvial pluvial fine sand silty sand and muddy clay with few interlayers of peat fig 2 from the alluvial fans to the flat plain the aquifer types vary from unconfined to leaky confined the groundwater depths generally decrease from around 20 m below land surface bls in the alluvial fans to around 2 0 m bls in the flat plain groundwater is mainly recharged through fractures along the mountain front in the alluvial fans and vertical infiltration of precipitation ditch water irrigation channels and irrigation water in the flat plain and discharged mainly via evapotranspiration drainage and extraction for at least 50 years the diverted yellow river water has predominately been used for agricultural irrigation in the basin guo et al 2011 since it is unavailable near the mountains due to the high elevation 1038 m above mean sea level amsl and overuse of the water in the upstream of the irrigation channels deep groundwater 42 m bls has recently been extracted for both irrigation and drinking in the study area from more than 5000 wells guo et al 2016a irrigation mainly occurs in spring from mid april to early september owing to the gentle hydraulic gradient and fine grained aquifers extremely low flow rates of groundwater make water levels vulnerable to the extraction according to six year monitoring data of groundwater levels the study area is divided into two zones zone i is located in the distal of the alluvial fan where the groundwater flows from northwest to southeast and zone ii is located in the flat plain where the flow is from southeast to northwest fig 1c zhang et al 2018 2 2 well construction two deep boreholes were drilled with depths around 80 m bls in zone i and zone ii b1 and b2 respectively in july 2015 using a rotary drill method fig 1c multilevel wells were then installed in the boreholes by using a high density polyethylene hdpe pipe with seven isolated partitions fig 1d and used to take groundwater samples at different depths table s1 the screened interval of each sampler was around 1 0 m clay balls were backfilled at the top and the bottom of the quartz sand around each sampler to minimize groundwater recharge from other layers after the installation pumping lasted more than 20 min in each sampler until clear groundwater was obtained 2 3 sediment sampling and analysis aquifer sediment samples were collected during borehole drilling the sampling interval was around 1 0 m and additional samples were taken near lithological boundaries seventy nine samples were taken from borehole b1 and seventy three samples from borehole b2 for chemical characterization immediately collected from the boreholes sediment samples were wrapped tightly with tinfoil sealed in sterile plastic bags filled with pure n2 99 999 and kept at 20 after transported to laboratory they were frozen at 80 before analysis in the laboratory the difference in diffuse spectral reflectance between 530 nm and 520 nm r530 520 as an indicator of the degree of reduction of fe oxyhydroxides horneman et al 2004 was measured with a spectrocolorimeter cm 700d konica minolta after being freeze dried disaggregated and milled sediment samples were measured by energy dispersive x ray fluorescence xrf xl3t800 niton to determine as fe and mn contents two certified reference standards gbw07303 and gbw07305 were used to assure the quality of xrf data showing the accuracies within 10 in addition toc analyzer multi n c 2100 s analytikjena was used to determine sedimentary organic carbon soc prior to analysis sediments were treated with 0 5 m hcl to remove inorganic carbon brodie et al 2011 2 4 groundwater level monitoring water levels of fourteen piezometers for two multilevel wells b1 and b2 and eight irrigation wells iw1 to iw8 fig 1c were measured with an electronic water sensor model 101b solinst in april may august and october 2016 and april 2017 four irrigation wells iw1 iw2 iw3 and iw4 are located near b1 with depths between 60 and 100 m bls while other four iw5 iw6 iw7 and iw8 are near b2 with depths between 70 and 85 m bls these irrigation wells usually had long screen lengths 60 70 m the elevations of well heads were measured with a real time kinematic difference global positioning system rtk gps and then used to calibrate water levels to elevations above mean sea level amsl 2 5 water sampling and analysis from april 2016 to november 2017 238 groundwater samples were collected from multilevel wells b1 and b2with a double valve pump model 408 solinst fig 1c seventeen sampling campaigns were carried out six times during non irrigation season and eleven times during irrigation seasons for each multilevel well in addition ten sampling campaigns including four times during non irrigation seasons and six times during irrigation seasons were conducted to take groundwater samples from the irrigation wells fig 1c surface waters including spring water and lake water were sampled in june 2016 fig 1c groundwater samples were taken after pumping for around 20 min until water temperature ph orp oxidation reduction potential and electrical conductivity ec were stabilized a multiparameter portable meter hi 9828 hanna was used to monitor these parameters through an in line flow cell under minimal atmospheric contact after calibrated using standard solutions dissolved oxygen do was measured with a portable dissolved oxygen analyzer ldotm hach all samples were filtered in the field through 0 22 μm membrane filters water samples for major cation and trace element analysis were acidified with ultrapure 6 m hno3 at ph 2 those for analysis of as species were preserved with 0 25 m edta in amber glass bottles samples for anion analysis were taken without being acidified dissolved organic carbon doc samples were collected in 40 ml amber glass bottles and acidified with h3po4 at ph 2 all samples were kept at

and alkalinity using a model 16900 digital titrator hach in the laboratory concentrations of major cations and trace elements were determined using icp aes and icp ms respectively with an analytical precision of 3 0 the detection limit for as was 0 01 μg l arsenic species in groundwater samples were analyzed with hplc hg afs with the detection limits of 2 μg l for as iii and 4 μg l for as v unacidified aliquots were analyzed for major anions with ion chromatography dx 120 dionex with an analytical precision less than 5 0 for most samples ion charge imbalances were less than 5 a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer was used to determine doc concentrations furthermore doc samples taken from the two multilevel wells in 2017 were analyzed for fluorescence spectroscopy measurements with a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer jobin yvon horiba the fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of the intensity at emission of 450 nm and 500 nm both at 370 nm excitation reflecting the source of humic substances hs mcknight et al 2001 3 results 3 1 surface water chemistry the spring water in the piedmont was of ca hco3 so4 type while the shahai lake water was of na cl so4 type higher orp and do concentration were observed in the spring water than in the lake water showing that the former was under a more oxic environment table 1 generally the lake water had greater doc and fi values than the spring water which indicates that the former was enriched in bioavailable dissolved organic matter dom tds of the lake water was more than twice that of the spring water in addition as concentrations in surface waters were less than 10 μg l and fe2 and nh4 concentrations were below the detection limit table s1 3 2 aquifer architectures and sediment geochemistry the sediments ranged in texture from coarse sand to clay in borehole b1 and from medium sand to clay in borehole b2 the sediments of b1 were mainly composed of sandy clay and silt in the upper 10 m sand from 10 to 41 m clay between 41 and 43 m and sand from 44 to 80 m bls fig 3 a the sediments of b2 contained interbedded clay and silt above 40 m clay between 40 and 42 m and sand at depths of 42 80 m bls mostly fine sand fig 3d these lithology features were similar to other boreholes in the western hetao basin shen et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 an aquitard of around 2 m thick was widely present at a depth around 40 m bls and thus the aquifers were divided into two sub aquifers shallow aquifer above 40 m bls and deep aquifer below 42 m bls which host shallow and deep groundwater respectively arsenic contents ranged from 5 3 to 34 1 μg g with a median of 11 1 μg g in b1 sediments and from 4 6 to 33 1 μg g with a median of 10 4 μg g in b2 sediments for b1 as contents were higher at depths of 0 10 m bls median 17 4 μg g

3 mg g median 22 3 mg g in b1 and from 8 9 to 57 5 mg g median 19 1 mg g in b2 good correlations between as and fe contents were observed r 0 89 for b1 and 0 92 for b2 p 0 01 fig 3b and e indicating that sediment as was mainly associated with fe oxides although the median of soc content in b1 1 9 mg g from 0 5 to10 0 mg g was twice as high as that in b2 0 9 mg g from 0 4 to 5 0 mg g its distributions along the depth were similar good correlations were observed between as and soc in sediments from both boreholes r 0 89 for b1 and 0 92 for b2 p 0 01 fig 3c and f in addition r530 520 were larger in shallow sediments 40 m bls than in deep sediments 42 m bls from both b1 and b2 r530 520 in b1 sediments were generally higher than those in b2 sediments fig 3 indicating higher contents of fe iii oxides in b1 sediments 3 3 variations in groundwater levels water levels in irrigation wells showed an obvious decline during irrigation fig 4 a from april to august 2016 levels in the four irrigation wells of zone i averagely declined from 1028 4 to 1025 1 m amsl while those of zone ii declined from 1030 3 to 1026 4 m amsl the drop of water level in zone ii 3 9 m was greater than that in zone i 3 3 m relative to april 2016 the levels in the irrigation wells of zone i in april 2017 averagely dropped by 0 4 m and in zone ii kept relatively unchanged fig 4a it seemed that precipitation had limited effect on variations in groundwater levels according to the local meteorological department precipitation in 2016 2017 mainly occurred between july and september with a maximum of 46 mm in august fig 4a during irrigation water levels of multilevel well b1 evidently declined the drawdowns in shallow groundwater at depths of 15 16 m bls b1 1 23 24 m bls b1 2 and 38 39 m bls b1 3 were about 4 0 m lower than those 5 0 m in deep groundwater at depths of 46 47 m bls b1 4 56 57 m bls b1 5 63 64 m bls b1 6 and 75 76 m bls b1 7 table s1 fig 4b as the irrigation ceased the water levels gradually recovered within two months until the beginning of the next irrigation season the water levels of seven piezometers were still 0 5 m lower than the original values fig 4b for multilevel well b2 during irrigation in 2016 the drawdowns in shallow groundwater at depths of 15 16 m bls b2 1 20 21 m bls b2 2 and 27 28 m bls b2 3 were around 4 0 m lower than those in deep groundwater at depths of 42 43 m bls b2 4 5 0 m 54 55 m bls b2 5 8 5 m and 66 67 m bls b2 6 5 0 m table s1 fig 4c deep groundwater levels decreased more evidently the drawdowns 5 0 m relative to shallow groundwater levels after the cease of the extraction the water levels generally increased to the original ones at the beginning of the next irrigation season fig 4c 3 4 spatiotemporal variations in groundwater major ions 3 4 1 zone i in zone i shallow groundwater from piezometers b1 1 b1 2 and b1 3 was mainly of na hco3 so4 type during non irrigation season and of na so4 hco3 type during irrigation season fig s1a and b groundwater from piezometer b1 4 was mainly of ca na hco3 type during non irrigation and of ca na so4 hco3 during irrigation which would be affected by shallow groundwater groundwater from piezometers b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 was mainly of ca na hco3 type during both non irrigation and irrigation seasons from non irrigation to irrigation season median tds of shallow groundwater decreased from 480 to 460 mg l fig 5 a but median tds of b1 4 increased from 307 to 380 mg l table s2 there were no temporal variations in tds of b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 table s2 boron as a conservative tracer witnessed a slight increase in b1 4 from non irrigation season median 105 μg l to irrigation season median 113 μg l indicating that the b1 4 might be recharged from shallow groundwater with higher b concentrations mostly 100 μg l during irrigation season fig 5c variations in tds cl and b of irrigation wells in zone i were similar to b1 4 fig s2 tds cl and b slightly increased during irrigation declined to the initial value during non irrigation and slightly increased again in the next irrigation season 3 4 2 zone ii in zone ii shallow groundwater from piezometers b2 1 b2 2 and b2 3 was mainly of na cl so4 type and groundwater of piezometers b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 of na cl hco3 in both non irrigation and irrigation seasons fig s1c and d however from non irrigation season to irrigation season water from piezometer b2 4 changed from na cl hco3 to na cl so4 type shallow groundwater tds during irrigation had a median of 2016 mg l slightly higher than that during non irrigation 1976 mg l no obvious seasonal changes were observed in tds of b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 table s2 however in b2 4 the median tds 2357 mg l during irrigation season was as twice as that during non irrigation season 1253 mg l from non irrigtaion season to irrigation season the median cl concentrations of b2 4 increased from 543 to 670 mg l fig 5e and a noteworthy increase was observed in median b concentrations from 200 to 421 μg l fig 5f additionally average tds cl and b of irrigation wells in the irrigation season were about 2 3 times those of non irrigation season in both 2016 and 2017 fig s2 3 5 spatiotemporal variations in dissolved as and redox sensitive components 3 5 1 zone i vertically total as in multilevel well b1 ranged between 3 0 and 37 7 μg l median 13 9 μg l showing an increasing trend with depth fig 6 a table s3 around 87 of deep groundwater samples exceeded the world health organization provisional guide value 10 μg l who 2011 arsenic v was the dominant as species in shallow groundwater while as iii prevailed in deep one groundwater generally contained low concentrations of fe2 and nh4 with ranges from 0 02 to 0 63 mg l and 0 01 to 0 66 mg l respectively table s3 dissolved fe2 and nh4 generally increased with depth with medians of 0 04 and 0 10 mg l in shallow groundwater 0 10 and 0 36 mg l in b1 4 and 0 12 and 0 44 mg l in deep groundwater respectively fig 6b and c orp and dissolved organic carbon doc showed decreasing trends with depth fig s3a and b from non irrigation to irrigation season median as concentrations decreased from 8 9 to 6 7 μg l in shallow groundwater from 17 9 to 10 7 μg l in b1 4 and from 31 8 to 27 5 μg l in groundwater from b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 table s3 concentrations of fe2 and nh4 showed similar temporal variations to dissolved as fig 6 median fe2 and nh4 concentrations declined from 0 06 to 0 02 and 0 12 to 0 09 mg l in shallow groundwater from 0 19 to 0 02 and 0 35 to 0 28 mg l in b1 4 and from 0 19 to 0 05 and 0 38 to 0 33 mg l in groundwater from b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 respectively fig 6b and c however orp and doc showed opposite variations to dissolved as median orp increased from 53 0 to 11 2 mv in in shallow groundwater from 78 3 to 17 2 mv in b1 4 and from 99 1 to 57 9 mv in groundwater from b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 fig s3a doc concentrations in shallow groundwater increased from non irrigation season median 2 0 mg l to irrigation season median 2 3 mg l fig s3b moreover do increased from 8 2 to 8 7 mg l in b1 1 1 5 to 2 5 mg l in b1 2 0 9 to 2 2 mg l in b1 3 and 0 7 to 1 8 mg l in b1 4 fig 7 a no big seasonal variations in fi were observed in b1 fig 7b average as concentration of the four irrigation wells in zone i were around 25 μg l and presented slight temporal variations fig s4a they had a decreasing trend from the early stage to the middle stage of irrigation season and increased to the initial value after the irrigation ceased variations in dissolved fe2 and nh4 concentrations showed similar trends to dissolved as fig s4b and c 3 5 2 zone ii relatively higher as concentrations were found in zone ii from 8 8 to 176 μg l median 57 3 μg l fig 6d than in zone i dissolved as concentrations decreased with depth in zone ii showing an opposite variation to that from zone i the highest as concentration was observed in b2 1 b2 2 and b2 3 with a range of 59 8 to 176 μg l as iii accounted for 16 100 of total as average 80 dissolved fe2 and nh4 were generally higher than these of zone i with ranges from 0 02 to 4 mg l and 0 01 to 4 mg l respectively table s3 they generally presented decreasing trends with depth fig 6e and f relative to zone i lower orp values were observed in multilevel well b2 ranging from 77 7 to 262 mv median 115 mv and there was a decreasing trend in orp along the depth fig s3c median doc in b2 4 was 2 9 mg l being slightly higher than those in other piezometers fig s3d in addition do declined sharply with depth fig 7a groundwater fi increased first at shallow depths and then decreased at deep depths fig 7b although there were no distinct temporal variations in as concentrations in shallow groundwater increasing trends were observed in the deep one from non irrigation to irrigation season median as concentration increased from 30 9 to 57 4 μg l in b2 4 and from 22 8 to 32 0 μg l in groundwater from b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 decreasing trends in fe2 concentration occurred in b2 1 median from 1 25 to 0 24 mg l and b2 2 median from 0 54 to 0 38 mg l while an increasing trend was observed in b2 3 median from 1 73 to 2 46 mg l fig 6e especially fe2 concentration in b2 4 significantly increased with medians from 0 60 to 0 95 mg l no obvious temporal variations in fe2 concentration were found in groundwater from b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 nh4 concentrations showed similar temporal variations to fe2 concentrations fig 6f no obvious variation was observed about in orp fig s3c moreover median doc increased from 2 0 to 2 6 mg l in shallow groundwater from 2 6 to 3 1 mg l in b2 4 from 2 0 to 2 5 mg l in groundwater from b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 from non irrigation to irrigation season fig s3d there was no seasonal variation in do concentration fig 7a fi values in b2 1 b2 2 b2 3 and b2 4 were obviously higher in irrigation season than those non irrigation season fig 7b being consistent with the observation of multilevel wells high as concentrations were also observed in the four irrigation wells near the multilevel well b2 within two years as concentrations during irrigation season were slightly higher than those during non irrigation season fig s4a in comparison with as concentration temporal variations in fe2 and nh4 concentrations were more evident and they were much higher during irrigation season fig s4b and c 4 discussion 4 1 arsenic release a negative correlation r 0 40 p 0 01 was observed between as concentration and orp fig 8 a showing that as mobilization generally occurred in reducing conditions in the study area a significantly positive correlation was found between as and fe2 r 0 82 p 0 01 fig 8d indicating that the reductive dissolution of fe oxide minerals was one of the causes of as enrichment in groundwater the positive correlation between as and fe in sediments supported this fact fig 3c and e this is consistent with previous investigations guo et al 2013 fendorf et al 2010 showing as release during reductive dissolution of fe oxides nh4 as an indicator of dom degradation postma et al 2012 had a positive correlation with dissolved as r 0 69 p 0 01 fig 8c the positive correlation indicates that microbial oxidation of dom coupled with reductive dissolution of fe oxides promoted the release of as which was supported by the higher bioreactivity of organic matter in the high as groundwater system guo et al 2019 in addition as desorption led to as mobilization in aquifers there was a positive correlation between as concentration and ph r 0 31 p 0 01 fig 8e indicating that the increase in ph caused desorption of as adsorbed on the surface of fe oxide minerals which has been proved in both laboratory experiments and field observation smedley and kinniburgh 2002 podgorski et al 2017 another factor inducing as desorption was the counter ion effect showing that as sorption on fe oxides drastically decreases in near neutral to alkaline water via replacement of bivalent ca2 by monovalent na masue et al 2007 a positive correlation between as and na ca0 5 r 0 52 p 0 01 fig 8f was observed indicating the contribution of counter ion effect to as mobilization this is in line with the observation by raychowdhury et al 2014 showing that the transition of the ca rich water to na rich water leads to counter ion effects and hence as mobilization in the chaco pampean plain of the andean foreland argentina 4 2 arsenic immobilization in deep groundwater from zone i during extraction 4 2 1 vertical recharge of shallow groundwater into deep aquifers the discontinuity of the thin aquitard only 1 2 m in thickness between shallow and deep aquifers fig 2 inner mongolia institute of hydrogeology 1982 provides the possibility of vertical recharge of shallow groundwater into deep aquifer due to higher water levels in shallow aquifers during irrigation season fig 4b after irrigation ceased water levels increased and water levels in deep aquifers recovered more quickly fig 4b the rapid recharge around the well and from the piedmont deep aquifers into deep groundwater could explain this phenomenon vertical recharge of shallow groundwater into neighboring deep aquifers was also evidenced by the increases in tds cl and b in b1 4 during irrigation fig 5a b and c due to the shift in water type from ca na hco3 to ca na so4 hco3 and increases in tds cl and b during irrigation the section 3 4 1 piezometer b1 4 was assumed to be the affected deep groundwater adg however water type and tds cl and b concentrations in piezometers b1 5 b1 6 and b1 7 remained unchanged and therefore they were regarded as potentially affected deep groundwater padg since cl and b as two conservative tracers singh et al 2014 were generally constant in padg it was considered as one end member for the mixing model piezometer b1 3 adjacent to b1 4 was regarded as the other end member to determine the recharge percentage of shallow groundwater into adg eqs 1 and 2 1 p 1 b e 2 c l c l e 2 b b e 2 c l e 1 c l e 2 b e 1 2 p 2 b e 1 c l c l e 1 b b e 1 c l e 2 c l e 1 b e 2 where p1 and p2 are the estimated recharge percentages from the end member b1 3 and the end member padg respectively c l and b are c l and b concentrations of adg respectively c l e 1 and b e 1 are c l and b concentrations of the end member b1 3 respectively c l e 2 and b e 2 are c l and b concentrations of the end member padg respectively based on the calculation we found that from non irrigation to irrigation season the average recharge percentage of shallow groundwater to adg increased from 21 range 0 25 to 53 range 27 72 fig 9 a indicating that extraction greatly increased the vertical recharge of shallow groundwater this observation was consistent with the studies in florida where the extensive pumping resulted in the mixing of shallow and deep groundwater pichler et al 2017 4 2 2 arsenic immobilization arsenic concentrations in well b1 showed decreasing trends from non irrigation to irrigation season the most evident decrease occurred in adg with median as concentration decreasing from 17 9 to 10 7 μg l by 40 fig 9b during irrigation the intense extraction 18 million m3 y data from local residents induced an increasing downward recharge of shallow groundwater with low as concentrations into deep aquifer and thus as concentration in adg was diluted according to the calculated recharge percentages of shallow and deep groundwater in adg as mentioned in the section 4 2 1 as concentrations of adg in both non irrigation and irrigation seasons were estimated by using eq 3 only considering the mixture of the two end members 3 as a s e 1 p 1 a s e 2 p 2 where as is estimated as concentration in adg μg l a s e 1 and a s e 2 μg l are as concentrations in the end member b1 3 and the end member padg respectively p1 and p2 are the recharge percentages from b1 3 and padg estimated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively the estimated as concentration of adg was 25 3 μg l during non irrigation and 18 0 μg l during irrigation with a decrease of 29 fig 9b the observed decrease 40 was more obvious than the estimated decrease 29 which might be the result of fe2 oxidation and as sequestration by fe oxides smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2014 furthermore the observed as concentrations were generally lower than estimated ones fig 9b it indicates that dissolved as would be partly adsorbed during vertical infiltration from shallow into deep aquifer this result was consistent with studies by van geen et al 2013 and mai et al 2014 showing that as contamination in deep aquifer as a consequence of vertical recharge was delayed by the retardation of as transport in southeast asia spatial temporal variations in do and fe2 supported fe2 oxidation and as sequestration in adg do concentrations in shallow groundwater median 2 23 mg l were higher than those in deep one median 0 77 mg l fig 7a but fe2 and nh4 were lower in shallow groundwater fig 6b and c the introduction of oxygen rich groundwater oxidized fe2 and led to the formation of fe oxides and thus dissolved as was scavenged into fe oxides masue et al 2007 mai et al 2014 schaefer et al 2017 the increasing do and orp as well as the decreasing fe2 and nh4 also explained the more evident decrease in observed as concentration of adg from non irrigation season to irrigation season relative to the estimated decrease fig 9b 4 3 vulnerability of deep groundwater to as contamination in zone ii 4 3 1 vertical recharge of shallow high as groundwater similar to zone i the water level differences and the discontinuity of the thin aquitard allowed vertical infiltration of shallow groundwater in zone ii fig 4b temporal variations in tds cl and b in deep groundwater also supported the aforementioned fact fig 4d e and f similar to the explanations in the section 4 2 1 piezometer b2 4 was assumed to be adg while piezometers b2 5 b2 6 and b2 7 were regarded as padg piezometer b2 3 and padg were considered as two end members with cl and b as two conservative tracers to estimate the recharge percentages of shallow groundwater and padg into b2 4 adg as shown in eqs 1 and 2 calculation showed that during non irrigation the b2 4 adg received the similar amount of recharge from shallow groundwater average 53 range 27 63 and padg average 47 range 37 73 however during irrigation the recharge average 86 range 71 97 from shallow groundwater predominated fig 9c this shift clearly evidenced that extraction greatly induced an increasing recharge of shallow groundwater into b2 4 adg 4 3 2 vulnerability of deep groundwater the recharge of shallow high as groundwater carried dissolved as into deep aquifer according to the recharge percentages of the shallow and deep groundwater in adg calculated by eqs 1 and 2 as concentrations of adg can be estimated by eq 3 only considering the mixture of the two end members the estimated as concentrations of adg were 67 7 μg l in non irrigation season and 92 1 μg l in irrigation season fig 9d similar to zone i the observed as concentrations of adg were lower than the estimated values in both irrigation and non irrigation seasons it indicates that as adsorption onto sediments occurred during the downward migration of shallow high as groundwater however deep groundwater is quite vulnerable to as contamination by shallow one from non irrigation season to irrigation season the observed increase 80 was significantly greater than the estimated increase 36 in as concentrations of adg fig 9d therefore in addition to the direct introduction of dissolved as other processes would be attributed to the increase in as concentration in adg during the vertical recharge of shallow groundwater labile dom was introduced into the adg which was verified by the increase in fi of adg fig 7b the introduced labile dom was ready to fuel dissimilatory reduction of fe oxyhydroxides neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 which was supported by the obvious increases in fe2 and nh4 concentrations in adg fig 6e and f in addition the counter ion effect was another cause of as mobilization as discussed above during irrigation the increase in na ca0 5 in adg induced by the recharge from the high na ca0 5 shallow groundwater promoted mobilization of adsorbed as fig 10 slight increases in as concentrations of padg from non irrigation season to irrigation season indicate that the vertical recharge induced by intensive extraction elevated as concentrations which deteriorated water quality in deep aquifers thus much concern should be paid on extraction in order to sustainably use deep low as groundwater 4 4 implication for sustainable usage of deep groundwater in the four irrigation wells from zone i the calculated leakage recharge of shallow groundwater to deep aquifer showed an increasing trend from the early stage april to the middle stage may july of irrigation season fig s5a since low dissolved as generally occurred in shallow aquifer as concentration of extracted water decreased with the increase in the leakage recharge of shallow groundwater fig s4a although the vertical recharge reduced the deep groundwater as concentrations the intensive extraction negatively affected the sustainable usage of groundwater in zone i water levels did not recover the initial value after the irrigation season fig 4a and b implicating that extraction broke the state of groundwater dynamic equilibrium with a loss of aquifer storage erban et al 2013 additionally over extraction led to the migration of the depression cone toward the alluvial fans zhang et al 2018 and intrusion of the high as groundwater from zone ii would potentially threaten the low as groundwater in zone i mixing calculation showed that the extracted water from the irrigation wells of zone ii was mainly from the deep aquifer during non irrigation and in the early stage of irrigation and came from both deep and shallow aquifers fig s5b during irrigation due to the recharge of shallow high as groundwater the average observed as concentrations of extracted water increased from non irrigation season to irrigation season fig s4a although these temporal variations were not obvious probably because dissolved as was retarded on discontinuously clay layers and aquifer sediments during the downward migration of shallow high as groundwater van geen et al 2013 extraction must be optimized in order to minimize the intrusion of shallow high as groundwater 5 conclusions excessive extraction groundwater led to the drastic declines in water levels and temporal variations in dissolved as and other chemicals in the hetao basin the greater decreases in deep groundwater levels were observed than those in shallow ones which induced the greater hydraulic gradients between shallow and deep aquifers especially in b2 the as variation patterns and their controlling processes were different in the distal of the alluvial fan and the flat plain groundwater extraction obviously decreased concentrations of as nh4 and fe2 in adg around 45 m bls in the distal of the alluvial fan zone i but increased their concentrations in adg in the flat plain zone ii no evident variations in concentrations of chemical compositions were observed in padg at depths 50 to 80 m bls from non irrigation to irrigation season the estimated proportion of recharge from shallow groundwater to the adg increased from 21 to 53 in zone i while it increased sharply from 53 to 86 in zone ii in zone i the more evident decreases in the observed as concentration than the estimated as concentration in adg during irrigation resulted from the introduction of dissolved oxygen fe2 oxidation and as immobilization by fe iii oxides in addition to the increasing recharge from shallow low as groundwater however in zone ii the observed increases in dissolved as in adg were significantly greater than the estimated increases during irrigation which were possibly caused by the enhanced as mobilization via both dissimilatory reduction of fe oxides fueled by the introduced labile organic matter and the counter ion effect of the increase in na ca0 5 molar ratio although this study revealed temporal variations in groundwater levels and as concentrations in different aquifers during two irrigation seasons it is still unknown the long term trends in groundwater levels and as concentrations impacted by extraction therefore long term monitoring is required to better understand the system credit authorship
