17480,operational disturbances in aerobic granular sludge ags systems can result in aerobic availability of readily biodegradable cod rbcod different from activated sludge morphological consequences on the short and long term are not well described in literature this study investigated the effect of incomplete anaerobic uptake of acetate on the morphological and process stability of ags using a lab scale reactor a fraction of the total acetate load was dosed aerobically which was increased stepwise while monitoring granular morphology a good granular morphology and an svi of 40 ml g were obtained during initial enrichment and maintained for 20 aerobic acetate load dosed at 4 mg cod g vss h biological phosphorus removal efficiency was initially unaffected but the aerobic acetate dosage rate did decrease the aerobic phosphate uptake rate this led to loss of phosphorus removal for 20 aerobic acetate load dosed at 8 mg cod g vss h over the course of 12 days subsequently significant outgrowth formed on the granular surfaces and developed over time into finger like structures under these high aerobic acetate loads the svi increased to 80 ml g and resulted in significant biomass washout due to deteriorating settling properties of the sludge the sludge settleability and biological phosphorus removal recovered 10 days after aerobic feeding of acetate was stopped aerobic presence of rbcod can be tolerated if mostly anaerobic acetate uptake is maintained thereby ensuring stable granular morphology and good settleability the high enrichment of phosphate accumulating organisms in the granular sludge through bottom feeding and selective wasting of flocs makes aerobic granular sludge resilient to morphological deterioration in aerobic presence of rbcod graphical

ags is becoming a well established technology for wastewater treatment due to the compactness energy savings and good effluent quality bengtsson et al 2018 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2017a the current commercial technology nereda a tradename owned by royal haskoningdhv is based on sequentially operated batch reactors sbrs giesen et al 2013 the influent is fed from the bottom of the reactor resulting in uptake of readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod and conversion to storage polymers in the microbial cells under anaerobic conditions the storage polymers are oxidised in the subsequent aeration phase where they are used for microbial growth and nutrient removal this process design selects for well settling granular sludge which is further enhanced by subsequent selective discharge of the worst settling flocculent sludge fraction beun et al 2002 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 liu et al 2005 there has been a significant amount of research orientated towards the long term morphological stability of ags in sbrs an increasing body of literature has been developed on ags formed on various organic substrates and a variety of operational conditions the results obtained on granular stability have led to the general view that long term stability of ags is very variable and dependant on the applied process conditions corsino et al 2017 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 franca et al 2018 kent et al 2018 liu and liu 2006 a limitation of many studies is their empirical nature different process conditions are evaluated but the underlying mechanisms explaining the observations are often not provided or even studied specific conclusions can therefore be difficult to extrapolate to a more general context it is the authors opinion that this clouds the current understanding of the principles governing the formation and stability of ags in general moreover this potentially hampers implementation and development of alternative technologies for acquiring granular sludge in full scale municipal wastewater treatment the effect of the presence of both rbcod and oxygen as electron acceptor is a prime example of such confusion strategies to prevent and mitigate bulking sludge in conventional activated sludge processes have primarily focussed on the impact of substrate concentrations or floc loading rates f m ratio on floc morphology martins et al 2004b the obtained insights initially led to the first investigations into ags under full aerobic conditions beun et al 1999 heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 in general a dense and smooth biofilm requires substrate uptake limited by the maximum biomass specific uptake rate while a transport limited substrate uptake yields less dense and irregular biofilms picioreanu et al 2000 van loosdrecht et al 1997a in the case of biological nutrient removal using activated sludge design has focussed traditionally on maximizing rbcod gradients in the activated sludge reactors chudoba 1985 chudoba et al 1985 this is implemented by designing plug flow reactors or adding so called aerobic selector tanks chudoba et al 1973 in these configurations rbcod is first converted into storage polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas van loosdrecht et al 1997b there are two important conditions to minimise the sludge volume index svi firstly a sufficiently high dissolved oxygen concentration 2 mg l is required in case of aerobic conversion of rbcod to prevent transport limitation for oxygen during formation of pha martins et al 2003a second the ratio of the rbcod sludge loading rate in the selector over the maximum biomass specific uptake rate q s q s max should be close to unity for a good sludge volume index svi30 100 ml g martins et al 2003b ags can be cultivated with an aerobic feeding strategy i e employing the same completely oxidative storage of rbcod to pha but this requires a relatively high shear rate a high selective pressure on settling speed and a sufficiently high dissolved oxygen concentration to obtain a granular morphology arrojo et al 2004 beun et al 2000 morgenroth et al 1997 mosquera corral et al 2005 schwarzenbeck et al 2004 tay et al 2001 with the increase of granule size over time the interior of these aerobically fed granules gets deprived of substrates and decays resulting in granular instability long term stability is in general not achieved in aerobically fed granular sludge processes beun et al 2000 morgenroth et al 1997 design of anaerobic and anoxic selectors to obtain well settling sludge has proven less problematic then for aerobic selectors the general observation for anaerobic selectors is that complete uptake of rbcod in the anaerobic contact zone yields a well settling dense flocculent sludge morphology independent of the hydrodynamic conditions in the anaerobic selector martins et al 2004a wanner et al 1987 the removal of all rbcod during the anaerobic stage of the process into pha was shown to be a critical design criterion to form granular sludge in aerobic processes for nutrient removal as well de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 different from aerobic feeding long term stability of granular sludge morphology was obtained using a process with anaerobic feeding aerobic growth de kreuk et al 2007 2005 the sensitivity of anaerobically fed ags reactors to the presence of rbcod in the aeration phase has not been studied this is an important aspect for design and operation and knowledge on this sensitivity aids in the further development of ags processes not only rbcod bypassing the anaerobic stage but also aerobic hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod makes rbcod available in the aerated phase pronk et al 2015a both can result in transport limited substrate uptake rates of either oxygen or rbcod and potentially lead to deterioration of sludge morphology and settleability if there is some tolerance for the aerobic presence of rbcod it would ease the control and design of ags processes the effect of aerobic presence of rbcod on the morphology of activated sludge and granular sludge respectively could vary due to the intrinsic differences in process configurations in both cases phosphate accumulating organisms can significantly compete for substrate uptake with other heterotrophs under aerobic conditions due to the ability to sequester substrates under aerobic conditions pijuan et al 2005 for a completely mixed activated sludge a fraction of 20 of the rbcod load dosed aerobically was reported to have no negative effect on the svi of a lab scale system enriched for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr martins et al 2004a aerobic granular sludge processes might react differently than flocculent sludge systems due to the difference in feeding and the need to selectively waste flocculent sludge in this work the effect of aerobic presence of rbcod on the morphological stability of ags was investigated the first aim was to determine the fraction of rbcod that can be consumed aerobically while maintaining well settling ags in case of deterioration the second aim was to clarify via which mechanism s it would occur a lab scale ags system with acetate as carbon source was used to investigate the impact on granular morphology and overall sludge settling when a fraction of acetate is dosed under aerobic conditions acetate was aerobically dosed at a rate that ensured a negligible residual concentration i e to force transport limited substrate uptake rates changes in sludge morphology and nutrient removal were monitored over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 2 7 l and aspect ratio of 5 was operated as a sequential batch reactor with a volume exchange ratio of 0 55 the bioreactor was operated continuously in 3 hour cycles for 192 days the cycle first consisted of an anaerobic phase where synthetic wastewater was fed through the bottom of a settled sludge bed an feeding maximum duration of 60 min a short mixing phase was then applied prior to enabling do control to homogenize the bulk liquid ae mix 4 min next a mixed aerobic phase with dosage of acetate to mimic the continued availability of rbcod was followed by a mixed aeration phase without additional dosage ae feeding and ae reaction combined minimum duration of both phases was 106 min a settling period settling 5 min was then followed by the discharge of effluent and unsettled sludge discharge 5 min the duration of the respective anaerobic and aerobic carbon source only feeding phases were set according to the anaerobic aerobic acetate distribution of the current stage table 1 while maintaining a constant total cycle duration the total organic loading rate 1 63 g cod l 1 d 1 was kept constant over the course of the study ags previously enriched at the same conditions as described in this section was used as inoculum conditions listed in table 1 0 aerobic rbcod load a synthetic wastewater of 1 5 l per cycle was used as anaerobic feed and consisted of 1 2 l of deionized water together with 150 ml carbon source medium a and 150 ml nitrogen and phosphorous source medium b medium a contained 63 mm nach3coo 3h2o 3 6 mm mgso47h2o and 4 7 mm kcl medium b contained 42 8 mm nh4cl 4 2 mm k2hpo4 2 1 mm kh2po4 and 10 ml l 1 trace elements solution vishniac and santer 1957 but using 2 2 mg l znso4 7h2o instead of 22 mg l pronk et al 2017b 2015b the combination of medium a medium b and tap water led to a synthetic wastewater composition of 366 mg cod l 1 60 mg nh4 n l 1 and 9 3 mg po4 3 p l 1 the synthetic wastewater was fed at a superficial liquid velocity of 0 6 m h 1 the aerobic acetate load was dosed using a 10x more diluted solution of medium a medium c medium c contained 6 3 mm nach3coo 3h2o 0 36 mm mgso4 7h2o and 0 47 mm kcl resulting in a concentration 366 mg cod l 1 all media were dosed using peristaltic pumps and only flow rate and feeding duration were changed according to experimental stage see table 1 media compositions remained the same throughout the study the temperature was controlled at 20 1 c through the double jacketed reactor wall using a water bath with thermostat the ph was controlled during aeration at 7 0 0 1 by dosage of either a 1 m solution of hydrochloric acid or a 1 m sodium hydroxide solution during aeration a recirculation gas flow was maintained at 6 l min 1 superficial gas velocity of 4 2 cm s 1 a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mg l was maintained during the aeration phase via addition of compressed air or dinitrogen gas using mass flow controllers the average sludge retention time srt was controlled at 10 days by manual removal of biomass at the end of the aeration phase on a two day basis once per 16 cycles 2 2 operational conditions during stepwise increase of aerobically dosed rbcod fraction to force transport limited uptake of acetate during the stepwise increase of the aerobically dosed acetate load the acetate sludge loading rate should be significantly lower than the maximum aerobic biomass specific uptake rate under these conditions there is the maximal risk of obtaining bulking sludge and open porous biofilms martins et al 2003b picioreanu et al 2000 the maximum aerobic uptake rate was determined during the reference period as 49 mg cod g vss h the aerobic acetate loading rate was initially set to 1 10 of this maximum rate 58 mg cod h thereby ensuring a transport limited substrate uptake rate the aerobic acetate feeding rate was increased to 1 5 of the maximal substrate uptake rate 116 m cod h as the aerobic acetate load was increased from 20 to 25 of the total load to a maintain a constant total cycle time the load distribution was achieved by altering the duration of acetate dosage in the anaerobic phase and aerated phase table 1 the reactor was operated at each aerobic acetate load fraction for at least one srt prior to transitioning to the next step table 1 a longer time period was applied when a clear morphological change was detected within one srt 2 3 analysis of reactor performance samples were taken during aeration and filtered through a 0 45 µm pvdf filter millipore nh4 n nox n and po43 p concentrations were measured by using a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyzer thermo fisher scientific waltham usa the concentration of acetate was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with an aminex hpx 87h column from biorad coupled to an uv detector using 0 01 m phosphoric acid as eluent mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations in the reactor were determined according to the standard methods 2540 solids 2017 the sludge volume after 10 min of settling and effluent discharge sv10 was determined in between cycles in situ the srt was calculated by dividing the average amount of vss in the reactor over the sample period by the sum of the vss in the effluent from selective wasting and manual mixed wasting of sludge averaged per week the amount sludge wasted manually was adjusted to maintain the desired average srt 2 4 imaging of sludge morphology the morphological features of the sludge were assessed from both the reactor and effluent prior to changing fraction of acetate dosed aerobically at each experimental stage or when a clear morphological change was observed sludge was collected from the reactor at the end of the aeration phase and from the effluent directly after discharge a mixed sample from either source was transferred to a glass petri dish and examinded by the means of an olympus reverse microscope coupled with a leica digital camera together with its software qwin pro version 3 1 2 5 maximum specific acetate uptake rate under aerobic conditions during a cycle in the reference period the do controller was turned off 10 min after the aeration phase had started at the do concentration set point of 2 mg l the outputs of the mass flow controllers for both compressed air and nitrogen gas were fixed to their last setting the reactor was then pulsed with a sodium acetate solution to obtain a bulk concentration of 20 mg cod l the volumetric uptake rate was then determined by measuring the duration of the temporary drop in dissolved oxygen concentration due to the increased oxygen consumption rate the reactor mlvss concentration was used to calculate the biomass specific uptake rate mg cod g vss h 2 6 fluorescent in situ hybridisation fish the handling fixation and staining of fish samples was performed as

same synthetic wastewater composition and initial operational conditions table 1 granulation and conversions were allowed to stabilize over the course of one month complete anaerobic acetate uptake and complete phosphorus removal were achieved during this period the focus in this research was on stable granulation and conversions rather than the optimisation of effluent concentrations i e total nitrogen concentration fig 1 depicts the concentration profiles during one cycle prior to initiating the stepwise increase of the fraction of acetate dosed in the aerobic period this period was used as a reference throughout the study the effluent concentration of phosphate during the steady state operation was always very low i e 0 1 mg po4 p l the maximum biomass specific rate for aerobic phosphate uptake was 20 mg p g vss d the presence of a strong pao community was also indicated using fish microscopy supplementary materials all the acetate was taken up during the anaerobic feeding period nitrification was present albeit not yet complete the reactor fully granulated and sludge settleability was stable with low svis throughout the reference period svi10 30 40 ml g fig 2 a granules in the reactor had a smooth surface and were heterogeneous in size and shape with an average diameter 1 mm fig 3 a stage i sludge wasted through selective discharge mainly consisted of the smallest granule size fraction fig 3b stage i the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration was 5 2 0 6 g vss l fig 2b the solids retention time srt after start up was controlled at 10 days 3 2 effect of aerobic transport limited acetate uptake rate on sludge morphology and settleability 3 2 1 stage ii 20 aerobic acetate load the effect of an increasing fraction of the aerobic acetate load on the sludge volume sv10 and sludge volume index after ten minutes of settling svi10 is shown in fig 2a the applied aerobic acetate loading rate had no noticeable effect on settleability nor on the mlvss concentration up to dosing 20 of the acetate load in the aerobic period fig 2b the sudden decrease in mlvss on days 28 and 73 of operation were caused by too much mixed sludge withdrawal for manual srt control the sludge morphology in the reactor remained smooth as well with a small amount of filamentous bacteria extending from the surface of some granules suspended growth was not observed in the reactor fig 3a stage ii the settling speed indicated by the sv10 and the packing density indicated by the svi10 were unaffected by the filamentous bacteria attached to the granules the sv10 and svi10 remained similar to the reference period with complete anaerobic acetate feeding i e sv10 400 500 ml svi10 30 40 ml g as the aerobic acetate load increased to 20 an increasing amount of suspended filamentous bacteria entangled with flocs and small granules were found in the effluent in addition to granules from the smallest size fraction fig 3b stage ii the selective wasting based on settling speed was sufficient to prevent accumulation of the filamentous bacteria in the reactor and a potential negative impact on the svi 3 2 2 stageiii 20 aerobic acetate load sludge morphology in the reactor changed after the increase to 25 aerobic acetate load combined with an increase in aerobic acetate feeding rate table 1 although it did not immediately lead to an increase in sv10 or svi10 in the reactor during the two weeks the surface coverage as well as the length of the outgrowth on granules increased and affected the majority of the granules fig 3a stage iii the outgrowth s shape changed from individual filaments to intertwined finger like structures that formed a shell around existing granules fig 3b morphological comparison a small fraction of suspended filamentous bacteria was also observed in the reactor but insufficient to affect overall sludge settleability suspended tape like films were the dominant morphology besides granules in sludge sampled from the effluent discharged after the settling period furthermore small granules embedded in larger films were observed fig 3b stage iii despite the change in sludge morphology it had not altered the settling speed of the sludge fraction growing in suspension and thus the sludge load discharged through the effluent therefore the mlvss in the reactor did not decrease compared to the reference period after two weeks stage iii short circuit flows during anaerobic feeding were becoming more frequent and the anaerobic storage capacity of acetate was diminished section 3 3 2 fig 5c the increased aerobic conversion of acetate resulted in more poor settling suspended growth and a subsequent decrease in mlvss through an increased sludge load discharged through selective wasting no manual srt control was applied to prevent the average srt from decreasing below 10 days although selective wasting stabilized the sv10 and svi10 initially the sludge volume started to increase noticeably after one month the svi kept deteriorating after the subsequent step to 35 aerobic acetate load ultimately leading to a twofold increase to 80 ml g stage iii fig 2a the thin films now were the main suspended sludge morphology in the reactor and covered remaining granules in finger like structures to a varying degree fig 3a stage iii although not smooth surfaced granular morphology remained the dominant morphology in terms of mass 3 2 3 stage iv recovery with complete anaerobic acetate dosage within one srt after switching back to the reference conditions the mlvss concentration went back to the reference stage level by the formation of new smooth granules fig 3a stage iv this improved the svi10 to 40 ml g as well but the sludge volume took between 2 3 srts to completely recover to 400 ml short circuit flows during the anaerobic contact phase kept occurring on an irregular basis up to one srt after the switch this likely resulted in transport limited acetate uptake during the aeration phase and delayed the recovery gradually granules covered in finger like outgrowth decreased in number over time either through wasting or disintegration newly formed smooth granules increased in number fig 3a stage iv reminiscent of the original morphology at the start of the experiment an overview of identified stages in morphological development is presented in table 2 3 3 biological phosphorus removal during stepwise increase of aerobic acetate load 3 3 1 stage ii 20 aerobic acetate load the stepwise increase of the aerobically dosed acetate to 20 of the total acetate did not affect sludge settleability and the overall removal performances of nitrogen data not shown and phosphorus were also not affected acetate concentrations were below the detection limit 1 mg cod l during the aerobic acetate feeding phase under all experimental conditions 20 aerobic acetate load sampled in the first cycle after the aerobic acetate load had been increased the addition of acetate under aerobic conditions did have a clear negative impact on the phosphate uptake rate the development of the biomass specific phosphate uptake rate over time is shown in fig 4 a rates were calculated based on measured concentrations from samples taken during a cycle within an experimental phase sample interval similar to depicted in fig 1 the biomass specific phosphate uptake rate decreased sharply after increasing the aerobic acetate load to 5 the uptake rate increased again during the stepwise transition from 5 to 20 aerobic acetate load as well as the anaerobic p cod ratio fig 4b 3 3 2 stageiii 20 aerobic acetate load the transition from 20 to 25 aerobic acetate load resulted in a further decrease of the phosphate uptake rate the phosphate uptake was completely lost over the course the next 25 days first part of stage iii upon closer inspection a series of events occurred after the aerobic acetate load was increased from 20 to 25 that resulted in the twofold increase in svi10 during stage iii the transition from 20 to 25 aerobic acetate load had to be accompanied by a twofold increase in aerobic acetate dosage rate i e to 116 mg cod h since the aerobic acetate load of 25 could not be achieved at the initial aerobic dosage rate of i e 58 mg cod h while maintaining the same total organic loading within the fixed total cycle time although this dosage rate still forced a transport limited acetate uptake rate the increase in the aerobic acetate dosage rate had a negative effect on the biomass specific phosphate uptake rate this was initially observed during stage ii as well additionally the concentration profiles of phosphate during the final cycle before the transition fig 5 a and a cycle on the fourth day after the transition fig 5b showed that the initial biomass specific phosphate uptake rate rapidly decreased as the aeration phase progressed it increased again after the dosage of acetate had finished but the remaining aeration time was insufficient for complete removal of phosphate biological phosphorus removal became kinetically limited due to increased aerobic acetate dosage rate the phosphorus removal during the remaining cycles was less than the combined phosphate load from the influent and the anaerobic phosphate release resulting in a net decrease of the intracellular polyphosphate storage pool in between day four fig 5b and day twelve fig 5c after the increase to 25 aerobic acetate load and increased feeding rate see table 1 two changes were observed in the reactor operation first the anaerobic ratio of phosphate release over the anaerobic acetate load decreased the decreasing intracellular poly phosphate pool likely resulted in insufficient anaerobic uptake capacity for acetate as it coincided with a 10 percent point decrease in the inorganic sludge fraction depicted in fig 4b the increase in oxygen uptake rate our first seen on day 6 at the start of aeration indicated the presence of a residual acetate concentration as was deduced from the sudden change in dissolved oxygen concentration measured in the bulk liquid this increase came on top of the acetate load dosed as part of the experimental set up fig 5c second the anaerobic uptake of acetate was further decreased by a shorter anaerobic contact time due to short circuit flows this was most likely caused by increased granular surface roughness due to outgrowth the short circuit flows increased dispersion in the flow through and above the sludge bed which was indicated by a non zero dissolved oxygen concentration at the end of anaerobic feeding fig 5c the short circuit flows first occurred on an irregular basis first seen on day 10 after increasing the aerobic acetate load to 25 but increased in frequency as the experiment progressed the aerobic acetate load was thereby increased higher than intended both of these mechanisms shifted more of the anaerobic acetate load to the aeration phase besides the already imposed aerobic acetate load the absence of anaerobic release of phosphate and negligible effective anaerobic contact time resulted in mainly aerobic conversion of the complete acetate load biological phosphorus removal remained negligible throughout this period 3 3 3 stage iv recovery with complete anaerobic acetate dosage the recovery of granular morphology was studied after letting it deteriorate at an aerobic acetate load of 35 prior to switching to complete anaerobic feeding stage iv both the ash fraction and the ratio of anaerobic phosphate release over acetate uptake returned to baseline levels after one srt fig 4b and complete biological phosphorus removal was restored short circuit flow channels still occurred on an irregular basis during anaerobic feeding after the switch until sludge morphology had significantly improved the remaining effective anaerobic contact time was sufficient to restore the intracellular poly phosphate pool restored ash fraction fig 4b thus recovering biological phosphorus removal the combined observations of settleability morphology and nutrient removal for all stages are summarized in table 2 4 discussion in this study we investigated the effect of an increasing fraction of the total acetate load on the morphology of ags enriched for anaerobic pha formation through ebpr stage i acetate was dosed aerobically at a rate that forced transport limited uptake this simulated rbcod leaking through an anaerobic phase as well as the release of rbcod from slowly biodegradable cod during aeration these conditions are known to result in the proliferation of filamentous bacteria and poor settling activated sludge chudoba 1985 smooth granular sludge morphology and good settleability svi10 30 40 ml g up to and including 20 aerobic acetate load stage ii were maintained paos were able to aerobically compete with aerobic heterotrophic organisms for acetate uptake and oxygen this ability of paos has been previously described for flocculent sludge kuba et al 1994 pijuan et al 2005 and shown to aid in controlling the svi in flocculent sludge martins et al 2004a although a flocculent sludge fraction with filamentous bacteria formed when acetate was partially fed aerobically the fraction in the reactor remained negligible due to selective wasting based on settling speed additionally bottom feeding favoured paos growing in well settling granules and contributed maximally to the ability to aerobically compete for acetate this work underlines that the selection principles that result in ags at the same time contribute to mitigation of the adverse effects of an aerobic rbcod load on sludge morphology 4 1 theoretical aspects of sludge morphology selection for anaerobic rbcod conversion to storage polymers results in well settling flocculent sludge martins et al 2004a these slow growing organisms generally form dense biofilms de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 van loosdrecht et al 1995 and transport limitation of the electron acceptor in a subsequent stage does not affect the growth morphology it was hypothesised that the ability of these slow growing organisms to aerobically convert rbcod also reduces the fraction consumed for growth of filamentous bacteria when part of the rbcod load was available under aerobic conditions martins et al 2004a similarly the majority of the growth of filamentous bacteria was found in suspension in this study stage ii fig 3b while filamentous outgrowth on granules remained limited stage ii fig 3a at least up to 20 aerobic acetate load could be sustained without adverse effect on settleability of flocculent sludge enriched for ebpr martins et al 2004a but the upper limit was not reported at least the same extent of stability was observed for ags in this study mainly anaerobic acetate uptake capacity thus ensures the aerobic competition for substrate uptake with ordinary heterotrophs the morphological fate of aerobically consumed acetate by ordinary heterotrophs observed in this study was in line with martins et al 2003b 2003a who formulated the hypothesis that transport limited aerobic uptake of substrates drives the formation of poor settling sludge transport limited uptake rates of either rbcod or oxygen due to low bulk concentrations favours one dimensional growth in the direction of the concentration gradient the specific morphology that causes the poor settleability depends on the type aerobic presence of rbcod which can be divided into two categories negligible bulk rbcod concentrations during a large part of the aerated phase e g from hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod or continuous supply or rbcod to the aeration zone in continuous flow reactors from incomplete anaerobic uptake or high bulk rbcod concentrations during a short pulse in the first part of the aerated phase e g from incomplete anaerobic uptake in sbrs for the first category mainly suspended filamentous bacteria were found in this study aerobically growing on the low concentration of acetate from active feeding during the majority of the aerated time stage ii fig 3b this is similar as previously observed for acetate fed cstrs where the low concentration of acetate also resulted in growth of mainly filamentous bacteria van niekerk et al 1987 the second category was observed when the significant decrease in the anaerobic acetate uptake after loss of ebpr section 4 3 caused a pulse of acetate at the start of aeration during this initial pulse of acetate the transport limitation switched to oxygen this led to overgrowth of the filamentous bacteria in suspension and attached to granular surfaces the finger like flocs that formed in this study resembled observations from work on flocculation by crabtree et al 1966 and selects for aerobic storage of acetate rather than direct growth the similarly shaped flocs and finger like films that formed on granular surfaces closely resembled those from work performed on granular sludge with completely aerobic pulse feeding there the relatively low do all between 2 and 4 mg o2 l led to transport limitation and high shear stress was required to erode this outgrowth and achieve well settling granular sludge beun et al 1999 morgenroth et al 1997 mosquera corral et al 2005 these observations emphasize that aerobic transport limitation in substrate uptake drives irregular growth in activated sludge as well as granular systems as was shown in a recent modelling study by wu et al 2020 as well combined with the level of shear and mixing the bulk concentration and duration of aerobic presence of rbcod thus determine the extent of the transport limitation and overall effect of sludge morphology 4 2 ags reactor operation and morphological effect of rbcod minor filamentous outgrowth on granular surfaces was observed at 20 aerobic acetate load supporting a good resilience towards acetate presence stage ii fig 3a consequently the majority of the aerobic growth on acetate formed suspended filamentous bacteria stage ii fig 3b the large difference in settling speed of both fractions allowed for efficient wasting of most filamentous bacteria and prevented an increase in svi furthermore anaerobic bottom feeding favours pha storage in the granular sludge fraction in this study leading to a significant pao fraction in the granules layer et al 2019 the pao fraction therefore competed substantially for aerobically available acetate with filamentous bacteria the selection for anaerobic pha formation and selective wasting contribute to maintaining a smooth granular morphology and good settleability the effect of aerobic conversion of rbcod on granular sludge morphology previously enriched for anaerobic storage has been generalized in fig 6 a in stage iii the loss of significant anaerobic storage leads to mainly aerobic conversion of rbcod as was observed in this study the aerobic competition for rbcod will be more in favour of flocculent growth or filamentous bacteria fig 6b since this becomes the main growth morphology selective wasting is insufficient to maintain stable granulation and eventually results in loss of granulation when granular sludge morphology has deteriorated or is not well established it can strongly hinder the start up or recovery of granular sludge morphology in line with this reasoning the svi10 did not improve in this study until after the active aerobic feeding was stopped and complete anaerobic acetate feeding was applied in stage iv the svi10 recovered substantially within one srt with the formation of new granules and increase in mlvss the recovery of the sludge volume took approximately 2 3 srts in lab scale reactors the waste sludge withdrawal is less optimised for selection compared to full scale plants which could result in different time scales for recovery on the other hand the less favourable substrate composition of sewage i e not only rbcod might result in slower recovery of the sludge volume 4 3 limits of morphological stabilization of ags by anaerobic pha storage the experimental results showed that phosphate uptake was negatively influenced each time by an increase in the aerobic feeding rate of acetate likely the decreased phosphate uptake rate was the result of the paos modulating their metabolism towards storage in the presence of an electron acceptor kuba et al 1994 the simultaneous aerobic acetate uptake seems to limit the phosphate uptake rate guisasola et al 2004 pijuan et al 2005 the incomplete aerobic phosphate uptake initiated the cascaded collapse of biological phosphorus removal fig 5 through the gradual decrease in polyphosphate storage pool fig 4b as reported also by pijuan et al 2006 the latter resulted in complete loss of p removal good granular morphology due to anaerobic storage of rbcod can thus be maintained if the combination of the aerobic rbcod uptake rate and the aerobic load allows for sufficient phosphate uptake and glycogen synthesis in principle granular stability is not dependant on paos or ebpr de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 and stable granular systems with glycogen accumulating organisms have been regularly reported meyer et al 2003 pronk et al 2015b the short circuit flows observed during anaerobic feeding shortly after loss of p removal likely minimized the effective anaerobic contact time and prevented continued selection for anaerobic conversion of acetate to pha by glycogen accumulating organisms future studies should focus on the impact of rbcod availability on the phosphate removal process and the risk of gaos outcompeting paos to ensure good phosphate removal 4 4 considerations for full scale ags processes aerobic presence of rbcod has potential consequences for process stability in full scale ags reactors the rate at which rbcod becomes available in the bulk and the duration of availability compared to the total aerated time are the critical parameters to maintain stable granulation section 4 3 in practice these are determined by the reactor design i e a sbr or a continuous flow reactor and the source of rbcod i e incomplete anaerobic uptake of rbcod or aerobic hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod see section 4 1 in case of incomplete anaerobic rbcod uptake it will result in a very dilute availability of rbcod during the complete residence time of the mixed aeration zone in continuous flow reactors as this study showed dilute availability of acetate during most of the aerated time was detrimental to the anaerobic acetate uptake capacity and sludge morphology due to insufficient aerobic phosphate uptake stage iii on the other hand sbrs will have a higher residual rbcod concentration at the start of the aeration phase for a relatively short time once active aerobic dosage of acetate was stopped in stage iv acetate was only present during aeration for a short time 10 15 min of 110 min since short circuit flows through the sludge bed still occurred during anaerobic feeding despite this aerobic acetate load phosphate uptake and sludge morphology recovered fig 3a stage iv our results therefore indicate that sbrs will be less prone to deterioration of granular morphology compared to continuous flow reactors thus it of vital importance for granular stability in continuous flow reactors to limit the rbcod presence in the aeration zones besides incomplete anaerobic uptake aerobic availability of rbcod will also arise from aerobic hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod that is not converted anaerobically de kreuk et al 2010 layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015a particulate cod will either be consumed by protozoa or incorporated in the flocculent sludge fraction before being hydrolysed martins et al 2011 the hydrolysis products will then be converted into more flocculent sludge a good selective removal of the flocculent sludge fraction is therefore required for keeping a stable granular sludge bed note that a certain level of flocculent sludge is always present in ags plants treating sewage and has been shown to aid in achieving good suspended solids effluent quality van dijk et al 2018 the release rate of both sources of rbcod are relatively slow and will always result in negligible residual concentrations and transport limited uptake rates but continuous flow reactors will still be more affected due to the intrinsic dilution in the mixed aeration zone compared to sbrs when granular sludge is well established the presence of a large pha storing fraction paos and gaos in the microbial community will stabilise the granular morphology by competing with more flocculent growth for rbcod during aeration a recent study by ali et al 2019 showed a three fold higher level of enrichment of paos in the largest granular size fraction 1 0 mm 60 of biomass than in the smaller granules and flocculent sludge 1 0 mm 40 of biomass fraction in a full scale nereda the extra selection for pao and thus pha storage increases the capacity for aerobic rbcod uptake in the largest granular sludge fraction this limits the negative impact of aerobic presence of rbcod on the granular morphology 5 conclusion selection for anaerobic storage of rbcod in ags through ebpr limited the adverse effect of a partial aerobic rbcod load on sludge morphology through aerobic competition for substrate uptake with ordinary heterotrophs 20 aerobic acetate load at dosage rate of 4 mg cod g vss h sufficient aerobic competition could be maintained while the combined negative effect of the aerobic rbcod uptake rate and the aerobic rbcod load on phosphate uptake paos still allowed for full p removal the reactor configuration with anaerobic bottom feeding and selective wasting of formed slow settling flocculent sludge further limited the negative effect of aerobic presence of rbcod on the sludge morphology of ags loss of anaerobic rbcod uptake and aerobic competition deteriorated the granular sludge morphology due to increased aerobic growth of finger like structures on the granules and as flocs in suspension 20 aerobic acetate load at dosage rate of 8 mg cod g vss h finger like structures on the granular surfaces provoked non uniform flow through the sludge bed during anaerobic feeding resulting in extra acetate availability in the aerated phase and further deterioration of the granular sludge morphology recovery of the sludge morphology through the formation of new smooth granules occurred only after active aerobic feeding of acetate was stopped it is therefore important to ensure maximum anaerobic rbcod removal and prevent transport limited substrate uptake rates in the aeration phase during recovery or start up in general the sludge morphology of ags systems with good anaerobic storage of rbcod can be considered resilient to low concentrations of rbcod under aerobic conditions the selection principles that result in ags formation also contribute to mitigation of

17480,operational disturbances in aerobic granular sludge ags systems can result in aerobic availability of readily biodegradable cod rbcod different from activated sludge morphological consequences on the short and long term are not well described in literature this study investigated the effect of incomplete anaerobic uptake of acetate on the morphological and process stability of ags using a lab scale reactor a fraction of the total acetate load was dosed aerobically which was increased stepwise while monitoring granular morphology a good granular morphology and an svi of 40 ml g were obtained during initial enrichment and maintained for 20 aerobic acetate load dosed at 4 mg cod g vss h biological phosphorus removal efficiency was initially unaffected but the aerobic acetate dosage rate did decrease the aerobic phosphate uptake rate this led to loss of phosphorus removal for 20 aerobic acetate load dosed at 8 mg cod g vss h over the course of 12 days subsequently significant outgrowth formed on the granular surfaces and developed over time into finger like structures under these high aerobic acetate loads the svi increased to 80 ml g and resulted in significant biomass washout due to deteriorating settling properties of the sludge the sludge settleability and biological phosphorus removal recovered 10 days after aerobic feeding of acetate was stopped aerobic presence of rbcod can be tolerated if mostly anaerobic acetate uptake is maintained thereby ensuring stable granular morphology and good settleability the high enrichment of phosphate accumulating organisms in the granular sludge through bottom feeding and selective wasting of flocs makes aerobic granular sludge resilient to morphological deterioration in aerobic presence of rbcod graphical

ags is becoming a well established technology for wastewater treatment due to the compactness energy savings and good effluent quality bengtsson et al 2018 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2017a the current commercial technology nereda a tradename owned by royal haskoningdhv is based on sequentially operated batch reactors sbrs giesen et al 2013 the influent is fed from the bottom of the reactor resulting in uptake of readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod and conversion to storage polymers in the microbial cells under anaerobic conditions the storage polymers are oxidised in the subsequent aeration phase where they are used for microbial growth and nutrient removal this process design selects for well settling granular sludge which is further enhanced by subsequent selective discharge of the worst settling flocculent sludge fraction beun et al 2002 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 liu et al 2005 there has been a significant amount of research orientated towards the long term morphological stability of ags in sbrs an increasing body of literature has been developed on ags formed on various organic substrates and a variety of operational conditions the results obtained on granular stability have led to the general view that long term stability of ags is very variable and dependant on the applied process conditions corsino et al 2017 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 franca et al 2018 kent et al 2018 liu and liu 2006 a limitation of many studies is their empirical nature different process conditions are evaluated but the underlying mechanisms explaining the observations are often not provided or even studied specific conclusions can therefore be difficult to extrapolate to a more general context it is the authors opinion that this clouds the current understanding of the principles governing the formation and stability of ags in general moreover this potentially hampers implementation and development of alternative technologies for acquiring granular sludge in full scale municipal wastewater treatment the effect of the presence of both rbcod and oxygen as electron acceptor is a prime example of such confusion strategies to prevent and mitigate bulking sludge in conventional activated sludge processes have primarily focussed on the impact of substrate concentrations or floc loading rates f m ratio on floc morphology martins et al 2004b the obtained insights initially led to the first investigations into ags under full aerobic conditions beun et al 1999 heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 in general a dense and smooth biofilm requires substrate uptake limited by the maximum biomass specific uptake rate while a transport limited substrate uptake yields less dense and irregular biofilms picioreanu et al 2000 van loosdrecht et al 1997a in the case of biological nutrient removal using activated sludge design has focussed traditionally on maximizing rbcod gradients in the activated sludge reactors chudoba 1985 chudoba et al 1985 this is implemented by designing plug flow reactors or adding so called aerobic selector tanks chudoba et al 1973 in these configurations rbcod is first converted into storage polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas van loosdrecht et al 1997b there are two important conditions to minimise the sludge volume index svi firstly a sufficiently high dissolved oxygen concentration 2 mg l is required in case of aerobic conversion of rbcod to prevent transport limitation for oxygen during formation of pha martins et al 2003a second the ratio of the rbcod sludge loading rate in the selector over the maximum biomass specific uptake rate q s q s max should be close to unity for a good sludge volume index svi30 100 ml g martins et al 2003b ags can be cultivated with an aerobic feeding strategy i e employing the same completely oxidative storage of rbcod to pha but this requires a relatively high shear rate a high selective pressure on settling speed and a sufficiently high dissolved oxygen concentration to obtain a granular morphology arrojo et al 2004 beun et al 2000 morgenroth et al 1997 mosquera corral et al 2005 schwarzenbeck et al 2004 tay et al 2001 with the increase of granule size over time the interior of these aerobically fed granules gets deprived of substrates and decays resulting in granular instability long term stability is in general not achieved in aerobically fed granular sludge processes beun et al 2000 morgenroth et al 1997 design of anaerobic and anoxic selectors to obtain well settling sludge has proven less problematic then for aerobic selectors the general observation for anaerobic selectors is that complete uptake of rbcod in the anaerobic contact zone yields a well settling dense flocculent sludge morphology independent of the hydrodynamic conditions in the anaerobic selector martins et al 2004a wanner et al 1987 the removal of all rbcod during the anaerobic stage of the process into pha was shown to be a critical design criterion to form granular sludge in aerobic processes for nutrient removal as well de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 different from aerobic feeding long term stability of granular sludge morphology was obtained using a process with anaerobic feeding aerobic growth de kreuk et al 2007 2005 the sensitivity of anaerobically fed ags reactors to the presence of rbcod in the aeration phase has not been studied this is an important aspect for design and operation and knowledge on this sensitivity aids in the further development of ags processes not only rbcod bypassing the anaerobic stage but also aerobic hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod makes rbcod available in the aerated phase pronk et al 2015a both can result in transport limited substrate uptake rates of either oxygen or rbcod and potentially lead to deterioration of sludge morphology and settleability if there is some tolerance for the aerobic presence of rbcod it would ease the control and design of ags processes the effect of aerobic presence of rbcod on the morphology of activated sludge and granular sludge respectively could vary due to the intrinsic differences in process configurations in both cases phosphate accumulating organisms can significantly compete for substrate uptake with other heterotrophs under aerobic conditions due to the ability to sequester substrates under aerobic conditions pijuan et al 2005 for a completely mixed activated sludge a fraction of 20 of the rbcod load dosed aerobically was reported to have no negative effect on the svi of a lab scale system enriched for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr martins et al 2004a aerobic granular sludge processes might react differently than flocculent sludge systems due to the difference in feeding and the need to selectively waste flocculent sludge in this work the effect of aerobic presence of rbcod on the morphological stability of ags was investigated the first aim was to determine the fraction of rbcod that can be consumed aerobically while maintaining well settling ags in case of deterioration the second aim was to clarify via which mechanism s it would occur a lab scale ags system with acetate as carbon source was used to investigate the impact on granular morphology and overall sludge settling when a fraction of acetate is dosed under aerobic conditions acetate was aerobically dosed at a rate that ensured a negligible residual concentration i e to force transport limited substrate uptake rates changes in sludge morphology and nutrient removal were monitored over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 2 7 l and aspect ratio of 5 was operated as a sequential batch reactor with a volume exchange ratio of 0 55 the bioreactor was operated continuously in 3 hour cycles for 192 days the cycle first consisted of an anaerobic phase where synthetic wastewater was fed through the bottom of a settled sludge bed an feeding maximum duration of 60 min a short mixing phase was then applied prior to enabling do control to homogenize the bulk liquid ae mix 4 min next a mixed aerobic phase with dosage of acetate to mimic the continued availability of rbcod was followed by a mixed aeration phase without additional dosage ae feeding and ae reaction combined minimum duration of both phases was 106 min a settling period settling 5 min was then followed by the discharge of effluent and unsettled sludge discharge 5 min the duration of the respective anaerobic and aerobic carbon source only feeding phases were set according to the anaerobic aerobic acetate distribution of the current stage table 1 while maintaining a constant total cycle duration the total organic loading rate 1 63 g cod l 1 d 1 was kept constant over the course of the study ags previously enriched at the same conditions as described in this section was used as inoculum conditions listed in table 1 0 aerobic rbcod load a synthetic wastewater of 1 5 l per cycle was used as anaerobic feed and consisted of 1 2 l of deionized water together with 150 ml carbon source medium a and 150 ml nitrogen and phosphorous source medium b medium a contained 63 mm nach3coo 3h2o 3 6 mm mgso47h2o and 4 7 mm kcl medium b contained 42 8 mm nh4cl 4 2 mm k2hpo4 2 1 mm kh2po4 and 10 ml l 1 trace elements solution vishniac and santer 1957 but using 2 2 mg l znso4 7h2o instead of 22 mg l pronk et al 2017b 2015b the combination of medium a medium b and tap water led to a synthetic wastewater composition of 366 mg cod l 1 60 mg nh4 n l 1 and 9 3 mg po4 3 p l 1 the synthetic wastewater was fed at a superficial liquid velocity of 0 6 m h 1 the aerobic acetate load was dosed using a 10x more diluted solution of medium a medium c medium c contained 6 3 mm nach3coo 3h2o 0 36 mm mgso4 7h2o and 0 47 mm kcl resulting in a concentration 366 mg cod l 1 all media were dosed using peristaltic pumps and only flow rate and feeding duration were changed according to experimental stage see table 1 media compositions remained the same throughout the study the temperature was controlled at 20 1 c through the double jacketed reactor wall using a water bath with thermostat the ph was controlled during aeration at 7 0 0 1 by dosage of either a 1 m solution of hydrochloric acid or a 1 m sodium hydroxide solution during aeration a recirculation gas flow was maintained at 6 l min 1 superficial gas velocity of 4 2 cm s 1 a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mg l was maintained during the aeration phase via addition of compressed air or dinitrogen gas using mass flow controllers the average sludge retention time srt was controlled at 10 days by manual removal of biomass at the end of the aeration phase on a two day basis once per 16 cycles 2 2 operational conditions during stepwise increase of aerobically dosed rbcod fraction to force transport limited uptake of acetate during the stepwise increase of the aerobically dosed acetate load the acetate sludge loading rate should be significantly lower than the maximum aerobic biomass specific uptake rate under these conditions there is the maximal risk of obtaining bulking sludge and open porous biofilms martins et al 2003b picioreanu et al 2000 the maximum aerobic uptake rate was determined during the reference period as 49 mg cod g vss h the aerobic acetate loading rate was initially set to 1 10 of this maximum rate 58 mg cod h thereby ensuring a transport limited substrate uptake rate the aerobic acetate feeding rate was increased to 1 5 of the maximal substrate uptake rate 116 m cod h as the aerobic acetate load was increased from 20 to 25 of the total load to a maintain a constant total cycle time the load distribution was achieved by altering the duration of acetate dosage in the anaerobic phase and aerated phase table 1 the reactor was operated at each aerobic acetate load fraction for at least one srt prior to transitioning to the next step table 1 a longer time period was applied when a clear morphological change was detected within one srt 2 3 analysis of reactor performance samples were taken during aeration and filtered through a 0 45 µm pvdf filter millipore nh4 n nox n and po43 p concentrations were measured by using a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyzer thermo fisher scientific waltham usa the concentration of acetate was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with an aminex hpx 87h column from biorad coupled to an uv detector using 0 01 m phosphoric acid as eluent mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations in the reactor were determined according to the standard methods 2540 solids 2017 the sludge volume after 10 min of settling and effluent discharge sv10 was determined in between cycles in situ the srt was calculated by dividing the average amount of vss in the reactor over the sample period by the sum of the vss in the effluent from selective wasting and manual mixed wasting of sludge averaged per week the amount sludge wasted manually was adjusted to maintain the desired average srt 2 4 imaging of sludge morphology the morphological features of the sludge were assessed from both the reactor and effluent prior to changing fraction of acetate dosed aerobically at each experimental stage or when a clear morphological change was observed sludge was collected from the reactor at the end of the aeration phase and from the effluent directly after discharge a mixed sample from either source was transferred to a glass petri dish and examinded by the means of an olympus reverse microscope coupled with a leica digital camera together with its software qwin pro version 3 1 2 5 maximum specific acetate uptake rate under aerobic conditions during a cycle in the reference period the do controller was turned off 10 min after the aeration phase had started at the do concentration set point of 2 mg l the outputs of the mass flow controllers for both compressed air and nitrogen gas were fixed to their last setting the reactor was then pulsed with a sodium acetate solution to obtain a bulk concentration of 20 mg

same synthetic wastewater composition and initial operational conditions table 1 granulation and conversions were allowed to stabilize over the course of one month complete anaerobic acetate uptake and complete phosphorus removal were achieved during this period the focus in this research was on stable granulation and conversions rather than the optimisation of effluent concentrations i e total nitrogen concentration fig 1 depicts the concentration profiles during one cycle prior to initiating the stepwise increase of the fraction of acetate dosed in the aerobic period this period was used as a reference throughout the study the effluent concentration of phosphate during the steady state operation was always very low i e 0 1 mg po4 p l the maximum biomass specific rate for aerobic phosphate uptake was 20 mg p g vss d the presence of a strong pao community was also indicated using fish microscopy supplementary materials all the acetate was taken up during the anaerobic feeding period nitrification was present albeit not yet complete the reactor fully granulated and sludge settleability was stable with low svis throughout the reference period svi10 30 40 ml g fig 2 a granules in the reactor had a smooth surface and were heterogeneous in size and shape with an average diameter 1 mm fig 3 a stage i sludge wasted through selective discharge mainly consisted of the smallest granule size fraction fig 3b stage i the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration was 5 2 0 6 g vss l fig 2b the solids retention time srt after start up was controlled at 10 days 3 2 effect of aerobic transport limited acetate uptake rate on sludge morphology and settleability 3 2 1 stage ii 20 aerobic acetate load the effect of an increasing fraction of the aerobic acetate load on the sludge volume sv10 and sludge volume index after ten minutes of settling svi10 is shown in fig 2a the applied aerobic acetate loading rate had no noticeable effect on settleability nor on the mlvss concentration up to dosing 20 of the acetate load in the aerobic period fig 2b the sudden decrease in mlvss on days 28 and 73 of operation were caused by too much mixed sludge withdrawal for manual srt control the sludge morphology in the reactor remained smooth as well with a small amount of filamentous bacteria extending from the surface of some granules suspended growth was not observed in the reactor fig 3a stage ii the settling speed indicated by the sv10 and the packing density indicated by the svi10 were unaffected by the filamentous bacteria attached to the granules the sv10 and svi10 remained similar to the reference period with complete anaerobic acetate feeding i e sv10 400 500 ml svi10 30 40 ml g as the aerobic acetate load increased to 20 an increasing amount of suspended filamentous bacteria entangled with flocs and small granules were found in the effluent in addition to granules from the smallest size fraction fig 3b stage ii the selective wasting based on settling speed was sufficient to prevent accumulation of the filamentous bacteria in the reactor and a potential negative impact on the svi 3 2 2 stageiii 20 aerobic acetate load sludge morphology in the reactor changed after the increase to 25 aerobic acetate load combined with an increase in aerobic acetate feeding rate table 1 although it did not immediately lead to an increase in sv10 or svi10 in the reactor during the two weeks the surface coverage as well as the length of the outgrowth on granules increased and affected the majority of the granules fig 3a stage iii the outgrowth s shape changed from individual filaments to intertwined finger like structures that formed a shell around existing granules fig 3b morphological comparison a small fraction of suspended filamentous bacteria was also observed in the reactor but insufficient to affect overall sludge settleability suspended tape like films were the dominant morphology besides granules in sludge sampled from the effluent discharged after the settling period furthermore small granules embedded in larger films were observed fig 3b stage iii despite the change in sludge morphology it had not altered the settling speed of the sludge fraction growing in suspension and thus the sludge load discharged through the effluent therefore the mlvss in the reactor did not decrease compared to the reference period after two weeks stage iii short circuit flows during anaerobic feeding were becoming more frequent and the anaerobic storage capacity of acetate was diminished section 3 3 2 fig 5c the increased aerobic conversion of acetate resulted in more poor settling suspended growth and a subsequent decrease in mlvss through an increased sludge load discharged through selective wasting no manual srt control was applied to prevent the average srt from decreasing below 10 days although selective wasting stabilized the sv10 and svi10 initially the sludge volume started to increase noticeably after one month the svi kept deteriorating after the subsequent step to 35 aerobic acetate load ultimately leading to a twofold increase to 80 ml g stage iii fig 2a the thin films now were the main suspended sludge morphology in the reactor and covered remaining granules in finger like structures to a varying degree fig 3a stage iii although not smooth surfaced granular morphology remained the dominant morphology in terms of mass 3 2 3 stage iv recovery with complete anaerobic acetate dosage within one srt after switching back to the reference conditions the mlvss concentration went back to the reference stage level by the formation of new smooth granules fig 3a stage iv this improved the svi10 to 40 ml g as well but the sludge volume took between 2 3 srts to completely recover to 400 ml short circuit flows during the anaerobic contact phase kept occurring on an irregular basis up to one srt after the switch this likely resulted in transport limited acetate uptake during the aeration phase and delayed the recovery gradually granules covered in finger like outgrowth decreased in number over time either through wasting or disintegration newly formed smooth granules increased in number fig 3a stage iv reminiscent of the original morphology at the start of the experiment an overview of identified stages in morphological development is presented in table 2 3 3 biological phosphorus removal during stepwise increase of aerobic acetate load 3 3 1 stage ii 20 aerobic acetate load the stepwise increase of the aerobically dosed acetate to 20 of the total acetate did not affect sludge settleability and the overall removal performances of nitrogen data not shown and phosphorus were also not affected acetate concentrations were below the detection limit 1 mg cod l during the aerobic acetate feeding phase under all experimental conditions 20 aerobic acetate load sampled in the first cycle after the aerobic acetate load had been increased the addition of acetate under aerobic conditions did have a clear negative impact on the phosphate uptake rate the development of the biomass specific phosphate uptake rate over time is shown in fig 4 a rates were calculated based on measured concentrations from samples taken during a cycle within an experimental phase sample interval similar to depicted in fig 1 the biomass specific phosphate uptake rate decreased sharply after increasing the aerobic acetate load to 5 the uptake rate increased again during the stepwise transition from 5 to 20 aerobic acetate load as well as the anaerobic p cod ratio fig 4b 3 3 2 stageiii 20 aerobic acetate load the transition from 20 to 25 aerobic acetate load resulted in a further decrease of the phosphate uptake rate the phosphate uptake was completely lost over the course the next 25 days first part of stage iii upon closer inspection a series of events occurred after the aerobic acetate load was increased from 20 to 25 that resulted in the twofold increase in svi10 during stage iii the transition from 20 to 25 aerobic acetate load had to be accompanied by a twofold increase in aerobic acetate dosage rate i e to 116 mg cod h since the aerobic acetate load of 25 could not be achieved at the initial aerobic dosage rate of i e 58 mg cod h while maintaining the same total organic loading within the fixed total cycle time although this dosage rate still forced a transport limited acetate uptake rate the increase in the aerobic acetate dosage rate had a negative effect on the biomass specific phosphate uptake rate this was initially observed during stage ii as well additionally the concentration profiles of phosphate during the final cycle before the transition fig 5 a and a cycle on the fourth day after the transition fig 5b showed that the initial biomass specific phosphate uptake rate rapidly decreased as the aeration phase progressed it increased again after the dosage of acetate had finished but the remaining aeration time was insufficient for complete removal of phosphate biological phosphorus removal became kinetically limited due to increased aerobic acetate dosage rate the phosphorus removal during the remaining cycles was less than the combined phosphate load from the influent and the anaerobic phosphate release resulting in a net decrease of the intracellular polyphosphate storage pool in between day four fig 5b and day twelve fig 5c after the increase to 25 aerobic acetate load and increased feeding rate see table 1 two changes were observed in the reactor operation first the anaerobic ratio of phosphate release over the anaerobic acetate load decreased the decreasing intracellular poly phosphate pool likely resulted in insufficient anaerobic uptake capacity for acetate as it coincided with a 10 percent point decrease in the inorganic sludge fraction depicted in fig 4b the increase in oxygen uptake rate our first seen on day 6 at the start of aeration indicated the presence of a residual acetate concentration as was deduced from the sudden change in dissolved oxygen concentration measured in the bulk liquid this increase came on top of the acetate load dosed as part of the experimental set up fig 5c second the anaerobic uptake of acetate was further decreased by a shorter anaerobic contact time due to short circuit flows this was most likely caused by increased granular surface roughness due to outgrowth the short circuit flows increased dispersion in the flow through and above the sludge bed which was indicated by a non zero dissolved oxygen concentration at the end of anaerobic feeding fig 5c the short circuit flows first occurred on an irregular basis first seen on day 10 after increasing the aerobic acetate load to 25 but increased in frequency as the experiment progressed the aerobic acetate load was thereby increased higher than intended both of these mechanisms shifted more of the anaerobic acetate load to the aeration phase besides the already imposed aerobic acetate load the absence of anaerobic release of phosphate and negligible effective anaerobic contact time resulted in mainly aerobic conversion of the complete acetate load biological phosphorus removal remained negligible throughout this period 3 3 3 stage iv recovery with complete anaerobic acetate dosage the recovery of granular morphology was studied after letting it deteriorate at an aerobic acetate load of 35 prior to switching to complete anaerobic feeding stage iv both the ash fraction and the ratio of anaerobic phosphate release over acetate uptake returned to baseline levels after one srt fig 4b and complete biological phosphorus removal was restored short circuit flow channels still occurred on an irregular basis during anaerobic feeding after the switch until sludge morphology had significantly improved the remaining effective anaerobic contact time was sufficient to restore the intracellular poly phosphate pool restored ash fraction fig 4b thus recovering biological phosphorus removal the combined observations of settleability morphology and nutrient removal for all stages are summarized in table 2 4 discussion in this study we investigated the effect of an increasing fraction of the total acetate load on the morphology of ags enriched for anaerobic pha formation through ebpr stage i acetate was dosed aerobically at a rate that forced transport limited uptake this simulated rbcod leaking through an anaerobic phase as well as the release of rbcod from slowly biodegradable cod during aeration these conditions are known to result in the proliferation of filamentous bacteria and poor settling activated sludge chudoba 1985 smooth granular sludge morphology and good settleability svi10 30 40 ml g up to and including 20 aerobic acetate load stage ii were maintained paos were able to aerobically compete with aerobic heterotrophic organisms for acetate uptake and oxygen this ability of paos has been previously described for flocculent sludge kuba et al 1994 pijuan et al 2005 and shown to aid in controlling the svi in flocculent sludge martins et al 2004a although a flocculent sludge fraction with filamentous bacteria formed when acetate was partially fed aerobically the fraction in the reactor remained negligible due to selective wasting based on settling speed additionally bottom feeding favoured paos growing in well settling granules and contributed maximally to the ability to aerobically compete for acetate this work underlines that the selection principles that result in ags at the same time contribute to mitigation of the adverse effects of an aerobic rbcod load on sludge morphology 4 1 theoretical aspects of sludge morphology selection for anaerobic rbcod conversion to storage polymers results in well settling flocculent sludge martins et al 2004a these slow growing organisms generally form dense biofilms de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 van loosdrecht et al 1995 and transport limitation of the electron acceptor in a subsequent stage does not affect the growth morphology it was hypothesised that the ability of these slow growing organisms to aerobically convert rbcod also reduces the fraction consumed for growth of filamentous bacteria when part of the rbcod load was available under aerobic conditions martins et al 2004a similarly the majority of the growth of filamentous bacteria was found in suspension in this study stage ii fig 3b while filamentous outgrowth on granules remained limited stage ii fig 3a at least up to 20 aerobic acetate load could be sustained without adverse effect on settleability of flocculent sludge enriched for ebpr martins et al 2004a but the upper limit was not reported at least the same extent of stability was observed for ags in this study mainly anaerobic acetate uptake capacity thus ensures the aerobic competition for substrate uptake with ordinary heterotrophs the morphological fate of aerobically consumed acetate by ordinary heterotrophs observed in this study was in line with martins et al 2003b 2003a who formulated the hypothesis that transport limited aerobic uptake of substrates drives the formation of poor settling sludge transport limited uptake rates of either rbcod or oxygen due to low bulk concentrations favours one dimensional growth in the direction of the concentration gradient the specific morphology that causes the poor settleability depends on the type aerobic presence of rbcod which can be divided into two categories negligible bulk rbcod concentrations during a large part of the aerated phase e g from hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod or continuous supply or rbcod to the aeration zone in continuous flow reactors from incomplete anaerobic uptake or high bulk rbcod concentrations during a short pulse in the first part of the aerated phase e g from incomplete anaerobic uptake in sbrs for the first category mainly suspended filamentous bacteria were found in this study aerobically growing on the low concentration of acetate from active feeding during the majority of the aerated time stage ii fig 3b this is similar as previously observed for acetate fed cstrs where the low concentration of acetate also resulted in growth of mainly filamentous bacteria van niekerk et al 1987 the second category was observed when the significant decrease in the anaerobic acetate uptake after loss of ebpr section 4 3 caused a pulse of acetate at the start of aeration during this initial pulse of acetate the transport limitation switched to oxygen this led to overgrowth of the filamentous bacteria in suspension and attached to granular surfaces the finger like flocs that formed in this study resembled observations from work on flocculation by crabtree et al 1966 and selects for aerobic storage of acetate rather than direct growth the similarly shaped flocs and finger like films that formed on granular surfaces closely resembled those from work performed on granular sludge with completely aerobic pulse feeding there the relatively low do all between 2 and 4 mg o2 l led to transport limitation and high shear stress was required to erode this outgrowth and achieve well settling granular sludge beun et al 1999 morgenroth et al 1997 mosquera corral et al 2005 these observations emphasize that aerobic transport limitation in substrate uptake drives irregular growth in activated sludge as well as granular systems as was shown in a recent modelling study by wu et al 2020 as well combined with the level of shear and mixing the bulk concentration and duration of aerobic presence of rbcod thus determine the extent of the transport limitation and overall effect of sludge morphology 4 2 ags reactor operation and morphological effect of rbcod minor filamentous outgrowth on granular surfaces was observed at 20 aerobic acetate load supporting a good resilience towards acetate presence stage ii fig 3a consequently the majority of the aerobic growth on acetate formed suspended filamentous bacteria stage ii fig 3b the large difference in settling speed of both fractions allowed for efficient wasting of most filamentous bacteria and prevented an increase in svi furthermore anaerobic bottom feeding favours pha storage in the granular sludge fraction in this study leading to a significant pao fraction in the granules layer et al 2019 the pao fraction therefore competed substantially for aerobically available acetate with filamentous bacteria the selection for anaerobic pha formation and selective wasting contribute to maintaining a smooth granular morphology and good settleability the effect of aerobic conversion of rbcod on granular sludge morphology previously enriched for anaerobic storage has been generalized in fig 6 a in stage iii the loss of significant anaerobic storage leads to mainly aerobic conversion of rbcod as was observed in this study the aerobic competition for rbcod will be more in favour of flocculent growth or filamentous bacteria fig 6b since this becomes the main growth morphology selective wasting is insufficient to maintain stable granulation and eventually results in loss of granulation when granular sludge morphology has deteriorated or is not well established it can strongly hinder the start up or recovery of granular sludge morphology in line with this reasoning the svi10 did not improve in this study until after the active aerobic feeding was stopped and complete anaerobic acetate feeding was applied in stage iv the svi10 recovered substantially within one srt with the formation of new granules and increase in mlvss the recovery of the sludge volume took approximately 2 3 srts in lab scale reactors the waste sludge withdrawal is less optimised for selection compared to full scale plants which could result in different time scales for recovery on the other hand the less favourable substrate composition of sewage i e not only rbcod might result in slower recovery of the sludge volume 4 3 limits of morphological stabilization of ags by anaerobic pha storage the experimental results showed that phosphate uptake was negatively influenced each time by an increase in the aerobic feeding rate of acetate likely the decreased phosphate uptake rate was the result of the paos modulating their metabolism towards storage in the presence of an electron acceptor kuba et al 1994 the simultaneous aerobic acetate uptake seems to limit the phosphate uptake rate guisasola et al 2004 pijuan et al 2005 the incomplete aerobic phosphate uptake initiated the cascaded collapse of biological phosphorus removal fig 5 through the gradual decrease in polyphosphate storage pool fig 4b as reported also by pijuan et al 2006 the latter resulted in complete loss of p removal good granular morphology due to anaerobic storage of rbcod can thus be maintained if the combination of the aerobic rbcod uptake rate and the aerobic load allows for sufficient phosphate uptake and glycogen synthesis in principle granular stability is not dependant on paos or ebpr de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 and stable granular systems with glycogen accumulating organisms have been regularly reported meyer et al 2003 pronk et al 2015b the short circuit flows observed during anaerobic feeding shortly after loss of p removal likely minimized the effective anaerobic contact time and prevented continued selection for anaerobic conversion of acetate to pha by glycogen accumulating organisms future studies should focus on the impact of rbcod availability on the phosphate removal process and the risk of gaos outcompeting paos to ensure good phosphate removal 4 4 considerations for full scale ags processes aerobic presence of rbcod has potential consequences for process stability in full scale ags reactors the rate at which rbcod becomes available in the bulk and the duration of availability compared to the total aerated time are the critical parameters to maintain stable granulation section 4 3 in practice these are determined by the reactor design i e a sbr or a continuous flow reactor and the source of rbcod i e incomplete anaerobic uptake of rbcod or aerobic hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod see section 4 1 in case of incomplete anaerobic rbcod uptake it will result in a very dilute availability of rbcod during the complete residence time of the mixed aeration zone in continuous flow reactors as this study showed dilute availability of acetate during most of the aerated time was detrimental to the anaerobic acetate uptake capacity and sludge morphology due to insufficient aerobic phosphate uptake stage iii on the other hand sbrs will have a higher residual rbcod concentration at the start of the aeration phase for a relatively short time once active aerobic dosage of acetate was stopped in stage iv acetate was only present during aeration for a short time 10 15 min of 110 min since short circuit flows through the sludge bed still occurred during anaerobic feeding despite this aerobic acetate load phosphate uptake and sludge morphology recovered fig 3a stage iv our results therefore indicate that sbrs will be less prone to deterioration of granular morphology compared to continuous flow reactors thus it of vital importance for granular stability in continuous flow reactors to limit the rbcod presence in the aeration zones besides incomplete anaerobic uptake aerobic availability of rbcod will also arise from aerobic hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable cod that is not converted anaerobically de kreuk et al 2010 layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015a particulate cod will either be consumed by protozoa or incorporated in the flocculent sludge fraction before being hydrolysed martins et al 2011 the hydrolysis products will then be converted into more flocculent sludge a good selective removal of the flocculent sludge fraction is therefore required for keeping a stable granular sludge bed note that a certain level of flocculent sludge is always present in ags plants treating sewage and has been shown to aid in achieving good suspended solids effluent quality van dijk et al 2018 the release rate of both sources of rbcod are relatively slow and will always result in negligible residual concentrations and transport limited uptake rates but continuous flow reactors will still be more affected due to the intrinsic dilution in the mixed aeration zone compared to sbrs when granular sludge is well established the presence of a large pha storing fraction paos and gaos in the microbial community will stabilise the granular morphology by competing with more flocculent growth for rbcod during aeration a recent study by ali et al 2019 showed a three fold higher level of enrichment of paos in the largest granular size fraction 1 0 mm 60 of biomass than in the smaller granules and flocculent sludge 1 0 mm 40 of biomass fraction in a full scale nereda the extra selection for pao and thus pha storage increases the capacity for aerobic rbcod uptake in the largest granular sludge fraction this limits the negative impact of aerobic presence of rbcod on the granular morphology 5 conclusion selection for anaerobic storage of rbcod in ags through ebpr limited the adverse effect of a partial aerobic rbcod load on sludge morphology through aerobic competition for substrate uptake with ordinary heterotrophs 20 aerobic acetate load at dosage rate of 4 mg cod g vss h sufficient aerobic competition could be maintained while the combined negative effect of the aerobic rbcod uptake rate and the aerobic rbcod load on phosphate uptake paos still allowed for full p removal the reactor configuration with anaerobic bottom feeding and selective wasting of formed slow settling flocculent sludge further limited the negative effect of aerobic presence of rbcod on the sludge morphology of ags loss of anaerobic rbcod uptake and aerobic competition deteriorated the granular sludge morphology due to increased aerobic growth of finger like structures on the granules and as flocs in suspension 20 aerobic acetate load at dosage rate of 8 mg cod g vss h finger like structures on the granular surfaces provoked non uniform flow through the sludge bed during anaerobic feeding resulting in extra acetate availability in the aerated phase and further deterioration of the granular sludge morphology recovery of the sludge morphology through the formation of new smooth granules occurred only after active aerobic feeding of acetate was stopped it is therefore important to ensure maximum anaerobic rbcod removal and prevent transport limited substrate uptake rates in the aeration phase during recovery or start up in general the sludge morphology of ags systems with good anaerobic storage of rbcod can be considered resilient to low concentrations of rbcod under aerobic conditions the selection principles that result in ags formation also contribute to mitigation of the adverse effects of low aerobic rbcod concentrations on settleability funding this work was financed by the delfland water authority delfluent services b v evides industriewater the rijnland water

burkholderiaceae were not retrieved phototrophic component was also abundant in all plastisphere samples with the main asvs affiliated to cyanobacteria ranging from 0 2 to 61 20 where the principal populations were members of the leptolyngbyaceae and pseudoanabaenaceae families further analysis by direct light microscopy also revealed the occurrence of chroococcalean cyanobacteria mainly aphanothece spp chroococcus spp and synechocystis spp moreover three oscillatorialean phormidium sp leptolyngbya sp pseudoanabaena sp and one nostocalean taxon calothrix sp were also present in addition in most samples different diatom genera were found primarily the benthonic forms achnanhes cymbella gomphonema navicula and nitzschia green algae members belonging to chlorophyceae were observed in all samples mainly cladophora sp and stigeoclonium sp noteworthy independent on sampling site freshwater biofilm communities shared a core microbiome constituted by asvs affiliated to 10

the most abundant fig 4b interestingly further analyses of whole data set revealed that plastisphere and suspended communities shared in all the sampling sites asvs affiliated to three families rhodobacteraceae sphingomonadaceae and burkholderiaceae fig 4c asvs affiliated to propionibacteriaceae hyphomonadaceae rhizobiaceae rhodocyclaceae and to xanthomonadaceae were found only in biofilm communities to determine the establishment of plastic specific taxa the composition of the biofilm communities attached on three different polymers pe pp and pa collected from all the sampled sites was compared fig 5 a asvs affiliated to families sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae were found in all the analyzed biofilms independently of polymer type on the contrary irrespective of the sampling site asvs affiliated to rhizobiaceae and burkholderiaceae were exclusively found in pp biofilms while pa substrata were exclusively colonized by members of flavobacteriaceae arcobacteraceae and micavibrionaceae finally the differences in taxon composition of plastisphere belonging to different degradation classes were also evaluated fig 5b remarkably independent on the sampling site and the microplastic types shared families number increased with degradation level increase fig 5c 3 5 in situdetection of biofilm forming microorganisms and community architecture biofilm composition and 3d structure were evaluated by fish and clsm analysis microbial assemblages patchy distributed and with different thickness and voids in biofilm structure were observed figs 6 and 7 thicker biofilm portions up to 30 μm were characterized by filamentous prokaryotic forms fig 6 belonging to oscillatoriales order phylum cyanobacteria along with filamentous and or ramified microalgae diatom assemblages were abundant in almost all analyzed communities where navicula spp and nitzschia spp recognizable from their cell dimensions and chloroplast morphology were the dominant forms bacteria micro colonies were interspersed in biofilms matrix fish analysis with oligonucleotide probes targeting the main bacterial groups highlighted by high throughput sequencing showed that gammaproteobacteria and in particular members of burkolderiaceae family were abundant in most of the analyzed samples fig 6j l moreover clsm observations allowed 3 d reconstruction of analysed plastic particles images showed the evident adhesion of biofilm forming microorganisms on plastic surfaces fig 7d g 4 discussion recognition that mps can be a vehicle for the microbial dispersal in aquatic ecosystems has intensified studies on microbial ecology of the plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 in particular the use of molecular techniques is increasing our knowledge on diversity of biofilm communities thriving on microplastics in marine environments xu et al 2019 kirstein et al 2018 amaral zettler et al 2015 oberbeckmann et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 despite the well documented widespread presence of mps also in freshwater habitats koelmans et al 2019 studies on plastisphere in these environments are still rare mc cormick et al 2016 parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 to date none investigation on microorganisms attached to mps in lakes has been conducted although lentic systems role as mps sink and source of microplastics is well documented eerkes medrano et al 2015 recent studies performed on italian lentic systems sighicelli et al 2018 revealed a significant presence of mps whose shape distribution and composition was comparable with those found in other lakes li et al 2018 to address the lack of information on plastisphere microbiome composition and to evaluate the eventual selection and recruitment of specific taxa from the planktonic community this study analysed plastisphere and associated water communities in the main italian lakes differences were observed in taxon composition among biofilm and planktonic communities in line with several previous studies conducted in marine environments xu et al 2019 frere et al 2018 kirstein et al 2018 amaral zettler et al 2015 de tender et al 2015 and the few data available on the plastisphere in freshwater ecosystems hoellein et al 2017 mc cormick et al 2016 2014 this finding suggests that plastic particles may play an important selective role that deserves careful evaluation as plastisphere follows the same transport and distribution in the trophic chain taxa affiliated to alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the main component of plastisphere communities in freshwater lakes consistently with the scant data available from freshwater sources miao et al 2019 parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 mc cormick et al 2016 independently on mp types and the sample site a core microbiome was found in the freshwater plastisphere communities primarily composed by members of sphingomonadaceae rhodobacteraceae burkholderiaceae and illumatobacteraceae families most of retrieved genera are known biofilm formers besemer 2016 besemer et al 2012 in detail many sphingomonadaceae species were found in biofilms grown in artificial environments e g in water distribution or cooling water systems di gregorio et al 2017 lührig et al 2015 wang et al 2013 furthermore different species of rhodobacteraceae are important components of aquatic microbial biofilms besemer et al 2016 in addition burkolderiaceae members were found in biofilm occurring in membrane bioreactors ziegler et al 2016 in streams besemer et al 2012 and in biofilms formed on plastics in drinking water facilities kalbach et al 2000 sphingomonadaceae and burkholderiaceae families include generalist microorganisms with widespread distribution in aquatic systems able to utilize a wide range of organic compounds and to grow under different nutrient conditions balkwill et al 2006 noteworthy most asvs affiliated to sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae were also found in sampled planktonic communities it is known that different members of these families possess the capability to shift from a motile to a sessile lifestyle thus it is possible that mp substrata may select from water column such microorganisms which likely drive the initial biofilm formation and allow for the further colonization by other microbial populations as found for biofilms occurring in freshwater natural systems besemer et al 2012 and suggested for artificial systems di gregorio et al 2017 to initiate biofilm formation pioneer microorganisms would be able of adhering to bare substratum and then to co aggregate several species of sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae can produce exopolysaccharides and surface adhesion proteins kviatkovski and minz 2015 bala subramanian et al 2010 balkwill et al 2006 which may facilitate the colonization process the putative role of sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae members as initial plastic colonizers seems to be consistent with results obtained by comparing bacterial composition of biofilms sampled from microplastics with different degradation levels independent on sampling site and mp types only asvs affiliated to these two families were indeed shared by biofilms grown on mps with the lowest degradation level degradation level is strictly linked to mps residence time in the water body and likely this can be mirrored by the age stage of development of attached communities with biofilms at initial development stage associated to mps with lower degradation level the number of taxa shared by biofilms then increased with increase of degradation level sem analysis mps surface revealed that higher roughness of mp surface corresponding to higher degradation level ci 1 was associated to the presence of more complex biofilms the latter evidence may also explain why bacterial composition of biofilms seems not substantially differ among the diverse polymers although many studies in marine environments highlighted the dependence of microbial species composition on plastic types xu et al 2019 kirstein et al 2018 oberbeckmann et al 2016 it has been recently hypothesised that typical biofilm formation processes could be the main drivers for biofilm diversity on plastics rather than surface type amaral zettler et al 2020 pinto et al 2019 however long term onsite exposure experiments investigating temporal and spatial variations and succession of plastisphere in freshwater ecosystems are still limited in perspective the study of biofilm communities grown onto appropriate plastic removable substrata placed in lentic ecosystems would enable their diversity to be better understood and may provide data to comprehend mechanisms involved in plastisphere formation the higher abundance of sequences affiliated to oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms differentiates well the biofilm from the water communities all biofilms shared asvs affiliated to different cyanobacterial families light microscope observations confirmed their presence and further allowed to identify most of the microalgal genera present almost of which are typical freshwater biofilm colonizers phototrophs such as diatoms and cyanobacteria commonly occur in biofilms colonizing plastics exposed to sunlight in marine environments masò et al 2016 oberbeckmann et al 2016 eich et al 2015 carson et al 2013 clsm observations of samples after fish analysis revealed the complex architecture of plastic associated biofilms overall patchy microbial colonization of substrata occurred similarly to biofilms from different natural and artificial environments di gregorio et al 2017 donlan et al 2002 wimpenny et al 2000 in line with sequencing data and optical microscope observation most of the images of biofilms 3 d reconstruction showed dense aggregates of different cyanobacterial morphotypes together with green algae taxa and micro colonies of different bacterial microorganisms oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms like cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae dominate the top layer of phototrophic biofilms and they may release autochthonous organic carbon metabolites generated from photosynthesis and extracellular polymeric substances eps available to support heterotrophic metabolism according to sequencing data clsm fish analysis also revealed the occurrence of most burkolderaceae members associated to phototrophic microorganisms this association reported also in biofilms of freshwater systems zancarini et al 2017 besemer 2016 is likely due to the capability of burkolderaceae to degrade complex organic matter besemer 2016 even though plastisphere communities shared a core microbiome differences in bacterial taxon composition were found between sampling sites however the observed differences cannot be univocally linked to site conditions in most of the cases as the number of samples analysed for each transect was different among lakes and largely due to the different levels of mps contamination on the contrary the plastisphere from freshwater lakes differed markedly from the control samples characterized by high abundance of marine genera it is known that environmental conditions including salinity gradients may influence microbial composition of plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 geographic differences in microbial composition of plastisphere were previously reported in marine environments at various scales amaral zettler et al 2020 the increasing interest on plastisphere is also due to the evidence that mps can provide substrata that may support growth of microorganisms potentially capable to degrade plastic interestingly we found several potentially polyethylene degrading bacteria as members belonging to flavobacterium rhodococcus and pseudomonas genera in most of the plastisphere analysed pathak and navneet 2017 the presence of ideonella spp in almost all the samples deserves close attention as a new species ideonella sakaiensis recently isolated from a bottle recycling facility was found able to hydrolyze polyethylene terephthalate pet yoshida et al 2016 further investigations should be directed at evaluating if these micro consortia can be good candidates for mp degradation in freshwater environments dussud et al 2018 5 conclusions this study investigated for the first time community composition and structure of microbial biofilms attached to mps sampled from italian lentic ecosystems the plastisphere exhibited a microbial composition different from the corresponding planktonic populations it is here suggested that mps may select from water column microorganisms able to adhere to these substrata i e generalist taxa as members of sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae families that likely act as pioneers thus allowing the further attachment of other microbial colonizers i e members of hyphomonadaceae rhizobiaceae rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae and of cyanobacterial families a core microbiome characterised by typical biofilm forming taxa was found overall different mp materials did not show a strict attachment selectivity for microbial species while different mp degradation levels were linked to the species composition of plastic attached biofilm communities interestingly several bacterial genera previously reported for being able of degrading pe were found in plastisphere samples this finding deserves further attention and

amaral zettler et al 2020 koelmans et al 2019 a significant proportion of plastic produced is not properly disposed and persists for a long time in the environment where the exposure to environmental conditions alters the material and slowly originates plastic debris plastic debris incidence in marine ecosystem was already highlighted in early 70s carpenter and smith 1972 and over the last decades plastic pollution has received growing attention amaral zettler et al 2020 plastic debris is now considered a potential threat to human health and activities eerkes medrano et al 2015 thompson et al 2009 and it is also identified as an emerging pollutant that might contribute to biodiversity loss in aquatic ecosystems in the near to medium term future gall and thompson 2015 sutherland et al 2010 the size of plastic debris ranges from meter to nanometer and plastic particles with an upper size limit of five millimeters are termed microplastics mps the so called primary mps can be sourced from

documented amaral zettler et al 2020 and several authors have reported mps accumulation in marine ecosystems all over the world the buoyant and persistent nature of plastic particles allow their dispersion across large distances throughout the oceans they have even been found in polar regions lusher et al 2015 mid ocean island ivar do sul et al 2013 and deep sea habitats claessens et al 2013 the studies performed on marine environments have highlighted as mps accumulation may strongly alter water ecosystems by increasing foreign debris quantity and by further accumulating transporting and releasing the associated pollutants including heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants pops lambert and wagner 2018 andrady 2011 browne et al 2011 cole et al 2011 mps effects on aquatic organisms as a result of ingestion are well documented botterell et al 2019 amelineau et al 2016 gall and thompson 2015 nerland et al 2014 while few studies have been conducted on plastic associated microbial communities amaral zettler et al 2020 2015 oberbeckmann et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 during transport by water flow mps can be colonized by planktonic microorganisms able to adhere to plastic surfaces with subsequent formation of biofilms amaral zettler et al 2020 surface attached complex microbial communities embedded in an exopolymeric matrix flemming et al 2016 pioneer studies

arcobacter spp mccormick et al 2014 kirstein et al 2016 koelmans et al 2019 biofilm formation and biofouling processes within plastisphere also modulate plastic particles buoyancy causing them to sink into the water column fazey and ryan 2016 moreover some microbial species associated with plastic debris might be involved in biodegradation of plastic polymers debroas et al 2017 yoshida et al 2016 although recent investigations revealed the massive presence of mps in rivers lakes and reservoirs koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2018 lambert and wagner 2018 very little is known on plastisphere in freshwater environments harrison et al 2018 interest is growing especially for lentic environments where accumulated mps may persist for decades due to long water residence time eerkes medrano et al 2015 early studies have shown mp pollution in surface waters of three italian subalpine lakes sighicelli et al 2018 however to date no data are available on plastisphere occurring on mps in the

cannot be explained by standard kinetic processes as the plastic is weathered it remains integral while polymer chains are broken and oxygen is assimilated through oxidation by formation of functional groups such as carboxyl anhydrides and hydroxyls fig 1 supplementary information ci analysis revealed that all polymer items were degraded in particular 25 of the analysed mps fell into degradation class i 21 in class ii 29 in class iii and 25 in class iv where the degradation processes are more evident ci 1 sem analysis of plastic surfaces confirmed that the higher the ci value the greater the

populations were members of the leptolyngbyaceae and pseudoanabaenaceae families further analysis by direct light microscopy also revealed the occurrence of chroococcalean cyanobacteria mainly aphanothece spp chroococcus spp and synechocystis spp moreover three oscillatorialean phormidium sp leptolyngbya sp pseudoanabaena sp and one nostocalean taxon calothrix sp were also present in addition in most samples different diatom genera were found primarily the benthonic forms achnanhes cymbella gomphonema navicula and nitzschia green algae members belonging to chlorophyceae were observed in all samples mainly cladophora sp and stigeoclonium sp noteworthy independent on sampling site freshwater biofilm communities shared a core microbiome constituted by asvs affiliated to 10

the most abundant fig 4b interestingly further analyses of whole data set revealed that plastisphere and suspended communities shared in all the sampling sites asvs affiliated to three families rhodobacteraceae sphingomonadaceae and burkholderiaceae fig 4c asvs affiliated to propionibacteriaceae hyphomonadaceae rhizobiaceae rhodocyclaceae and to xanthomonadaceae were found only in biofilm communities to determine the establishment of plastic specific taxa the composition of the biofilm communities attached on three different polymers pe pp and pa collected from all the sampled sites was compared fig 5 a asvs affiliated to families sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae were found in all the analyzed biofilms independently of polymer type on the contrary irrespective of the sampling site asvs affiliated to rhizobiaceae and burkholderiaceae were exclusively found in pp biofilms while pa substrata were exclusively colonized by members of flavobacteriaceae arcobacteraceae and micavibrionaceae finally the differences in taxon composition of plastisphere belonging to different degradation classes were also evaluated fig 5b remarkably independent on the sampling site and the microplastic types shared families number increased with degradation level increase fig 5c 3 5 in situdetection of biofilm forming microorganisms and community architecture biofilm composition and 3d structure were evaluated by fish and clsm analysis microbial assemblages patchy distributed and with different thickness and voids in biofilm structure were observed figs 6 and 7 thicker biofilm

assemblages were abundant in almost all analyzed communities where navicula spp and nitzschia spp recognizable from their cell dimensions and chloroplast morphology were the dominant forms bacteria micro colonies were interspersed in biofilms matrix fish analysis with oligonucleotide probes targeting the main bacterial groups highlighted by high throughput sequencing showed that gammaproteobacteria and in particular members of burkolderiaceae family were abundant in most of the analyzed samples fig 6j l moreover clsm observations allowed 3 d reconstruction of analysed plastic particles images showed the evident adhesion of biofilm forming microorganisms on plastic surfaces fig 7d g 4 discussion recognition that mps can be a vehicle for the microbial dispersal in aquatic ecosystems has intensified studies on microbial ecology of the plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 in particular the use of molecular techniques is increasing our knowledge on diversity of biofilm communities thriving on microplastics in marine environments xu et al 2019 kirstein et al 2018 amaral zettler et al 2015 oberbeckmann et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 despite the well documented widespread presence of mps also in freshwater habitats koelmans et al 2019 studies on plastisphere in these environments are still rare mc cormick et al 2016 parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 to date none investigation on microorganisms attached to mps in lakes has been conducted although lentic systems role as mps sink and source of microplastics is well documented eerkes medrano et al 2015 recent studies performed on italian lentic systems sighicelli et al 2018 revealed a significant presence of mps whose shape distribution and composition was comparable with those found in other lakes li et al 2018 to address the lack of information on plastisphere microbiome composition and to evaluate the eventual selection and recruitment of specific taxa from the planktonic community this study analysed plastisphere and associated water communities in the main italian lakes differences were observed in taxon composition among biofilm and planktonic communities in line with several previous studies conducted in marine environments xu et al 2019 frere et al 2018 kirstein et al 2018 amaral zettler et al 2015 de tender et al 2015 and the few data available on the plastisphere in freshwater ecosystems hoellein et al 2017 mc cormick et al 2016 2014 this finding suggests that plastic particles may play an important selective role that deserves careful evaluation as plastisphere follows the same transport and distribution in the trophic chain taxa affiliated to alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the main component of plastisphere communities in freshwater lakes consistently with the scant data available from freshwater sources miao et al 2019 parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 mc cormick et al 2016 independently on mp types and the sample site a core microbiome was found in the freshwater plastisphere communities primarily composed by members of sphingomonadaceae rhodobacteraceae burkholderiaceae and illumatobacteraceae families most of retrieved genera are known biofilm formers besemer 2016 besemer et al 2012 in detail many sphingomonadaceae species were found in biofilms grown in artificial environments e g in water distribution or cooling water systems di gregorio et al 2017 lührig et al 2015 wang et al 2013 furthermore different species of rhodobacteraceae are important components of aquatic microbial biofilms besemer et al 2016 in addition burkolderiaceae members were found in biofilm occurring in membrane bioreactors ziegler et al 2016 in streams besemer et al 2012 and in biofilms formed on plastics in drinking water facilities kalbach et al 2000 sphingomonadaceae and burkholderiaceae families include generalist microorganisms with widespread distribution in aquatic systems able to utilize a wide range of organic compounds and to grow under different nutrient conditions balkwill et al 2006 noteworthy most asvs affiliated to sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae were also found in sampled planktonic communities it is known that different members of these families possess the capability to shift from a motile to a sessile lifestyle thus it is possible that mp substrata may select from water column such microorganisms which likely drive the initial biofilm formation and allow for the further colonization by other microbial populations as found for biofilms occurring in freshwater natural systems besemer et al 2012 and suggested for artificial systems di gregorio et al 2017 to initiate biofilm formation pioneer microorganisms would be able of adhering to bare substratum and then to co aggregate several species of sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae can produce exopolysaccharides and surface adhesion proteins kviatkovski and minz 2015 bala subramanian et al 2010 balkwill et al 2006 which may facilitate the colonization process the putative role of sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae members as initial plastic colonizers seems to be consistent with results obtained by comparing bacterial composition of biofilms sampled from microplastics with different degradation levels independent on sampling site and mp types only asvs affiliated to these two families were indeed shared by biofilms grown on mps with the lowest degradation level degradation level is strictly linked to mps residence time in the water body and likely this can be mirrored by the age stage of development of attached communities with biofilms at initial development stage associated to mps with lower degradation level the number of taxa shared by biofilms then increased with increase of degradation level sem analysis mps surface revealed that higher roughness of mp surface corresponding to higher degradation level ci 1 was associated to the presence of more complex biofilms the latter evidence may also explain why bacterial composition of biofilms seems not substantially differ among the diverse polymers although many studies in marine environments highlighted the dependence of microbial species composition on plastic types xu et al 2019 kirstein et al 2018 oberbeckmann et al 2016 it has been recently hypothesised that typical biofilm formation processes could be the main drivers for biofilm diversity on plastics rather than surface type amaral zettler et al 2020 pinto et al 2019 however long term onsite exposure experiments investigating temporal and spatial variations and succession of plastisphere in freshwater ecosystems are still limited in perspective the study of biofilm communities grown onto appropriate plastic removable substrata placed in lentic ecosystems would enable their diversity to be better understood and may provide data to comprehend mechanisms involved in plastisphere formation the higher abundance of sequences affiliated to oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms differentiates well the biofilm from the water communities all biofilms shared asvs affiliated to different cyanobacterial families light microscope observations confirmed their presence and further allowed to identify most of the microalgal genera present almost of which are typical freshwater biofilm colonizers phototrophs such as diatoms and cyanobacteria commonly occur in biofilms colonizing plastics exposed to sunlight in marine environments masò et al 2016 oberbeckmann et al 2016 eich et al 2015 carson et al 2013 clsm observations of samples after fish analysis revealed the complex architecture of plastic associated biofilms overall patchy microbial colonization of substrata occurred similarly to biofilms from different natural and artificial environments di gregorio et al 2017 donlan et al 2002 wimpenny et al 2000 in line with sequencing data and optical microscope observation most of the images of biofilms 3 d reconstruction showed dense aggregates of different cyanobacterial morphotypes together with green algae taxa and micro colonies of different bacterial microorganisms oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms like cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae dominate the top layer of phototrophic biofilms and they may release autochthonous organic carbon metabolites generated from photosynthesis and extracellular polymeric substances eps available to support heterotrophic metabolism according to sequencing data clsm fish analysis also revealed the occurrence of most burkolderaceae members associated to phototrophic microorganisms this association reported also in biofilms of freshwater systems zancarini et al 2017 besemer 2016 is likely due to the capability of burkolderaceae to degrade complex organic matter besemer 2016 even though plastisphere communities shared a core microbiome differences in bacterial taxon composition were found between sampling sites however the observed differences cannot be univocally linked to site conditions in most of the cases as the number of samples analysed for each transect was different among lakes and largely due to the different levels of mps contamination on the contrary the plastisphere from freshwater lakes differed markedly from the control samples characterized by high abundance of marine genera it is known that environmental conditions including salinity gradients may influence microbial composition of plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 geographic differences in microbial composition of plastisphere were previously reported in marine environments at various scales amaral zettler et al 2020 the increasing interest on plastisphere is also due to the evidence that mps can provide substrata that may support growth of microorganisms potentially capable to degrade plastic interestingly we found several potentially polyethylene degrading bacteria as members belonging to flavobacterium rhodococcus and pseudomonas genera in most of the plastisphere analysed pathak and navneet 2017 the presence of ideonella spp in almost all the samples deserves close attention as a new species ideonella sakaiensis recently isolated from a bottle recycling facility was found able to hydrolyze polyethylene terephthalate pet yoshida et al 2016 further investigations should be directed at evaluating if these micro consortia can be good candidates for mp degradation in freshwater environments dussud et al 2018 5 conclusions this study investigated for the first time community composition and structure of microbial biofilms attached to mps sampled from italian lentic ecosystems the plastisphere exhibited a microbial composition different from the corresponding planktonic populations it is here suggested that mps may select from water column microorganisms able to adhere to these substrata i e generalist taxa as members of sphingomonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae families that likely act as pioneers thus allowing the further attachment of other microbial colonizers i e members of hyphomonadaceae rhizobiaceae rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae and of cyanobacterial families a core microbiome characterised by typical biofilm forming taxa was found overall different mp materials did not show a strict attachment selectivity for microbial species while different mp degradation levels were linked to the species composition of plastic attached biofilm communities interestingly several bacterial genera previously reported for being able of degrading pe were found in plastisphere samples this finding deserves further attention and

17482,disposal of the increasingly huge amounts of sewage sludge ses has become an impending problem worldwide to solve this problem a high solid anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr was used for the anaerobic co digestion acod of ses and food waste fw this study investigated the effects of ses ratio on the methanogenic performance of the acod with a gradual increase value from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 total solids based the results showed that the highest methanogenic performance was achieved at mono fw digestion as for the co digestion the optimal fw ses ratio for methanogenic performance was 75 25 among all the mixing ratios the cod based biogas yield and methane yield were 0 498 l biogas g codfed and 0 295 l ch4 g codfed at this optimal mixing ratio which were 67 7 and 67 6 higher than those of the mono ses digestion respectively the upgraded values were attributed to the improved hydrolysis ratio by 8 14 and the balanced carbon to nitrogen c n ratio by co digestion with fw which synergistically stimulated methanogenesis ratio by 81 0 the continuous membrane filtration property was investigated and four typical trans membrane pressure tmp variation curves at different fouling degrees were determined the membrane could sustainably operate at a flux of 6 l m2 h lmh at the mixed liquor total solids mlts concentration of 25 30 g l the combination of continuous membrane filtration property particle size distribution of the mixed liquor and the external forces analysis was firstly applied to unravel the membrane fouling mechanism of a high solid anmbr the result of this study will contribute to the establishment of an efficient fw and ses treatment strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword sewage sludge food waste anaerobic co digestion high solid anmbr fouling mechanism 1 introduction the volume of sewage sludge ses produced by municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps is huge and continues to increase due to the population growth and the development of public sewer systems according to the japan s ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2019 the annual production of dry ses in japan is 2 3 mt in the united states european union and china estimates place the annual production of dry ses at 17 8 9 0 and 11 8 mt wu et al 2020 ses causes serious pollution without appropriate management due to the toxic substances such as organic contaminants pathogens and heavy metals the disposal of such a large amount of ses has become a pressing challenge worldwide the conventional methods for ses treatment include land application landfilling and incineration however land application is often accompanied by strong odors and ses contains hazardous organic chemicals heavy metals microbial pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria landfilling is no longer viable due to the shortage of land space and the pollution of local environment such as contamination of groundwater aquifers and soil incineration of sludge usually requires supplementary fuel and the energy balance of the process is not high as sludge needs drying before incinerating in contrast anaerobic digestion ad a microbe mediated biotechnology is gaining increasing attention due to organic waste reduction stabilization and methane production which can be used as renewable energy however the mono ses digestion tends to be slow because of its low biodegradability and insufficient carbon source zhen et al 2017 thus improving ses methane production efficiency has been projected as an urgent agenda in wwtps to address these issues anaerobic co digestion acod has been explored and applied in recent years previous studies have documented that acod can improve methane production compared to mono ses due to its superior in terms of nutrient balance system stability toxic agent dilution moisture adjustment high microbial consortia diversity and their synergistic impacts hagos et al 2017 rabii et al 2019 for instance pan et al found that food waste fw ses ratio of 0 5 0 5 achieved an accumulative methane yield of 0 198 0 011 l ch4 g vs on day 5 which was 4 85 and 2 75 times higher than that of mono ses and fw digestion indicating the existence of synergistic effects in acod pan et al 2019 contradictory findings were also reported that no synergetic effect was found in the acod of fw and ses gu et al 2020 liu et al 2016 koch et al s results have shown that the biogas yield increased from 0 32 to 0 35 l ch4 g vs when fw was added at a ratio of 10 w w and the corresponding energy recovery can offset more than 50 of the total energy consumption in wwtps koch et al 2016 however although the feasibility of acod in the treatment of organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw has been confirmed there are two main problems in conventional acod notably low methane production rate and poor system stability due to the washout of the slow growing methanogens and undigested organic wastes ma et al 2018 the anmbr is an ideal alternative to overcome these problems as the membrane ensures complete solids retention including the slow growing methanogens and the undigested organic wastes the organic wastes can be degraded more rapidly and thoroughly and thus an increased biogas production rate and an improved effluent quality can be achieved kaan et al 2019 the solids retention time srt can be controlled separately from the hydraulic retention time hrt in the anmbr the proper prolonged srt favors the growth of anaerobic microorganisms and reduces the footprint pileggi and parker 2017 furthermore because soluble methane fermentation inhibitors such as ammonia are filtered out with permeate due to their dissolved state the anaerobic process in the anmbr is remarkably stable kanai et al 2010 at the same time the solubilizing nutrients e g ammonia and phosphorus can be recovered for fertilizer production song et al 2020 the high solid anmbr ensures a high and efficient organic degradation and superior effluent quality due to the low food microorganism f m ratio as solid contents in ses and fw are high it is sensible to opt for a high solid anmbr however the high solid concentration leads to a greater membrane fouling propensity and a lower operational flux for example meng et al found that the membrane fouling resistance increased exponentially with increasing mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration meng et al 2007a it was also reported that the sustainable flux decreased from 13 2 0 3 to 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh with the increase of mixed liquor total solids mlts from 10 to 15 20 and 25 g l during fw treatment cheng et al 2020a based on a systematic literature review the following questions need to be answered 1 is the anmbr feasible for high solid fw and ses treatment considering the high fouling propensity 2 does synergistic effect exist in fw and ses co digestion in the anmbr 3 what is the fouling mechanism of the high solid anmbr in fw and ses co digestion the novelty of this work lies in 1 investigating the cod based biogas and methane yield and discussing the hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis reaction ratios under different fw ses ratios to determine whether there exists synergetic effect in the acod and 2 revealing the membrane fouling mechanism by the combination of continuous membrane filtration property illustration particle size distribution investigation and external forces analysis in summary the investigation of methanogenic performance and membrane fouling were employed to open the black box of fw and ses co digestion in the anmbr the results of this study are expected to promote the development and application of anmbrs in municipal organic solid waste treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 rationale of this study the long term continuous experiment was divided into six stages based on ses ratio and hrt as shown in table 1 the high solid anmbr only treated fw at an hrt of 30 days in stage 1 and then hrt was decreased to 15 days in stage 2 6 from stage 3 ses was gradually added to replace fw at an increased ratio from 25 stage 3 to 50 stage 4 75 stage 5 and 100 stage 6 2 2 feedstock and inoculum the co substrates used in this study were fw and ses the fw was prepared according to our previous article cheng et al 2018 the ses was composed of primary sludge and excess sludge collected from a wwtp in sendai japan the mass ratio of the primary sludge and excess sludge in this study was 45 55 ts based by referring to their actual production in a wwtp the characteristics of the substrate at each stage are presented in table 2 to prevent substrate deterioration a cooling water circulator neocool circulator cf301 yamatokagaku co ltd was used to

fouling mechanism the mixed liquor and the mixed liquor supernatant were subjected to the psd analysis the samples were analyzed using the laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk with a detection range of 0 01 4000 µm the psd analysis was performed with three parallel samples and five measurements of each sample were taken and the average result was reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 the high solid anmbr performance due to the high feeding concentration the mlts in the anmbr increased quickly this anmbr was controlled at a mlts concentration of 25 30 g l which is much higher than the most commonly used value 5 15 g l in municipal wastewater treatment and is regarded as a high solid anmbr cheng et al 2020b the performance of this high solid anmbr was comprehensively evaluated from various aspects including biogas production reaction ratios of the four ad steps organic matter removal efficiency and soluble organic matter rejection efficiency effluent quality and membrane filtration properties throughout the long term continuous experiment the whole experiment lasted for 272 days and was divided into six stages based on ses ratio and hrt as shown in fig 1 the ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas were stable in the range of 59 61 and 38 40 under mono fw digestion with the decrease of hrt from 30 to 15 days the biogas production rate increased from 1 26 0 16 to 3 00 0 25 l l reactor d the biogas production rate in stage 2 was more than twice that in stage 1 which was due to the increased substrate concentration as shown in table 2 the ts vs and cod concentration increased from 44 4 6 0 42 3 5 9 and 69 2 14 6 g l to 51 8 4 8 49 4 4 8 and 82 1 16 6 g l respectively it is also clear from fig 1 that as ses ratio increased from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 the biogas production rates decreased from 3 00 0 25 to 2 46 0 30 1 63 0 23 1 31 0 14 and 1 30 0 17 l l reactor d respectively it should be noted that the biogas production rate under the ses ratio of 25 and 100 in this study were 4 72 times and 5 19 times higher than those reported in a previous article mattioli et al 2017 in the acod of ofmsw and ses by a cstr these results confirmed an advanced methanogenic performance of the high solid anmbr than the cstr from the perspective of the biogas production rate the optimal ses ratio for the acod is 25 among all the mixing ratios the reduction in the biogas production with ses ratio might be attributed to the decreased hydrolysis ratio which decreased from 87 5 to 71 6 as the ses ratio increased from 0 to 100 the low hydrolysis is the limited factor for the mono digestion of ses thus different pretreatment methods have been applied to improve hydrolysis such as hydrothermal and alkali thermal treatment gao et al 2020 mahdy et al 2020 zou et al 2020 the low ses hydrolysis was due to the larger amount of inorganic solids or the refractory organic matters as can be seen from table 2 the vs ts ratio of the substrate decreased from 95 3 to 94 5 91 0 88 0 and 83 1 with the increase of ses from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 the ubiquitous inorganic solids mineral compounds embedded in ses could debilitate the bio accessibility and greatly reduce the reaction ratio particularly hydrolysis ratio lin et al 2015 another important reason for the decrease of the biogas production with ses ratio might be the unbalanced nutrition or the improper c n ratio as shown in table 2 the c n ratio decreased from 17 0 0 1 to 15 5 0 1 14 0 0 1 12 5 0 1 and 11 0 0 1 as the ses ratio increased from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 the optimal c n ratio for acod of fw and ses has been determined in the range of 15 20 siddiqui et al 2011 as the c n ratio gradually moved away from the optimal c n ratio with the increase of ses ratio the biogas production rate and biogas yield decreased in a stepwise trend the c n ratio of the excess sludge in this study is 5 5 0 1 it has also been verified that a c n ratio of less than 6 0 can negatively affect the ad process by inhibiting the growth of anaerobic microorganisms especially the syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria due to the low carbon availability and high ammonia concentration mehariya et al 2018 wang et al 2015 combined previous study and the reduced biogas production with ses ratio slight inhibition of the lower c n ratio was speculated the cod based biogas yield l biogas g codfed and methane yield l ch4 g codfed at different ses ratios were also calculated to check whether acod prompted methanogenic performance in the mono digestion groups pure fw and pure ses the results varied greatly as shown in fig 2 fw exhibited a much higher cod based biogas yield 0 548 l biogas g codfed and methane yield 0 324 l ch4 g codfed than those of the ses at 0 297 l biogas g codfed and 0 176 l ch4 g codfed the biogas yields were 0 498 0 450 and 0 386 l biogas g codfed at ses ratio of 25 50 and 75 respectively the corresponding methane yields were 0 295 0 271 and 0 233 l ch4 g codfed respectively fig 2 histogram from these results it can be seen clearly that among all the mixing ratios the anmbr achieved the highest biogas yield at the ses ratio of 25 the biogas yield and methane yield at ses ratio of 25 were 2 63 and 2 79 higher than the simulation values fig 2 dot plot obtained based on the results of mono fw and ses digestion at the same fw ses ratio the biogas yields at ses ratio of 50 and 75 were improved by 6 51 and 7 30 and the corresponding methane yields were improved by 8 40 and 9 39 these improved but not significant values indicated that synergetic effect may exist in the acod by the high solid anmbr gu et al 2020 found that the synergism on methane yields was initially observed but not significant at the end of experiment they considered the co digestion of fw and ses accelerated the hydrolysis due to the addition of readily degradable fw but did not enhance the extent of degradation some researchers reported that no synergetic effect was found and the addition of fw even resulted in the accumulation of vfa and decelerated biogas production liu et al 2016 in contrast a significant synergistic effect was observed at the ses fw ratio of 1 1 with the highest methane yield at 415 ml g vs in wang et al s study 267 and 61 ml g vs higher than the mono ses and fw digestion wang et al 2020 in this study though the synergistic effect was not significant the biogas yield and methane yield at the fw ses ratio of 75 25 were 67 7 and 67 6 higher than those of the mono ses digestion these findings shed light on the impacts of fw addition on the ses anaerobic digestion performance thereby improving the policy making on ses treatment 3 2 effects of the ses ratios on the four steps reaction ratios of the ad process to better understand reaction process synergistic effect and biodegradation kinetics in this acod system the four steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis reaction ratios were analyzed the hydrolysis ratios showed a decreased trend from 87 5 to 71 6 which explained the drop in biogas production as illustrated in section 3 1 compared with the mono ses anaerobic digestion the hydrolysis ratio of the co digestion at the fw ses ratio of 75 25 was enhanced by 8 1 as shown in fig 3 the enhanced hydrolysis ratio is not only due to the higher degradability of fw but also the increased relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria bacteroidales and clostridiales have been ascertained as the key hydrolyzer in anaerobic digesters ju et al 2017 their relative abundances show an increasing trend from 46 8 to 54 4 and 66 2 with the increase of fw ratio from 0 to 50 and 100 fig s2 specifically prolixibacteraceae the dominant family of bacteroidales increased significantly from 21 4 to 35 9 and 56 0 with fw ratio the acidogenesis ratio and acetogenesis ratio at this fw ses ratio were 84 0 and 83 6 respectively which were 80 6 and 82 6 higher than those of the mono ses anaerobic digestion the methanogenesis ratio was 84 2 an 81 0 improvement on that for the mono ses digestion shown in fig 3 e acetoclastic methanosarcinales and hydrogentrophic methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales have been ascertained as major functional guilds for methanogenesis ju et al 2017 the combined relative abundances of the three major methanogens did not show significant change with fw ratio accounting for 94 5 99 5 it is clearly that methanosaeta competed over methanobacterium and the later gained advantages with fw ratio as the abundance of methanosaeta decreased from 73 1 to 41 0 while the abundance of methanobacterium increased from 24 4 to 47 5 fig s3 these results indicated that the predominant pathway for methane production in mono ses digestion fw ratio of 0 was acetoclastic methanogenesis while in mono fw digestion it was in the balance between acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the improved four step reactions ratio explained the synergistic effects and stimulation mechanisms by the addition of fw the enhancement of hydrolysis ratio is limited compared to the ratios for the other three steps the marked improvement in the final methanogenic performance was a further evidence that hydrolysis is the rate limiting step and is responsible for a high low final methanogenic performance for ses digestion ma et al 2018 xiao et al calculated the reaction ratios of the four ad steps of the two stage thermophilic anaerobic digestion of mono fw in the cstr which were at 85 7 85 8 87 5 and 87 2 xiao et al 2018 while the mesophilic hydrolysis ratio at the fw ses ratio of 75 25 in this study was much lower than that in xiao et al s study the acidogenesis acetogenesis and the methanogenesis ratio approached their values this is a clear evidence that the anmbr enhanced methanogenic performance even under a low hydrolysis ratio the methanogenic performance in this study was comparable to that in the thermophilic two stage anaerobic digestion of mono fw digestion by a cstr reactor confirming the advanced high solid anmbr performance than the cstr 3 3 organic matter removal and soluble organic matter rejection efficiency the cod carbohydrate and protein concentrations of the substrate mixed liquor and effluent under each ses ratio were measured and the removal efficiencies were calculated as shown in table 3 the total cod carbohydrate and protein t cod t carbohydrate and t protein of the effluent were all at a very low concentration compared to those of the substrate stabilized in 0 32 0 45 g l 0 03 0 08 g l and 0 13 0 25 g l respectively the t cod t carbohydrate and t protein removal efficiencies were 99 4 0 1 99 7 0 2 and 99 2 0 4 respectively they are much higher than those achieved by the cstr in the range of 67 95 cabbai et al 2016 the concentration of soluble cod carbohydrate and protein s cod s carbohydrate and s protein in the permeate and in the mixed liquor within the reactor is also compared to determine how much of the soluble organic matter was rejected by the membrane and further converted to biogas the relationship between the concentration of soluble organics in the permeate and in the mixed liquor is presented in fig 4 if no soluble organics were rejected the relationship between them should be y x y is the soluble organic matter concentration of the permeate and x is the soluble organic matter concentration of the mixed liquor in the reactor however the relationships of s cod s carbohydrate and s protein are y1 0 0977 x1 0 2971 y2 0 1779 x2 0 0363 and y3 0 2766 x3 0 1089 respectively these results indicate that 1 0 0977 100 1 0 1779 100 1 0 2766 100 namely 90 2 82 2 and 72 3 of the soluble cod carbohydrate and protein were rejected by the membrane the rejection efficiency of s carbohydrate was much higher than s protein which is consistent with yue et al s observation yue et al 2015 this might be due to the fact that the molecular weight of carbohydrate is generally higher than that of protein wu et al 2008 because the high temperature promotes the hydrolysis process and the organic solids are likely to be degraded into small molecules the soluble organic rejection efficiencies of the thermophilic anmbr are lower than these in this study li et al 2020 qiao et al 2013 used a thermophilic anmbr for the acod of coffee ground and activated waste sludge and their soluble organic rejection efficiencies are also lower than those in this study probably owing to the lower hydrolysis ratio in this study due to the lower temperature 37 c this study 57 c their study the smaller membrane pore size 0 1 μm this study 0 2 μm their study the different composition and structure of organic matters as well as different biofilm and foulant layers formed as smith et al state the biofilm or cake layer that develops on the membrane surface not only plays a role in membrane fouling but also contributes to soluble cod removal and superior permeate quality smith et al 2012 it should be noted that thanks to the physical rejection pathway and biological pathway the excess sludge production was 0 17 0 27 g g tsfed in this study much lower than that in the mesophilic two stage ad and temperature phased ad prabhu and mutnuri 2016 and that in the high temperature thermal pretreatment and low temperature thermal alkaline pretreatment ad xiao et al 2020 the organic matter removal and soluble organic matter rejection efficiency analysis demonstrates that both large suspended solids and soluble organic matters were rejected by the membrane which not only resulted in a lower excess sludge production but also contributed to a higher methanogenic performance compared to conventional acod membrane plays a significant role not only in substrates and biomass rejection but also in providing longer sludge retention time srt for keeping the functional microbial groups in balance and thus timely converting the intermediates such as vfas to biogas for instance in this study the vfa in the anmbr was very low 73 8 mg hac l at the hrt of 15 days however the vfa concentration reached 6000 mg l at the same hrt in a cstr even under a lower organic loading rate wang et al 2020 the high vfa concentration in the cstr induced a drastic ph drop from 7 5 to less than 5 0 and finial led to system acidification the much lower vfa in the anmbr was attributed to the proper prolonged srt at 30 days as the optimal srt has been determined 25 days wang et al 2020 while srt can not be decoupled from hrt for conventional digesters like cstrs from this point the membrane also prevents the washout out and enriches the functional microbial groups which convert the vfa timely and thus avoid system acidification additionally dissolved methane fermentation inhibitors such as ammonia are filtered out with permeate which makes the anmbr more stable than conversional digesters kanai et al 2010 this advantage is more significant in high ammonia production system like in manure anaerobic digestion furthermore the biofilm or cake layer that develops on the membrane surface also enhances soluble organic matter rejection as discussed in section 3 3 and finally contributes to high methanogenic performance and superior permeate quality 3 4 membrane operation performance and continuous filtration properties the mlts and mlss concentration in the anmbr are shown in fig 5 together with variations in the instantaneous flux and tmp a membrane operation optimization test was conducted during the first 72 days and the results have been reported in our recent article cheng et al 2020a from the day 74 to 145 the membrane was operated under an instantaneous flux of 12 1 lmh with a filtration mode of 3 minutes of filtration and 3 minutes of relaxation as shown in fig 5 b it can be seen clearly from fig 5 c that tmp increased rapidly at a rate of 1 8 kpa d from day 74 to 83 the tmp on the day of 89 reached 35 00 kpa the tmp threshold value recommended by the manufacturer with a sharp increase rate of 6 7 kpa d indicating a very serious membrane fouling cheng et al 2020a considering the high fouling rate the membrane was taken out and replaced by a new membrane the tmp curve of the new membrane shows an obvious three stage rise up pattern with filtration time a small and rapid tmp increase from 2 08 to 5 00 kpa 89 93 d followed by a slow and gradual increase from 5 00 to 15 50 kpa 93 120 d and then an abrupt increase from 15 00 to 30 21 kpa 120 123 d the very slow increase in the tmp and limited decrease in the flux from 89 d to 120 d suggest that the membrane could operate sustainably under this filtration model the net flux was 10 3 3 3 lmh 6 lmh considering the membrane area is 0 1 m2 the total permeate production was 6 l m2 h 0 1 m2 24 h d 14 4 l d this means the membrane was able to deal with 14 4 l feeding d equivalent to an hrt of 15 l 14 4 l d 1 04 d 15 l is the volume of the anmbr this hrt is much shorter than the most commonly used hrt 15 60 d in the anaerobic digestion of urban organic solid wastes fonoll et al 2015 kariyama et al 2018 rasapoor et al 2020 that is to say the membrane is not a bottleneck for the high solid anmbr in this study considering that traditional anaerobic systems can be easily upgraded to anmbr configurations we strongly recommend the application of anmbrs especially a high solid anmbrs for the treatment of organic solid wastes or high strength waste streams to improve methanogenic performance and effluent quality to further illustrate the filtration properties of the high solid anmbr in the acod of ses and fw four typical membrane states or fouling degrees were investigated 1 the new membrane under a sustainable operation condition 2 the membrane after a few days of filtration but still under a sustainable operation condition 3 the membrane was fouled needed to be cleaned and 4 the membrane was most seriously fouled these four typical membrane states correspond to a b c and d in fig 5 c the new membrane under a sustainable operation condition is characterized by a very low and stable value in both tmpt and tmp0 where tmpt is the final maximum tmp value after the filtration phase in a filtration relaxation cycle and tmp0 is the initial minimum tmp value in a filtration relaxation cycle for this study as shown in fig 6 a when the new membrane was under a sustainable process tmpt maintained at around 4 29 kpa and tmp0 could recover back to 2 43 kpa after relaxation as shown in fig 6 b after a few days of filtration the tmp curve is characterized by stable tmp0 and slow growing tmpt under a sustainable operation condition the tmpt is higher than that of a new membrane but the increase rate is slow and acceptable for long term operation as shown in fig 6 c the fouled membrane which needed to be cleaned shows a high and upward tmp0 from 6 09 to 7 19 kpa within 60 minutes in this study indicating that the total suction pressure generated during the filtration time could not release completely within 3 minutes of relaxation this further resulted in tmpt increasing as same tmp is required to produce a constant flux although the increase of tmp0 and tmpt are not obvious within 60 minutes fig 6 c they are evident after a long period of filtration as shown in fig 6 e as for the most serious fouled membrane point d the tmpt and tmp0 are the highest at 35 00 kpa and 14 46 kpa respectively this process is usually accompanied by a reduction in flux as shown in fig 5 b the fouling rate for the most serious fouled membrane point d is higher than that for point c as illustrated by the elevated slopes k2 k1 the tmp0 is also higher n2 n1 as shown in fig 6 e and f in summary the increase in tmp0 and or tmpt or the decrease of flux indicate a membrane fouling and the fouling degree is positively correlated with the increasing speed k and increasing magnitude of tmp0 and tmpt compared with those for the new membrane at around 2 50 and 13 00 kpa for the hollow fiber membrane used in this study the tmp0 could recover at around 2 50 kpa and the tmpt was less than 30 kpa in a sustainable operation if a tmp0 could not recover and was higher than 5 00 kpa or the tmpt climbed to 35 00 kpa a serious fouling might have been formed a membrane fouling mitigation measure should be taken timely under this condition to prevent the membrane from over fatigue particle size is the key parameter determining the specific cake resistance according to the carman kozeny equation lin et al 2011 park et al 2015 therefore particle size distribution psd of the mixed liquor and the mixed liquor supernatant were measured in this study it can be seen clearly from fig 7 that at the mono fw digestion trimodal curves with a predominant peak in the range of 0 3 1 0 μm were found for the supernatant and a unimodal with a predominant peak in the range of 10 100 μm was found for the mixed liquor while with the addition of ses a broad particle range 0 2 4000 μm was observed with three peaks in the range of 0 2 1 0 μm 10 300 μm and 400 3000 μm for the supernatant and a dominant peak in the range of 10 400 μm was found for the mixed liquor though different peak shapes and locations were recognized with the addition of ses the particles in both the supernatant and mixed liquor were larger than the membrane pore size 0 1 μm this result demonstrated that the main fouling mechanism caused by the particles was cake layer rather than pore blocking in this study park et al 2015 compared to the mono fw digestion the addition of the ses led to an increase in sustainable flux from 4 to 6 lmh cheng et al 2020a the higher sustainable flux with the addition of ses might be due to the decrease of small particles in the size range of 1 μm and the increase of large particles 100 μm as can be seen from table 4 the volume of the particles in the size of 1 μm decreased from 31 to 22 24 at the same time the larger particles in the size of 100 μm increased from 17 to 34 39 the small particles had a strong tendency to deposit on the membrane surface or pore walls while the large particles could be detached from the membrane surface much easily by the shear force meng et al 2007b additionally the small particles can fill in the interstices of the cake and build a denser cake layer thus the decrease of small particles and the increase of large particles contribute to a higher sustainable flux to further reveal the fouling mechanism of the high solid anmbr during the acod of fw and ses the external forces exerted on the sludge flocs or particles were analyzed as shown in fig 8 in a cross flow regimen there is a trade off in the vertical direction between the permeation drag force driven from outside pressure to extract permeate and the shear force driven by the feed stream cross flow and or biogas sparging plus the back transport force driven by concentration gradient and or inertial lift the drag force acting in the vertical direction carries sludge flocs or particles toward the membrane surface causing membrane fouling while the shear force releases foulants from membrane surface by shearing them into the mixed liquor the back transport force also plays a positive role in removing foulants other factors such as brownian diffusion lewis acid base van der waals and electrostatic repulsion or attraction also affect the direction of particle movement xu et al 2020 but they are inferior to the drag force shear force and back transport force during the filtration period as shown in fig 8 a most of the sludge flocs or particles subject to the force of fb fs ver fd where fb is back transport force fs ver is shear force in vertical direction fd is drag force in the vertical direction as a result they move toward the membrane surface and result in membrane fouling during the relaxation period since there is no drag force fb fs ver fd 0 foulants detach from membrane surface and membrane fouling is mitigated as shown in fig 8 b it should be noted that even under filtration period some particles are moving away the membrane due to the hydrodynamic effects the particle size the shear force distribution the charge of the membrane surface and the particles and the distance between them ramon and hoek 2012 xu et al 2020 base on the force analysis the increase of shear force such as by altering the cross flow velocity or by optimizing the biogas sparging strategy is recommended to mitigate membrane fouling as it directly determines the particle movement direction 4 conclusion this work comprehensively explored the acod of fw and ses in a high solid anmbr the best methanogenic performance was achieved at mono fw digestion as for the co digestion a synergetic effect was identified and the optimal fw ses ratio for methanogenic performance was determined at 75 25 among all the mixing ratios by co digestion with fw the hydrolysis ratio increased 8 1 and the methanogenesis ratio increased by 81 0 compared with mono ses digestion moreover this study is the first of its kind to uncover the membrane fouling mechanism by the combination of depicting the continuous membrane filtration property investigating the psd and analyzing the external force exerted on the sludge flocs according to the results of this study the increase of shear force is recommended to mitigate membrane fouling since it has been clearly demonstrated that the high solid anmbr achieved an advanced methanogenic performance we

17482,disposal of the increasingly huge amounts of sewage sludge ses has become an impending problem worldwide to solve this problem a high solid anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr was used for the anaerobic co digestion acod of ses and food waste fw this study investigated the effects of ses ratio on the methanogenic performance of the acod with a gradual increase value from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 total solids based the results showed that the highest methanogenic performance was achieved at mono fw digestion as for the co digestion the optimal fw ses ratio for methanogenic performance was 75 25 among all the mixing ratios the cod based biogas yield and methane yield were 0 498 l biogas g codfed and 0 295 l ch4 g codfed at this optimal mixing ratio which were 67 7 and 67 6 higher than those of the mono ses digestion respectively the upgraded values were attributed to the improved hydrolysis ratio by 8 14 and the balanced carbon to nitrogen c n ratio by co digestion with fw which synergistically stimulated methanogenesis ratio by 81 0 the continuous membrane filtration property was investigated and four typical trans membrane pressure tmp variation curves at different fouling degrees were determined the membrane could sustainably operate at a flux of 6 l m2 h lmh at the mixed liquor total solids mlts concentration of 25 30 g l the combination of continuous membrane filtration property particle size distribution of the mixed liquor and the external forces analysis was firstly applied to unravel the membrane fouling mechanism of a high solid anmbr the result of this study will contribute to the establishment of an efficient fw and ses treatment strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword sewage sludge food waste anaerobic co digestion high solid anmbr fouling mechanism 1 introduction the volume of sewage sludge ses produced by municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps is huge and continues to increase due to the population growth and the development of public sewer systems according to the japan s ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2019 the annual production of dry ses in japan is 2 3 mt in the united states european union and china estimates place the annual production of dry ses at 17 8 9 0 and 11 8 mt wu et al 2020 ses causes serious pollution without appropriate management due to the toxic substances such as organic contaminants pathogens and heavy metals the disposal of such a large amount of ses has become a pressing challenge worldwide the conventional methods for ses treatment include land application landfilling and incineration however land application is often accompanied by strong odors and ses contains hazardous organic chemicals heavy metals microbial pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria landfilling is no longer viable due to the shortage of land space and the pollution of local environment such as contamination of groundwater aquifers and soil incineration of sludge usually requires supplementary fuel and the energy balance of the process is not high as sludge needs drying before incinerating in contrast anaerobic digestion ad a microbe mediated biotechnology is gaining increasing attention due to organic waste reduction stabilization and methane production which can be used as renewable energy however the mono ses digestion tends to be slow because of its low biodegradability and insufficient carbon source zhen et al 2017 thus improving ses methane production efficiency has been projected as an urgent agenda in wwtps to address these issues anaerobic co digestion acod has been explored and applied in recent years previous studies have documented that acod can improve methane production compared to mono ses due to its superior in terms of nutrient balance system stability toxic agent dilution moisture adjustment high microbial consortia diversity and their synergistic impacts hagos et al 2017 rabii et al 2019 for instance pan et al found that food waste fw ses ratio of 0 5 0 5 achieved an accumulative methane yield of 0 198 0 011 l ch4 g vs on day 5 which was 4 85 and 2 75 times higher than that of mono ses and fw digestion indicating the existence of synergistic effects in acod pan et al 2019 contradictory findings were also reported that no synergetic effect was found in the acod of fw and ses gu et al 2020 liu et al 2016 koch et al s results have shown that the biogas yield increased from 0 32 to 0 35 l ch4 g vs when fw was added at a ratio of 10 w w and the corresponding energy recovery can offset more than 50 of the total energy consumption in wwtps koch et al 2016 however although the feasibility of acod in the treatment of organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw has been confirmed there are two main problems in conventional acod notably low methane production rate and poor system stability due to the washout of the slow growing methanogens and undigested organic wastes ma et al 2018 the anmbr is an ideal alternative to overcome these problems as the membrane ensures complete solids retention including the slow growing methanogens and the undigested organic wastes the organic wastes can be degraded more rapidly and thoroughly and thus an increased biogas production rate and an improved effluent quality can be achieved kaan et al 2019 the solids retention time srt can be controlled separately from the hydraulic retention time hrt in the anmbr the proper prolonged srt favors the growth of anaerobic microorganisms and reduces the footprint pileggi and parker 2017 furthermore because soluble methane fermentation inhibitors such as ammonia are filtered out with permeate due to their dissolved state the anaerobic process in the anmbr is remarkably stable kanai et al 2010 at the same time the solubilizing nutrients e g ammonia and phosphorus can be recovered for fertilizer production song et al 2020 the high solid anmbr ensures a high and efficient organic degradation and superior effluent quality due to the low food microorganism f m ratio as solid contents in ses and fw are high it is sensible to opt for a high solid anmbr however the high solid concentration leads to a greater membrane fouling propensity and a lower operational flux for example meng et al found that the membrane fouling resistance increased exponentially with increasing mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration meng et al 2007a it was also reported that the sustainable flux decreased from 13 2 0 3 to 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh with the increase of mixed liquor total solids mlts from 10 to 15 20 and 25 g l during fw treatment cheng et al 2020a based on a systematic literature review the following questions need to be answered 1 is the anmbr feasible for high solid fw and ses treatment considering the high fouling propensity 2 does synergistic effect exist in fw and ses co digestion in the anmbr 3 what is the fouling mechanism of the high solid anmbr in fw and ses co digestion the novelty of this work lies in 1 investigating the cod based biogas and methane yield and discussing the hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis reaction ratios under different fw ses ratios to determine whether there exists synergetic effect in the acod and 2 revealing the membrane fouling mechanism by the combination of continuous membrane filtration property illustration particle size distribution investigation and external forces analysis in summary the investigation of methanogenic performance and membrane fouling were employed to open the black box of fw and ses co digestion in the anmbr the results of this study are expected to promote the development and application of anmbrs in municipal organic solid waste treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 rationale of this study the long term continuous experiment was divided into six stages based on ses ratio and hrt as shown in table 1 the high solid anmbr only treated fw at an hrt of 30 days in stage 1 and then hrt was decreased to 15 days in stage 2 6 from stage 3 ses was gradually added to replace fw at an increased ratio from 25 stage 3 to 50 stage 4 75 stage 5 and 100 stage 6 2 2 feedstock and inoculum the co substrates used in this study were fw and ses the fw was prepared according to our previous article cheng et al 2018 the ses was composed of primary

fouling mechanism the mixed liquor and the mixed liquor supernatant were subjected to the psd analysis the samples were analyzed using the laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk with a detection range of 0 01 4000 µm the psd analysis was performed with three parallel samples and five measurements of each sample were taken and the average result was reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 the high solid anmbr performance due to the high feeding concentration the mlts in the anmbr increased quickly this anmbr was controlled at a mlts concentration of 25 30 g l which is much higher than the most commonly used value 5 15 g l in municipal wastewater treatment and is regarded as a high solid anmbr cheng et al 2020b the performance of this high solid anmbr was comprehensively evaluated from various aspects including biogas production reaction ratios of the four ad steps organic matter removal efficiency and soluble organic matter rejection efficiency effluent quality and membrane filtration properties throughout the long term continuous experiment the whole experiment lasted for 272 days and was divided into six stages based on ses ratio and hrt as shown in fig 1 the ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas were stable in the range of 59 61 and 38 40 under mono fw digestion with the decrease of hrt from 30 to 15 days the biogas production rate increased from 1 26 0 16 to 3 00 0 25 l l reactor d the biogas production rate in stage 2 was more than twice that in stage 1 which was due to the increased substrate concentration as shown in table 2 the ts vs and cod concentration increased from 44 4 6 0 42 3 5 9 and 69 2 14 6 g l to 51 8 4 8 49 4 4 8 and 82 1 16 6 g l respectively it is also clear from fig 1 that as ses ratio increased from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 the biogas production rates decreased from 3 00 0 25 to 2 46 0 30 1 63 0 23 1 31 0 14 and 1 30 0 17 l l reactor d respectively it should be noted that the biogas production rate under the ses ratio of 25 and 100 in this study were 4 72 times and 5 19 times higher than those reported in a previous article mattioli et al 2017 in the acod of ofmsw and ses by a cstr these results confirmed an advanced methanogenic performance of the high solid anmbr than the cstr from the perspective of the biogas production rate the optimal ses ratio for the acod is 25 among all the mixing ratios the reduction in the biogas production with ses ratio might be attributed to the decreased hydrolysis ratio which decreased from 87 5 to 71 6 as the ses ratio increased from 0 to 100 the low hydrolysis is the limited factor for the mono digestion of ses thus different pretreatment methods have been applied to improve hydrolysis such as hydrothermal and alkali thermal treatment gao et al 2020 mahdy et al 2020 zou et al 2020 the low ses hydrolysis was due to the larger amount of inorganic solids or the refractory organic matters as can be seen from table 2 the vs ts ratio of the substrate decreased from 95 3 to 94 5 91 0 88 0 and 83 1 with the increase of ses from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 the ubiquitous inorganic solids mineral compounds embedded in ses could debilitate the bio accessibility and greatly reduce the reaction ratio particularly hydrolysis ratio lin et al 2015 another important reason for the decrease of the biogas production with ses ratio might be the unbalanced nutrition or the improper c n ratio as shown in table 2 the c n ratio decreased from 17 0 0 1 to 15 5 0 1 14 0 0 1 12 5 0 1 and 11 0 0 1 as the ses ratio increased from 0 to 25 50 75 and 100 the optimal c n ratio for acod of fw and ses has been determined in the range of 15 20 siddiqui et al 2011 as the c n ratio gradually moved away from the optimal c n ratio with the increase of ses ratio the biogas production rate and biogas yield decreased in a stepwise trend the c n ratio of the excess sludge in this study is 5 5 0 1 it has also been verified that a c n ratio of less than 6 0 can negatively affect the ad process by inhibiting the growth of anaerobic microorganisms especially the syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria due to the low carbon availability and high ammonia concentration mehariya et al 2018 wang et al 2015 combined previous study and the reduced biogas production with ses ratio slight inhibition of the lower c n ratio was speculated the cod based biogas yield l biogas g codfed and methane yield l ch4 g codfed at different ses ratios were also calculated to check whether acod prompted methanogenic performance in the mono digestion groups pure fw and pure ses the results varied greatly as shown in fig 2 fw exhibited a much higher cod based biogas yield 0 548 l biogas g codfed and methane yield 0 324 l ch4 g codfed than those of the ses at 0 297 l biogas g codfed and 0 176 l ch4 g codfed the biogas yields were 0 498 0 450 and 0 386 l biogas g codfed at ses ratio of 25 50 and 75 respectively the corresponding methane yields were 0 295 0 271 and 0 233 l ch4 g codfed respectively fig 2 histogram from these results it can be seen clearly that among all the mixing ratios the anmbr achieved the highest biogas yield at the ses ratio of 25 the biogas yield and methane yield at ses ratio of 25 were 2 63 and 2 79 higher than the simulation values fig 2 dot plot obtained based on the results of mono fw and ses digestion at the same fw ses ratio the biogas yields at ses ratio of 50 and 75 were improved by 6 51 and 7 30 and the corresponding methane yields were improved by 8 40 and 9 39 these improved but not significant values indicated that synergetic effect may exist in the acod by the high solid anmbr gu et al 2020 found that the synergism on methane yields was initially observed but not significant at the end of experiment they considered the co digestion of fw and ses accelerated the hydrolysis due to the addition of readily degradable fw but did not enhance the extent of degradation some researchers reported that no synergetic effect was found and the addition of fw even resulted in the accumulation of vfa and decelerated biogas production liu et al 2016 in contrast a significant synergistic effect was observed at the ses fw ratio of 1 1 with the highest methane yield at 415 ml g vs in wang et al s study 267 and 61 ml g vs higher than the mono ses and fw digestion wang et al 2020 in this study though the synergistic effect was not significant the biogas yield and methane yield at the fw ses ratio of 75 25 were 67 7 and 67 6 higher than those of the mono ses digestion these findings shed light on the impacts of fw addition on the ses anaerobic digestion performance thereby improving the policy making on ses treatment 3 2 effects of the ses ratios on the four steps reaction ratios of the ad process to better understand reaction process synergistic effect and biodegradation kinetics in this acod system the four steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis reaction ratios were analyzed the hydrolysis ratios showed a decreased trend from 87 5 to 71 6 which explained the drop in biogas production as illustrated in section 3 1 compared with the mono ses anaerobic digestion the hydrolysis ratio of the co digestion at the fw ses ratio of 75 25 was enhanced by 8 1 as shown in fig 3 the enhanced hydrolysis ratio is not only due to the higher degradability of fw but also the increased relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria bacteroidales and clostridiales have been ascertained as the key hydrolyzer in anaerobic digesters ju et al 2017 their relative abundances show an increasing trend from 46 8 to 54 4 and 66 2 with the increase of fw ratio from 0 to 50 and 100 fig s2 specifically prolixibacteraceae the dominant family of bacteroidales increased significantly from 21 4 to 35 9 and 56 0 with fw ratio the acidogenesis ratio and acetogenesis ratio at this fw ses ratio were 84 0 and 83 6 respectively which were 80 6 and 82 6 higher than those of the mono ses anaerobic digestion the methanogenesis ratio was 84 2 an 81 0 improvement on that for the mono ses digestion shown in fig 3 e acetoclastic methanosarcinales and hydrogentrophic methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales have been ascertained as major functional guilds for methanogenesis ju et al 2017 the combined relative abundances of the three major methanogens did not show significant change with fw ratio accounting for 94 5 99 5 it is clearly that methanosaeta competed over methanobacterium and the later gained advantages with fw ratio as the abundance of methanosaeta decreased from 73 1 to 41 0 while the abundance of methanobacterium increased from 24 4 to 47 5 fig s3 these results indicated that the predominant pathway for methane production in mono ses digestion fw ratio of 0 was acetoclastic methanogenesis while in mono fw digestion it was in the balance between acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the improved four step reactions ratio explained the synergistic effects and stimulation mechanisms by the addition of fw the enhancement of hydrolysis ratio is limited compared to the ratios for the other three steps the marked improvement in the final methanogenic performance was a further evidence that hydrolysis is the rate limiting step and is responsible for a high low final methanogenic performance for ses digestion ma et al 2018 xiao et al calculated the reaction ratios of the four ad steps of the two stage thermophilic anaerobic digestion of mono fw in the cstr which were at 85 7 85 8 87 5 and 87 2 xiao et al 2018 while the mesophilic hydrolysis ratio at the fw ses ratio of 75 25 in this study was much lower than that in xiao et al s study the acidogenesis acetogenesis and the methanogenesis ratio approached their values this is a clear evidence that the anmbr enhanced methanogenic performance even under a low hydrolysis ratio the methanogenic performance in this study was comparable to that in the thermophilic two stage anaerobic digestion of mono fw digestion by a cstr reactor confirming the advanced high solid anmbr performance than the cstr 3 3 organic matter removal and soluble organic matter rejection efficiency the cod carbohydrate and protein concentrations of the substrate mixed liquor and effluent under each ses ratio were measured and the removal efficiencies were calculated as shown in table 3 the total cod carbohydrate and protein t cod t carbohydrate and t protein of the effluent were all at a very low concentration compared to those of the substrate stabilized in 0 32 0 45 g l 0 03 0 08 g l and 0 13 0 25 g l respectively the t cod t carbohydrate and t protein removal efficiencies were 99 4 0 1 99 7 0 2 and 99 2 0 4 respectively they are much higher than those achieved by the cstr in the range of 67 95 cabbai et al 2016 the concentration of soluble cod carbohydrate and protein s cod s carbohydrate and s protein in the permeate and in the mixed liquor within the reactor is also compared to determine how much of the soluble organic matter was rejected by the membrane and further converted to biogas the relationship between the concentration of soluble organics in the permeate and in the mixed liquor is presented in fig 4 if no soluble organics were rejected the relationship between them should be y x y is the soluble organic matter concentration of the permeate and x is the soluble organic matter concentration of the mixed liquor in the reactor however the relationships of s cod s carbohydrate and s protein are y1 0 0977 x1 0 2971 y2 0 1779 x2 0 0363 and y3 0 2766 x3 0 1089 respectively these results indicate that 1 0 0977 100 1 0 1779 100 1 0 2766 100 namely 90 2 82 2 and 72 3 of the soluble cod carbohydrate and protein were rejected by the membrane the rejection efficiency of s carbohydrate was much higher than s protein which is consistent with yue et al s observation yue et al 2015 this might be due to the fact that the molecular weight of carbohydrate is generally higher than that of protein wu et al 2008 because the high temperature promotes the hydrolysis process and the organic solids are likely to be degraded into small molecules the soluble organic rejection efficiencies of the thermophilic anmbr are lower than these in this study li et al 2020 qiao et al 2013 used a thermophilic anmbr for the acod of coffee ground and activated waste sludge and their soluble organic rejection efficiencies are also lower than those in this study probably owing to the lower hydrolysis ratio in this study due to the lower temperature 37 c this study 57 c their study the smaller membrane pore size 0 1 μm this study 0 2 μm their study the different composition and structure of organic matters as well as different biofilm and foulant layers formed as smith et al state the biofilm or cake layer that develops on the membrane surface not only plays a role in membrane fouling but also contributes to soluble cod removal and superior permeate quality smith et al 2012 it should be noted that thanks to the physical rejection pathway and biological pathway the excess sludge production was 0 17 0 27 g g tsfed in this study much lower than that in the mesophilic two stage ad and temperature phased ad prabhu and mutnuri 2016 and that in the high temperature thermal pretreatment and low temperature thermal alkaline pretreatment ad xiao et al 2020 the organic matter removal and soluble organic matter rejection efficiency analysis demonstrates that both large suspended solids and soluble organic matters were rejected by the membrane which not only resulted in a lower excess sludge production but also contributed to a higher methanogenic performance compared to conventional acod membrane plays a significant role not only in substrates and biomass rejection but also in providing longer sludge retention time srt for keeping the functional microbial groups in balance and thus timely converting the intermediates such as vfas to biogas for instance in this study the vfa in the anmbr was very low 73 8 mg hac l at the hrt of 15 days however the vfa concentration reached 6000 mg l at the same hrt in a cstr even under a lower organic loading rate wang et al 2020 the high vfa concentration in the cstr induced a drastic ph drop from 7 5 to less than 5 0 and finial led to system acidification the much lower vfa in the anmbr was attributed to the proper prolonged srt at 30 days as the optimal srt has been determined 25 days wang et al 2020 while srt can not be decoupled from hrt for conventional digesters like cstrs from this point the membrane also prevents the washout out and enriches the functional microbial groups which convert the vfa timely and thus avoid system acidification additionally dissolved methane fermentation inhibitors such as ammonia are filtered out with permeate which makes the anmbr more stable than conversional digesters kanai et al 2010 this advantage is more significant in high ammonia production system like in manure anaerobic digestion furthermore the biofilm or cake layer that develops on the membrane surface also enhances soluble organic matter rejection as discussed in section 3 3 and finally contributes to high methanogenic performance and superior permeate quality 3 4 membrane operation performance and continuous filtration properties the mlts and mlss concentration in the anmbr are shown in fig 5 together with variations in the instantaneous flux and tmp a membrane operation optimization test was conducted during the first 72 days and the results have been reported in our recent article cheng et al 2020a from the day 74 to 145 the membrane was operated under an instantaneous flux of 12 1 lmh with a filtration mode of 3 minutes of filtration and 3 minutes of relaxation as shown in fig 5 b it can be seen clearly from fig 5 c that tmp increased rapidly at a rate of 1 8 kpa d from day 74 to 83 the tmp on the day of 89 reached 35 00 kpa the tmp threshold value recommended by the manufacturer with a sharp increase rate of 6 7 kpa d indicating a very serious membrane fouling cheng et al 2020a considering the high fouling rate the membrane was taken out and replaced by a new membrane the tmp curve of the new membrane shows an obvious three stage rise up pattern with filtration time a small and rapid tmp increase from 2 08 to 5 00 kpa 89 93 d followed by a slow and gradual increase from 5 00 to 15 50 kpa 93 120 d and then an abrupt increase from 15 00 to 30 21 kpa 120 123 d the very slow increase in the tmp and limited decrease in the flux from 89 d to 120 d suggest that the membrane could operate sustainably under this filtration model the net flux was 10 3 3 3 lmh 6 lmh considering the membrane area is 0 1 m2 the total permeate production was 6 l m2 h 0 1 m2 24 h d 14 4 l d this means the membrane was able to deal with 14 4 l feeding d equivalent to an hrt of 15 l 14 4 l d 1 04 d 15 l is the volume of the anmbr this hrt is much shorter than the most commonly used hrt 15 60 d in the anaerobic digestion of urban organic solid wastes fonoll et al 2015 kariyama et al 2018 rasapoor et al 2020 that is to say the membrane is not a bottleneck for the high solid anmbr in this study considering that traditional anaerobic systems can be easily upgraded to anmbr configurations we strongly recommend the application of anmbrs especially a high solid anmbrs for the treatment of organic solid wastes or high strength waste streams to improve methanogenic performance and effluent quality to further illustrate the filtration properties of the high solid anmbr in the acod of ses and fw four typical membrane states or fouling degrees were investigated 1 the new membrane under a sustainable operation condition 2 the membrane after a few days of filtration but still under a sustainable operation condition 3 the membrane was fouled needed to be cleaned and 4 the membrane was most seriously fouled these four typical membrane states correspond to a b c and d in fig 5 c the new membrane under a sustainable operation condition is characterized by a very low and stable value in both tmpt and tmp0 where tmpt is the final maximum tmp value after the filtration phase in a filtration relaxation cycle and tmp0 is the initial minimum tmp value in a filtration relaxation cycle for this study as shown in fig 6 a when the new membrane was under a sustainable process tmpt maintained at around 4 29 kpa and tmp0 could recover back to 2 43 kpa after relaxation as shown in fig 6 b after a few days of filtration the tmp curve is characterized by stable tmp0 and slow growing tmpt under a sustainable operation condition the tmpt is higher than that of a new membrane but the increase rate is slow and acceptable for long term operation as shown in fig 6 c the fouled membrane which needed to be cleaned shows a high and upward tmp0 from 6 09 to 7 19 kpa within 60 minutes in this study indicating that the total suction pressure generated during the filtration time could not release completely within 3 minutes of relaxation this further resulted in tmpt increasing as same tmp is required to produce a constant flux although the increase of tmp0 and tmpt are not obvious within 60 minutes fig 6 c they are evident after a long period of filtration as shown in fig 6 e as for the most serious fouled membrane point d the tmpt and tmp0 are the highest at 35 00 kpa and 14 46 kpa respectively this process is usually accompanied by a reduction in flux as shown in fig 5 b the fouling rate for the most serious fouled membrane point d is higher than that for point c as illustrated by the elevated slopes k2 k1 the tmp0 is also higher n2 n1 as shown in fig 6 e and f in summary the increase in tmp0 and or tmpt or the decrease of flux indicate a membrane fouling and the fouling degree is positively correlated with the increasing speed k and increasing magnitude of tmp0 and tmpt compared with those for the new membrane at around 2 50 and 13 00 kpa for the hollow fiber membrane used in this study the tmp0 could recover at around 2 50 kpa and the tmpt was less than 30 kpa in a sustainable operation if a tmp0 could not recover and was higher than 5 00 kpa or the tmpt climbed to 35 00 kpa a serious fouling might have been formed a membrane fouling mitigation measure should be taken timely under this condition to prevent the membrane from over fatigue particle size is the key parameter determining the specific cake resistance according to the carman kozeny equation lin et al 2011 park et al 2015 therefore particle size distribution psd of the mixed liquor and the mixed liquor supernatant were measured in this study it can be seen clearly from fig 7 that at the mono fw digestion trimodal curves with a predominant peak in the range of 0 3 1 0 μm were found for the supernatant and a unimodal with a predominant peak in the range of 10 100 μm was found for the mixed liquor while with the addition of ses a broad particle range 0 2 4000 μm was observed with three peaks in the range of 0 2 1 0 μm 10 300 μm and 400 3000 μm for the supernatant and a dominant peak in the range of 10 400 μm was found for the mixed liquor though different peak shapes and locations were recognized with the addition of ses the particles in both the supernatant and mixed liquor were larger than the membrane pore size 0 1 μm this result demonstrated that the main fouling mechanism caused by the particles was cake layer rather than pore blocking in this study park et al 2015 compared to the mono fw digestion the addition of the ses led to an increase in sustainable flux from 4 to 6 lmh cheng et al 2020a the higher sustainable flux with the addition of ses might be due to the decrease of small particles in the size range of 1 μm and the increase of large particles 100 μm as can be seen from table 4 the volume of the particles in the size of 1 μm decreased from 31 to 22 24 at the same time the larger particles in the size of 100 μm increased from 17 to 34 39 the small particles had a strong tendency to deposit on the membrane surface or pore walls while the large particles could be detached from the membrane surface much easily by the shear force meng et al 2007b additionally the small particles can fill in the interstices of the cake and build a denser cake layer thus the decrease of small particles and the increase of large particles contribute to a higher sustainable flux to further reveal the fouling mechanism of the high solid anmbr during the acod of fw and ses the external forces exerted on the sludge flocs or particles were analyzed as shown in fig 8 in a cross flow regimen there is a trade off in the vertical direction between the permeation drag force driven from outside pressure to extract permeate and the shear force driven by the feed stream cross flow and or biogas sparging plus the back transport force driven by concentration gradient and or inertial lift the drag force acting in the vertical direction carries sludge flocs or particles toward the membrane surface causing membrane fouling while the shear force releases foulants from membrane surface by shearing them into the mixed liquor the back transport force also plays a positive role in removing foulants other factors such as brownian diffusion lewis acid base van der waals and electrostatic repulsion or attraction also affect the direction of particle movement xu et al 2020 but they are inferior to the drag force shear force and back transport force during the filtration period as shown in fig 8 a most of the sludge flocs or particles subject to the force of fb fs ver fd where fb is back transport force fs ver is shear force in vertical direction fd is drag force in the vertical direction as a result they move toward the membrane surface and result in membrane fouling during the relaxation period since there is no drag force fb fs ver fd 0 foulants detach from membrane surface and membrane fouling is mitigated as shown in fig 8 b it should be noted that even under filtration period some particles are moving away the membrane due to the hydrodynamic effects the particle size the shear force distribution the charge of the membrane surface and the particles and the distance between them ramon and hoek 2012 xu et al 2020 base on the force analysis the increase of shear force such as by altering the cross flow velocity or by optimizing the biogas sparging strategy is recommended to mitigate membrane fouling as it directly determines the particle movement direction 4 conclusion this work comprehensively explored the acod of fw and ses in a high solid anmbr the best methanogenic performance was achieved at mono fw digestion as for the co digestion a synergetic effect was identified and the optimal fw ses ratio for methanogenic performance was determined at 75 25 among all the mixing ratios by co digestion with fw the hydrolysis ratio increased 8 1 and the methanogenesis ratio increased by 81 0 compared with mono ses digestion moreover this study is the first of its kind to uncover the membrane fouling mechanism by the combination of depicting the continuous membrane filtration property investigating the psd and analyzing the external force exerted on the sludge flocs according to the results of this study the increase of shear force is recommended to mitigate membrane fouling since it has been clearly demonstrated that the high solid anmbr achieved an advanced methanogenic performance we

17483,in this study ultrafiltration uf pre oxidation with a boron doped diamond bdd electrode was employed aiming to mitigate membrane fouling during algae laden water treatment it was found that bdd anodizing can efficiently alleviate membrane fouling regardless of the filtration membrane material when the oxidation time was over 30 min this was because that the cake layer fouling resistance was highly mitigated by the pre oxidation process the generated small molecular organics after anodic oxidation might increase the potential of pore blockage the anodizing preferentially oxidized hydrophobic organic and fluorescent substances which is conducive to reducing membrane fouling and improving production efficiency besides disinfection byproduct precursors and harmful algae derived substances of uf filtrated solution were contained the algae bodies tend to agglomeration and the zeta potential obviously declined after the pretreatment which is instrumental in forming a loose cake layer structure in addition the interaction force between membrane and foulants also converted to a repulsion force after pre oxidation which implies that bdd pre oxidation was an effective way to mitigate cake layer fouling by reducing foulant membrane interactions at last the secondary organic release of a dynamic formed cake layer was proved to be limited especially for living algae cells graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bdd electrode ultrafiltration algae laden water fouling mechanism organic release 1 introduction lakes and reservoirs have a significant and far reaching impact on the living environment and economic development of surrounding cities chen et al 2018 they are susceptible to exogenous and endogenous pollutants of which water eutrophication and the resulting algae outbreaks are very common algae blooms caused by eutrophication dramatically affect people s living environment wang et al 2019 the presence of a large amount of algae cells accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and interferes with the coagulation and filtration process qi et al 2016 moreover algae derived metabolites as well as disinfection byproduct precursors threaten public health therefore special attention should be paid to this challenge in the process of water environmental protection and governance ultrafiltration uf is a reliable and superior separation technology through size exclusion li et al 2020a the molecular weight cut off of uf membranes is substantially smaller than the size of common algae hence uf can retain virtually 100 algae cells liu et al 2017b the main obstacle of algae laden water treatment by uf is membrane fouling generated by algae bodies and the derived organics in understanding membrane fouling caused by algae laden water the algae bodies are associated to cake layer formation since algae cells are deposited onto membrane surface and the small molecular weight of organic matter induces pore blocking li et al 2014 to mitigate fouling of ultrafiltration membranes aroused by algae laden water various pretreatment technologies have been explored in recent years ding et al 2020 liu et al 2018 wei et al 2016b advanced pre oxidation is an attractive option among a variety of pretreatment strategies wan et al employed ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes including ultraviolet uv persulfate uv chlorine and uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling during algae laden water treatment and found that uv persulfate and uv h2o2 can mitigate membrane fouling whereas the combination uv chlorine conversely aggravates fouling wan et al 2019 it was also reported that a high dose of ozone can aggravate fouling of ultrafiltration membranes during algae laden water treatment especially for irreversible fouling liu et al 2018 hence different from other typical characteristic foulants the uncertainty of ultrafiltration pretreatment specifically pre oxidation for algae laden water should be paid close attention currently reported unfavorable factors of pre oxidation for algae laden water treatment include two aspects one is more severe pore blockage due to the transformation of organic substances into small fragments the other is the cake layer resistance formed by dead algae and the release of intracellular organic matter iom liu et al 2018 wan et al 2019 wei et al 2016b hydroxyl radical oh oxidation is a widely reported advanced oxidation method and researchers also adopt the technology for algae removal li et al 2019 bai et al reported that though the radicals may damage the dna of algae cells no toxin and odorous compounds were released bai et al 2019 therefore the application of hydroxyl radical based oxidation as algae laden water pretreatment for uf was considered promising anode electrochemical oxidation is an environmentally friendly treatment technology and the reactive free electrons lead to a low secondary pollution effect and a high efficiency li et al 2019 xu et al found that electrochemical oxidation has a good inhibitory effect on the growth of microcystis aeruginosa and a better inactivation of algal cells obtained as the current density increased xu et al 2007 zhou et al conducted a boron doped diamond anode bdd oxidation for cyanobacteria treatment and found that the photosynthesis ability and cell integrity of cyanobacteria were destroyed moreover oxidative degradation of the released microcystin lr was obtained zhou et al 2018 the electrolysis system was one of the high oxidation method by continuously generation of free radicals bdd electrode a superior catalytic electrode technology with high oxygen evolution potential was usually preferred as the non active anode due to its stability and efficiency li et al 2019 besides the bdd anodizing shows high degradation and mineralization effect under wide ph range ganiyu et al 2015 therefore the discussion of the potential of bdd anodizing as uf pretreatment for algae laden water has practical and scientific significance this paper investigates the possibility of applying a bdd anode for pre oxidation of uf process furthermore in order to understand algae secretion under pressure used as driving force the potential organic substance release from the cake layer formed by algae bodies live and dead cells is comprehensively discussed in this study a bdd anode and a titanium sheet cathode were employed as the electrode and two kinds of ultrafiltration membranes made of either polyethersulfone pes or polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf were utilized for the filtration process initially membrane fouling and rejection of organic compounds were investigated in addition the interface characteristics of fouled membranes including particle size distribution zeta potential interface free energy morphology were comprehensively investigated finally the potential of release of secondary organic compounds by the formed cake layer was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae culture and extraction the microcystis aeruginosa seeds no fachb 905 were purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences

1 0 mm nahco3 and 15 0 mm naclo4 was utilized to obtain a fixed microcystis aeruginosa concentration 2 2 106 cells ml 1 high speed refrigerated centrifugation was utilized to extract the algae cells and algae derived organics for centrifugation a low temperature 4 c and high speed 10 000 rpm centrifuge was used for 15 min 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup contains an electrochemical experimental device and a uf filtration setup the electrochemical experimental device included a power source electrodes electrolyte an electrolytic cell and a stirring device the power was supplied by a direct current dc power supply and controls the electrolysis current stability at 0 3 a the anode and cathode employed a bdd electrode and a titanium sheet electrode respectively the distance between the two electrodes was 10 mm and the electrode plate area was 10 cm2 hence the current density of the electrochemical device was 30 ma cm2 the electrolysis time was set as 0 min 10 min 30 min 60 min and 100 min and 200 ml algae laden water was employed during the oxidation process flat ultrafiltration membranes of two materials polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf both obtained from microdyn nadir company were used in the experiments both membranes have a molecular weight cutoff of 150 kda and thickness range of 210 to 250 µm a dead end filtration system was utilized with a constant pressure 100 kpa which includes an ultrafiltration cell an electronic balance a high pressure nitrogen tank a precision regulating valve and a computer terminal the ultrafiltration membrane was surface up placed on the bottom of the ultrafiltration the water produced by the ultrafiltration cell flowed into a beaker through a silicone tube the beaker was placed on an electronic balance connected to the computer to record the data every 5 seconds to draw the flux curve 2 3 membrane fouling assessment and mechanism analysis the resistance of the ultrafiltration membrane includes an inherent resistance a reversible resistance and an irreversible resistance zhang and fu 2018 ultrapure water was used for filtration until the flux is stabilized before each filtration process all the filtration tests were conducted at least 3 times the stable flux was recorded as j0 from which the inherent resistance ri can be calculated according to eq 1 1 r i δ p μ j 0 where δp represents the operating pressure pa and μ represents the dynamic viscosity pa s the average flux of the last 3 ml of effluent was recorded as j1 and the total resistance rtot can be calculated according to eq 2 2 r t o t δ p μ j 1 to wipe off the foulant cake layer the surface of the ultrafiltration membrane was gently wiped by a wet sponge when the ultrafiltration process was completed then the ultrafiltration membrane was installed into the ultrafiltration cell and filtrated with ultrapure water the stable flux was recorded as j2 therefore the irreversible resistance rb and the reversible resistance rc can be calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 3 r b δ p μ j 2 δ p μ j 0 4 r t o t r i r b r c in order to further explore the mechanism of membrane fouling during ultrafiltration four classical fouling models were introduced as shown in table 1 the fouling mechanism was corresponding to relationship between d2t dv2 and dt dv eq 5 where t represents the filtration time v represents the total filtration volume and specific fouling mechanisms corresponding to different index values n a b c and d in the table represent constants 5 d 2 t d v 2 k d t d v n 6 d t d v 1 j a 7 d 2 t d v 2 1 j 3 a 2 d j d t 8 n d l o g d 2 t d v 2 d l o g d t d v according to equations 6 and 7 the flux can be used to calculate d2t dv2 and dt dv dj dt was obtained by calculating the differential relationship between flux and time with matlab 2014 software and d2t dv2 is obtained by calculating the second derivative relationship between filtering time and volume with matlab 2014 software then the value of n was calculated through the logarithmic relationship between d2t dv2 and dt dv eq 8 2 4 analytical methods uv254 was tested using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1810 general analysis beijing and doc was tested using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100s jena germany to detect the charging and aggregation of algal cell particles the zeta potential was measured by a nanometer particle size analyzer marvern s90 uk the particle size of algae cells and surface fractal dimension df was measured by a laser particle size distribution analyzer marvern msatersizer 3000 uk the calculation method of df was introduced in previous work liu et al 2017a hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of organic compounds was classified by non ionic macroporous xad xad 4 and xad 8 resin separation method lu et al 2019 a fluorescent excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy f7000 hitachi japan was utilized to qualitatively analyze fluorescent luminescence characteristics in solution the excitation light ex wavelength is 200 450 nm the emission light em wavelength is 250 550 nm and the scanning interval is 5 nm for both excitation and emission light before measuring the excitation emission matrix the sample solution was filtered through a 0 45µm microfiltration membrane and the ph value was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 liu et

diiodomethane ultrapure water and glycerin were selected as test liquids to calculate the interface free energy the calculation method of cohesive free energy and adhesive free energy can be found in previous work liu et al 2017c a flow cytometer fc500 beckman coulter usa was utilized to detect the algae cell viability sytox green was selected as the fluorescent probe which could selectively penetrate through the ruptured cell membrane and bind to the nucleic acid inside the cell to generate specific fluorescence a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 6890 usa was used to detect the disinfection by product precursor and detail analytical method was introduced in supplemental information liu et al 2018 a scanning electron microscope gemini sem 300 zeiss germany was employed to observe the morphology and microstructure of algal cell particles on the surface of the ultrafiltration membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bdd pre oxidation on membrane fouling the effect of bdd pre oxidation on ultrafiltration membrane fouling mitigation is shown in fig 1 the algae laden water without electrochemical pretreatment caused a rapid flux drop in the initial filtration stage and the specific flux j j0 finally reached 0 1 and 0 04 with pvdf and pes membrane respectively this suggests that the algae laden water has a potential to evoke severe flux decline when 10 min bdd pre oxidation was applied the membrane fouling was slightly alleviated when using the pvdf membrane in contrast a short time electro oxidation has a negligible impact on membrane fouling mitigation with the pes membrane when the electrochemical oxidation time was prolonged the membrane fouling was considerably alleviated with either the pvdf membrane or the pes membrane for the pvdf membrane the final specific fluxes were 0 53 and 0 52 when 30 min and 60 min oxidation time were used and the specific flux began to decrease when further extending the oxidation time for the pes membrane a similar result was obtained the bdd pre oxidation could effectively mitigate the membrane fouling within a certain oxidation time fig 2 presents the membrane fouling reversibility of the pvdf and pes membrane for different bdd pre oxidation times regardless of the pretreatment conditions the ratio of reversible fouling caused by algae cells and macromolecular organic matter deposition was higher than irreversible fouling caused by pore blocking conversely when 10 min bdd oxidation was applied the irreversible fouling of pvdf and pes membranes were aggravated this result can probably be ascribed to the organic matter increase when oxidation is applied the reversible fouling and irreversible fouling resistances could be well controlled when oxidation time was over 30 min especially with pvdf membrane for instance the irreversible fouling resistance declined to 0 53 1012 m 1 and the reversible fouling resistance reduced to 5 95 1012 m 1 at 30 min anodizing oxidation with pvdf membrane this indicates that both reversible fouling and irreversible fouling could be alleviated by bdd oxidation prior to pvdf uf and the controlling for irreversible fouling during filtration with pes membrane was irregular gao et al 2019 however a rise of irreversible fouling resistance was observed with both membranes this can probably be explained by the generation of small molecular organic substances in addition when comparing the fouling resistance of the two ultrafiltration membranes it can be found that the pes ultrafiltration membrane which is more hydrophobic has a higher resistance to fouling during filtration than the pvdf membrane especially for what concerns the irreversible fouling resistance younas et al 2017 to further investigate the effect of electro chemical pretreatment on the membrane fouling mechanism the membrane fouling model based on d2t dv2 and dt dv was utilized ho and zydney 2000 as illustrated by fig 3 each of the filtration processes regardless of the pretreatment condition and membrane material was in accordance with a two stage linear fitting curve which was distinct from our previous work liu et al 2018 in previous work a one stage linear curve was used to fit the ultrafiltration process of algae laden water by ferrous activated persulfate pretreatment table 1 shows the relationship between the n value and the dominant fouling model for instance the main fouling pattern is complete blocking when the n value is 2 or close to 2 both standard blocking and complete blocking govern the fouling mechanism if the n value is between 1 5 and 2 for the pvdf membrane the n values linear fitting correlation slope value of the first stage were 2 29 1 94 1 73 1 66 and 1 53 this suggests that complete blocking was dominant during the first stage of the filtration process without pretreatment however with the increase of electrochemical pre oxidation time standard blocking starts to substitute complete blocking and becomes the dominant fouling mechanism a similar result can be observed with the pes membrane hence a lower ratio of foulants was deposited onto membrane pores but a higher ratio of foulants penetrated into membrane pores and then blocked the pores when the pretreatment was applied this can be explained by two factors one is that the macromolecular organic compounds were prone to decompose by the hydroxyl radical generated by bdd anodizing another is that with the inactivate effect of radicals an amount of intracellular organic matter with smaller molecular weight was released for the second stage the n value lies between 0 201 and 0 206 under all conditions which indicates that although electrochemical pre oxidation could effectively mitigate the membrane fouling growth of a cake layer generated by algae deposition still occurred liu et al 2017c zhou et al 2018 3 2 effect of bdd pre oxidation on organic rejection as shown in fig 4 a and b the impact of algae laden water treatment with bdd anodizing and ultrafiltration on the detection of uv254 was investigated with respect to direct filtration of algae laden water the uv254 of feed and final permeate generated by the pvdf and pes membrane were 0 200 0 098 and 0 095 respectively the rejection of the pvdf and pes membranes was thus 51 and 52 however the absorbance of uv254 increased with the increase of electrolysis pre oxidation it reaches 0 535 cm 1 which is approximately an increase of 167 5 of raw algae laden water after 100 minutes of bdd oxidation one possible explanation of this phenomenon is due to the release of intracellular organic matter iom caused by the electrochemical pre oxidation wan et al 2019 furthermore fig s1 shows that the absorbance of uv254 increased with bdd anode oxidation although it excludes the factor of iom release which indicates that the formation of small molecular organic substances during anodizing could enhance the response to ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 254 nm wei et al 2016b fig 4 c and d present the doc concentration of feed and permeate with respect to direct filtration of algae laden water the removal of doc was 71 1 and 71 6 for the pvdf and pes membrane respectively the removal of doc by the pvdf ultrafiltration membrane at different electrochemical pre oxidation times from 10 min to 100 min were 58 6 41 2 53 1 and 55 2 respectively and the removal by the pes ultrafiltration membrane were 50 6 58 4 41 5 48 6 compared with the removal of uv254 the ultrafiltration combination process has a better removal effect on doc which is probably because uv254 related aromaticity organics is more difficult to be retained by the ultrafiltration process and the doc parameter represents organic matters with all molecular weight distribution hou et al 2018 korshin et al 2009 weishaar et al 2003 fig 5 shows the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum of the effluent under different treatment conditions it can be seen from fig 5 a that the fluorescent substance in the raw water has three characteristic peaks the peak t is generally considered to represent tryptophan protein substances and the two peaks a and c represent humic organic substances liu et al 2017a the peak t is particularly obvious which indicates that the algae laden water contains a high concentration of tryptophan based protein substances the protein substances in solution are likely to originate from metabolic processes and enzyme release xu et al 2016 figures 5 f and k show that the intensity of the t peak was significantly weakened after filtration by the pes and pvdf ultrafiltration membrane which is because the protein substances have a large molecular weight and are easy to be rejected by ultrafiltration membranes however the decline of the peaks a and c is not obvious which shows that ultrafiltration is not ideal for the adsorption and retention of small molecular humic organics after 10 min of electrochemical oxidation the intensity of the three peaks t a and c sharply declined and almost all fluorescent substances in algae laden water were degraded with an oxidation duration of over 30 min this suggests that the removal effect of bdd anodizing on fluorescent substances is superior to that of ultrafiltration process henderson et al found that algae organic matter aom is mainly composed of hydrophilic polysaccharides and hydrophobic proteins henderson et al 2008 most of the proteins and humus organic substances included in the fluorescent substances in algae laden water were hydrophobic the efficient removal of fluorescent substances by the bdd anode also shows that the bdd anode has a preferential removal effect for hydrophobic organic components the alleviation of membrane fouling by bdd anodizing probably can attributed to this preferential removal effect in addition to the conventional water quality indicators the content of precursors of chlorinated disinfection by products after pre oxidation and ultrafiltration was also investigated as bromide was not utilized for the dbps detection method the brominated dbps was considered negligible in this study zhou et al 2015 fig 6 shows the removal of trichloromethane formation potential tcmfp by bdd anodizing and the pvdf membrane for different electrochemical oxidation times the concentration of tcmfp in algae laden water was 52 78 μg l which is lower than the chinese sanitary standard for drinking water 60 μg l however there is still a risk of large amount of intracellular organic matter being released during the pre oxidation treatment the tcmfp concentration was 91 61 μg l 62 12 μg l 66 22 μg l and 58 08 μg l respectively for oxidation times of 10 min 30 min 60 min and 100 min this suggests that the tcmfp was rapidly released due to the inactivation effect while the degradation effect of tcmfp was restricted due to the deficiency of generated hydroxyl radicals during the initial period of bdd anodizing the tcmfp concentration decreased when oxidation time over 30 min which is different from the variation of doc after oxidation this suggest that the oxidation substances were selective the removal of tcmfp after filtration was apparently improved when the pre oxidation time was over 30 min this is probably because the large tcmfp molecular weight fraction of iom was much higher than that from eom after bdd oxidation and higher rejection efficiency was obtained zhou et al 2015 3 3 effect of bdd pre oxidation on foulant and interface characteristics the observations of membrane fouling and organic rejection show that the membrane fouling resistance was significantly reduced but the retention of organic foulants also decreased during bdd anode electrochemical pre oxidation treatment for algae laden water filtration therefore it is necessary to investigate the properties of algae laden water after electrochemical pre oxidation in order to understand the mechanism of electrochemical pre oxidation coupled with ultrafiltration fig 7 shows the particle size distribution of algae laden water under different electrochemical pre oxidation conditions the average particle size of untreated algae was around 4 µm and basically no aggregation occurred liu et al 2017c this suggests that the untreated algae laden water was in a stable and steady state khalfbadam et al 2016 when bdd anodizing was utilized the peak of individual algae particles was gradually declined and a peak over 100 µm was generated this indicates that the algae tend to accumulate after oxidation moreover more agglomeration was observed with oxidation time the zeta potential is an important indicator to characterize the stability of dispersions shah et al 2014 to investigate the surface charge of algae mass the zeta potential of algae laden water after bdd anodizing was measured table 2 the zeta potential of untreated algae laden water suggests repulsive charges the value was 24 1 mv which indicates that the algal particles exhibited a greater resistance to aggregation and hence manifested as stable bushell et al 2002 with the increase of oxidation time the zeta potential of algae mass decreased from 18 2 mv to 8 9 mv this indicates that the resistance of algal cells to particle aggregation gradually weakened and therefore algae bodies spontaneously agglomerated and deposited carneiro da cunha et al 2011 hence the particle size distribution of the algae mass became more wide raised after bdd anodizing on the other hand fig s2 indicates that the fraction dimension was decreased which was facilitated by bdd anodizing the fraction dimension can be utilized for the characterization of occupied space and compactness of particles hassan et al 2014 generally an inferior compact spacious structure of particulate mass is observed with lower fraction dimension hence with the bdd pre oxidation the algae cell tends to accumulate and form loose algae flocs liu et al 2017a a previous study proved that the fouling resistance is related with the compressibility of the formed cake layer especially when cake layer fouling was dominant compared to pore blocking the cake layer formed by a loose structure of algae flocs can provide more water channels and therefore result in less flux loss guo et al 2012 the surface free energy of the pvdf ultrafiltration membrane surface for different pre oxidation times is shown in table 3 glw gab and gel represent the van der waals interaction polar interaction and electrostatic interaction of the interface free energy respectively and the sum of the three parts constitutes the total interface free energy gtot desmet et al 2017 the charge of electrostatic interaction was lower after bdd anodizing this was in accordance with the zeta potential of algae laden water after pre oxidation however the absolute value of g131 el was much lower when compared with g131 ab and g131 lw which means that the van der waals interaction and polar interaction play a decisive role in the total cohesion free energy g131 tot showed a gradual increasing trend with the electrochemical pre oxidation time and became positive after 30 min of electrochemical pre oxidation this suggests that the algae foulants showed a repulsion trend during the filtration process after oxidation and this probably contributes to fouling mitigation zhao et al 2020 the cohesive free energy and zeta potential can be attributed to the fact that the cake layer was formed by organic matter and algae mass and polar interactions dominated during the foulant deposition process the adhesive free energy was employed to represent the interface free energy between foulant and membrane surface the polar interaction plays a primary role in adhesive free energy and the g132 ab raised with increasing of oxidation time the influence of oxidation time on van der waals interaction was feeble the electrostatic interaction between membrane and foulant was negative and the attractive force slightly increased with pre oxidation time this is probably because the charge of the foulant surface was turned to positive after bdd anodizing the total adhesive free energy altered from negative to positive and continues to increase when the electrolysis time is over 30 min which indicates that the interaction force converts to repulsion after pre oxidation and hence mitigates the cake layer fouling resistance fig 8 shows the hydrophilic and hydrophobic classification status of the effluent under various pretreatment conditions it can be seen from the figure that the proportion of hydrophilic organic substances in algae laden water was quite large while the proportion of hydrophobic substances was less than 10 this is quite different from the observation of qu et al that the hydrophobic organic doc accounted for about 30 qu et al 2014 this probably because of the difference in the algae derived organic matter separating method the proportion of hydrophilic substances in each group was markedly declined after ultrafiltration which indicates that the hydrophilic components in the algae laden water can be well rejected by the membrane this is also consistent with another study in which neutral and hydrophilic substances were found to be the main foulants after chemical cleaning ding et al 2020 a higher ratio of hydrophilic organic matters was detected after electrochemical treatment two factors may explain the rising trend of hydrophilic organic matter one is that the macromolecular organics with hydrophobic property were degraded to small hydrophilic molecular organics another is the higher hydrophilicity of the organic matter of iom that was released zhang and fu 2018 the hydrophobicity of algae laden water after bdd anodizing is probably one of the reasons for the membrane fouling alleviation fig 9 shows scanning electron micrographs of a fouled membrane surface at 3000 times magnification after different electrochemical pre oxidation time it can be intuitively observed that the algae cells without pre treatment were intact and the particles were homogeneously and tightly deposited onto the membrane surface the algae begin to shrink after bdd anodizing which suggests that the generated oh could highly impact the algae cell surface morphology the cake layer presents a loose and fuzzy form especially after 60 min oxidation which could evoke more water flow channels reduce the cake layer resistance and improve the water production efficiency moreover as shown in fig 9 d and e an amount of algae cells was broken and ablated which indicates that a lower quantity of algal particles was settled onto the membrane surface after a long time of pre oxidation to determine the algae cell integrity after bdd anodizing the flow cytometer was employed the result is shown in fig 9 f for the untreated algae approximately 93 5 of algae cells were intact probably because a small amount of algae cells was in decay period at laboratory cultivation condition after 10 min electro oxidation around 57 7 algae cells were damaged which suggests that the oh could strongly cause cell deactivation a previous study also reported that 94 22 algae were identified to have broken dna strands after oh treatment for only 20 s which proved that oh has a high efficiency for algae inactivation bai et al 2019 3 4 effect of bdd pre oxidation on organic release by a formed cake layer based on the detection of algae morphology and intactness analysis it was found that severe algal deformation and death occurred after electrochemical oxidation previous studies also reported that the algae integrity was highly impacted after ozone persulfate permanganate chlorine h2o2 treatment and the organic concentration of algae laden solution was increased in varying degrees bai et al 2019 li et al 2018 li et al 2020b liu et al 2018 generally the organic concentration of iom was more than an order of magnitude higher than that of eom although the vast majority of algae cells was deemed dead or dna broken after bdd anodizing only a small portion of iom was released fig 4 this algae inactivation and release mechanism was in accordance with other oxidation process liu et al 2018 wei et al 2016a hence a hypothesis can be made algae mass deposited onto the membrane surface may continuously release iom during the filtration process the algae laden water with 0 min and 30 min bdd anodizing was resuspended by diluent after discarding the supernatant fig 10 a presents the detection of uv254 of filtrated solution with microfiltration and ultrafiltration the uv254 of filtrated solution was negligible when comparing with the potential amount of organic substance from intracellular dead and live algae on the other hand to confirm the impact of membrane adsorption on the ultrafiltration process the adsorption saturated pvdf and pes membranes were employed details of the experimental method in supplementary information the purification efficiency of adsorption saturated membranes was slightly declined especially for feed solution after 30 min bdd anodizing the uv254 of filtrated solution by adsorption saturated membranes was even inferior to the filtrated solution of microfiltration which indicates that an amount of organic substances could be rejected due to adsorption on the ultrafiltration membrane the purification efficiency after 30 min bdd anodizing was lower than filtration without pre treatment this implies that avoiding the deposition of dead algae cell onto the membrane surface can improve the filtration separation effectively although the cake layer can be compressed by the filtration pressure since the non rigid characteristics of algae body endows it potential of compressible deformability due to its characteristics of non rigid bodies the release effect of iom was faint especially during ultrafiltration algal cell particles and algae derived organic matter during ultrafiltration process could accumulate on the membrane surface to form a cake layer generally such permeation resistance conformed by the conventional deposition of a foulant layer is known as a self forming dynamic membrane hu et al 2018 the algae laden water with 0 min and 30 min bdd anodizing were preloaded on pvdf and pes ultrafiltration membranes to thoroughly investigate the rejection of a self forming dynamic membrane formed by algae derived foulants with different pre oxidation conditions to better study the enhanced retention capacity the eom separated from algae laden water with 60 min pre oxidation was employed due to its higher portion of small molecular organic matter and hydrophilicity fig 10 b shows the organic rejection of the self forming dynamic membrane dm composited by algae derived foulants after 0 min and 30 min bdd anodizing the retention of organic compounds was significantly improved by the self forming dm without bdd anodizing pre oxidation dm 0 min the rejection of uv254 by pvdf and pes membranes with dm 0 min was 48 2 and 49 3 respectively which is approximately 5 times higher than the interception of direct membrane separation this suggests that the prefiltration by cake layer could notably enhance the purification potential of the ultrafiltration process on the other hand although the prefiltration effect also contributed during the filtration process with dm 30min only 28 1 and 26 5 uv254 rejection was obtained the foulant concentration foulant size cake layer thickness and homogeneity can affect the retention by the dynamic membrane anantharaman et al 2020 the viscous organic substances could be degraded by bdd anodizing and hence decline the bond between algae cells and form a loose cake layer after excluding the possibility of cake layer releasing the reduction of organic substances retention is probably because the pre filtration effect by the dynamic membrane was weakened after pre oxidation 4 conclusion in this work the effect of bdd pre oxidation on ultrafiltration membrane fouling organic rejection foulant and interface characteristics and organic release by formed cake layer were systematically investigated during algae laden water treatment the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the membrane flux improved effectively and the reversible membrane fouling reduced significantly when the oxidation time was over 30 min however the pore blockage might aggravate due to the generation of small molecular organic substances 2 the hydrophilicity of the algae laden water system gradually improved after preferentially oxidizing hydrophobic organics which is beneficial to reduce the interfacial energy of algae bodies and the ultrafiltration membrane and thereby reduce the density of the cake layer the decrease of algae laden water stability also contributed to the loose cake layer structure 3 although algae bodies deformed under the driving pressure used in ultrafiltration the secondary release of iom from the cake layer formed by live and dead algae bodies was faint especially during ultrafiltration in addition the pre filtration effect of the loose cake layer after bdd anodizing was weakened declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17483,in this study ultrafiltration uf pre oxidation with a boron doped diamond bdd electrode was employed aiming to mitigate membrane fouling during algae laden water treatment it was found that bdd anodizing can efficiently alleviate membrane fouling regardless of the filtration membrane material when the oxidation time was over 30 min this was because that the cake layer fouling resistance was highly mitigated by the pre oxidation process the generated small molecular organics after anodic oxidation might increase the potential of pore blockage the anodizing preferentially oxidized hydrophobic organic and fluorescent substances which is conducive to reducing membrane fouling and improving production efficiency besides disinfection byproduct precursors and harmful algae derived substances of uf filtrated solution were contained the algae bodies tend to agglomeration and the zeta potential obviously declined after the pretreatment which is instrumental in forming a loose cake layer structure in addition the interaction force between membrane and foulants also converted to a repulsion force after pre oxidation which implies that bdd pre oxidation was an effective way to mitigate cake layer fouling by reducing foulant membrane interactions at last the secondary organic release of a dynamic formed cake layer was proved to be limited especially for living algae cells graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bdd electrode ultrafiltration algae laden water fouling mechanism organic release 1 introduction lakes and reservoirs have a significant and far reaching impact on the living environment and economic development of surrounding cities chen et al 2018 they are susceptible to exogenous and endogenous pollutants of which water eutrophication and the resulting algae outbreaks are very common algae blooms caused by eutrophication dramatically affect people s living environment wang et al 2019 the presence of a large amount of algae cells accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and interferes with the coagulation and filtration process qi et al 2016 moreover algae derived metabolites as well as disinfection byproduct precursors threaten public health therefore special attention should be paid to this challenge in the process of water environmental protection and governance ultrafiltration uf is a reliable and superior separation technology through size exclusion li et al 2020a the molecular weight cut off of uf membranes is substantially smaller than the size of common algae hence uf can retain virtually 100 algae cells liu et al 2017b the main obstacle of algae laden water treatment by uf is membrane fouling generated by algae bodies and the derived organics in understanding membrane fouling caused by algae laden water the algae bodies are associated to cake layer formation since algae cells are deposited onto membrane surface and the small molecular weight of organic matter induces pore blocking li et al 2014 to mitigate fouling of ultrafiltration membranes aroused by algae laden water various pretreatment technologies have been explored in recent years ding et al 2020 liu et al 2018 wei et al 2016b advanced pre oxidation is an attractive option among a variety of pretreatment strategies wan et al employed ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes including ultraviolet uv persulfate uv chlorine and uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling during algae laden water treatment and found that uv persulfate and uv h2o2 can mitigate membrane fouling whereas the combination uv chlorine conversely aggravates fouling wan et al 2019 it was also reported that a high dose of ozone can aggravate fouling of ultrafiltration membranes during algae laden water treatment especially for irreversible fouling liu et al 2018 hence different from other typical characteristic foulants the uncertainty of ultrafiltration pretreatment specifically pre oxidation for algae laden water should be paid close attention currently reported unfavorable factors of pre oxidation for algae laden water treatment include two aspects one is more severe pore blockage due to the transformation of organic substances into small fragments the other is the cake layer resistance formed by dead algae and the release of intracellular organic matter iom liu et al 2018 wan et al 2019 wei et al 2016b hydroxyl radical oh oxidation is a widely reported advanced oxidation method and researchers also adopt the technology for algae removal li et al 2019 bai et al reported that though the radicals may damage the dna of algae cells no toxin and odorous compounds were released bai et al 2019 therefore the application of hydroxyl radical based oxidation as algae laden water pretreatment for uf was considered promising anode electrochemical oxidation is an environmentally friendly treatment technology and the reactive free electrons lead to a low secondary pollution effect and a high efficiency li et al 2019 xu et al found that electrochemical oxidation has a good inhibitory effect on the growth of microcystis aeruginosa and a better inactivation of algal cells obtained as the current density increased xu et al 2007 zhou et al conducted a boron doped diamond anode bdd oxidation for cyanobacteria treatment and found that the photosynthesis ability and cell integrity of cyanobacteria were destroyed moreover oxidative degradation of the released microcystin lr was obtained zhou et al 2018 the electrolysis system was one of the high oxidation method by continuously generation of free radicals bdd electrode a superior catalytic electrode technology with high oxygen evolution potential was usually preferred as the non active anode due to its stability and efficiency li et al 2019 besides the bdd anodizing shows high degradation and mineralization effect under wide ph range ganiyu et al 2015 therefore the discussion of the potential of bdd anodizing as uf pretreatment for algae laden water has practical and scientific significance this paper investigates the possibility of applying a bdd anode for pre oxidation of uf process furthermore in order to understand algae secretion under pressure used as driving force the potential organic substance release from the cake layer formed by algae bodies live and dead cells is comprehensively discussed in this study a bdd anode and a titanium sheet cathode were employed as the electrode and two kinds of ultrafiltration membranes made of either polyethersulfone pes or polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf were utilized for the filtration process initially membrane fouling and rejection of organic compounds were investigated in addition the interface characteristics of fouled membranes including particle size distribution zeta potential interface free energy morphology were comprehensively investigated finally the potential of release of secondary organic compounds by the formed cake layer was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae culture and extraction the microcystis aeruginosa seeds no fachb 905 were purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences

by a direct current dc power supply and controls the electrolysis current stability at 0 3 a the anode and cathode employed a bdd electrode and a titanium sheet electrode respectively the distance between the two electrodes was 10 mm and the electrode plate area was 10 cm2 hence the current density of the electrochemical device was 30 ma cm2 the electrolysis time was set as 0 min 10 min 30 min 60 min and 100 min and 200 ml algae laden water was employed during the oxidation process flat ultrafiltration membranes of two materials polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf both obtained from microdyn nadir company were used in the experiments both membranes have a molecular weight cutoff of 150 kda and thickness range of 210 to 250 µm a dead end filtration system was utilized with a constant pressure 100 kpa which includes an ultrafiltration cell an electronic balance a high pressure nitrogen tank a precision regulating valve and a computer terminal the ultrafiltration membrane was surface up placed on the bottom of the ultrafiltration the water produced by the ultrafiltration cell flowed into a beaker through a silicone tube the beaker was placed on an electronic balance connected to the computer to record the data every 5 seconds to draw the flux curve 2 3 membrane fouling assessment and mechanism analysis the resistance of the ultrafiltration membrane includes an inherent resistance a reversible resistance and an irreversible resistance zhang and fu 2018 ultrapure water was used for filtration until the flux is stabilized before each filtration process all the filtration tests were conducted at least 3 times the stable flux was recorded as j0 from which the inherent resistance ri can be calculated according to eq 1 1 r i δ p μ j 0 where δp represents the operating pressure pa and μ represents the dynamic viscosity pa s the average flux of the last 3 ml of effluent was recorded as j1 and the total resistance rtot can be calculated according to eq 2 2 r t o t δ p μ j 1 to wipe off the foulant cake layer the surface of the ultrafiltration membrane was gently wiped by a wet sponge when the ultrafiltration process was completed then the ultrafiltration membrane was installed into the ultrafiltration cell and filtrated with ultrapure water the stable flux was recorded as j2 therefore the irreversible resistance rb and the reversible resistance rc can be calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 3 r b δ p μ j 2 δ p μ j 0 4 r t o t r i r b r c in order to further explore the mechanism of membrane fouling during ultrafiltration four classical fouling models were introduced as shown in table 1 the fouling mechanism was corresponding to relationship between d2t dv2 and dt dv eq 5 where t represents the filtration time v represents the total filtration volume and specific fouling mechanisms corresponding to different index values n a b c and d in the table represent constants 5 d 2 t d v 2 k d t d v

calculating the differential relationship between flux and time with matlab 2014 software and d2t dv2 is obtained by calculating the second derivative relationship between filtering time and volume with matlab 2014 software then the value of n was calculated through the logarithmic relationship between d2t dv2 and dt dv eq 8 2 4 analytical methods uv254 was tested using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1810 general analysis beijing and doc was tested using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100s jena germany to detect the charging and aggregation of algal cell particles the zeta potential was measured by a nanometer particle size analyzer marvern s90 uk the particle size of algae cells and surface fractal dimension df was measured by a laser particle size distribution analyzer marvern msatersizer 3000 uk the calculation method of df was introduced in previous work liu et al 2017a hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of organic compounds was classified by non ionic macroporous xad xad 4 and xad 8 resin separation method lu et al 2019 a fluorescent excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy f7000 hitachi japan was utilized to qualitatively analyze fluorescent luminescence characteristics in solution the excitation light ex wavelength is 200 450 nm the emission light em wavelength is 250 550 nm and the scanning interval is 5 nm for both excitation and emission light before measuring the excitation emission matrix the sample solution was filtered through a 0 45µm microfiltration membrane and the ph value was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 liu et

diiodomethane ultrapure water and glycerin were selected as test liquids to calculate the interface free energy the calculation method of cohesive free energy and adhesive free energy can be found in previous work liu et al 2017c a flow cytometer fc500 beckman coulter usa was utilized to detect the algae cell viability sytox green was selected as the fluorescent probe which could selectively penetrate through the ruptured cell membrane and bind to the nucleic acid inside the cell to generate specific fluorescence a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 6890 usa was used to detect the disinfection by product precursor and detail analytical method was introduced in supplemental information liu et al 2018 a scanning electron microscope gemini sem 300 zeiss germany was employed to observe the morphology and microstructure of algal cell particles on the surface of the ultrafiltration membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bdd pre oxidation on membrane fouling the effect of bdd pre oxidation on ultrafiltration membrane fouling mitigation is shown in fig 1 the algae laden water without electrochemical pretreatment caused a rapid flux drop in the initial filtration stage and the specific flux j j0 finally reached 0 1 and 0 04 with pvdf and pes membrane respectively this suggests that the algae laden water has a potential to evoke severe flux decline when 10 min bdd pre oxidation was applied the membrane fouling was slightly alleviated when using the pvdf membrane in contrast a short time electro oxidation has a negligible impact on membrane fouling mitigation with the pes membrane when the electrochemical oxidation time was prolonged the membrane fouling was considerably alleviated with either the pvdf membrane or the pes membrane for the pvdf membrane the final specific fluxes were 0 53 and 0 52 when 30 min and 60 min oxidation time were used and the specific flux began to decrease when further extending the oxidation time for the pes membrane a similar result was obtained the bdd pre oxidation could effectively mitigate the membrane fouling within a certain oxidation time fig 2 presents the membrane fouling reversibility of the pvdf and pes membrane for different bdd pre oxidation times regardless of the pretreatment conditions the ratio of reversible fouling caused by algae cells and macromolecular organic matter deposition was higher than irreversible fouling caused by pore blocking conversely when 10 min bdd oxidation was applied the irreversible fouling of pvdf and pes membranes were aggravated this result can probably be ascribed to the organic matter increase when oxidation is applied the reversible fouling and irreversible fouling resistances could be well controlled when oxidation time was over 30 min especially with pvdf membrane for instance the irreversible fouling resistance declined to 0 53 1012 m 1 and the reversible fouling resistance reduced to 5 95 1012 m 1 at 30 min anodizing oxidation with pvdf membrane this indicates that both reversible fouling and irreversible fouling could be alleviated by bdd oxidation prior to pvdf uf and the controlling for irreversible fouling during filtration with pes membrane was irregular gao et al 2019 however a rise of irreversible fouling resistance was observed with both membranes this can probably be explained by the generation of small molecular organic substances in addition when comparing the fouling resistance of the two ultrafiltration membranes it can be found that the pes ultrafiltration membrane which is more hydrophobic has a higher resistance to fouling during filtration than the pvdf membrane especially for what concerns the irreversible fouling resistance younas et al 2017 to further investigate the effect of electro chemical pretreatment on the membrane fouling mechanism the membrane fouling model based on d2t dv2 and dt dv was utilized ho and zydney 2000 as illustrated by fig 3 each of the filtration processes regardless of the pretreatment condition and membrane material was in accordance with a two stage linear fitting curve which was distinct from our previous work liu et al 2018 in previous work a one stage linear curve was used to fit the ultrafiltration process of algae laden water by ferrous activated persulfate pretreatment table 1 shows the relationship between the n value and the dominant fouling model for instance the main fouling pattern is complete blocking when the n value is 2 or close to 2 both standard blocking and complete blocking govern the fouling mechanism if the n value is between 1 5 and 2 for the pvdf membrane the n values linear fitting correlation slope value of the first stage were 2 29 1 94 1 73 1 66 and 1 53 this suggests that complete blocking was dominant during the first stage of the filtration process without pretreatment however with the increase of electrochemical pre oxidation time standard blocking starts to substitute complete blocking and becomes the dominant fouling mechanism a similar result can be observed with the pes membrane hence a lower ratio of foulants was deposited onto membrane pores but a higher ratio of foulants penetrated into membrane pores and then blocked the pores when the pretreatment was applied this can be explained by two factors one is that the macromolecular organic compounds were prone to decompose by the hydroxyl radical generated by bdd anodizing another is that with the inactivate effect of radicals an amount of intracellular organic matter with smaller molecular weight was released for the second stage the n value lies between 0 201 and 0 206 under all conditions which indicates that although electrochemical pre oxidation could effectively mitigate the membrane fouling growth of a cake layer generated by algae deposition still occurred liu et al 2017c zhou et al 2018 3 2 effect of bdd pre oxidation on organic rejection as shown in fig 4 a and b the impact of algae laden water treatment with bdd anodizing and ultrafiltration on the detection of uv254 was investigated with respect to direct filtration of algae laden water the uv254 of feed and final permeate generated by the pvdf and pes membrane were 0 200 0 098 and 0 095 respectively the rejection of the pvdf and pes membranes was thus 51 and 52 however the absorbance of uv254 increased with the increase of electrolysis pre oxidation it reaches 0 535 cm 1 which is approximately an increase of 167 5 of raw algae laden water after 100 minutes of bdd oxidation one possible explanation of this phenomenon is due to the release of intracellular organic matter iom caused by the electrochemical pre oxidation wan et al 2019 furthermore fig s1 shows that the absorbance of uv254 increased with bdd anode oxidation although it excludes the factor of iom release which indicates that the formation of small molecular organic substances during anodizing could enhance the response to ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 254 nm wei et al 2016b fig 4 c and d present the doc concentration of feed and permeate with respect to direct filtration of algae laden water the removal of doc was 71 1 and 71 6 for the pvdf and pes membrane respectively the removal of doc by the pvdf ultrafiltration membrane at different electrochemical pre oxidation times from 10 min to 100 min were 58 6 41 2 53 1 and 55 2 respectively and the removal by the pes ultrafiltration membrane were 50 6 58 4 41 5 48 6 compared with the removal of uv254 the ultrafiltration combination process has a better removal effect on doc which is probably because uv254 related aromaticity organics is more difficult to be retained by the ultrafiltration process and the doc parameter represents organic matters with all molecular weight distribution hou et al 2018 korshin et al 2009 weishaar et al 2003 fig 5 shows the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum of the effluent under different treatment conditions it can be seen from fig 5 a that the fluorescent substance in the raw water has three characteristic peaks the peak t is generally considered to represent tryptophan protein substances and the two peaks a and c represent humic organic substances liu et al 2017a the peak t is particularly obvious which indicates that the algae laden water contains a high concentration of tryptophan based protein substances the protein substances in solution are likely to originate from metabolic processes and enzyme release xu et al 2016 figures 5 f and k show that the intensity of the t peak was significantly weakened after filtration by the pes and pvdf ultrafiltration membrane which is because the protein substances have a large molecular weight and are easy to be rejected by ultrafiltration membranes however the decline of the peaks a and c is not obvious which shows that ultrafiltration is not ideal for the adsorption and retention of small molecular humic organics after 10 min of electrochemical oxidation the intensity of the three peaks t a and c sharply declined and almost all fluorescent substances in algae laden water were degraded with an oxidation duration of over 30 min this suggests that the removal effect of bdd anodizing on fluorescent substances is superior to that of ultrafiltration process henderson et al found that algae organic matter aom is mainly composed of hydrophilic polysaccharides and hydrophobic proteins henderson et al 2008 most of the proteins and humus organic substances included in the fluorescent substances in algae laden water were hydrophobic the efficient removal of fluorescent substances by the bdd anode also shows that the bdd anode has a preferential removal effect for hydrophobic organic components the alleviation of membrane fouling by bdd anodizing probably can attributed to this preferential removal effect in addition to the conventional water quality indicators the content of precursors of chlorinated disinfection by products after pre oxidation and ultrafiltration was also investigated as bromide was not utilized for the dbps detection method the brominated dbps was considered negligible in this study zhou et al 2015 fig 6 shows the removal of trichloromethane formation potential tcmfp by bdd anodizing and the pvdf membrane for different electrochemical oxidation times the concentration of tcmfp in algae laden water was 52 78 μg l which is lower than the chinese sanitary standard for drinking water 60 μg l however there is still a risk of large amount of intracellular organic matter being released during the pre oxidation treatment the tcmfp concentration was 91 61 μg l 62 12 μg l 66 22 μg l and 58 08 μg l respectively for oxidation times of 10 min 30 min 60 min and 100 min this suggests that the tcmfp was rapidly released due to the inactivation effect while the degradation effect of tcmfp was restricted due to the deficiency of generated hydroxyl radicals during the initial period of bdd anodizing the tcmfp concentration decreased when oxidation time over 30 min which is different from the variation of doc after oxidation this suggest that the oxidation substances were selective the removal of tcmfp after filtration was apparently improved when the pre oxidation time was over 30 min this is probably because the large tcmfp molecular weight fraction of iom was much higher than that from eom after bdd oxidation and higher rejection efficiency was obtained zhou et al 2015 3 3 effect of bdd pre oxidation on foulant and interface characteristics the observations of membrane fouling and organic rejection show that the membrane fouling resistance was significantly reduced but the retention of organic foulants also decreased during bdd anode electrochemical pre oxidation treatment for algae laden water filtration therefore it is necessary to investigate the properties of algae laden water after electrochemical pre oxidation in order to understand the mechanism of electrochemical pre oxidation coupled with ultrafiltration fig 7 shows the particle size distribution of algae laden water under different electrochemical pre oxidation conditions the average particle size of untreated algae was around 4 µm and basically no aggregation occurred liu et al 2017c this suggests that the untreated algae laden water was in a stable and steady state khalfbadam et al 2016 when bdd anodizing was utilized the peak of individual algae particles was gradually declined and a peak over 100 µm was generated this indicates that the algae tend to accumulate after oxidation moreover more agglomeration was observed with oxidation time the zeta potential is an important indicator to characterize the stability of dispersions shah et al 2014 to investigate the surface charge of algae mass the zeta potential of algae laden water after bdd anodizing was measured table 2 the zeta potential of untreated algae laden water suggests repulsive charges the value was 24 1 mv which indicates that the algal particles exhibited a greater resistance to aggregation and hence manifested as stable bushell et al 2002 with the increase of oxidation time the zeta potential of algae mass decreased from 18 2 mv to 8 9 mv this indicates that the resistance of algal cells to particle aggregation gradually weakened and therefore algae bodies spontaneously agglomerated and deposited carneiro da cunha et al 2011 hence the particle size distribution of the algae mass became more wide raised after bdd anodizing on the other hand fig s2 indicates that the fraction dimension was decreased which was facilitated by bdd anodizing the fraction dimension can be utilized for the characterization of occupied space and compactness of particles hassan et al 2014 generally an inferior compact spacious structure of particulate mass is observed with lower fraction dimension hence with the bdd pre oxidation the algae cell tends to accumulate and form loose algae flocs liu et al 2017a a previous study proved that the fouling resistance is related with the compressibility of the formed cake layer especially when cake layer fouling was dominant compared to pore blocking the cake layer formed by a loose structure of algae flocs can provide more water channels and therefore result in less flux loss guo et al 2012 the surface free energy of the pvdf ultrafiltration membrane surface for different pre oxidation times is shown in table 3 glw gab and gel represent the van der waals interaction polar interaction and electrostatic interaction of the interface free energy respectively and the sum of the three parts constitutes the total interface free energy gtot desmet et al 2017 the charge of electrostatic interaction was lower after bdd anodizing this was in accordance with the zeta potential of algae laden water after pre oxidation however the absolute value of g131 el was much lower when compared with g131 ab and g131 lw which means that the van der waals interaction and polar interaction play a decisive role in the total cohesion free energy g131 tot showed a gradual increasing trend with the electrochemical pre oxidation time and became positive after 30 min of electrochemical pre oxidation this suggests that the algae foulants showed a repulsion trend during the filtration process after oxidation and this probably contributes to fouling mitigation zhao et al 2020 the cohesive free energy and zeta potential can be attributed to the fact that the cake layer was formed by organic matter and algae mass and polar interactions dominated during the foulant deposition process the adhesive free energy was employed to represent the interface free energy between foulant and membrane surface the polar interaction plays a primary role in adhesive free energy and the g132 ab raised with increasing of oxidation time the influence of oxidation time on van der waals interaction was feeble the electrostatic interaction between membrane and foulant was negative and the attractive force slightly increased with pre oxidation time this is probably because the charge of the foulant surface was turned to positive after bdd anodizing the total adhesive free energy altered from negative to positive and continues to increase when the electrolysis time is over 30 min which indicates that the interaction force converts to repulsion after pre oxidation and hence mitigates the cake layer fouling resistance fig 8 shows the hydrophilic and hydrophobic classification status of the effluent under various pretreatment conditions it can be seen from the figure that the proportion of hydrophilic organic substances in algae laden water was quite large while the proportion of hydrophobic substances was less than 10 this is quite different from the observation of qu et al that the hydrophobic organic doc accounted for about 30 qu et al 2014 this probably because of the difference in the algae derived organic matter separating method the proportion of hydrophilic substances in each group was markedly declined after ultrafiltration which indicates that the hydrophilic components in the algae laden water can be well rejected by the membrane this is also consistent with another study in which neutral and hydrophilic substances were found to be the main foulants after chemical cleaning ding et al 2020 a higher ratio of hydrophilic organic matters was detected after electrochemical treatment two factors may explain the rising trend of hydrophilic organic matter one is that the macromolecular organics with hydrophobic property were degraded to small hydrophilic molecular organics another is the higher hydrophilicity of the organic matter of iom that was released zhang and fu 2018 the hydrophobicity of algae laden water after bdd anodizing is probably one of the reasons for the membrane fouling alleviation fig 9 shows scanning electron micrographs of a fouled membrane surface at 3000 times magnification after different electrochemical pre oxidation time it can be intuitively observed that the algae cells without pre treatment were intact and the particles were homogeneously and tightly deposited onto the membrane surface the algae begin to shrink after bdd anodizing which suggests that the generated oh could highly impact the algae cell surface morphology the cake layer presents a loose and fuzzy form especially after 60 min oxidation which could evoke more water flow channels reduce the cake layer resistance and improve the water production efficiency moreover as shown in fig 9 d and e an amount of algae cells was broken and ablated which indicates that a lower quantity of algal particles was settled onto the membrane surface after a long time of pre oxidation to determine the algae cell integrity after bdd anodizing the flow cytometer was employed the result is shown in fig 9 f for the untreated algae approximately 93 5 of algae cells were intact probably because a small amount of algae cells was in decay period at laboratory cultivation condition after 10 min electro oxidation around 57 7 algae cells were damaged which suggests that the oh could strongly cause cell deactivation a previous study also reported that 94 22 algae were identified to have broken dna strands after oh treatment for only 20 s which proved that oh has a high efficiency for algae inactivation bai et al 2019 3 4 effect of bdd pre oxidation on organic release by a formed cake layer based on the detection of algae morphology and intactness analysis it was found that severe algal deformation and death occurred after electrochemical oxidation previous studies also reported that the algae integrity was highly impacted after ozone persulfate permanganate chlorine h2o2 treatment and the organic concentration of algae laden solution was increased in varying degrees bai et al 2019 li et al 2018 li et al 2020b liu et al 2018 generally the organic concentration of iom was more than an order of magnitude higher than that of eom although the vast majority of algae cells was deemed dead or dna broken after bdd anodizing only a small portion of iom was released fig 4 this algae inactivation and release mechanism was in accordance with other oxidation process liu et al 2018 wei et al 2016a hence a hypothesis can be made algae mass deposited onto the membrane surface may continuously release iom during the filtration process the algae laden water with 0 min and 30 min bdd anodizing was resuspended by diluent after discarding the supernatant fig 10 a presents the detection of uv254 of filtrated solution with microfiltration and ultrafiltration the uv254 of filtrated solution was negligible when comparing with the potential amount of organic substance from intracellular dead and live algae on the other hand to confirm the impact of membrane adsorption on the ultrafiltration process the adsorption saturated pvdf and pes membranes were employed details of the experimental method in supplementary information the purification efficiency of adsorption saturated membranes was slightly declined especially for feed solution after 30 min bdd anodizing the uv254 of filtrated solution by adsorption saturated membranes was even inferior to the filtrated solution of microfiltration which indicates that an amount of organic substances could be rejected due to adsorption on the ultrafiltration membrane the purification efficiency after 30 min bdd anodizing was lower than filtration without pre treatment this implies that avoiding the deposition of dead algae cell onto the membrane surface can improve the filtration separation effectively although the cake layer can be compressed by the filtration pressure since the non rigid characteristics of algae body endows it potential of compressible deformability due to its characteristics of non rigid bodies the release effect of iom was faint especially during ultrafiltration algal cell particles and algae derived organic matter during ultrafiltration process could accumulate on the membrane surface to form a cake layer generally such permeation resistance conformed by the conventional deposition of a foulant layer is known as a self forming dynamic membrane hu et al 2018 the algae laden water with 0 min and 30 min bdd anodizing were preloaded on pvdf and pes ultrafiltration membranes to thoroughly investigate the rejection of a self forming dynamic membrane formed by algae derived foulants with different pre oxidation conditions to better study the enhanced retention capacity the eom separated from algae laden water with 60 min pre oxidation was employed due to its higher portion of small molecular organic matter and hydrophilicity fig 10 b shows the organic rejection of the self forming dynamic membrane dm composited by algae derived foulants after 0 min and 30 min bdd anodizing the retention of organic compounds was significantly improved by the self forming dm without bdd anodizing pre oxidation dm 0 min the rejection of uv254 by pvdf and pes membranes with dm 0 min was 48 2 and 49 3 respectively which is approximately 5 times higher than the interception of direct membrane separation this suggests that the prefiltration by cake layer could notably enhance the purification potential of the ultrafiltration process on the other hand although the prefiltration effect also contributed during the filtration process with dm 30min only 28 1 and 26 5 uv254 rejection was obtained the foulant concentration foulant size cake layer thickness and homogeneity can affect the retention by the dynamic membrane anantharaman et al 2020 the viscous organic substances could be degraded by bdd anodizing and hence decline the bond between algae cells and form a loose cake layer after excluding the possibility of cake layer releasing the reduction of organic substances retention is probably because the pre filtration effect by the dynamic membrane was weakened after pre oxidation 4 conclusion in this work the effect of bdd pre oxidation on ultrafiltration membrane fouling organic rejection foulant and interface characteristics and organic release by formed cake layer were systematically investigated during algae laden water treatment the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the membrane flux improved effectively and the reversible membrane fouling reduced significantly when the oxidation time was over 30 min however the pore blockage might aggravate due to the generation of small molecular organic substances 2 the hydrophilicity of the algae laden water system gradually improved after preferentially oxidizing hydrophobic organics which is beneficial to reduce the interfacial energy of algae bodies and the ultrafiltration membrane and thereby reduce the density of the cake layer the decrease of algae laden water stability also contributed to the loose cake layer structure 3 although algae bodies deformed under the driving pressure used in ultrafiltration the secondary release of iom from the cake layer formed by live and dead algae bodies was faint especially during ultrafiltration in addition the pre filtration effect of the loose cake layer after bdd anodizing was weakened declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17484,although eutrophic urban rivers receiving loads of wastewater represent an important anthropogenic source of n2o little is known as to how temperature and other environmental factors affect temporal variations in n2o emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and downstream rivers two year monitoring at a wwtp and five river sites was complemented with available water quality data laboratory incubations and stable isotopes in n2o and no3 to explore how wastewater effluents interact with seasonal changes in environmental conditions to affect downstream metabolic processes and n2o emissions from the lower han river traversing the megacity seoul water quality data from four wwtps revealed significant inverse relationships between water temperature and the concentrations or fluxes of total n tn in effluents increased tn fluxes at low temperatures concurred with n2o surges in wwtp effluents and downstream rivers counteracting the long term decline in tn fluxes resulting from enhanced wastewater treatments incubation experiments with river water and sediment in isolation or combined implied the hypoxic winter sediment as a large source of n2o whereas the anoxic summer sediment produced a smaller amount of n2o only when it was added with oxic water for both wwtp effluents and downstream rivers bulk isotope ratios and intramolecular distribution of 15n in n2o distinctly differed between summer and winter indicating incomplete denitrification in the hypoxic sediment at low temperatures as a primary downstream source adding to wwtp derived n2o winter surges

studied as important sources of co2 and ch4 to the atmosphere bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 much less research has been undertaken regarding controlling mechanisms for n2o emissions from increasingly n enriched inland waters worldwide a limited understanding of n2o emissions from inland waters may be illustrated by the fifth assessment report of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc where rivers represent a natural source of ch4 but an anthropogenic source of n2o ciais et al 2013 a particularly large uncertainty lies in estimating the global riverine

have argued that the current ipcc approaches substantially underestimate n2o emissions from anthropogenically impacted river systems seitzinger and kroeze 1998 seitzinger et al 2000 beaulieu et al 2011 on the other hand a recent meta analysis hu et al 2016 and a process based model maavara et al 2019 have provided much lower estimates 12 67 gg n2o n yr 1 than the previous estimates table s1 furthermore altered rates of n transformation processes in anthropogenically modified river systems have not yet been incorporated into global n budgets despite a growing recognition of manmade

treatments effluents from wwtps can also enhance n2o emissions from downstream waterways by affecting n transformation processes in receiving waters toyoda et al 2009 yu et al 2013 u s environmental protection agency 2019 urban rivers have been identified as the largest inland water source of n2o as a result of enhanced nitrification and denitrification in eutrophic waters that receive high n loads from wwtp effluents and fertilizers kroeze et al 2010 seitzinger et al 2000 beaulieu et al 2011 yu et al 2013 however ipcc guidelines for accounting n2o emissions from receiving waters intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2019 have rarely been incorporated into actual national and global inventories that usually focus on n2o emissions from human and animal waste u s environmental protection agency 2019 furthermore little is known about the relative contributions of wwtps and riverine metabolic processes to the coupled production and consumption of n2o in urban river systems over the last decades considerable efforts have been made to elucidate major factors controlling n2o emissions from diverse wastewater treatments processes maavara et al 2019 isotope techniques have been applied increasingly to the study of n2o production pathways specific to wastewater treatment processes toyoda et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2013 duan et al 2017 in particular the intramolecular site preference sp of 15n in the asymmetric structure of n n o has been used successfully in assessing the relative contributions of the primary biological n2o production processes including nh2oh oxidation nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification toyoda et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2013 tumendelger et al 2016 while these previous studies have contributed to unravelling controlling mechanisms for n2o production within wwtps they did not take an integrated approach considering temporal variations in n2o production in both wwtps and downstream rivers to explore how treated wastewater interacts with seasonal variations in environmental conditions to affect riverine metabolic processes and n2o emissions in anthropogenically modified river systems we

were measured at three mainstem sites m up m mid and m down and two tributaries t high and t low on a monthly july 2017 august 2018 or bimonthly august 2018 june 2019 basis fig 1 the three mainstem sites were selected based on spatial coverage spanning the entire section of the lower han river sandwiched by the two submerged weirs that were constructed to increase baseflow in the 1980s the two tributaries represent either a highly polluted tributary loaded with wwtp effluents t high and a low pollution tributary without any wwtp within the subbasin as part of the routine monitoring samples were also collected at a wwtp located near the mouth of the tributary jn on a quarterly basis in addition two samples were collected for n2o isotope analysis at another wwtp located upstream of the site m down the data of water temperature and quality tn and tp concentrations measured in the effluents from the four major wwtps in seoul were obtained from the seoul metropolitan government for the two season campaigns conducted in a monsoon july 2017 and a low flow period april 2018 three tributaries with wwtps t high and three tributaries without wwtps t low were surveyed at a headwater and an outlet location water temperature ph electrical conductivity and do were measured in situ during each sampling using a portable multi meter orion 5 star portable thermo scientific usa air temperature

during low flow periods using an acid washed amber glass bottle 2 l sampling on the mainstem was conducted either on a jetty 10 20 m away from the river bank sites m up and m down or on the river bank along an island site m mid whereas tributaries were usually sampled near the river bank a manual headspace equilibration method was used to measure n2o concentrations dissolved in surface water jin et al 2018 a 30 ml water sample and a 30 ml ambient air sample were collected in sequence using a 60 ml syringe the syringe was shaken vigorously for 2 min and 20 ml of the equilibrated headspace air was transferred to a pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vial thus creating overpressure to ensure a long term sample storage without noticeable concentration change for several months although we could not take replicate samples at all sites of the routine monitoring and two season campaigns replicate water and gas samples were collected from one of the five routine monitoring sites m up and two of 12 two season campaign sites one t low and one t high sites to evaluate sampling associated errors for all measurement parameters 2 2 laboratory analyses collected water samples were immediately

headspace equilibration samples were measured on a gas chromatograph 7890a agilent usa equipped with an electron capture detector µecd and a supelco hayesep q 12 ft 1 8 in column certified standard reference gases in n2 balance were used to calibrate the gc signals and assess instrumental accuracy and consistency more details on water and gas analyses have been reported elsewhere jin et al 2018 selected subsets of gas samples were analyzed for stable n isotopes in n2o by a gasbench precon gas concentration system interfaced to a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermoscientific bremen germany results for stable isotope values are reported in standard notion shown in eq 1 where r is 15 n 14 n 1 δ 15 n r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 10 3 another subset of headspace equilibration were measured for n and o stable isotope ratios δ 15nbulk and δ 18o and the intramolecular sp of 15n in n2o using a gc irms mat252 thermoscientific bremen germany equipped with a modified preconcentration device toyoda et al 2009 definition of δ values were similar to eq 1 and sp δ15nα δ15nβ where nα and nβ denote central and terminal n in the asymmetric structure of nno respectively the reduction of n2o to n2 can result in deviations of isotope ratios and sp values of remaining n2o molecules from the initial linear relationships between sp and isotope ratios ostrom et al 2007 therefore based on a previous suggestion well et al 2012 for using δ18o instead of δ15n an isotopomer mixing approach was employed to account for n2o reduction effect using endmember values obtained from pure culture experiments nh2oh oxidation spnh2oh from 33 to 37 δ18o from 40 to 50 bacterial denitrification including nitrifier denitrification spd from 10 to 0 δ18o from 10 to 20 and the average reduction slope 0 35 deppe et al 2017 the initial isotope values of n2o before reduction were estimated from the point of interception between the average mixing line of the two endmembers and the reduction line passing each sample value from these initial isotope values except for one measured value that was lower than the initial value and therefore used directly assuming negligible reduction the fraction of n2o derived from nh2oh oxidation fnh2oh and the fraction of n2o derived from denitrification including nitrifier denitrification fd were calculated using the following equation f n h 2 o h 1 f d s p s p d s p n h 2 o h s p d isotopic analysis of no3 was conducted using the denitrifying bacterial method sigman et al 2001 hattori et al 2016 coupled with n2o decomposition by microwave induced plasma casciotti et al 2002 briefly the bacterial method involves a strain of denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas aureofaciens which lacks the enzyme n2o reductase involved in the conversion of nitrate into n2o the produced n2o is passed into an online automated system involving purified n2o gas chromatographic techniques and is followed by the decomposition of n2o to o2 and n2 prior to analysis by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany with monitoring ions at m z 32 33 and 34 for oxygen isotope measurements and m

34 and 32 and their accepted values were estimated to be 0 2 and 0 6 for δ15n and δ18o respectively the slopes and intercepts of linear regressions were used to convert the measurement values into calibrated values relative to international standards 2 3 incubation experiments samples of river benthic sediments and their overlying water at 10 cm above the riverbed were collected in august 2018 and december 2019 to compare n2o production potentials the same volumes of sediment and water were used in three treatments three replicates per treatment in the first treatment containing only sediment a sediment sample 60 ml or 150 ml was transferred into a glass bottle 120 ml and 300 ml for the winter and summer incubation respectively the bottle was sealed with a gas tight lid and then filled with he in the second treatment an incubation bottle was completely filled with river water the third treatment included both sediment and water a 60 ml winter or 150 ml portion summer of the sediment that had been kept in the storage bottles without contacting air was transferred into an incubation bottle and the bottle was then completely filled with river water to ensure that no headspace remained while minimizing mixing induced disturbance to keep the sediment as intact as possible for the same reason the incubation bottles were not shaken during the incubation following a previous study royer et al 2004 although this setting might create somewhat different condition from the flowing water condition that can enhance sediment water material exchanges the summer august 2018 and winter december 2019 samples were kept for 12 h in the dark in an incubator set at 31 c and 4 c ambient water temperature at site m down on the sampling date respectively samples were incubated for 12 h because a longer incubation time e g 24 h would result in a depletion of o2 in the oxic water samples as observed in a previous study sturm et al 2016 and our own test prior to this experiment anoxic condition can result in an underestimation of the n2o production rate due to accelerated n2o reduction to n2 upon completion of the 12 h incubation headspace air samples from the first treatment were transferred to pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vials for gas analysis n2o gases dissolved in the water of the second and third treatments were collected using manual headspace equilibration with ambient air after measuring do the incubated water samples from the second and third treatments were filtered through membrane filters with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm to measure doc and major ions in the filtrates 2 4 data analysis the air water gas flux f of n2o was calculated according to the equation f k δc where k is the gas transfer velocity and δc is the air water gas concentration gradient lauerwald et al 2015 to estimate k we used a range of k values normalized to a schmidt number sc of 600 k 600 that were estimated for small and large rivers in the temperate zone by lauerwald et al 2015 7 58 10 2 m d 1 for the tributaries and wwtp effluents 3 95 5 32 m d 1 for the han river mainstem the actual gas transfer velocity k actual of a specific month was estimated from k 600 and the measured water temperature the monthly mean areal fluxes of n2o mmol m 2 d 1 were calculated from the estimated k actual and measured δc values and then averaged to produce the annual mean k value for the calculation of the annual mean areal flux of n2o most routine monitoring data were not normally distributed hence the non parametric spearman s rank correlation was performed to examine the relationships among the measured water quality and hydroclimatic variables spatiotemporal variations in the concentrations and fluxes of all n species were analyzed by the non parametric kruskal wallis analysis of variance followed by dunn s multiple comparisons all statistical analyses were conducted with spss version 20 spss inc chicago usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variations in n concentrations and fluxes the two year monitoring revealed large longitudinal and seasonal variations in the concentrations and fluxes of n2o along the lower han river fig 2 table s2 both concentrations and fluxes of n2o increased downstream along the mainstem lower han river table s2 while n2o was highly supersaturated with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium across the mainstem and tributary sites exceptionally high n2o concentrations measured at m down and t high may exceed the uppermost ranges of n2o reported for other rivers piña ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 toyoda et al 2009 beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 mean areal emission rates of n2o μmol m 2 d 1 at m down 2 206 and t high 4 558 fell in the upper range of 169 reported observations 43 to 12 754 median 29 compiled by a global synthesis hu et al 2016 the concentrations of n2o at a wwtp discharge and its downstream tributary location t high displayed similar seasonal variations with the highest concentrations during the winter fig 2 across the han river mainstem n2o concentrations were relatively low during the monsoon and other high flow periods when increased flows from the upstream dam and other tributaries may have caused a dilution effect on the concentrations of n2o and other water quality components however the peak n2o concentrations measured at m down from february through may 2018 exceeded those of wwtp effluents and t high fig 2 compared with these exceptionally high concentrations at m down n2o concentrations were relatively low during the corresponding period in 2019 the large concurrent seasonal increases in n2o concentrations at wwtp effluents t high and m down fig 2b generally coincided with increases in tn concentrations in wwtp effluents and m down fig 2c the winter increases in tn loads in wwtp effluents can be attributed to lowered efficiencies of biological n removal at wwtps during cold winter months as indicated by the significant negative relationships between water temperature and tn concentrations in effluents from the four wwtps in seoul from june 2016 to december 2018 fig 3 winter daily tn exports from two wwtps had significant negative relationships with water temperature although tp exports exhibited no significant relationship fig 3 activities of some enzymes involved in various denitrification processes are known to decelerate at low temperatures and result in accumulation of no2 thereby facilitating n2o production via nitrifier denitrification and elevating tn in wwtp effluents duan et al 2017 massara et al 2017 while the parallel temporal variations in tn concentrations in wwtp effluents and m down fig 2c illustrate a predominant influence of wastewater effluents on the downstream n fluxes including n2o emissions the higher concentrations of n2o at m down than at t high in 2018 imply a complex interplay of various processes involving the concentration effect of low flows additional inputs from other downstream sources and n2o production in river water or benthic sediment the negative correlations between river flow and n2o concentrations were not significant at all the sites except for t high table s3 this together with the fact that among the three mainstem sites large concentration increases during low flow periods occurred only at m down fig 2 indicates a minor concentration effect of reduced flows during the relatively dry period from winter to spring the contribution from other tributaries was not likely to be substantial because n2o concentrations were highest at t high among the major tributaries sampled during the two season field campaigns data not shown therefore the production of n2o either in river water or benthic sediment must have added a significant portion to the wastewater derived gases during the n2o surge in 2018 although correlations don t provide any direct causal evidence the significant correlations between n2o and other measurements at m down including positive correlations with nh4 n p 0 001 electrical conductivity p 0 001 and dissolved oxygen do p 0 04 and the negative correlation with water temperature p 0 02 table s3 fig s1 offered some clues into the crucial drivers for the 2018 surge as well as the overall seasonal variations in n2o concentrations first the significant positive correlation between n2o and nh4 n or do at m down implicates nitrification as a potential riverine source of n2o as observed in other n rich rivers cébron et al 2005 yu et al 2013 the nitrification of nh4 released from wwtps was suggested as a dominant source of n2o emissions from eutrophic rivers in shanghai yu et al 2013 however we cannot rule out the possibility of haphazard correlations among these factors given the common influence of wwtp effluents on nh4 n do and n2o second all measured n species showed significant p 0 05 negative correlations with water temperature across the mainstem sites except for tn at m up and no3 at m down fig s1 reflecting concomitant concentration increases in all measured n species at low water temperatures fig 2 while low temperatures appear to play a key role in determining the winter time increases and hence overall seasonal patterns of n2o concentrations in both wwtp effluents and downstream waterways multiple interacting factors might have been involved in the 2018 n2o surge at m down the mean water temperature at m down on the sampling dates from december 2017 to february 2018 was 1 6 c which was lower than that of the second winter sampling period 4 7 c indicating the role of low temperature in february 2018 for the enhanced riverine n2o production however the sustained high n2o concentrations in the following months until may 2018 suggest that other factors also need to be taken into consideration to elucidate the controlling mechanism for the n2o surge 3 2 effects of wastewater and temperature on downstream n transformations the incubation experiments with water and sediment samples collected at m down in august 2018 and december 2019 showed a stark contrast in the patterns of n2o production and consumption between summer and winter fig 4 during the summer incubation n2o concentrations increased only in the water overlying the sediment s w by 1 132 nmol l 1 for the winter samples however a much larger net increase in n2o concentrations 10 546 nmol l 1 was found in the sediment only treatment s compared with a very small increase 56 nmol l 1 in the water only treatment w and a negligible change in the s w samples in the s w samples of both summer and winter incubations decreases in do and no3 n concentrations concurred with increases in nh4 n concentrations fig 4 it was noteworthy that a larger fall of do from 200 to 34 μmol l 1 occurred in the summer compared with a rather moderate wintertime decrease from 355 to 254 μmol l 1 the n2o production coupled with no3 consumption in the summer s w samples together with the near zero level of do 0 5 μmol l 1 measured in the sediment prior to the incubation implicates that the addition of the oxic water rich in no3 may have hindered the complete denitrification from no3 to n2 that might have been occurring in the originally anoxic sediment leading to a small production of n2o as an intermediate of incomplete denitrification cébron et al 2005 piña ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 high no3 loads in the overlying water have been suggested to trigger n2o production through incomplete denitrification at the sediment water interface piña ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 the experimental set up allowing suspended sediment settling combined with near zero production of n2o in the water only treatment fig 4 precludes such significant levels of n2o production from suspended sediment as have been observed in previous studies e g xia et al 2016 the relatively high do level 254 μmol l 1 measured in the winter s w samples after the 12 hr incubation indicates a narrow range of do that would be suitable for n2o production at the sediment water interface considering the fact that do levels can drastically drop across the interface between the oxic water and the anoxic sediment ditoro 2001 the addition of the oxic water may have caused a large increase in do away from the narrow hypoxic range of do that was suitable for n2o production via denitrification in the sediment the do level in the winter sediment 2 8 μmol l 1 was low but slightly higher than the near zero level found in the summer sediment this non zero do level linked to the exceptionally large n2o increase in the winter sediment samples fig 4e implies that the sediment samples might not have been completely anoxic before water addition with do levels falling in the narrow do range suitable for n2o production n2o production during denitrification has been attributed to a low but non zero o2 availability as n2o reduction to n2 is more complete under anoxic conditions rosamond et al 2012 the final do levels in the s w samples were much higher than the low do values measured in the hypoxic sediment creating an unfavorable condition for n2o production in the sediment fig 4 under actual field conditions however larger amounts of n2o could have been produced in the entire sediment layer deeper than 50 cm overriding the dampening effect of the oxic water on n2o production at the sediment water interface given the winter incubation results emphasizing the hypoxic sediment as the single most important riverine source of n2o fig 4d along with the observed relationships between n2o and the multiple factors including water temperature and do in the han river it is reasonable to assume that n2o effluxes from the entire sediment layer made a significant contribution to the n2o surge observed at m down in 2018 fig 2b although the two incubation experiments cannot fully cover large variations in do in the field the results emphasize the hypoxic sediment winter or the sediment water interface summer as a seasonal hotspot of n2o production in the lower han river it demands further research to find out whether the optimal hypoxic range for n2o production in the benthic sediment can last for several months from december to may as observed during the 2018 surge event offering a stimulating condition for enhanced n2o production initially triggered by increased wastewater derived n fluxes at low temperatures the very low levels of do linked to the net n2o increases in the s winter and s w summer samples fig 4 combined with the positive correlations between surface water concentrations of n2o and do or nh4 n at site m down table s3 point to nitrification as an alternative source of n2o given that almost no n2o production occurred in the summer water only treatment fig 5 a n2o production via nitrification might have occurred at the sediment water interface n2o production in n enriched urban rivers has been ascribed to nh2oh oxidation and nitrifier denitrification under hypoxic conditions do 1 1 to 1 5 mg l 1 cébron et al 2005 toyoda et al 2009 yu et al 2013 high nh4 and low no2 concentrations were found to stimulate the rate of n2o production via nh2oh oxidation wunderlin et al 2012 the drastic decrease in do to 34 μmol l 1 1 1 mg l 1 in the summer s w samples fig 4c suggests that not only nh2oh oxidation but also nitrifier denitrification might have provided an additional source of n2o at least during the later phase of the incubation when increased oxygen stress would favor nitrifier denitrification cébron et al 2005 zhu et al 2013 the nh4 production coupled with no3 consumption in the s w samples of both summer and winter incubations fig 4b d also raises the possibility of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra occurring under increasingly anoxic conditions fig 4c f no3 from overlying water can supply a source for dnra in the hypoxic to anoxic sediment xia et al 2018 higher rates of dnra as well as denitrification during the summer than in the winter have been reported for the benthic sediments from the highly polluted urban river network in shanghai cheng et al 2016 dnra may be coupled with other n transformation processes to release n2o from the sediment water interface under oxygen stress the dual isotope analysis of no3 allowed for assessing the relative contributions of the headwater streams and the outlets of the six tributaries and wwtp effluents as the primary source of no3 in the lower han river fig 5a the isotope signals found at the tributary outlets and mainstem sites were similar to those of wwtp effluents illustrating the importance of urban wastewater as a predominant source of no3 this result is consistent with a previous finding for the entire han river basin lee et al 2008 overlapping δ15n no3 values among the mainstem sites tributary outlets and wwtp effluents fig 5a fell in the ranges that are indicative of manure and sewage whereas δ15n no3 values for the headwater streams indicate a predominant contribution of soil derived no3 kendall et al 2007 compared with no3 n2o exhibited distinctively lower δ15n and higher δ18o values fig 5a as observed in other urban rivers toyoda et al 2009 thuan et al 2018 despite the wide scatters in both δ15n and δ18o among the mainstem sites and wwtp effluents there were noticeable seasonal differences in isotope values between winter and summer fig 5a comparing the isotope values of the wwtp effluent samples with the values reported for different wastewater treatment processes toyoda et al 2011 townsend small et al 2011 tumendelger et al 2016 suggests that both nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification may be involved in n2o production in the studied wwtp n2o isotopomers from individual wastewater treatment processes have shown that heterotrophic denitrification prevails under anoxic conditions while both nh2oh oxidation and nitrifier denitrification no2 reduction may be involved in the production of n2o under low oxygen conditions toyoda et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2012 tumendelger et al 2016 n2o molecules generated by nitrifier denitrification tend to be more depleted in 15n and 18o than those from heterotrophic denitrification townsend small et al 2011 the relatively low values of δ15n and δ18o measured at all sites except m up in february and december fig 5a imply that n2o gases in wwtp effluents and downstream rivers might have been produced from nitrifier denitrification during the winter whereas denitrification and or nh2oh oxidation prevailed during the warmer months baulch et al 2012 also observed generally higher δ15n and δ18o values in summer and attributed the finding to an isotope effect associated with enhanced n2o reduction at higher temperatures that would result in isotopic enrichment of the remaining n2o molecules however the values of δ15n and δ18o alone are limited in evaluating the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification given the complex array of concomitant abiotic and biotic processes involved in the production and consumption of n2o duan et al 2017 the original values of δ18o measured at m down and wwtp effluents during the summer exhibited particularly large deviations from the mixing line between two endmembers namely nh2oh oxidation and bacterial denitrification indicating an enhanced n2o reduction at high summer temperatures fig 5b the isotopomer mixing approach deppe et al 2017 employed to compensate the effect of n2o reduction allowed for a source partitioning between the two endmembers fig 5c the fraction of n2o produced by nh2oh oxidation fnh2oh was highest in the surface water and the overlying water added to the benthic sediment collected at m down during the summer 0 77 0 90 in contrast high fractions of n2o produced by denitrification fd at m down and wwtp effluents during the colder seasons ranged from 0 71 m down to 0 88 wwtp effluents comparing the corrected sp values fig 5c with those measured for pure cultures of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria sutka et al 2006 yamazaki et al 2014 indicates nitrification in summer and denitrification in winter as the dominant source of n2o at m down although 15n fractionations observed during the pure culture incubation may differ from those occurring in complex microbial communities that are commonly found in wwtps and rivers duan et al 2017 unlike the distinct separation between the summer and winter values of bulk isotope ratios and sp in wwtp effluents the corrected values of δ18o and sp were more congregated resulting in a relatively narrow range of fd from 0 67 july 2018 to 0 88 february 2019 this result suggests that denitrification may be a dominant process of n2o production in wwtps throughout the year consistent with previous findings toyoda et al 2009 the higher value of fd observed in wwtps during the winter may have resulted from an enhanced n2o production via nitrifier denitrification because nitrifier denitrification can benefit from accumulating no2 in response to incomplete heterotrophic denitrification under unfavorable hypoxic conditions or low temperature wunderlin et al 2012 massara et al 2017 however the overlapping signatures of sp don t allow a clear separation of nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as the primary source of n2o sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2012 therefore it remains an unresolved question how temperature and other factors combine to control the competitive balance between heterotrophic and nitrifier denitrification in wwtps and downstream waterways given the higher corrected sp values estimated for the downstream tributaries and mainstem sites relative to the corresponding values in the wwtp effluents fig 5c the relative importance of nh2oh oxidation seems to increase along the river downstream especially during the summer seasonal variations in isotopic signatures fig 5 combined with the changes in do observed during the incubation experiments fig 4 suggest that hypoxic conditions created in the benthic sediment winter or across the sediment water interface summer may enhance n2o production via nitrifier denitrification or nh2oh oxidation respectively nitrification has been suggested to amount to or even exceed the capacity of heterotrophic denitrification as a source of n2o emissions from eutrophic rivers cébron et al 2005 beaulieu et al 2011 yu et al 2013 however more empirical evidence is required to elucidate the seasonal shifts in the dominant process of n2o production 3 3 implications for the global riverine n budget n2o surges associated with the incomplete treatment of wastewater n at low temperatures raise a possibility of sustained high n2o emissions from urban rivers systems for which advanced wastewater treatments based on biological n removal are supposed to reduce large n loads as observed in other urbanized rivers ibáñez and peñuelas 2019 advanced wastewater treatments have drastically reduced total p tp concentrations in the lower han river fig s2 given the long term declines in tn and tp concentrations in the lower han river the parallel seasonal increases in n2o and tn fig 2 deserve a particular attention despite overall declining trends a rather weak decreasing trend of tn relative to tp has resulted in a significant p 0 05 increase in the n p ratio over the recent years this pattern was stronger during the winter compared with the trends for the annual means fig s2 these results suggest that the water quality control focused on reducing p as a primary cause of phytoplankton blooms has not been equally successful in reducing n fluxes in the lower han river the less steep decline in n concentrations may reflect that the performance of biological n treatments are more subject to temperature variability than p treatments this temperature effect on wastewater n removal has a significant implication for estimating global n2o emissions from anthropogenic sources because anthropogenically enhanced n2o emissions from urbanized river systems represent a primary source of uncertainty in global n2o budgets hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2019 the results also raise a possibility that winter time increases in n2o emissions reported for some agriculturally impacted streams baulch et al 2011 and boreal aquatic networks soued et al 2016 may be common or even stronger in urban rivers across temperate regions in contrast to the previous observations of the positive correlation between temperature and n2o concentrations yu et al 2013 maavara et al 2019 the large seasonal variations in wastewater n fluxes and downstream riverine n2o emissions can amplify the already large uncertainty in the global inland water n2o emission maavara et al 2019 as an example of potential underestimation of n2o emissions from wwtps the national ghg inventory reports of korea have accounted only n2o emissions from human excreta 3 4 gg n2o yr 1 in 2017 moe 2019 neglecting the fact that n2o emissions from wastewater occur primarily as indirect emissions from downstream waterways us epa 2019 even after excluding internal n2o emissions from domestic and industrial wwtps 7 billion m3 yr 1 of effluents from domestic wwtps in korea yoon et al 2017 would discharge additional 0 19 gg n2o into downstream rivers assuming an average n2o concentration of 602 nmol l 1 table s2 considering this unaccounted n2o released from wwtp effluents and downstream rivers would greatly increase the estimate of n2o emissions from the wastewater sector although neglecting the declining emission factor ef with increasing levels of n was suspected to cause an overestimation of the global riverine n2o emission hu et al 2016 the ef calculated as the proportion of the mean n2o in the mean tn concentration increased from 0 12 to 0 33 when both tn and n2o concentrations peaked at m down the concomitant increases in wastewater derived n and ef in the downstream rivers suggest that seasonal changes in water temperature and sediment o2 availability should be considered to better predict riverine n2o emissions using ef based modeling approaches 4 conclusions large seasonal increases in tn and n2o in wwtp effluents and downstream waterways can compromise the declining riverine n fluxes from improved wastewater treatment and therefore pose a new challenge for water quality management while the low temperature effect on biological n removal is well known in the wastewater sector its downstream impacts have rarely been studied in relation to riverine metabolic processes and n2o emissions our field monitoring combined with the comparison of sediment n2o production potentials between summer and winter provides some indirect evidence that incomplete denitrification in the hypoxic sediment at low temperatures may function as a large downstream source adding to n2o derived from wwtp effluents the dual isotope analysis of no3 and n2o complemented with an isotopomer mixing approach supports the proposed seasonal shift in n2o production from nh2oh oxidation at the sediment water interface in the summer to denitrification dominating in both wwtps and sediment during the winter further research is required to obtain process specific evidence for the temperature control on the concurrent n transformation processes for instance by examining temperature responses of n2o production to 15n labelled no2 under controlled o2 availability addressing seasonal increases in n loads from wwtps would require not only technological improvements but also a better understanding of the response of riverine n transformation processes to seasonal variations in wastewater treatment efficiency subject to temperature fluctuations it may be very challenging to control n2o emissions from river sediments that can also occur as a legacy effect of long term n storage in the flow controlled eutrophic river system water quality monitoring programs need to incorporate all major n species including n2o released from wwtp effluents and benthic sediments to assess water quality improvement across the major components of urban river systems we also suggest that ipcc guidelines and national n2o inventories take into account large temporal variations in n2o emissions from wwtp effluents and downstream waterways to provide more accurate estimates of national and global anthropogenic n2o emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17484,although eutrophic urban rivers receiving loads of wastewater represent an important anthropogenic source of n2o little is known as to how temperature and other environmental factors affect temporal variations in n2o emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and downstream rivers two year monitoring at a wwtp and five river sites was complemented with available water quality data laboratory incubations and stable isotopes in n2o and no3 to explore how wastewater effluents interact with seasonal changes in environmental conditions to affect downstream metabolic processes and n2o emissions from the lower han river traversing the megacity seoul water quality data from four wwtps revealed significant inverse relationships between water temperature and the concentrations or fluxes of total n tn in effluents increased tn fluxes at low temperatures concurred with n2o surges in wwtp effluents and downstream rivers counteracting the long term decline in tn fluxes resulting from enhanced wastewater treatments incubation experiments with river water and sediment in isolation or combined implied the hypoxic winter sediment as a large source of n2o whereas the anoxic summer sediment produced a smaller amount of n2o only when it was added with oxic water for both wwtp effluents and downstream rivers bulk isotope ratios and intramolecular distribution of 15n in n2o distinctly differed between summer and winter indicating incomplete denitrification in the hypoxic sediment at low temperatures as a primary downstream source adding to wwtp derived n2o winter surges

studied as important sources of co2 and ch4 to the atmosphere bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 much less research has been undertaken regarding controlling mechanisms for n2o emissions from increasingly n enriched inland waters worldwide a limited understanding of n2o emissions from inland waters may be illustrated by the fifth assessment report of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc where rivers represent a natural source of ch4 but an anthropogenic source of n2o ciais et al 2013 a particularly large uncertainty lies in estimating the global riverine n2o emissions 12 1870 gg n2o n yr 1 table s1 and references therein these estimates account for 0 2 35 of the global anthropogenic n2o emission 5300 gg n2o n yr 1 davidson et al 2014 several studies have argued that the current ipcc approaches substantially underestimate n2o emissions from anthropogenically impacted river systems seitzinger and kroeze 1998 seitzinger et al 2000 beaulieu et al 2011 on the other hand a recent meta analysis hu et al 2016 and a process based model maavara et al 2019 have provided much lower estimates 12 67 gg n2o n yr 1 than the previous estimates table s1 furthermore altered rates of n transformation processes in anthropogenically modified river systems have not yet been incorporated into global n budgets despite a growing recognition of manmade structures such as dams and wwtps as integral components of urbanized river systems kaushal and belt 2012 park et al 2018 in 2015 wastewater accounted for 5 of the global anthropogenic non co2 ghg emissions and n2o emissions from the wastewater sector 126 tg co2eq and also represented 5 of the global anthropogenic n2o emissions u s environmental protection agency 2019 in addition to wastewater treatments effluents from wwtps can also enhance n2o emissions from downstream waterways by affecting n transformation processes in receiving waters toyoda et al 2009 yu et al 2013 u s environmental protection agency 2019 urban rivers have been identified as the largest inland water source of n2o as a result of enhanced nitrification and denitrification in eutrophic waters that receive high n loads from wwtp effluents and fertilizers kroeze et al 2010 seitzinger et al 2000 beaulieu et al 2011 yu et al 2013 however ipcc guidelines for accounting n2o emissions from receiving waters intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2019 have rarely been incorporated into actual national and global inventories that usually focus on n2o emissions from human and animal waste u s environmental protection agency 2019 furthermore little is known about the relative contributions of wwtps and riverine metabolic processes to the coupled production and consumption of n2o in urban river systems over the last decades considerable efforts have been made to elucidate major factors controlling n2o emissions from diverse wastewater treatments processes maavara et al 2019 isotope techniques have been applied increasingly to the study of n2o production pathways specific to wastewater treatment processes toyoda et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2013 duan et al 2017 in particular the intramolecular site preference sp of 15n in the asymmetric structure of n n o has been used successfully in assessing the relative contributions of the primary biological n2o production processes including nh2oh oxidation nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification toyoda et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2013 tumendelger et al 2016 while these previous studies have contributed to unravelling controlling mechanisms for n2o production within wwtps they did not take an integrated approach considering temporal variations in n2o production in both wwtps and downstream rivers to explore how treated wastewater interacts with seasonal variations in environmental conditions to affect riverine metabolic processes and n2o emissions in anthropogenically modified river systems we investigated spatiotemporal patterns of n2o concentrations and fluxes in the lower han river which traverses the seoul metropolitan area population 25 million fig 1 large loadings of nutrients and ghgs that are released from wwtps and urban runoffs may greatly alter riverine metabolic processes as illustrated by recurrent phytoplankton blooms and enhanced ghg emissions in the eutrophic reach yoon et al 2017 jin et al 2018 a two year monitoring of n2o at three mainstem locations two tributaries and a wwtp from july 2017 to june 2019 were complemented by laboratory incubations and stable isotope analysis of n2o and no3 to trace the sources of n2o in the lower han river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling the han river consisting of the north and south branches and the lower han river drains an area of 35 770 km2 across the central korean peninsula fig 1 jin et al 2018 the mean annual precipitation was 1323 mm from 1983 to 2014 with up to 70 of the annual precipitation concentrated from june to september the lower han river traverses the highly urbanized seoul metropolitan area where four large wwtps are operating advanced wastewater treatments including the anaerobic anoxic oxic process a2o and the modified ludzack ettinger process mle effluents from the four wwtps averaged 4 228 000 m3 day 1 in 2018 97 of the total effluent was treated by a tertiary treatment process seoul metropolitan government 2018 a routine water quality monitoring was conducted at five sites in the lower han river basin complemented with additional samplings in two wwtps and two season field campaigns in six tributaries during the routine monitoring from july 2017 to june 2019 surface water concentrations of n2o as well as ancillary water quality parameters were measured at three mainstem sites m up m mid and m down and two tributaries t high and t low on a monthly july 2017 august 2018 or bimonthly august 2018 june 2019 basis fig 1 the three mainstem sites were selected based on spatial coverage spanning the entire section of the lower han river sandwiched by the two submerged weirs that were constructed to increase baseflow in the 1980s the two tributaries represent either a highly polluted tributary loaded with wwtp effluents t high and a low pollution tributary without any wwtp within the subbasin as part of the routine monitoring samples were also collected at a wwtp located near the mouth of the tributary jn on a quarterly basis in addition two samples were collected for n2o isotope analysis at another wwtp located upstream of the site m down the data of water temperature and quality tn and tp concentrations measured in the effluents from the four major wwtps in seoul were obtained from the seoul metropolitan government for the two season campaigns conducted in a monsoon july 2017 and a low flow period april 2018 three tributaries with wwtps t high and three tributaries without wwtps t low were surveyed at a headwater and an outlet location water temperature ph electrical conductivity and do were measured in situ during each sampling using a portable multi meter orion 5 star portable thermo scientific usa air temperature and barometric pressure were measured by a portable sensor watchdog 1650 micro station spectrum technologies usa water samples were collected at 20 cm below the surface 10 20 cm in shallow tributaries during low flow periods using an acid washed amber glass bottle 2 l sampling on the mainstem was conducted either on a jetty 10 20 m away from the river bank sites m up and m down or on the river bank along an island site m mid whereas tributaries were usually sampled near the river bank a manual headspace equilibration method was used to measure n2o concentrations dissolved in surface water jin et al 2018 a 30 ml water sample and a 30 ml ambient air sample were collected in sequence using a 60 ml syringe the syringe was shaken vigorously for 2 min and 20 ml of the equilibrated headspace air was transferred to a pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vial thus creating overpressure to ensure a long term sample storage without noticeable concentration change for several months although we could not take replicate samples at all sites of the routine monitoring and two season campaigns replicate water and gas samples were collected from one of the five routine monitoring sites m up and two of 12 two season campaign sites one t low and one t high sites to evaluate sampling associated errors for all measurement parameters 2 2 laboratory analyses collected water samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory and then filtered through pre combusted 0 7 µm glass fiber filters filtered water samples were analyzed for doc using high temperature 680 c catalytic oxidation

and ultrapure water were analyzed for every batch of 10 samples triplicate analysis was performed for 10 of samples to check up instrumental stability and accuracy the concentrations of n2o in headspace equilibration samples were measured on a gas chromatograph 7890a agilent usa equipped with an electron capture detector µecd and a supelco hayesep q 12 ft 1 8 in column certified standard reference gases in n2 balance were used to calibrate the gc signals and assess instrumental accuracy and consistency more details on water and gas analyses have been reported elsewhere jin et al 2018 selected subsets of gas samples were analyzed for stable n isotopes in n2o by a gasbench precon gas concentration system interfaced to a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermoscientific bremen germany results for stable isotope values are reported in standard notion shown in eq 1 where r is 15 n 14 n 1 δ 15 n r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 10 3 another subset of headspace equilibration were measured for n and o stable isotope ratios δ 15nbulk and δ 18o and the intramolecular sp of 15n in n2o using a gc irms mat252 thermoscientific bremen germany equipped with a modified preconcentration device toyoda et al 2009 definition of δ values were similar to eq 1 and sp δ15nα δ15nβ where nα and nβ denote central and terminal n in the asymmetric structure of nno respectively the reduction of n2o to n2 can result in deviations of isotope ratios and sp values of remaining n2o molecules from the initial linear relationships between sp and isotope ratios ostrom et al 2007 therefore based on a previous suggestion well et al 2012 for using δ18o instead of δ15n an isotopomer mixing approach was employed to account for n2o reduction effect using endmember values obtained from pure culture experiments nh2oh oxidation spnh2oh from 33 to 37 δ18o from 40 to 50 bacterial denitrification including nitrifier denitrification spd from 10 to 0 δ18o from 10 to 20 and the average reduction slope 0 35 deppe et al 2017 the initial isotope values of n2o before reduction were estimated from the point of interception between the average mixing line of the two endmembers and the reduction line passing each sample value from these initial isotope values except for one measured value that was lower than the initial value and therefore used directly assuming negligible reduction the fraction of n2o derived from nh2oh oxidation fnh2oh and the fraction of n2o derived from denitrification including nitrifier denitrification fd were calculated using the following equation f n h 2 o h 1 f d s p s p d s p n h 2 o h s p d isotopic analysis of no3 was conducted using the denitrifying bacterial method sigman et al 2001 hattori et al 2016 coupled with n2o decomposition by microwave induced plasma casciotti et al 2002 briefly the bacterial method involves a strain of denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas aureofaciens which lacks the enzyme n2o reductase involved in the conversion of nitrate into n2o the produced n2o is passed into an online automated system involving purified n2o gas chromatographic techniques and is followed by the decomposition of n2o to o2 and n2 prior to analysis by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany with monitoring ions at m z 32 33 and 34 for oxygen isotope measurements and m z 28 and 29 for n isotope measurements analytical errors calculated from the standard deviation 1σ of the residuals from the linear regression between the raw data of the reference standards usgs 35 34 and 32 and their accepted values were estimated to be 0 2 and 0 6 for δ15n and δ18o respectively the slopes and intercepts of linear regressions were used to convert the measurement values into calibrated values relative to international standards 2 3 incubation experiments samples of river benthic sediments and their overlying water at 10 cm above the riverbed were collected in august 2018 and december 2019 to compare n2o production potentials the same volumes of sediment and water were used in three treatments three replicates per treatment in the first treatment containing only sediment a sediment sample 60 ml or 150 ml was transferred into a glass bottle 120 ml and 300 ml for the winter and summer incubation respectively the bottle was sealed with a gas tight lid and then filled with he in the second treatment an incubation bottle was completely filled with river water the third treatment included both sediment and water a 60 ml winter or 150 ml portion summer of the sediment that had been kept in the storage bottles without contacting air was transferred into an incubation bottle and the bottle was then completely filled with river water to ensure that no headspace remained while minimizing mixing induced disturbance to keep the sediment as intact as possible for the same reason the incubation bottles were not shaken during the incubation following a previous study royer et al 2004 although this setting might create somewhat different condition from the flowing water condition that can enhance sediment water material exchanges the summer august 2018 and winter december 2019 samples were kept for 12 h in the dark in an incubator set at 31 c and 4 c ambient water temperature at site m down on the sampling date respectively samples were incubated for 12 h because a longer incubation time e g 24 h would result in a depletion of o2 in the oxic water samples as observed in a previous study sturm et al 2016 and our own test prior to this experiment anoxic condition can result in an underestimation of the n2o production rate due to accelerated n2o reduction to n2 upon completion of the 12 h incubation headspace air samples from the first treatment were transferred to pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vials for gas analysis n2o gases dissolved in the water of the second and third treatments were collected using manual headspace equilibration with ambient air after measuring do the incubated water samples from the second and third treatments were filtered through membrane filters with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm to measure doc and major ions in the filtrates 2 4 data analysis the air water gas flux f of n2o was calculated according to the equation f k δc where k is the gas transfer velocity and δc is the air water gas concentration gradient lauerwald et al 2015 to estimate k we used a range of k values normalized to a schmidt number sc of 600 k 600 that were estimated for small and large rivers in the temperate zone by lauerwald et al 2015 7 58 10 2 m d 1 for the tributaries and wwtp effluents 3 95 5 32 m d 1 for the han river mainstem the actual gas transfer velocity k actual of a specific month was estimated from k 600 and the measured water temperature the monthly mean areal fluxes of n2o mmol m 2 d 1 were calculated from the estimated k actual and measured δc values and then averaged to produce the annual mean k value for the calculation of the annual mean areal flux of n2o most routine monitoring data were not normally distributed hence the non parametric spearman s rank correlation was performed to examine the relationships among the measured water quality and hydroclimatic variables spatiotemporal variations in the concentrations and fluxes of all n species were analyzed by the non parametric kruskal wallis analysis of variance followed by dunn s multiple comparisons all statistical analyses were conducted with spss version 20 spss inc chicago usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variations in n concentrations and fluxes the two year monitoring revealed large longitudinal and seasonal variations in the concentrations and fluxes of n2o along the lower han river fig 2 table s2 both concentrations and fluxes of n2o increased downstream along the mainstem lower han river table s2 while n2o was highly supersaturated with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium across the mainstem and tributary sites exceptionally high n2o concentrations measured at m down and t high may exceed the uppermost ranges of n2o reported for other rivers piña ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 toyoda et al 2009 beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 mean areal emission rates of n2o μmol m 2 d 1 at m down 2 206 and t high 4 558 fell in the upper range of 169 reported observations 43 to 12 754 median 29 compiled by a global synthesis hu et al 2016 the concentrations of n2o at a wwtp discharge and its downstream tributary location t high displayed similar seasonal variations with the highest concentrations during the winter fig 2 across the han river mainstem n2o concentrations were relatively low during the monsoon and other high flow periods when increased flows from the upstream dam and other tributaries may have caused a dilution effect on the concentrations of n2o and other water quality components however the peak n2o concentrations measured at m down from february through may 2018 exceeded those of wwtp effluents and t high fig 2 compared with these exceptionally high concentrations at m down n2o concentrations were relatively low during the corresponding period in 2019 the large concurrent seasonal increases in n2o concentrations at wwtp effluents t high and m down fig 2b generally coincided with increases in tn concentrations in wwtp effluents and m down fig 2c the winter increases in tn loads in wwtp effluents can be attributed to lowered efficiencies of biological n removal at wwtps during cold winter months as indicated by the significant negative relationships between water temperature and tn concentrations in effluents from the four wwtps in seoul from june 2016 to december 2018 fig 3 winter daily tn exports from two wwtps had significant negative relationships with water temperature although tp exports exhibited no significant relationship fig 3 activities of some enzymes involved in various denitrification processes are known to decelerate at low temperatures and result in accumulation of no2 thereby facilitating n2o production via nitrifier denitrification and elevating tn in wwtp effluents duan et al 2017 massara et al 2017 while the parallel temporal variations in tn concentrations in wwtp effluents and m down fig 2c illustrate a predominant influence of wastewater effluents on the downstream n fluxes including n2o emissions the higher concentrations of n2o at m down than at t high in 2018 imply a complex interplay of various processes involving the concentration effect of low flows additional inputs from other downstream sources and n2o production in river water or benthic sediment the negative correlations between river flow and n2o concentrations were not significant at all the sites except for t high table s3 this together with the fact that among the three mainstem sites large concentration increases during low flow periods occurred only at m down fig 2 indicates a minor concentration effect of reduced flows during the relatively dry period from winter to spring the contribution from other tributaries was not likely to be substantial because n2o concentrations were highest at t high among the major tributaries sampled during the two season field campaigns data not shown therefore the production of n2o either in river water or benthic sediment must have added a significant portion to the wastewater derived gases during the n2o surge in 2018 although correlations don t provide any direct causal evidence the significant correlations between n2o and other measurements at m down including positive correlations with nh4 n p 0 001 electrical conductivity p 0 001 and dissolved oxygen do p 0 04 and the negative correlation with water temperature p 0 02 table s3 fig s1 offered some clues into the crucial drivers for the 2018 surge as well as the overall seasonal variations in n2o concentrations first the significant positive correlation between n2o and nh4 n or do at m down implicates nitrification as a potential riverine source of n2o as observed in other n rich rivers cébron et al 2005 yu et al 2013 the nitrification of nh4 released from wwtps was suggested as a dominant source of n2o emissions from eutrophic rivers in shanghai yu et al 2013 however we cannot rule out the possibility of haphazard correlations among these factors given the common influence of wwtp effluents on nh4 n do and n2o second all measured n species showed significant p 0 05 negative correlations with water temperature across the mainstem sites except for tn at m up and no3 at m down fig s1 reflecting concomitant concentration increases in all measured n species at low water temperatures fig 2 while low temperatures appear to play a key role in determining the winter time increases and hence overall seasonal patterns of n2o concentrations in both wwtp effluents and downstream waterways multiple interacting factors might have been involved in the 2018 n2o surge at m down the mean water temperature at m down on the sampling dates from december 2017 to february 2018 was 1 6 c which was lower than that of the second winter sampling period 4 7 c indicating the role of low temperature in february 2018 for the enhanced riverine n2o production however the sustained high n2o concentrations in the following months until may 2018 suggest that other factors also need to be taken into consideration to elucidate the controlling mechanism for the n2o surge 3 2 effects of wastewater and temperature on downstream n transformations the incubation experiments with water and sediment samples collected at m down in august 2018 and december 2019 showed a stark contrast in the patterns of n2o production and consumption between summer and winter fig 4 during the summer incubation n2o concentrations increased only in the water overlying the sediment s w by 1 132 nmol l 1 for the winter samples however a much larger net increase in n2o concentrations 10 546 nmol l 1 was found in the sediment only treatment s compared with a very small increase 56 nmol l 1 in the water only treatment w and a negligible change in the s w samples in the s w samples of both summer and winter incubations decreases in do and no3 n concentrations concurred with increases in nh4 n concentrations fig 4 it was noteworthy that a larger fall of do from 200 to 34 μmol l 1 occurred in the summer compared with a rather moderate wintertime decrease from 355 to 254 μmol l 1 the n2o production coupled with no3 consumption in the summer s w samples together with the near zero level of do 0 5 μmol l 1 measured in the sediment prior to the incubation implicates that the addition of the oxic water rich in no3 may have hindered the complete denitrification from no3 to n2 that might have been occurring in the originally anoxic sediment leading to a small production of n2o as an intermediate of incomplete denitrification cébron et al 2005 piña ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 high no3 loads in the overlying water have been suggested to trigger n2o production through incomplete denitrification at the sediment water interface piña ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 the experimental set up allowing suspended sediment settling combined with near zero production of n2o in the water only treatment fig 4 precludes such significant levels of n2o production from suspended sediment as have been observed in previous studies e g xia et al 2016 the relatively high do level 254 μmol l 1 measured in the winter s w samples after the 12 hr incubation indicates a narrow range of do that would be suitable for n2o production at the sediment water interface considering the fact that do levels can drastically drop across the interface between the oxic water and the anoxic sediment ditoro 2001 the addition of the oxic water may have caused a large increase in do away from the narrow hypoxic range of do that was suitable for n2o production via denitrification in the sediment the do level in the winter sediment 2 8 μmol l 1 was low but slightly higher than the near zero level found in the summer sediment this non zero do level linked to the exceptionally large n2o increase in the winter sediment samples fig 4e implies that the sediment samples might not have been completely anoxic before water addition with do levels falling in the narrow do range suitable for n2o production n2o production during denitrification has been attributed to a low but non zero o2 availability as n2o reduction to n2 is more complete under anoxic conditions rosamond et al 2012 the final do levels in the s w samples were much higher than the low do values measured in the hypoxic sediment creating an unfavorable condition for n2o production in the sediment fig 4 under actual field conditions however larger amounts of n2o could have been produced in the entire sediment layer deeper than 50 cm overriding the dampening effect of the oxic water on n2o production at the sediment water interface given the winter incubation results emphasizing the hypoxic sediment as the single most important riverine source of n2o fig 4d along with the observed relationships between n2o and the multiple factors including water temperature and do in the han river it is reasonable to assume that n2o effluxes from the entire sediment layer made a significant contribution to the n2o surge observed at m down in 2018 fig 2b although the two incubation experiments cannot fully cover large variations in do in the field the results emphasize the hypoxic sediment winter or the sediment water interface summer as a seasonal hotspot of n2o production in the lower han river it demands further research to find out whether the optimal hypoxic range for n2o production in the benthic sediment can last for several months from december to may as observed during the 2018 surge event offering a stimulating condition for enhanced n2o production initially triggered by increased wastewater derived n fluxes at low temperatures the very low levels of do linked to the net n2o increases in the s winter and s w summer samples fig 4 combined with the positive correlations between surface water concentrations of n2o and do or nh4 n at site m down table s3 point to nitrification as an alternative source of n2o given that almost no n2o production occurred in the summer water only treatment fig 5 a n2o production via nitrification might have occurred at the sediment water interface n2o production in n enriched urban rivers has been ascribed to nh2oh oxidation and nitrifier denitrification under hypoxic conditions do 1 1 to 1 5 mg l 1 cébron et al 2005 toyoda et al 2009 yu et al 2013 high nh4 and low no2 concentrations were found to stimulate the rate of n2o production via nh2oh oxidation wunderlin et al 2012 the drastic decrease in do to 34 μmol l 1 1 1 mg l 1 in the summer s w samples fig 4c suggests that not only nh2oh oxidation but also nitrifier denitrification might have provided an additional source of n2o at least during the later phase of the incubation when increased oxygen stress would favor nitrifier denitrification cébron et al 2005 zhu et al 2013 the nh4 production coupled with no3 consumption in the s w samples of both summer and winter incubations fig 4b d also raises the possibility of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra occurring under increasingly anoxic conditions fig 4c f no3 from overlying water can supply a source for dnra in the hypoxic to anoxic sediment xia et al 2018 higher rates of dnra as well as denitrification during the summer than in the winter have been reported for the benthic sediments from the highly polluted urban river network in shanghai cheng et al 2016 dnra may be coupled with other n transformation processes to release n2o from the sediment water interface under oxygen stress the dual isotope analysis of no3 allowed for assessing the relative contributions of the headwater streams and the outlets of the six tributaries and wwtp effluents as the primary source of no3 in the lower han river fig 5a the isotope signals found at the tributary outlets and mainstem sites were similar to those of wwtp effluents illustrating the importance of urban wastewater as a predominant source of no3 this result is consistent with a previous finding for the entire han river basin lee et al 2008 overlapping δ15n no3 values among the mainstem sites tributary outlets and wwtp effluents fig 5a fell in the ranges that are indicative of manure and sewage whereas δ15n no3 values for the headwater streams indicate a predominant contribution of soil derived no3 kendall et al 2007 compared with no3 n2o exhibited distinctively lower δ15n and higher δ18o values fig 5a as observed in other urban rivers toyoda et al 2009 thuan et al 2018 despite the wide scatters in both δ15n and δ18o among the mainstem sites and wwtp effluents there were noticeable seasonal differences in isotope values between winter and summer fig 5a comparing the isotope values of the wwtp effluent samples with the values reported for different wastewater treatment processes toyoda et al 2011 townsend small et al 2011 tumendelger et al 2016 suggests that both nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification may be involved in n2o production in the studied wwtp n2o isotopomers from individual wastewater treatment processes have shown that heterotrophic denitrification prevails under anoxic conditions while both nh2oh oxidation and nitrifier denitrification no2 reduction may be involved in the production of n2o under low oxygen conditions toyoda et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2012 tumendelger et al 2016 n2o molecules generated by nitrifier denitrification tend to be more depleted in 15n and 18o than those from heterotrophic denitrification townsend small et al 2011 the relatively low values of δ15n and δ18o measured at all sites except m up in february and december fig 5a imply that n2o gases in wwtp effluents and downstream rivers might have been produced from nitrifier denitrification during the winter whereas denitrification and or nh2oh oxidation prevailed during the warmer months baulch et al 2012 also observed generally higher δ15n and δ18o values in summer and attributed the finding to an isotope effect associated with enhanced n2o reduction at higher temperatures that would result in isotopic enrichment of the remaining n2o molecules however the values of δ15n and δ18o alone are limited in evaluating the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification given the complex array of concomitant abiotic and biotic processes involved in the production and consumption of n2o duan et al 2017 the original values of δ18o measured at m down and wwtp effluents during the summer exhibited particularly large deviations from the mixing line between two endmembers namely nh2oh oxidation and bacterial denitrification indicating an enhanced n2o reduction at high summer temperatures fig 5b the isotopomer mixing approach deppe et al 2017 employed to compensate the effect of n2o reduction allowed for a source partitioning between the two endmembers fig 5c the fraction of n2o produced by nh2oh oxidation fnh2oh was highest in the surface water and the overlying water added to the benthic sediment collected at m down during the summer 0 77 0 90 in contrast high fractions of n2o produced by denitrification fd at m down and wwtp effluents during the colder seasons ranged from 0 71 m down to 0 88 wwtp effluents comparing the corrected sp values fig 5c with those measured for pure cultures of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria sutka et al 2006 yamazaki et al 2014 indicates nitrification in summer and denitrification in winter as the dominant source of n2o at m down although 15n fractionations observed during the pure culture incubation may differ from those occurring in complex microbial communities that are commonly found in wwtps and rivers duan et al 2017 unlike the distinct separation between the summer and winter values of bulk isotope ratios and sp in wwtp effluents the corrected values of δ18o and sp were more congregated resulting in a relatively narrow range of fd from 0 67 july 2018 to 0 88 february 2019 this result suggests that denitrification may be a dominant process of n2o production in wwtps throughout the year consistent with previous findings toyoda et al 2009 the higher value of fd observed in wwtps during the winter may have resulted from an enhanced n2o production via nitrifier denitrification because nitrifier denitrification can benefit from accumulating no2 in response to incomplete heterotrophic denitrification under unfavorable hypoxic conditions or low temperature wunderlin et al 2012 massara et al 2017 however the overlapping signatures of sp don t allow a clear separation of nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as the primary source of n2o sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2012 therefore it remains an unresolved question how temperature and other factors combine to control the competitive balance between heterotrophic and nitrifier denitrification in wwtps and downstream waterways given the higher corrected sp values estimated for the downstream tributaries and mainstem sites relative to the corresponding values in the wwtp effluents fig 5c the relative importance of nh2oh oxidation seems to increase along the river downstream especially during the summer seasonal variations in isotopic signatures fig 5 combined with the changes in do observed during the incubation experiments fig 4 suggest that hypoxic conditions created in the benthic sediment winter or across the sediment water interface summer may enhance n2o production via nitrifier denitrification or nh2oh oxidation respectively nitrification has been suggested to amount to or even exceed the capacity of heterotrophic denitrification as a source of n2o emissions from eutrophic rivers cébron et al 2005 beaulieu et al 2011 yu et al 2013 however more empirical evidence is required to elucidate the seasonal shifts in the dominant process of n2o production 3 3 implications for the global riverine n budget n2o surges associated with the incomplete treatment of wastewater n at low temperatures raise a possibility of sustained high n2o emissions from urban rivers systems for which advanced wastewater treatments based on biological n removal are supposed to reduce large n loads as observed in other urbanized rivers ibáñez and peñuelas 2019 advanced wastewater treatments have drastically reduced total p tp concentrations in the lower han river fig s2 given the long term declines in tn and tp concentrations in the lower han river the parallel seasonal increases in n2o and tn fig 2 deserve a particular attention despite overall declining trends a rather weak decreasing trend of tn relative to tp has resulted in a significant p 0 05 increase in the n p ratio over the recent years this pattern was stronger during the winter compared with the trends for the annual means fig s2 these results suggest that the water quality control focused on reducing p as a primary cause of phytoplankton blooms has not been equally successful in reducing n fluxes in the lower han river the less steep decline in n concentrations may reflect that the performance of biological n treatments are more subject to temperature variability than p treatments this temperature effect on wastewater n removal has a significant implication for estimating global n2o emissions from anthropogenic sources because anthropogenically enhanced n2o emissions from urbanized river systems represent a primary source of uncertainty in global n2o budgets hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2019 the results also raise a possibility that winter time increases in n2o emissions reported for some agriculturally impacted streams baulch et al 2011 and boreal aquatic networks soued et al 2016 may be common or even stronger in urban rivers across temperate regions in contrast to the previous observations of the positive correlation between temperature and n2o concentrations yu et al 2013 maavara et al 2019 the large seasonal variations in wastewater n fluxes and downstream riverine n2o emissions can amplify the already large uncertainty in the global inland water n2o emission maavara et al 2019 as an example of potential underestimation of n2o emissions from wwtps the national ghg inventory reports of korea have accounted only n2o emissions from human excreta 3 4 gg n2o yr 1 in 2017 moe 2019 neglecting the fact that n2o emissions from wastewater occur primarily as indirect emissions from downstream waterways us epa 2019 even after excluding internal n2o emissions from domestic and industrial wwtps 7 billion m3 yr 1 of effluents from domestic wwtps in korea yoon et al 2017 would discharge additional 0 19 gg n2o into downstream rivers assuming an average n2o concentration of 602 nmol l 1 table s2 considering this unaccounted n2o released from wwtp effluents and downstream rivers would greatly increase the estimate of n2o emissions from the wastewater sector although neglecting the declining emission factor ef with increasing levels of n was suspected to cause an overestimation of the global riverine n2o emission hu et al 2016 the ef calculated as the proportion of the mean n2o in the mean tn concentration increased from 0 12 to 0 33 when both tn and n2o concentrations peaked at m down the concomitant increases in wastewater derived n and ef in the downstream rivers suggest that seasonal changes in water temperature and sediment o2 availability should be considered to better predict riverine n2o emissions using ef based modeling approaches 4 conclusions large seasonal increases in tn and n2o in wwtp effluents and downstream waterways can compromise the declining riverine n fluxes from improved wastewater treatment and therefore pose a new challenge for water quality management while the low temperature effect on biological n removal is well known in the wastewater sector its downstream impacts have rarely been studied in relation to riverine metabolic processes and n2o emissions our field monitoring combined with the comparison of sediment n2o production potentials between summer and winter provides some indirect evidence that incomplete denitrification in the hypoxic sediment at low temperatures may function as a large downstream source adding to n2o derived from wwtp effluents the dual isotope analysis of no3 and n2o complemented with an isotopomer mixing approach supports the proposed seasonal shift in n2o production from nh2oh oxidation at the sediment water interface in the summer to denitrification dominating in both wwtps and sediment during the winter further research is required to obtain process specific evidence for the temperature control on the concurrent n transformation processes for instance by examining temperature responses of n2o production to 15n labelled no2 under controlled o2 availability addressing seasonal increases in n loads from wwtps would require not only technological improvements but also a better understanding of the response of riverine n transformation processes to seasonal variations in wastewater treatment efficiency subject to temperature fluctuations it may be very challenging to control n2o emissions from river sediments that can also occur as a legacy effect of long term n storage in the flow controlled eutrophic river system water quality monitoring programs need to incorporate all major n species including n2o released from wwtp effluents and benthic sediments to assess water quality improvement across the major components of urban river systems we also suggest that ipcc guidelines and national n2o inventories take into account large temporal variations in n2o emissions from wwtp effluents and downstream waterways to provide more accurate estimates of national and global anthropogenic n2o emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
