regression four important parameters namely volume of the solvent ph temperature and contact time were optimized using central composite design ccd up to 98 of solvent was recovered by simple distillation for further use the precipitated salts were characterized by fesem xrd and ftir analysis keywords steel industry nf rejected water precipitation chloride sulphate 1 introduction steel industries are one among the major industries which contribute to the world s economic growth 1 however waste generation within the industry is enormous due to its high production rates large quantity of water is used in the steel industry for different processes like cooling operations dust scrubbing and descaling integrated steel plant utilizes water in an average of 28 6 m3 tonne of steel produced and water discharge with an average of 25 3 m3 tonne of steel most of the steel industry releases about 90 of water which needs to be treated and then reused or discharged into the environment 2 iron and steel plants generate wastewater from different processes like mining smelting of pig iron in a blast furnace ld convertors and rolling mills the wastewater generated from all the processes is basic and contain high concentrations of chlorides calcium bicarbonate fluoride sulphates cyanide total suspended solids volatile suspended solid total dissolved solids cyanide thiocyanates phenol traces iron and magnesium oxide 3 6 usually steel industries follow chemical coagulation and biological method for the treatment of coke oven process wastewater tata steel jamshedpur india uses biochemical oxidation bo for the treatment of wastewater coming from coke oven by product 6 this is very effective for the removal of cyanide and phenol the treated water after bo process contains high chlorides sulphates fluorides and other ions which make it difficult to discharge to the environment utilization of sea water for coke quenching is the main source of such ions hence the said industry uses bo followed by nanofiltration nf for the treatment of coke oven wastewater nanofiltration is advantageous over other process due to the fact that it can be operated at lower transmembrane pressure tmp 10 20 at m than ro and effectively remove monovalent and divalent ions 7 9 use of nf could effectively reduce the concentration of ions present in the wastewater 10 however the rejected stream of this technology is more concentrated with chlorides sulphates sodium calcium magnesium and potassium ions moreover the nf rejected stream is as high as 20 30 of feed this rejected stream cannot be reused or discharged to the environment as it can affect the activities of the environs especially chlorides 600 mg l and sulphates 400 mg l cause adverse effects on living beings such as diarrheal symptoms dehydration hypertension on the other hand scaling blockage of pipes corrosion demineralization are some of the adverse effects in the industry 5 thus it is extremely important to make a move to treat the nf rejected stream before reusing or discarding it to the environment the general method of managing nanofiltration reverse osmosis rejected stream is deep well injection evaporation ponds sewer discharge and ocean outfall 11 however due to the environmental policies and strict discharge standards these methods have become insupportable hence

industry in terms of handling nanofiltration rejected water containing high chlorides and sulphate ions to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported on use of solvent based technology for the treatment of nf rejected effluent of steel industry 2 experimental 2 1 materials the nf rejected water was collected from nf plant of tata steel ltd located at haldia west bengal india the

proportion were well mixed in a ceramic vessel using agitator the solvent to rejected water ratio vr of 0 2 66 was considered which is calculated using eq 1 for instance volume of nf rejected water and solvent was considered in the range of 0 9 litres to 1 25 litres the solution was mixed at 100 rpm for 1 h at room temperature 25 c after 30 min blending was ceased for another 30 min to complete precipitation of salts the solution was filtered through nylon filter pore size 0 2 μm diameter 47 mm using vacuum filtration set up to separate the salts from the solution a vacuum pump of capacity 50 hz and flow rate of 15 l min was used the filtrate which was a mixture of organic solvent and water was sent to distillation unit 1 l capacity to recuperate the solvent the mixture of water and solvent was heated up to the boilling point of three solvents separately the distillate organic solvent was collected in a storing chamber for further use properties of the organic solvents like diisopropylamine isopropylamine and ethylamine is shown in table 1 a detailed layout of experimental scheme is shown in fig 1 the efficiency of separation of both ions was measured in terms of percentage precipitation factor and calculated using eq 2 1 v r v o l u m e o f s o l v e n t v o l u m e o f s a m p l e 2 p 1 c f c i 100 where p is percentage precipitation factor cf is final anion concentration in the filtered sample and ci is initial anion concentration in the nf rejected water 2 4 experimental design response surface methodology rsm is a collection of statistical and mathematical methods which assess the effect of different factors and their actions on the system response one of the main advantages of rsm is to develop and optimize the variables which results in less number of experimental runs rsm is mainly focused on design of experiments response surface modelling and optimization 20 21 central composite design ccd by design expert version 11 0 was utilized with four different independent factors namely volume ratio vr ratio of volume of solvent to volume of the nf rejected water x1 ph x2 temperature x3 and contact time x4 with two dependent responses like percentage precipitation factor p of chloride and sulphate the volume ratio vr ranged from 0 33 to 2 67 ph of the sample varied from 2 to 10 temperature from 10 to 32 c and that of contact time ranged from 10 to 30 min table 2 shows the parameters and the range dealt by rsm eq 3 was used to show the interaction between the independent variable and dependent responses 3 γ b 0 i 1 k b 1 x 1 i 1 k b i i x i 2 i 1 k 1 j 1 k b i j x i x j c where b0 is the value of the intercept bi bii bij are the regression coefficients for linear second order and interactive effects respectively xi xj refers to independent variables and c represents the error of prediction the analysis of variance gives the information related to lack of fit p value f value and r2 representing the efficiency of the model prob f less than 0 05 refers that the model terms are significant lack of fit more than 0 05 implies the validity of the model the probability less than 0 05 implies the accuracy of the model 3 results and discussion this section is divided into five parts in the first part water quality parameters of the nf rejected water of tata steel ltd india was determined and reported variation of precipitation factor p of chlorides and sulphates with vr using three solvents were studied and discussed in second part the separation of chlorides and sulphates were done in terms of percentage precipitation factor which is calculated using eq 1 third and fourth part deals with the response surface methodology rsm to optimize the parameters for the removal of chloride and sulphate ions characterization of the precipitated salt is discussed in fifth part 3 1 characteristics of nf rejected water blast furnace wastewater contains high chlorides and sulfate ions along with other salts consequently reusing without treatment makes the framework pipelines eroded along these lines tata steel ltd india uses nanofiltration nf as tertiary treatment method for the blast furnace wastewater however the nf unit contributes to highly concentrated chlorides and sulfates along with different salts much higher than the permissible limit this makes the rejected water unfit to either reuse or discharge to the streams the characteristics of obtained nf rejected water was analysed and shown in table 3 it is seen from the table that all the water quality parameters are well above the permissible limits especially chlorides and sulphates in the range of 1600 mg l and 4200 mg l respectively the total dissolved solids have very high value in the range of 8613 mg l which is highly above the permissible limit 2000 mg l similarly sodium potassium calcium and iron are also above the permissible limit the results after the treatment technique undertaken in this work is also shown in the table and discussed in subsequent sections 3 2 precipitation of chlorides and sulphates by organic solvents three organic solvents such as diisopropylamine dipa isopropylamine ipa and ethylamine ea were selected to separate chlorides and sulphates from nf rejected water mentioned in the preceding section the properties of nanofiltration nf rejected water stream is shown in table 3 chloride and sulphate ion concentrations are well above the allowable limit of 600 mg l and 400 mg l respectively 5 three solvents ipa dipa and ea were blended independently with nf rejected water the solvent to rejected water volumetric proportion is named as vr experiments were done in room temperature with a blending and settling time of 10 and 30 min respectively the variation of precipitation factor with vr is shown in fig 2 a and b for chloride and sulphate respectively for three solvents considered here from fig 2 a it is seen that chloride precipitation factor increases sharply upto vr value of 1 25 and gradual thereafter from the figure it may be seen that beyond the vr value of 3 the increase on precipitation factor will be marginal again precipitation is more for diipa that of ea is less for each value of vr for example chloride precipitation is 80 46 69 54 and 67 65 for diipa ipa and ea respectively for solvent to volume ratio vr of 2 67 fig 2a similar observation is also found for sulphate precipitation shown in fig 2 b however the sharp increase is observed upto vr of 1 0 instead that of chloride at vr 1 25 and becomes gradual afterward from both fig 2 a and b it is seen that diipa shows highest precipitation factor 80 and 100 for chloride and sulphate respectively followed by ipa and ea the difference in extent salt precipitation capacity was due to the variation of hydrogen bonding capabilities of these three solvents soluble salts are salted out precipitated when water molecules are easily h bonded with the amine based solvents and unavailable for salts for solvation diipa has higher h bonding capacity than that of for ipa and ea thereon therefore extent of chloride and sulphate precipitation is observed in the order of diipa ipa ea depending on h bonding capabilities 22 considering the operation point of view and boiling point table 1 ipa is the best choice 23 hence ipa was chosen for the investigation of various factors influencing the precipitation and discussed in the subsequent sections 3 3 ccd designed model and analysis of variance chloride and sulphate precipitation factor model is given by eqs 4 and 5 respectively the experiments were carried with the volume ratio vr a range from 0 33 2 67 ph range b from 2 10 temperature c from 10 32 oc and contact time d range from 10 30 min a positive value of coefficient indicates a synergistic effect and a negative value symbolizes an opposite effect 21 4 chloride precipitation factor p 76 68 3 04 a 0 91 b 3 82 c 1 69 d 1 44 a b 4 48 a c 0 79 a d 0 75 b c 1 86 b d 4

b c and d are the coded values of variables namely volume ratio vr ph temperature c and time min respectively total of 30 experiments with 6 central points have been applied to study the effects of main four independent parameters viz volume of the solvent ph temperature and contact time on chloride and sulphate precipitation the responses were analysed and the results of anova for precipitation of chlorides and sulphates are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the low probability with f value of 172 8 depicts that the model is accurate lack of fit 0 08 more than 0 05 shows that the model is valid a high r2 value of 0 99 with adjusted r2 of 0 98 represents that the model is significant for the chloride precipitation similarly f value about 18 with low probability implies that the model is accurate lack of fit 0 82 which is more than 0 05 illustrates that the model is valid r2 value of 0 98 represents the sulphate precipitation model is substantial 3 4 response surface methodology and 3d plotting effect of the dependent variables on the percent precipitation factor in 3d graph is shown in figs 3 and 4 for chloride and sulphate respectively the interaction between vr ph vr temperature vr contact time ph temperature ph contact time and temperature contact time may be seen from these 2 figures this also depicts the maximum 77 50 cl and 99 82 so4 2 and minimum 49 48 cl and 94 21 so4 2 precipitation factor obtained with above mentioned interactions figs 3 and 4 represents the higher value points towards the lower value points of the response for chloride and sulphate precipitation factor respectively fig 3 a shows that the chloride precipitation factor increased with the increase in vr and ph while from fig 3b it is seen that the chloride precipitation was maximum 63 05 at the middle value of the design space it can be clearly seen from fig 3 c and e that the contact time does not have much of an impact on chloride precipitation factor with increasing vr and ph whereas the temperature and dosage showed prominent impact on chloride precipitation factor it may be concluded that 15 min is the optimum mixing time for precipitating the chloride and sulphate salts in presence of ipa at increasing vr similarly from fig 4 a it is seen that sulphate precipitation factor increases from 97 to 99 with increasing vr fig 4 b shows the effect of temperature and vr on sulphate precipitation factor this plot shows that sulphate precipitation factor is maximum 98 5 at higher vr 2 08 and low temperature 15 50 c from fig 4d it is seen that there is no much impact on sulphate precipitation factor with increasing temperature and ph therefore the percentage chloride and sulphate precipitation factor is better at the midpoints of the limit as seen in figs 3 and 4 respectively 3 5 interaction studies using factors tool interaction study gives a clear picture of changes in precipitation factor with respect to the four parameters considered herein interaction study between ph and vr was carried with two ph 4 and 8 with varying vr and keeping temperature and contact time at 21 c and 20 min respectively from fig 5 two things can be inferred firstly when the ph of the sample was maintained at 4 the chloride precipitation is higher 80 at lower vr 0 92 however as vr was increased chloride precipitation factor gradually decreased to 72 on the other hand at ph 8 chloride precipitation factor was 74 5 and was steady till vr 1 50 and decreased thereafter secondly at ph 4 there is a drastic decrease in chloride precipitation factor but at ph 8 there is no much decrease in precipitation factor with varying vr this fact would indicate that the chloride ion removal is better when the sample ph is kept in its original 8 1 as shown in table 3 in fig 5b it is seen that chloride precipitation factor is decreasing gradually from 82 2 to 65 at 15 c whereas at 26 5 c chloride precipitation factor increased from 64 to 68 as vr is increased this fact is advantageous as the temperature is near about room temperature and precipitation is higher at this temperature hence there is no need of extra energy which directly favours in terms of cost efficiency likewise in fig 5c it is seen that chloride precipitation factor shows a decreasing trend with respect to increasing vr when contact time is at 14 5 min and 25 2 min in case of interaction study of parameters of sulphate precipitation factor the trend is exactly opposite to the chloride precipitation factor which is seen in fig 6 in fig 6a it is seen that sulphate precipitation factor increases from 97 15 to 99 25 and 97 9 to 98 5 with increase in vr for both ph 4 and 8 respectively in fig 6b it is seen that at 15 c and 26 c sulphate precipitation factor increases sequentially with increasing vr however sulphate precipitation factor is highest 99 55 when temperature is maintained at 15 c this indicates that sulphate ions are less soluble than chloride at lower temperature it may be seen from fig 6 c that at 14 5 min of contact time sulphate precipitation factor remain almost constant at 99 25 with increase in vr at 25 2 min sulphate precipitation factor increases drastically from 97 3 to 99 7 as vr is increased from 0 92 to 2 09 therefore it may be concluded that contact time beyond 14 5 min imparts better sulphate precipitation factor there are limited works focusing on the separation of chloride and sulphate ions from wastewater especially from nf rejected saline water a comparative study of literatures with the present study is shown in table 6 17 24 27 from the table it is envisaged that the use of miscible organic solvents are scant for the separation of chloride and sulphate ions from the industrial effluents in this context the present study is advocated to investigate performance of ipa diipa and ea for the separation of chloride and sulphate ions from nf rejected saline water which highlights the uniqueness of this work 3 6 process optimization by desirability function a desirable value for every input and all the responses were chosen by using numerical optimization to set an output value for the given conditions the range of the inputs and target of the responses were considered 28 29 the goals for all the inputs were selected in range and maximum for the responses the maximum attained percentage chloride and sulphate precipitation factor was obtained at 77 50 and 99 82 respectively at vr of 1 02 ph of 8 temperature at 23 39 c and contact time of 26 min validation was confirmed by carrying out the experiments at the optimized conditions given by the software the confirmatory experiments depicted percentage chloride and sulphate precipitation factor of 74 50 and 97 6 respectively this suggests that the model is accurate and valid 3 7 recovery of the solvent the organic solvents used for the precipitation should have favourable physical properties when recovery is considered as discussed in table 1 the boiling point of ipa is very low which favours in recovering the solvent from the solution 96 98 of isopropylamine ipa was recovered using simple distillation however 2 4 loss was seen due to evaporation during the operation this loss may be avoided by state of art distillation facilities traces of ipa in the filtered sample was eliminated by simple aeration 3 8 characterization of precipitated salt 3 8 1 field emission scanning electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem was performed to analyse the surface morphological features of the obtained precipitated salt as shown in figs 7 a and 7b it is seen from fig 7 b higher magnification that the salts are aggregated by nature this is due to the presence of mixture of inorganic salts the quantitative analysis of the salt sample by measuring the elemental composition for every species in the sample was performed using edx fig 7 c depicts that the precipitated salt contains cations like magnesium calcium sodium iron potassium which possibly combine with chloride and sulphates to form their respective salts the presence of chlorine and sulphur makes it evident for the presence of chloride and sulphates 3 8 2 x ray diffraction x ray diffraction xrd analysis of precipitated salt was performed and is shown in fig 8 the 2θ value at 31 and 45 predominantly show the presence of sodium chloride 30 similarly 30 and 43 4 depicted the presence of magnesium chloride and calcium sulphate respectively 31 32 thus the results confirm that the chloride and sulphate is been salted out with the available cations present in the solution 3 8 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of precipitated salt was carried out between 500 and 4000 cm 1 the spectra obtained is shown in fig 9 precipitated salt showed inorganic sulphates like calcium sulphate sodium sulphate and potassium sulphate in the range of 1000 to 1110 cm 1 in addition peaks around 3694 cm 1 and 3377 cm 1 showed nh stretching this might be due to the presence of trace amount of ipa within the precipitated salt it is to be noted here that inorganic chlorides will not produce any vibrations as their lattice vibrations are beyond ir range 33 4 conclusion separation of chlorides and sulphates from nf rejected wastewater of steel industry was successfully achieved by using organic solvents namely diipa ipa and ea the chloride and sulphate salts were precipitated in the presence of miscible organic solvents based on solventing out phenomenon water quality parameters like tds was reduced from 8613 mg l to 785 mg l and that of chlorides and sulphates from 1594 mg l to 358 mg l and 4196 mg l to 8 4 mg l respectively the optimum condition obtained for chloride and sulphate precipitation was at vr 1 02 ph 8 temperature 23 4 c and contact time 26 min 96 98 of organic solvent ipa was recovered which is recycled back to the system for further use however higher recovery efficiency can be achieved by introducing a closed system of entire precipitation scheme based on the results obtained in this work a pilot plant study is strongly recommended to treat the nf rejected stream and to investigate its feasibility in industrial scale the steel industry having integrated plant of nf units used for the treatment of blast furnace wastewater is encouraged to investigate further the said technology for implementation in industrial scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgment this work is supported by a grant from tata steel

utilized with four different independent factors namely volume ratio vr ratio of volume of solvent to volume of the nf rejected water x1 ph x2 temperature x3 and contact time x4 with two dependent responses like percentage precipitation factor p of chloride and sulphate the volume ratio vr ranged from 0 33 to 2 67 ph of the sample varied from 2 to 10 temperature from 10 to 32 c and that of contact time ranged from 10 to 30 min table 2 shows the parameters and the range dealt by rsm eq 3 was used to show the interaction between the independent variable and dependent responses 3 γ b 0 i 1 k b 1 x 1 i 1 k b i i x i 2 i 1 k 1 j 1 k b i j x i x j c where b0 is the value of the intercept bi bii bij are the regression coefficients for linear second order and interactive effects respectively xi xj refers to independent variables and c represents the error of prediction the analysis of variance gives the information related to lack of fit p value f value and r2 representing the efficiency of the model prob f less than 0 05 refers that the model terms are significant lack of fit more than 0 05 implies the validity of the model the probability less than 0 05 implies the accuracy of the model 3 results and discussion this section is divided into five parts in the first part water quality parameters of the nf rejected water of tata steel ltd india was determined and reported variation of precipitation factor p of chlorides and sulphates with vr using three solvents were studied and discussed in second part the separation of chlorides and sulphates were done in terms of percentage precipitation factor which is calculated using eq 1 third and fourth part deals with the response surface methodology rsm to optimize the parameters for the removal of chloride and sulphate ions characterization of the precipitated salt is discussed in fifth part 3 1 characteristics of nf rejected water blast furnace wastewater contains high chlorides and sulfate ions along with other salts consequently reusing without treatment makes the framework pipelines eroded along these lines tata steel ltd india uses nanofiltration nf as tertiary treatment method for the blast furnace wastewater however the nf unit contributes to highly concentrated chlorides and sulfates along with different salts much higher than the permissible limit this makes the rejected water unfit to either reuse or discharge to the streams the characteristics of obtained nf rejected water was analysed and shown in table 3 it is seen from the table that all the water quality parameters are well above the permissible limits especially chlorides and sulphates in the range of 1600 mg l and 4200 mg l respectively the total dissolved solids have very high value in the range of 8613 mg l which is highly above the permissible limit 2000 mg l similarly sodium potassium calcium and iron are also above the permissible limit the results after the treatment technique undertaken in this work is also shown in the table and discussed in subsequent sections 3 2 precipitation of chlorides and sulphates by organic solvents three organic solvents such as diisopropylamine dipa isopropylamine ipa and ethylamine ea were selected to separate chlorides and sulphates from nf rejected water mentioned in the preceding section the properties of nanofiltration nf rejected water stream is shown in table 3 chloride and sulphate ion concentrations are well above the allowable limit of 600 mg l and 400 mg l respectively 5 three solvents ipa dipa and ea were blended independently with nf rejected water the solvent to rejected water volumetric proportion is named as vr experiments were done in room temperature with a blending and settling time of 10 and 30 min respectively the variation of precipitation factor with vr is shown in fig 2 a and b for chloride and sulphate respectively for three solvents considered here from fig 2 a it is seen that chloride precipitation factor increases sharply upto vr value of 1 25 and gradual thereafter from the figure it may be seen that beyond the vr value of 3 the increase on precipitation factor will be marginal again precipitation is more for diipa that of ea is less for each value of vr for example chloride precipitation is 80 46 69 54 and 67 65 for diipa ipa and ea respectively for solvent to volume ratio vr of 2 67 fig 2a similar observation is also found for sulphate precipitation shown in fig 2 b however the sharp increase is observed upto vr of 1 0 instead that of chloride at vr 1 25 and becomes gradual afterward from both fig 2 a and b it is seen that diipa shows highest precipitation factor 80 and 100 for chloride and sulphate respectively followed by ipa and ea the difference in extent salt precipitation capacity was due to the variation of hydrogen bonding capabilities of these three solvents soluble salts are salted out precipitated when water molecules are easily h bonded with the amine based solvents and unavailable for salts for solvation diipa has higher h bonding capacity than that of for ipa and ea thereon therefore extent of chloride and sulphate precipitation is observed in the order of diipa ipa ea depending on h bonding capabilities 22 considering the operation point of view and boiling point table 1 ipa is the best choice 23 hence ipa was chosen for the investigation of various factors influencing the precipitation and discussed in the subsequent sections 3 3 ccd designed model and analysis of variance chloride and sulphate precipitation factor model is given by eqs 4 and 5 respectively the experiments were carried with the volume ratio vr a range from 0 33 2 67 ph range b from 2 10 temperature c from 10 32 oc and contact time d range from 10 30 min a positive value of coefficient indicates a synergistic effect and a negative value symbolizes an opposite effect 21 4 chloride precipitation factor p 76 68 3 04 a 0 91 b 3 82 c 1 69 d 1 44 a b 4 48 a c 0 79 a d 0 75 b c 1 86 b d 4

b c and d are the coded values of variables namely volume ratio vr ph temperature c and time min respectively total of 30 experiments with 6 central points have been applied to study the effects of main four independent parameters viz volume of the solvent ph temperature and contact time on chloride and sulphate precipitation the responses were analysed and the results of anova for precipitation of chlorides and sulphates are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the low probability with f value of 172 8 depicts that the model is accurate lack of fit 0 08 more than 0 05 shows that the model is valid a high r2 value of 0 99 with adjusted r2 of 0 98 represents that the model is significant for the chloride precipitation similarly f value about 18 with low probability implies that the model is accurate lack of fit 0 82 which is more than 0 05 illustrates that the model is valid r2 value of 0 98 represents the sulphate precipitation model is substantial 3 4 response surface methodology and 3d plotting effect of the dependent variables on the percent precipitation factor in 3d graph is shown in figs 3 and 4 for chloride and sulphate respectively the interaction between vr ph vr temperature vr contact time ph temperature ph contact time and temperature contact time may be seen from these 2 figures this also depicts the maximum 77 50 cl and 99 82 so4 2 and minimum 49 48 cl and 94 21 so4 2 precipitation factor obtained with above mentioned interactions figs 3 and 4 represents the higher value points towards the lower value points of the response for chloride and sulphate precipitation factor respectively fig 3 a shows that the chloride precipitation factor increased with the increase in vr and ph while from fig 3b it is seen that the chloride precipitation was maximum 63 05 at the middle value of the design space it can be clearly seen from fig 3 c and e that the contact time does not have much of an impact on chloride precipitation factor with increasing vr and ph whereas the temperature and dosage showed prominent impact on chloride precipitation factor it may be concluded that 15 min is the optimum mixing time for precipitating the chloride and sulphate salts in presence of ipa at increasing vr similarly from fig 4 a it is seen that sulphate precipitation factor increases from 97 to 99 with increasing vr fig 4 b shows the effect of temperature and vr on sulphate precipitation factor this plot shows that sulphate precipitation factor is maximum 98 5 at higher vr 2 08 and low temperature 15 50 c from fig 4d it is seen that there is no much impact on sulphate precipitation factor with increasing temperature and ph therefore the percentage chloride and sulphate precipitation factor is better at the midpoints of the limit as seen in figs 3 and 4 respectively 3 5 interaction studies using factors tool interaction study gives a clear picture of changes in precipitation factor with respect to the four parameters considered herein interaction study between ph and vr was carried with two ph 4 and 8 with varying vr and keeping temperature and contact time at 21 c and 20 min respectively from fig 5 two things can be inferred firstly when the ph of the sample was maintained at 4 the chloride precipitation is higher 80 at lower vr 0 92 however as vr was increased chloride precipitation factor gradually decreased to 72 on the other hand at ph 8 chloride precipitation factor was 74 5 and was steady till vr 1 50 and decreased thereafter secondly at ph 4 there is a drastic decrease in chloride precipitation factor but at ph 8 there is no much decrease in precipitation factor with varying vr this fact would indicate that the chloride ion removal is better when the sample ph is kept in its original 8 1 as shown in table 3 in fig 5b it is seen that chloride precipitation factor is decreasing gradually from 82 2 to 65 at 15 c whereas at 26 5 c chloride precipitation factor increased from 64 to 68 as vr is increased this fact is advantageous as the temperature is near about room temperature and precipitation is higher at this temperature hence there is no need of extra energy which directly favours in terms of cost efficiency likewise in fig 5c it is seen that chloride precipitation factor shows a decreasing trend with respect to increasing vr when contact time is at 14 5 min and 25 2 min in case of interaction study of parameters of sulphate precipitation factor the trend is exactly opposite to the chloride precipitation factor which is seen in fig 6 in fig 6a it is seen that sulphate precipitation factor increases from 97 15 to 99 25 and 97 9 to 98 5 with increase in vr for both ph 4 and 8 respectively in fig 6b it is seen that at 15 c and 26 c sulphate precipitation factor increases sequentially with increasing vr however sulphate precipitation factor is highest 99 55 when temperature is maintained at 15 c this indicates that sulphate ions are less soluble than chloride at lower temperature it may be seen from fig 6 c that at 14 5 min of contact time sulphate precipitation factor remain almost constant at 99 25 with increase in vr at 25 2 min sulphate precipitation factor increases drastically from 97 3 to 99 7 as vr is increased from 0 92 to 2 09 therefore it may be concluded that contact time beyond 14 5 min imparts better sulphate precipitation factor there are limited works focusing on the separation of chloride and sulphate ions from wastewater especially from nf rejected saline water a comparative study of literatures with the present study is shown in table 6 17 24 27 from the table it is envisaged that the use of miscible organic solvents are scant for the separation of chloride and sulphate ions from the industrial effluents in this context the present study is advocated to investigate performance of ipa diipa and ea for the separation of chloride and sulphate ions from nf rejected saline water which highlights the uniqueness of this work 3 6 process optimization by desirability function a desirable value for every input and all the responses were chosen by using numerical optimization to set an output value for the given conditions the range of the inputs and target of the responses were considered 28 29 the goals for all the inputs were selected in range and maximum for the responses the maximum attained percentage chloride and sulphate precipitation factor was obtained at 77 50 and 99 82 respectively at vr of 1 02 ph of 8 temperature at 23 39 c and contact time of 26 min validation was confirmed by carrying out the experiments at the optimized conditions given by the software the confirmatory experiments depicted percentage chloride and sulphate precipitation factor of 74 50 and 97 6 respectively this suggests that the model is accurate and valid 3 7 recovery of the solvent the organic solvents used for the precipitation should have favourable physical properties when recovery is considered as discussed in table 1 the boiling point of ipa is very low which favours in recovering the solvent from the solution 96 98 of isopropylamine ipa was recovered using simple distillation however 2 4 loss was seen due to evaporation during the operation this loss may be avoided by state of art distillation facilities traces of ipa in the filtered sample was eliminated by simple aeration 3 8 characterization of precipitated salt 3 8 1 field emission scanning electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem was performed to analyse the surface morphological features of the obtained precipitated salt as shown in figs 7 a and 7b it is seen from fig 7 b higher magnification that the salts are aggregated by nature this is due to the presence of mixture of inorganic salts the quantitative analysis of the salt sample by measuring the elemental composition for every species in the sample was performed using edx fig 7 c depicts that the precipitated salt contains cations like magnesium calcium sodium iron potassium which possibly combine with chloride and sulphates to form their respective salts the presence of chlorine and sulphur makes it evident for the presence of chloride and sulphates 3 8 2 x ray diffraction x ray diffraction xrd analysis of precipitated salt was performed and is shown in fig 8 the 2θ value at 31 and 45 predominantly show the presence of sodium chloride 30 similarly 30 and 43 4 depicted the presence of magnesium chloride and calcium sulphate respectively 31 32 thus the results confirm that the chloride and sulphate is been salted out with the available cations present in the solution 3 8 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of precipitated salt was carried out between 500 and 4000 cm 1 the spectra obtained is shown in fig 9 precipitated salt showed inorganic sulphates like calcium sulphate sodium sulphate and potassium sulphate in the range of 1000 to 1110 cm 1 in addition peaks around 3694 cm 1 and 3377 cm 1 showed nh stretching this might be due to the presence of trace amount of ipa within the precipitated salt it is to be noted here that inorganic chlorides will not produce any vibrations as their lattice vibrations are beyond ir range 33 4 conclusion separation of chlorides and sulphates from nf rejected wastewater of steel industry was successfully achieved by using organic solvents namely diipa ipa and ea the chloride and sulphate salts were precipitated in the presence of miscible organic solvents based on solventing out phenomenon water quality parameters like tds was reduced from 8613 mg l to 785 mg l and that of chlorides and sulphates from 1594 mg l to 358 mg l and 4196 mg l to 8 4 mg l respectively the optimum condition obtained for chloride and sulphate precipitation was at vr 1 02 ph 8 temperature 23 4 c and contact time 26 min 96 98 of organic solvent ipa was recovered which is recycled back to the system for further use however higher recovery efficiency can be achieved by introducing a closed system of entire precipitation scheme based on the results obtained in this work a pilot plant study is strongly recommended to treat the nf rejected stream and to investigate its feasibility in industrial scale the steel industry having integrated plant of nf units used for the treatment of blast furnace wastewater is encouraged to investigate further the said technology for implementation in industrial scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgment this work is supported by a grant from tata steel

14206,the influence of addition of titanate nanotubes modified with copper cu tnts on the physicochemical antifouling and antibacterial properties of polyethersulfone pes membranes obtained under various conditions is presented the effect of polymer concentration 15 and 16 wt in casting dope and temperature of coagulation bath 10 and 20 c was investigated furthermore the influence of cu content in the cu tnts 1 86 vs 12 23 wt on the properties of the membranes was evaluated the physicochemical characterization of the membranes was based on scanning electron microscopy atomic force microscopy isoelectric point and contact angle measurements the permeability of the mixed matrix membranes was higher compared to the neat ones and the improvement was the most significant for 15 wt pes content in the casting dope and cu tnts with higher cu loading on the opposite the best antifouling performance exhibited the membranes characterized by the lowest pure water flux 16 pes 10 c and a lower cu content the addition of cu tnts improved the antibacterial activity of the membranes the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis was depended on the kind of cu tnts used

ultra high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope v volume xrd x ray diffraction 1 introduction polyethersulfone pes membranes are widely applied during water purification using pressure driven techniques such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf they are characterized by a good mechanical resistance as well as high thermal chemical and oxidative stability 1 despite these advantages they suffer from membrane fouling due to the relatively low hydrophilicity of pes fouling is one of major challenges related to mf and uf operation this undesired phenomenon contributes to a decrease of membranes permeability or even their damage thus increasing the process costs currently modern methods for improving membrane antifouling properties are being searched amongst numerous attempts to fouling minimization modification of membranes with nanomaterials seems a very promising solution various modifying agents have been proposed including zero dimensional tio2 nanoparticles nps or one dimensional carbon nanotubes cnts halloysite nanotubes hnts and titania titanate nanotubes tnts moreover different types of metallic nanoparticles such as ag and cu or metal oxides e g iron oxides zro2 al2o3 zno 2 or their composites have been examined over the years 3 in general incorporation of these nanomaterials was found to increase membrane hydrophilicity and contribute to improvement of permeability and bio fouling resistance amongst various nps the tnts are still poorly explored as membrane modifying agents subramaniam et al 4 obtained pvdf ultrafiltration membrane loaded with tnts with enhanced fouling resistance wan azelee et al 5 presented that the polyamide pa thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes with addition of multi walled carbon nanotube titania nanotube mwcnt tnt hybrid nps were characterized by a higher water permeability compared to the neat pa membranes an increase of hydrophilicity permeability and anti bio fouling resistance of polysulfone psu membranes modified with sulfonic acid functionalized tio2 nanotubes was also reported by alsohaimi 6 furthermore emadzadeh et al 7 prepared reverse osmosis ro membrane modified by amino functionalized titanate nanotubes nh2 tnts with enhanced antifoulingproperties the pervaporation membranes for separation of water isopropanol mixtures based on poly vinyl alcohol pva incorporated with tnts and cross linked with glutaraldehyde were synthesized by raeisi et al 8 ng et al 9 obtained nanocomposite membranes using tnts modified with hexafluorobutyl acrylate hfba or hydroxyethyl methacrylate hema by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition pecvd the above overview clearly shows that the number of reports on the tnts loaded uf polymeric membranes is very limited nonetheless the present state of the art in the area of uf polymeric membranes modified with tnts functionalized with metallic nps such as ag or cu is also very scarce 10 11 the application of ag or cu was proposed to improve the resistance of membranes to biofouling although ag is well known as an excellent antibacterial agent there are also reports showing superior activity of cu with reference to some bacteria species for example ruparelia et al 12 compared the antibacterial activity of ag and cu nps towards various strains of escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis in case of e coli silver was for circa 40 50 more effective in inhibition of their growth compared to copper in case of s aureus ag was more effective for only circa 10 15 and for b subtilis cu exhibited almost 90 higher activity than ag the application of cu nps for modification of uf membranes made of pes blended with sulfonated polyarylethersulfone spaes was reported by zhang et al 13 the addition of cu nps into the membrane casting dope suppressed macropores formation and the increasing content of the nanomaterial resulted in an increase in pore density and decrease in pore size the cu modified membranes exhibited higher hydrophilicity and water permeability compared to the neat membrane moreover the modified membranes were characterized by an improved overall antifouling performance although the higher content of cu nps led to a higher reversible fouling the mixed matrix membranes exhibited also antibacterial properties as was found on a basis of inhibition zone measurement with application of e coli 14 cherif et al 15 prepared thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes for nanofiltration nf by incorporation of cu nps in the pa layer they reported that the membranes containing cu nps exhibited much rougher surface than the unmodified one which led to an increase of the membrane surface area and thus enhancement of water permeability it was also reported that the modified membranes possessed antibacterial properties cu nps incorporated to a membrane structure have been reported to be relatively easily released from the polymeric matrix 13 leading to a decrease of the positive effects of the modification as well as contamination of feed or permeate copper species present in the treated wastewater discharged to the environment can act as toxic agents for the aquatic organisms due to the induction of the oxidative stress and membrane cell damage 16 in case of application of the permeate as a potable water the elevated cu level could have a negative impact on human health 17 therefore prior to application in membranes fabrication the cu nps should be immobilized on organic or inorganic carriers to reduce release of metal ions from the membrane structure 14 there are some reports concerning immobilization of cu on other nanomaterials such as halloysite 18 alumina 19 magnesium 20 graphene 21 or tio2 22 alternatively titanate nanotubes can be regarded as one of the inorganic carrier used in this approach however there are only few reports related to preparation of cu modified tnts 23 25 umek et al 23 prepared copper doped sodium titanate nanotubes and nanoribbons tnrs by two different methods utilizing in situ and ex situ approach in the first method the tnts and tnrs were prepared from anatase tio2 doped with cu2 from cu ch3coo 2 while in the second one the nanotubes and nanoribbons were impregnated with copper by stirring in cuso4 solution doong et al 24 obtained cu modified tio2 tnt nanocomposite by photodeposition of copper from cu no3 2 solution on tnts prepared hydrothermally from tio2 and calcined at 500 c the nps were applied for photocatalytic removal of bisphenol a similar photodeposition approach using cuso4 as a precursor was applied by joshi et al 25 for fabrication of cu modified tnts cu tnts with antibacterial properties the authors reported that under dark conditions the cu tnts exhibited similar antibacterial activity towards s aureus compared to ag modified tnts ag tnts the literature on application of cu tnts for membranes fabrication is even more limited to the best of our knowledge there is only one report by sumisha et al 26 on that subject nonetheless the authors prepared an nf membrane containing cu tnts for improvement of salt rejection there are however no reports on the preparation of uf pes membranes modified with hybrid cu tnts characterized by enhanced permeability and hydrophilicity as well as antibacterial properties in view of the above in the present paper the investigations on the influence of cu tnts on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties as well as performance of pes membranes obtained under various preparation conditions is presented and discussed especially the effect of polymer concentration and temperature of coagulation bath was investigated furthermore the influence of the content of copper in the cu titanate nanotubes on the properties of the obtained membranes was examined 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods polyethersulfone was provided by basf germany n n dimethylformamide dmf solvent was purchased from avantor

coli suspension in 0 85 wt nacl solution or s epidermidis in pbs was adjusted to 0 5 according to mcfarland scale mcfarland standards biomérieux france 2 2 preparation of titanate nanotubes titanate nanotubes were prepared using hydrothermal method 27 in the blh 800 pressure reactor berghof germany first 2 g of anatase tio2 powder and 60 ml of 10 m naoh were added into 75 ml teflon vessel and sonicated for 1 h then the vessel was mounted in the reactor and the hydrothermal reaction was performed for 24 h at the temperature of 140 c the obtained suspension was washed with ultrapure water simplicity millipore and 0 1 m hcl and subsequently dried 80 c for 24 h and ground using agate mortar 2 3 preparation of composite cu tnts the hybrid cu tnts were prepared by photodeposition method in the first step 0 5 g of tnts were dispersed in 50 ml of cu no3 2 or cu ch3coo 2 solution 100 mm and magnetically stirred 250 rpm for 2 h in a glass reactor subsequently the suspension was irradiated with a low pressure mercury vapour lamp tnn 15 32 heraeus noblelight gmbh 15 w λmax 254 nm for 2 h with continuous stirring the obtained nanomaterial was centrifuged washed with pure water to remove the excess of cu2 ions and dried at 80 c in an oven for 12 h the samples were denoted later as cu tnt n and cu tnt ac where the extensions n and ac correspond to cu no3 2 or cu ch3coo 2 respectively 2 4 preparation of membranes the membranes were fabricated by the wet phase inversion method the casting solution for preparation of the unmodified membranes was obtained by dissolution of a proper amount 15 or 16 wt of pes in 50 ml of dmf and stirring in a tightly closed bottle overnight then the casting dope was degassed by leaving it at rest to get a bubble free solution and casted on a glass plate using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 elcometer ltd uk equipped with a knife the knife gap was set at 0 1 mm which corresponded to the membrane thickness in the range of 35 38 μm the casted film was immersed in the non solvent bath at 10 c or 20 c and kept in pure water for 24 h the temperature of coagulation bath of 20 c was selected as an ambient temperature commonly used during phase inversion process higher temperature was not selected because it is well known from literature that with increasing temperature of coagulation bath the membranes exhibit higher pure water flux and typically lower resistance to fouling which is a flux driven phenomenon on the opposite lower temperature of non solvent leads to formation of a denser membrane hence the membranes under decreased temperature of coagulation bath 10 c with a hypothesis that it would be beneficial in terms of fouling mitigation were prepared in case of the modified membranes the fabrication procedure was similar to the abovementioned however an additional step of cu tnts sonication was applied at this stage 1 wt of cu tnts in relation to pes was dispersed in 10 ml of dmf using ultrasonic liquid processor vibra cell vcx 130 sonics usa output power 130 w frequency 20 khz amplitude 80 equipped with a 6 mm ultrasonic probe the obtained suspension was then added into the solution of pes in dmf subsequently sonicated sonic 6d polsonic poland output power 320 w frequency 40 khz for 15 min at 20 25 c and finally stirred 200 rpm for additional 15 min at temperature of 55 60 c the sonication and stirring steps were carried out by turns for 2 h a summary of the conditions applied during preparation of the membranes is presented in table 1 2 5 characterization of composite cu tnts the morphological analysis of cu tnts was carried out using transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai f20 the samples were prepared by sonication in ethanol followed by adding a drop of the suspension on a nickel grid 300 mesh the phase composition of cu tnts was determined based on x ray diffraction xrd method panalytical empyrean x ray diffractometer using cukα radiation λ 1 54056 å the isoelectric point and

average membrane roughness ra was evaluated using the nanoscope analysis software the ra results represent a mean value calculated for five randomly selected areas the size of the membrane pores in the top layer was calculated using the gwyddion software package slightly modifying the method described by khanukaeva et al 28 namely both watershed and threshold modes were used to mark pores on the previously recorded 1 μm 1 μm afm images the water contact angles were measured using a sessile water drop method with application of the goniometer model 260 ramé hart instruments co usa the static contact angle sca values were calculated as an average of at least 10 measurements from 10 different membrane pieces the volume of the ultrapure water drop in this set of experiments was 10 μl the isoelectric point ph i and zeta potential of the membranes were measured using surpass 3 analyzer anton paar gmbh austria the 0 001 m kcl solution in ultrapure water was applied as an electrolyte

of modified membranes were inserted into glass bottles containing 25 ml of saline solution and a stirrer bar the bottles were stirred at 250 rpm and 37 c for 7 days the liquid samples were collected after 24 72 and 168 h and analyzed using optima 5300dv icp oes spectrometer 2 7 membrane filtration the measurements of membranes permeability and antifouling performance were realized in a laboratory scale cross flow membrane system the installation was equipped with a feed tank from which the feed was pumped using a plunger pump with a pressure dampener to two parallel stainless steel membrane modules the working membrane area was 0 0025 m2 a 1 194 mm feed spacer was applied in all experiments the transmembrane pressure tmp in the range of 0 1 0 3 mpa was controlled using manometers and needle valves the temperature was maintained at 20 1 c the changes of the permeate flux were evaluated by measuring the volume of the permeate passing through the membrane during a fixed period of time and calculated according to the eq 1 1 j v a t where v volume of permeate l a membrane area m2 t time during which the permeate was collected h each experiment was repeated at least three times in order to confirm the reproducibility of the results the antifouling properties of the membranes were evaluated by ultrafiltration of bsa solution at a concentration of 1 g l 1 under tmp of 0 2 mpa

according to mcfarland scale were added to glass bottles then an ellipsoidal stirring bar and a piece of a dry membrane 12 5 cm 4 5 cm were introduced inside each bottle additionally control samples i

1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cu tnts during our preliminary studies data not shown we have observed that the antibacterial properties of cu tnts are strongly dependent on cu loading since one of the issues discussed in the present manuscript is antibacterial performance of the mixed matrix membranes on a basis of these investigations the cu tnt n with low 1 86 wt and the cu tnt ac with high 12 23 wt cu content were selected for the membranes fabrication such an attempt gives an opportunity to evaluate the effect of cu loading in the hybrid nps on the membranes performance based on tem analysis of cu tnts fig 1 it was found that the nanotubes exhibited multi walled and open ended structure the length of tnts was in the range of 50 200 nm and inner outer diameter amounted to circa 5 13 nm respectively on the outer surface of the tnts some small cu nps can be observed with dominant diameters in the range of circa 2 3 nm fig 1 the xrd patterns fig s1 of the prepared cu tnts exhibited four broad peaks positioned at 2θ 9 5 24 5 28 5 and 48 5 which correspond with 020 110 130 and 200 reflections of the layered titanates e g orthorhombic h2ti2 x 4 x 4o4 a 0 3643 b 1 8735 and c 0 2978 nm 29 moreover the absence of peaks corresponding to anatase tio2 indicates that after the hydrothermal treatment the precursor was completely converted to layered titanates 30 31 however no visible reflections representing metallic cu or copper oxides were observed in the xrd patterns which is possibly due to the quite low cu content in the nanocomposites or the small size of cu nps the presence of copper in the prepared cu tnts was confirmed on a basis of icp oes analysis the cu tnt n contained 1 86 wt of cu and cu tnt ac exhibited six times higher amount of this metal 12 23 wt the isoelectric point of cu tnt ac was 4 1 0 1 and the ph i of cu tnt n was 3 9 0 1 which could also indicate lower amount of cu in these nps as the unmodified tnts had the isoelectric point of 3 1 0 1 above these ph values the surface of the nanoparticles was negatively charged 3 2 characterization of membranes 3 2 1 membranes morphology sem was applied for analysis of membranes morphology and distribution of nanomaterials within the membranes structure the cross sections of all investigated uf membranes fig 2 exhibit typical asymmetric porous structure with a dense skin layer a porous sub layer containing well developed narrow finger like pores and larger finger like pores in the bottom part with a spongy structure between them the finger like pores widened towards the bottom section of the membranes in some places some spherical macrovoids can be also observed in case of all modified membranes the cu tnts agglomerates imbedded in the polymeric matrices are visible fig 2 nevertheless the structure of the membranes prepared from the casting dope containing 16 wt of pes at the non solvent bath temperature of 20 c m4 m6 exhibit lower number of macropores and richer spongy structure compared to 15 wt of pes m1 m3 which is related to a higher polymer content moreover the decrease of temperature of non solvent bath to 10 c m7 m9 caused the enhancement of this effect since under lower temperature solvent diffusion is slower and viscosity of polymer solution increases low temperature of the non solvent bath diminishes the mutual diffusivity between the solvent and non solvent during phase inversion and in result instantaneous demixing hence the number of macropores is reduced and the membrane structure is much denser 32 3 2 2 surface properties of the membranes fig 3 presents the three dimensional afm images of the membranes surfaces both large mountain like agglomerates as well as small needle like structures are visible on the skin of all modified membranes the diameters and heights of the larger species range from 0 5 μm to 6 35 μm and from 60 to 180 nm respectively while in case of the small aggregates the values are 0 1 0 5 μm and 19 50 nm respectively the presence of the cu tnts based species resulted in an increase of the surface roughness 6 0 8 9 nm compared to the neat membranes 4 7 5 1 nm as can be found from the ra values summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the temperature of the non solvent bath had an influence on the membrane surface properties all membranes prepared at 20 c have higher surface roughness 5 1 8 9 nm than the samples prepared at 10 c 4 7 6 4 nm this observation could also be made by comparing the ra of samples fabricated at 20 c using the same nanofillers but different pes concentration 8 9 nm or 8 2 nm for cu tnt n and 15 wt or 16 wt of pes respectively and 6 4 or 6 8 nm for cu tnt ac and 15 wt or 16 wt of pes respectively it can be seen that these results are similar to each other and yet they are higher than ra of the samples casted at 10 c 6 4 nm for cu tnt n and 6 0 nm for cu tnt ac it can be noted that the addition of cu tnt n as a nanofiller had a higher impact on ra 6 4 8 9 nm than cu tnt ac 6 0 6 9 nm the reason can be that cu tnt n nanoparticles contained lower amount of copper which could influence the interactions between nps and cause different agglomeration than in case of cu tnt ac the effect of coagulation bath temperature on the membranes properties can be also seen when analysing their surface porosity in fig s2 the pores on the surface of the neat m1 m4 and m7 membranes marked and calculated using gwyddion software are presented both samples casted at 20 c m1 and m4 exhibited slightly larger pores mean pore size of 7 4 nm and 7 0 respectively and higher porosity 8 1 and 7 8 respectively than the sample fabricated at 10 c 5 9 nm and 6 8 respectively although the porosity was the lowest in case of the lowest non solvent temperature the number of pores was for that membrane the highest fig s2 these findings are in agreement with the literature data li et al 33 proved that the increase of the coagulation bath temperature increases the porosity and pore size of the pes membranes they attributed these results to the changes of solvent water exchange rates the isoelectric points table 2 of the prepared membranes shifted slightly from 2 7 to 2 8 for the neat membranes to 2 9 3 1 for the membranes with the nanofiller indicating that the cu tnts which have the isoelectric point of 4 1 and 3 9 for cu tnt ac and cu tnt n respectively are present on the surface at ph above the isoelectric point the membranes possess a negative charge while at ph ph i their surface is positively charged the highest static water contact angles were observed for the unmodified pes membranes table 2 the water contact angles of the composite membranes were reduced since their hydrophilicity was improved with the addition of cu tnts the most hydrophilic membranes were those prepared from 15 wt of pes table 1 in general the sca increased with the increase of polymer concentration and decrease of temperature of non solvent bath the explanation could be a much denser skin layer of the membranes casted from the dope containing 16 wt of polymer especially formed at 10 c at low surface porosity and smaller pores the flow of water into membrane pores due to capillary forces was inhibited resulting in higher sca values on the opposite in case of the membranes obtained using dopes containing 15 wt of pes the pores were larger which allowed water to infiltrate more easily thus reducing the sca 32 34 to investigate the stability of the membranes the release of cu and ti in 0 85 wt nacl solution at 37 c was evaluated such conditions represented the parameters applied during evaluation of the antibacterial properties of the membranes it was found that no ti was released from the membranes during 7 days of experiments moreover the cu concentration in the solution did not exceed 0 02 mg l 1 after 7 days being circa 4 5 times higher in case of cu tnt ac containing higher amount of cu compared to cu tnt n the obtained results revealed good stability of the prepared membranes containing cu tnts nanocomposites under the applied conditions 3 2 3 water permeability of membranes the pure water permeability of the examined membranes is summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the addition of cu tnts into pes matrix improved the permeability regardless of the applied parameters of membranes fabrication the highest improvement was noted for the membranes obtained with application of 15 wt pes concentration in the casting solution for both modified membranes the permeability increased for about 31 32 in comparison with that of the unmodified m1 the membranes casted from the solutions containing 16 wt of pes exhibited lower permeability compared to the m1 m3 membranes due to a denser structure resulting from a higher polymer content however despite that also the improvement of membranes permeability associated with the incorporation of cu tnts was significantly less remarkable than observed for 15 wt of pes in the casting dope the permeability of m5 and m6 increased for only 9 and 13 respectively compared to m4 further in case of the membranes casted at the coagulation bath temperature of 10 c the cu tnts modification led to a less significant improvement compared to the m1 m3 series reaching 11 12 from the data presented in table 2 it can be also observed that a higher temperature of the coagulation bath contributed to an increase of membranes permeability however the differences between m4 m6 and m7 m9 series were not as large as in case of the membranes prepared with different pes concentration the main explanation can be a much denser skin layer of the membranes fabricated using higher pes concentration the skin formed at the very early stage of the coagulation bath casting dope interaction was limiting further diffusion of non solvent in and solvent out of the underneath layer 35 as a result of the thicker skin the membrane resistance for water transportation increased leading to lower permeate fluxes nevertheless the observed positive effect of the addition of the nanofillers into all types of the pes membranes matrices was caused by hydrophilic properties of the nps and the additional contribution of microchannels in the cu tnts structure that provided new flow paths for water molecules 36 37 these statements are confirmed by the higher hydrophilicity of the modified membranes and the presence of cu tnts agglomerates within their matrices the more hydrophilic modified membranes could attract easily water molecules and facilitate their transport through the pores a slightly higher permeability was observed in case of the membranes modified with cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n which is especially visible for the membranes prepared at the non solvent temperature of 20 c table 2 that can be related to the significantly higher content of copper in cu tnt ac 12 23 wt than in cu tnt n 1 86 wt 37 38 the obtained results demonstrate that the application of composite cu tnts as a nanofiller can be regarded as a method for improvement of membranes permeability 3 2 4 antifouling properties of membranes fig 4 presents changes of permeate fluxes during ultrafiltration of bsa solution through the examined membranes it can be observed that the effect of the cu tnts presence on the antifouling properties of the membranes was dependent on the parameters of their fabrication the permeate fluxes in case of the m2 and m3 modified membranes fig 4a were noticeably lower than that measured for the unmodified m1 during ultrafiltration of bsa solution through the m5 and m6 the permeate fluxes were comparable to that observed for the unmodified m4 membrane fig 4b finally in case of the m8 and m9 membranes prepared at the lowest coagulation bath temperature 10 c the incorporation of cu tnts resulted in an improvement of their antifouling properties from the very beginning of the ultrafiltration of the bsa solution the permeate fluxes through the modified m8 and m9 membranes were higher than that of the neat m7 fig 4c moreover the flux measured for the m8 membrane modified with cu tnt n was the highest amongst the fluxes measured for all the examined membranes after 2 h of experiment the permeate fluxes through the cu tnt n modified membranes reached the values of 153 l m 2 h 1 in case of m8 132 l m 2 h 1 for m2 and 127 l m 2 h 1 for m5 the m2 and m3 were characterized by the highest water permeability from all the examined membranes table 2 thus one explanation for the significant flux decline in their case can be the enhanced deposition of bsa molecules on the membranes surface and within their pores due to the enhanced transport of feed components towards the membrane at higher flux during the initial stage of the process 39 for the m5 and m6 membranes the increase of permeability due to the modification was not as high as in case of m1 m3 series table 2 hence the fouling intensity was less severe the lowest water permeability was obtained for the membranes casted at 10 c which corresponded with their superior resistance to bsa fouling generally the improvement of antifouling properties of the copper modified membranes is attributed to the hydrophilic nature of a cu based nanofiller 38 40 for example nasrollahi et al 38 explained in such a way the positive effect of cuo nps addition into pes membrane on its enhanced fouling resistance however in the present studies the lower fouling intensity in case of m5 and m6 compared to the m2 and m3 was not reflected by the contact angle values table 2 this indicates that some other factors are responsible for the observed results e g relatively lower water permeability and a denser skin layer which prevented from the enhanced deposition of bsa molecules during ultrafiltration process furthermore despite the lowest hydrophilicity of m8 and m9 membranes among all the modified ones these membranes exhibited the best antifouling properties except from the water permeability issue the explanation of the observed results could be related to the membranes surface roughness the ra values of m8 and m9 membranes were relatively low 6 4 and 6 0 nm respectively therefore the deposition of bsa on the membranes surfaces was hindered to some extent in order to evaluate whether the surface charge of the membranes under conditions applied during bsa fouling studies was important for their antifouling properties the zeta potential at ph 6 85 was also determined a more negative zeta potential of the membranes might help to mitigate their fouling by the negatively charged bsa since the deposition of negatively charged foulants is hindered by forming higher electrostatic double layer repulsion 41 however it was found that in the presence of cu tnts in the membranes matrix the zeta potential values were only slightly lower compared to those measured for the neat membranes moreover no noticeable effect of the type of cu tnts on the zeta potential was observed these results confirm again that the permeability closely associated with membranes porosity is an important issue to explain the fouling behaviour as was discussed in section 3 2 2 the membranes casted at higher non solvent temperature exhibited higher porosity and pore size compared to those obtained at 10 c thus relatively higher amount of bsa molecules could enter and block their pores 42 the data presented in fig 4 show that the cu tnt n modified membranes exhibited the highest fouling resistance amongst all the prepared samples these results could be explained by different cu content in the hybrid nps as was already reported in section 3 1 in case of the cu tnt n the cu loading was about six times lower compared to cu tnt ac taking into account that copper ions can form complexes with amino acid residues of the bsa molecules 43 44 the high cu content can promote binding of the foulant with the membrane surface such a phenomenon was much more possible for the membranes modified with cu tnt ac which exhibited stronger binding affinities due to a higher cu content compared to the samples modified with cu tnt n the interactions between metal ions present in cu tnts could contribute to the membrane fouling thus increasing its severity 39 in view of the above it is clear that a balance between high water permeability and fouling resistance is a key issue when designing the cu tnts modified membranes no significant influence of the modification on the rejection of bsa was found for all the examined membranes the retention coefficients ranged from 99 4 0 2 to 99 6 0 2 regardless of membrane preparation conditions 3 3 antibacterial performance of membranes fig 5 shows antibacterial ability of the prepared membranes against s epidermidis and e coli generally it was noticed that the addition of cu tnts into membranes matrices improved their antibacterial properties against both bacteria nevertheless for all examined membranes higher log reduction values were obtained in case of e coli compared to s epidermidis fig 5 moreover no significant differences between the antibacterial activity of the membranes modified with two various types of cu tnts against e coli was observed on the opposite in case of s epidermidis the membranes containing cu tnt ac m3 m6 m9 exhibited significantly higher antimicrobial action compared to cu tnt n regardless of the conditions of membrane fabrication these differences can be attributed to the higher cu content in case of cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n the antibacterial mechanism of cu is not fully understood taking into account that metallic cu is very sensitive to air and that cu oxides are thermodynamically more stable than metallic cu the formation of an oxide layer on the surface of the cu nps typically occurs 45 therefore the antibacterial properties of cu nps should be discussed in terms of the activity of cu oxides taking this into account applerot et al 46 based on their investigations on cuo antibacterial action towards gram negative e coli and gram positive s aureus reported that i smaller nps diameter of circa 2 nm possessed higher antibacterial activity and higher affinity to bacterial cells in case of both examined bacteria compared to large nps circa 800 nm ii cuo nps not only attached to the bacterial surface but also penetrated the cell membrane iii the reduction of bacterial growth was more efficient in case of e coli than s aureus iv cuo nps produced reactive oxygen species ros being responsible for oxidative stress leading to bacterial cells damage furthermore based on analysis of the action of cu2 ions and cuo nps they concluded that the antibacterial properties are mainly due to attachment of cuo nps to bacterial cell and ros production by the cuo nps rather than the action of soluble copper ions both phenomena cause an increase in membrane cell permeability resulting in an uncontrolled transport of cuo nps into the bacterial cell and ultimately cells death 46 however in case of the mixed matrix membranes fabricated in the present study the cu nps were deposited on tnts and additionally fixed in the porous polymeric structure thus the mechanism based on penetration of cu nps is little probable nonetheless since the cu tnts were present on membranes surface as was found from afm analysis the mechanism can be related to a direct contact between cu species and bacteria cells similarly as in case of copper surfaces 47 48 the data presented in fig 5 revealed that the antibacterial action of the prepared membranes was more efficient in case of e coli compared to s epidermidis these results are in agreement with literature reports 46 showing higher inhibition of bacterial growth in case of gram negative compared to gram positive bacteria this phenomenon is commonly explained by the differences in the bacterial cell wall structure the gram negative bacteria do not possess a thick peptidoglycan layer found in gram positive bacteria that could possibly act as a protective layer thus the cell wall destruction due to physical interaction between nps and the cell wall or the penetration of copper ions released from the nps into the cell of gram negative bacteria is facilitated 49 analysis of the results presented in fig 5 revealed also that the membranes preparation conditions pes content non solvent temperature had no significant effect on the antibacterial performance of membranes this can be explained by the same content 1 wt of cu tnt ac or cu tnt n in the two types of membranes 4 conclusions mixed matrix pes membranes fabricated under different conditions and modified with two various cu tnts have been thoroughly studied with particular emphasis on determination of anti bio fouling properties the permeability of the cu tnts modified membranes was higher compared to the neat ones and the difference was especially significant in case of 15 wt pes content in the casting dope a slightly higher pure water permeability was observed in case of the membranes modified with cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n which was explained by a higher cu content in the former nps the fouling by bsa was the most significant in case of the membranes characterized by the highest water permeability i e casted at 20 c from a solution containing 15 wt pes while the lowest permeate flux decline was observed for the membranes exhibiting the lowest permeability i e prepared at 10 c from the casting dope containing 16 wt pes the bsa membrane fouling was slightly higher in case of the membranes containing cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n which could be explained by a higher binding affinity resulting from complex formation between cu2 in nps present in membranes matrix and amino acid residues of the bsa in case of higher cu content the addition of cu tnts improved the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes a higher biocidal ability was observed for e coli than s epidermidis which was explained by the differences in the cell wall structure moreover the inhibition of the growth of s epidermidis was depended on the kind of cu tnts used for membrane modification being more effective for the nps with higher cu content on the opposite no significant influence of cu amount in the hybrid nps on the antibacterial ability against e coli was observed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

ultra high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope v volume xrd x ray diffraction 1 introduction polyethersulfone pes membranes are widely applied during water purification using pressure driven techniques such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf they are characterized by a good mechanical resistance as well as high thermal chemical and oxidative stability 1 despite these advantages they suffer from membrane fouling due to the relatively low hydrophilicity of pes fouling is one of major challenges related to mf and uf operation this undesired phenomenon contributes to a decrease of membranes permeability or even their damage thus increasing the process costs currently modern methods for improving membrane antifouling properties are being searched amongst numerous attempts to fouling minimization modification of membranes with nanomaterials seems a very promising solution various modifying agents have been proposed including zero dimensional tio2 nanoparticles nps or one dimensional carbon nanotubes cnts halloysite nanotubes hnts and titania titanate nanotubes tnts moreover different types of metallic nanoparticles such as ag and cu or metal oxides e g iron oxides zro2 al2o3 zno 2 or their composites have been examined over the years 3 in general incorporation of these nanomaterials was found to increase membrane hydrophilicity and contribute to improvement of permeability and bio fouling resistance amongst various nps the tnts are still poorly explored as membrane modifying agents subramaniam et al 4 obtained pvdf ultrafiltration membrane loaded with tnts with enhanced fouling resistance wan azelee et al 5 presented that the polyamide pa thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes with addition of multi walled carbon

resistance of polysulfone psu membranes modified with sulfonic acid functionalized tio2 nanotubes was also reported by alsohaimi 6 furthermore emadzadeh et al 7 prepared reverse osmosis ro membrane modified by amino functionalized titanate nanotubes nh2 tnts with enhanced antifoulingproperties the pervaporation membranes for separation of water isopropanol mixtures based on poly vinyl alcohol pva incorporated with tnts and cross linked with glutaraldehyde were synthesized by raeisi et al 8 ng et al 9 obtained nanocomposite membranes using tnts modified with hexafluorobutyl acrylate hfba or hydroxyethyl methacrylate hema by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition pecvd the above overview clearly shows that the number of reports on the tnts loaded uf polymeric membranes is very limited nonetheless the present state of the art in the area of uf polymeric membranes modified with tnts functionalized with metallic nps such as ag or cu is also very scarce 10 11 the application of ag or cu was proposed to improve the resistance of membranes to biofouling although ag is well known as an excellent antibacterial agent there are also reports showing superior activity of cu with reference to some bacteria species for example ruparelia et al 12 compared the antibacterial activity of ag and cu nps towards various strains of escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis in case of e coli silver was for circa 40 50 more effective in inhibition of their growth compared to copper in case of s aureus ag was more effective for only circa 10 15 and for b subtilis cu exhibited almost 90 higher activity than ag the application of cu nps for modification of uf membranes made of pes blended with sulfonated polyarylethersulfone spaes was reported by zhang et al 13 the addition of cu nps into the membrane casting dope suppressed macropores formation and the increasing content of the nanomaterial resulted in an increase in pore density and decrease in pore size the cu modified membranes exhibited higher hydrophilicity and water permeability compared to the neat membrane moreover the modified membranes were characterized by an improved overall antifouling performance although the higher content of cu nps led to a higher reversible fouling the mixed matrix membranes exhibited also antibacterial properties as was found on a basis of inhibition zone measurement with application of e coli 14 cherif et al 15 prepared thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes for nanofiltration nf by incorporation of cu nps in the pa layer they reported that the membranes containing cu nps exhibited much rougher surface than the unmodified one which led to an increase of the membrane surface area and thus enhancement of water permeability it was also reported that the modified membranes possessed antibacterial properties cu nps incorporated to a membrane structure have been reported to be relatively easily released from the polymeric matrix 13 leading to a decrease of the positive effects of the modification as well as contamination of feed or permeate copper species present in the treated wastewater discharged to the environment can act as toxic agents for the aquatic organisms due to the induction of the oxidative stress and membrane cell damage 16 in case of application of the permeate as a potable water the elevated cu level could have a negative impact on human health 17 therefore prior to application in membranes fabrication the cu nps should be immobilized on organic or inorganic carriers to reduce release of metal ions from the membrane structure 14 there are some reports concerning immobilization of cu on other nanomaterials such as halloysite 18 alumina 19 magnesium 20 graphene 21 or tio2 22 alternatively titanate nanotubes can be regarded as one of the inorganic carrier used in this approach however there are only few reports related to preparation of cu modified tnts 23 25 umek et al 23 prepared copper doped sodium titanate nanotubes and nanoribbons tnrs by two different methods utilizing in situ and ex situ approach in the first method the tnts and tnrs were prepared from anatase tio2 doped with cu2 from cu ch3coo 2 while in the second one the nanotubes and nanoribbons were impregnated with copper by stirring in cuso4 solution doong et al 24 obtained cu modified tio2 tnt nanocomposite by photodeposition of copper from cu no3 2 solution on tnts prepared hydrothermally from tio2 and calcined at 500 c the nps were applied for photocatalytic removal of bisphenol a similar photodeposition approach using cuso4 as a precursor was applied by joshi et al 25 for fabrication of cu modified tnts cu tnts with antibacterial properties the authors reported that under dark conditions the cu tnts exhibited similar antibacterial activity towards s aureus compared to ag modified tnts ag tnts the literature on application of cu tnts for membranes fabrication is even more limited to the best of our knowledge there is only one report by sumisha et al 26 on that subject nonetheless the authors prepared an nf membrane containing cu tnts for improvement of salt rejection there are however no reports on the preparation of uf pes membranes modified with hybrid cu tnts characterized by enhanced permeability and hydrophilicity as well as antibacterial properties in view of the above in the present paper the investigations on the influence of cu tnts on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties as well as performance of pes membranes obtained under various preparation conditions is presented and discussed especially the effect of polymer concentration and temperature of coagulation bath was investigated furthermore the influence of the content of copper in the cu titanate nanotubes on the properties of the obtained membranes was examined 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods polyethersulfone was provided by basf germany n n dimethylformamide dmf solvent was purchased from avantor

nanotubes were prepared using hydrothermal method 27 in the blh 800 pressure reactor berghof germany first 2 g of anatase tio2 powder and 60 ml of 10 m naoh were added into 75 ml teflon vessel and sonicated for 1 h then the vessel was mounted in the reactor and the hydrothermal reaction was performed for 24 h at the temperature of 140 c the obtained suspension was washed with ultrapure water simplicity millipore and 0 1 m hcl and subsequently dried 80 c for 24 h and ground using agate mortar 2 3 preparation of composite cu tnts the hybrid cu tnts were prepared by photodeposition method in the first step 0 5 g of tnts were dispersed in 50 ml of cu no3 2 or cu ch3coo 2 solution 100 mm and magnetically stirred 250 rpm for 2 h in a glass reactor subsequently the suspension was irradiated with a low pressure mercury vapour lamp tnn 15 32 heraeus noblelight gmbh 15 w λmax 254 nm for 2 h with continuous stirring the obtained nanomaterial was centrifuged washed with pure water to remove the excess of cu2 ions and dried at 80 c in an oven for 12 h the samples were denoted later as cu tnt n and cu tnt ac where the extensions n and ac correspond to cu no3 2 or cu ch3coo 2 respectively 2 4 preparation of membranes the membranes were fabricated by the wet phase inversion method the casting solution for preparation of the unmodified membranes was obtained by dissolution of a proper amount 15 or 16 wt of pes in 50 ml of dmf and stirring in a tightly closed bottle overnight then the casting dope was degassed by leaving it at rest to get a bubble free solution and casted on a glass plate using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 elcometer ltd uk equipped with a knife the knife gap was set at 0 1 mm which corresponded to the membrane thickness in the range of 35 38 μm the casted film was immersed in the non solvent bath at 10 c or 20 c and kept in pure water for 24 h the temperature of coagulation bath of 20 c was selected as an ambient temperature commonly used during phase inversion process higher temperature was not selected because it is well known from literature that with increasing temperature of coagulation bath the membranes exhibit higher pure water flux and typically lower resistance to fouling which is a flux driven phenomenon on the opposite lower temperature of non solvent leads to formation of a denser membrane hence the membranes under decreased temperature of coagulation bath 10 c with a hypothesis that it would be beneficial in terms of fouling mitigation were prepared in case of the modified membranes the fabrication procedure was similar to the abovementioned however an additional step of cu tnts sonication was applied at this stage 1 wt of cu tnts in relation to pes was dispersed in 10 ml of dmf using ultrasonic liquid processor vibra cell vcx 130 sonics usa output power 130 w frequency 20 khz amplitude 80 equipped with a 6 mm ultrasonic probe the obtained suspension was then added into the solution of pes in dmf subsequently sonicated sonic 6d polsonic poland output power 320 w frequency 40 khz for 15 min at 20 25 c and finally stirred 200 rpm for additional 15 min at temperature of 55 60 c the sonication and stirring

1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cu tnts during our preliminary studies data not shown we have observed that the antibacterial properties of cu tnts are strongly dependent on cu loading since one of the issues discussed in the present manuscript is antibacterial performance of the mixed matrix membranes on a basis of these investigations the cu tnt n with low 1 86 wt and the cu tnt ac with high 12 23 wt cu content were selected for the membranes fabrication such an attempt gives an opportunity to evaluate the effect of cu loading in the hybrid nps on the membranes performance based on tem analysis of cu tnts fig 1 it was found that the nanotubes exhibited multi walled and open ended structure the length of tnts was in the range of 50 200 nm and inner outer diameter amounted to circa 5 13 nm respectively on the outer surface of the tnts some small cu nps can be observed with dominant diameters in the range of circa 2 3 nm fig 1 the xrd patterns fig s1 of the prepared cu tnts exhibited four broad peaks positioned at 2θ 9 5 24 5 28 5 and 48 5 which correspond with 020 110 130 and 200 reflections of the layered titanates e g orthorhombic h2ti2 x 4 x 4o4 a 0 3643 b 1 8735 and c 0 2978 nm 29 moreover the absence of peaks corresponding to anatase tio2 indicates that after the hydrothermal treatment the precursor was completely converted to layered titanates 30 31 however no visible reflections representing metallic cu or copper oxides were observed in the xrd patterns which is possibly due to the quite low cu content in the nanocomposites or the small size of cu nps the presence of copper in the prepared cu tnts was confirmed on a basis of icp oes analysis the cu tnt n contained 1 86 wt of cu and cu tnt ac exhibited six times higher amount of this metal 12 23 wt the isoelectric point of cu tnt ac was 4 1 0 1 and the ph i of cu tnt n was 3 9 0 1 which could also indicate lower amount of cu in these nps as the unmodified tnts had the isoelectric point of 3 1 0 1 above these ph values the surface of the nanoparticles was negatively charged 3 2 characterization of membranes 3 2 1 membranes morphology sem was applied for analysis of membranes morphology and distribution of nanomaterials within the membranes structure the cross sections of all investigated uf membranes fig 2 exhibit typical asymmetric porous structure with a dense skin layer a porous sub layer containing well developed narrow finger like pores and larger finger like pores in the bottom part with a spongy structure between them the finger like pores widened towards the bottom section of the membranes in some places some spherical macrovoids can be also observed in case of all modified membranes the cu tnts agglomerates imbedded in the polymeric matrices are visible fig 2 nevertheless the structure of the membranes prepared from the casting dope containing 16 wt of pes at the non solvent bath temperature of 20 c m4 m6 exhibit lower number of macropores and richer spongy structure compared to 15 wt of pes m1 m3 which is related to a higher polymer content moreover the decrease of temperature of non solvent bath to 10 c m7 m9 caused the enhancement of this effect since under lower temperature solvent diffusion is slower and viscosity of polymer solution increases low temperature of the non solvent bath diminishes the mutual diffusivity between the solvent and non solvent during phase inversion and in result instantaneous demixing hence the number of macropores is reduced and the membrane structure is much denser 32 3 2 2 surface properties of the membranes fig 3 presents the three dimensional afm images of the membranes surfaces both large mountain like agglomerates as well as small needle like structures are visible on the skin of all modified membranes the diameters and heights of the larger species range from 0 5 μm to 6 35 μm and from 60 to 180 nm respectively while in case of the small aggregates the values are 0 1 0 5 μm and 19 50 nm respectively the presence of the cu tnts based species resulted in an increase of the surface roughness 6 0 8 9 nm compared to the neat membranes 4 7 5 1 nm as can be found from the ra values summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the temperature of the non solvent bath had an influence on the membrane surface properties all membranes prepared at 20 c have higher surface roughness 5 1 8 9 nm than the samples prepared at 10 c 4 7 6 4 nm this observation could also be made by comparing the ra of samples fabricated at 20 c using the same nanofillers but different pes concentration 8 9 nm or 8 2 nm for cu tnt n and 15 wt or 16 wt of pes respectively and 6 4 or 6 8 nm for cu tnt ac and 15 wt or 16 wt of pes respectively it can be seen that these results are similar to each other and yet they are higher than ra of the samples casted at 10 c 6 4 nm for cu tnt n and 6 0 nm for cu tnt ac it can be noted that the addition of cu tnt n as a nanofiller had a higher impact on ra 6 4 8 9 nm than cu tnt ac 6 0 6 9 nm the reason can be that cu tnt n nanoparticles contained lower amount of copper which could influence the interactions between nps and cause different agglomeration than in case of cu tnt ac the effect of coagulation bath temperature on the membranes properties can be also seen when analysing their surface porosity in fig s2 the pores on the surface of the neat m1 m4 and m7 membranes marked and calculated using gwyddion software are presented both samples casted at 20 c m1 and m4 exhibited slightly larger pores mean pore size of 7 4 nm and 7 0 respectively and higher porosity 8 1 and 7 8 respectively than the sample fabricated at 10 c 5 9 nm and 6 8 respectively although the porosity was the lowest in case of the lowest non solvent temperature the number of pores was for that membrane the highest fig s2 these findings are in agreement with the literature data li et al 33 proved that the increase of the coagulation bath temperature increases the porosity and pore size of the pes membranes they attributed these results to the changes of solvent water exchange rates the isoelectric points table 2 of the prepared membranes shifted slightly from 2 7 to 2 8 for the neat membranes to 2 9 3 1 for the membranes with the nanofiller indicating that the cu tnts which have the isoelectric point of 4 1 and 3 9 for cu tnt ac and cu tnt n respectively are present on the surface at ph above the isoelectric point the membranes possess a negative charge while at ph ph i their surface is positively charged the highest static water contact angles were observed for the unmodified pes membranes table 2 the water contact angles of the composite membranes were reduced since their hydrophilicity was improved with the addition of cu tnts the most hydrophilic membranes were those prepared from 15 wt of pes table 1 in general the sca increased with the increase of polymer concentration and decrease of temperature of non solvent bath the explanation could be a much denser skin layer of the membranes casted from the dope containing 16 wt of polymer especially formed at 10 c at low surface porosity and smaller pores the flow of water into membrane pores due to capillary forces was inhibited resulting in higher sca values on the opposite in case of the membranes obtained using dopes containing 15 wt of pes the pores were larger which allowed water to infiltrate more easily thus reducing the sca 32 34 to investigate the stability of the membranes the release of cu and ti in 0 85 wt nacl solution at 37 c was evaluated such conditions represented the parameters applied during evaluation of the antibacterial properties of the membranes it was found that no ti was released from the membranes during 7 days of experiments moreover the cu concentration in the solution did not exceed 0 02 mg l 1 after 7 days being circa 4 5 times higher in case of cu tnt ac containing higher amount of cu compared to cu tnt n the obtained results revealed good stability of the prepared membranes containing cu tnts nanocomposites under the applied conditions 3 2 3 water permeability of membranes the pure water permeability of the examined membranes is summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the addition of cu tnts into pes matrix improved the permeability regardless of the applied parameters of membranes fabrication the highest improvement was noted for the membranes obtained with application of 15 wt pes concentration in the casting solution for both modified membranes the permeability increased for about 31 32 in comparison with that of the unmodified m1 the membranes casted from the solutions containing 16 wt of pes exhibited lower permeability compared to the m1 m3 membranes due to a denser structure resulting from a higher polymer content however despite that also the improvement of membranes permeability associated with the incorporation of cu tnts was significantly less remarkable than observed for 15 wt of pes in the casting dope the permeability of m5 and m6 increased for only 9 and 13 respectively compared to m4 further in case of the membranes casted at the coagulation bath temperature of 10 c the cu tnts modification led to a less significant improvement compared to the m1 m3 series reaching 11 12 from the data presented in table 2 it can be also observed that a higher temperature of the coagulation bath contributed to an increase of membranes permeability however the differences between m4 m6 and m7 m9 series were not as large as in case of the membranes prepared with different pes concentration the main explanation can be a much denser skin layer of the membranes fabricated using higher pes concentration the skin formed at the very early stage of the coagulation bath casting dope interaction was limiting further diffusion of non solvent in and solvent out of the underneath layer 35 as a result of the thicker skin the membrane resistance for water transportation increased leading to lower permeate fluxes nevertheless the observed positive effect of the addition of the nanofillers into all types of the pes membranes matrices was caused by hydrophilic properties of the nps and the additional contribution of microchannels in the cu tnts structure that provided new flow paths for water molecules 36 37 these statements are confirmed by the higher hydrophilicity of the modified membranes and the presence of cu tnts agglomerates within their matrices the more hydrophilic modified membranes could attract easily water molecules and facilitate their transport through the pores a slightly higher permeability was observed in case of the membranes modified with cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n which is especially visible for the membranes prepared at the non solvent temperature of 20 c table 2 that can be related to the significantly higher content of copper in cu tnt ac 12 23 wt than in cu tnt n 1 86 wt 37 38 the obtained results demonstrate that the application of composite cu tnts as a nanofiller can be regarded as a method for improvement of membranes permeability 3 2 4 antifouling properties of membranes fig 4 presents changes of permeate fluxes during ultrafiltration of bsa solution through the examined membranes it can be observed that the effect of the cu tnts presence on the antifouling properties of the membranes was dependent on the parameters of their fabrication the permeate fluxes in case of the m2 and m3 modified membranes fig 4a were noticeably lower than that measured for the unmodified m1 during ultrafiltration of bsa solution through the m5 and m6 the permeate fluxes were comparable to that observed for the unmodified m4 membrane fig 4b finally in case of the m8 and m9 membranes prepared at the lowest coagulation bath temperature 10 c the incorporation of cu tnts resulted in an improvement of their antifouling properties from the very beginning of the ultrafiltration of the bsa solution the permeate fluxes through the modified m8 and m9 membranes were higher than that of the neat m7 fig 4c moreover the flux measured for the m8 membrane modified with cu tnt n was the highest amongst the fluxes measured for all the examined membranes after 2 h of experiment the permeate fluxes through the cu tnt n modified membranes reached the values of 153 l m 2 h 1 in case of m8 132 l m 2 h 1 for m2 and 127 l m 2 h 1 for m5 the m2 and m3 were characterized by the highest water permeability from all the examined membranes table 2 thus one explanation for the significant flux decline in their case can be the enhanced deposition of bsa molecules on the membranes surface and within their pores due to the enhanced transport of feed components towards the membrane at higher flux during the initial stage of the process 39 for the m5 and m6 membranes the increase of permeability due to the modification was not as high as in case of m1 m3 series table 2 hence the fouling intensity was less severe the lowest water permeability was obtained for the membranes casted at 10 c which corresponded with their superior resistance to bsa fouling generally the improvement of antifouling properties of the copper modified membranes is attributed to the hydrophilic nature of a cu based nanofiller 38 40 for example nasrollahi et al 38 explained in such a way the positive effect of cuo nps addition into pes membrane on its enhanced fouling resistance however in the present studies the lower fouling intensity in case of m5 and m6 compared to the m2 and m3 was not reflected by the contact angle values table 2 this indicates that some other factors are responsible for the observed results e g relatively lower water permeability and a denser skin layer which prevented from the enhanced deposition of bsa molecules during ultrafiltration process furthermore despite the lowest hydrophilicity of m8 and m9 membranes among all the modified ones these membranes exhibited the best antifouling properties except from the water permeability issue the explanation of the observed results could be related to the membranes surface roughness the ra values of m8 and m9 membranes were relatively low 6 4 and 6 0 nm respectively therefore the deposition of bsa on the membranes surfaces was hindered to some extent in order to evaluate whether the surface charge of the membranes under conditions applied during bsa fouling studies was important for their antifouling properties the zeta potential at ph 6 85 was also determined a more negative zeta potential of the membranes might help to mitigate their fouling by the negatively charged bsa since the deposition of negatively charged foulants is hindered by forming higher electrostatic double layer repulsion 41 however it was found that in the presence of cu tnts in the membranes matrix the zeta potential values were only slightly lower compared to those measured for the neat membranes moreover no noticeable effect of the type of cu tnts on the zeta potential was observed these results confirm again that the permeability closely associated with membranes porosity is an important issue to explain the fouling behaviour as was discussed in section 3 2 2 the membranes casted at higher non solvent temperature exhibited higher porosity and pore size compared to those obtained at 10 c thus relatively higher amount of bsa molecules could enter and block their pores 42 the data presented in fig 4 show that the cu tnt n modified membranes exhibited the highest fouling resistance amongst all the prepared samples these results could be explained by different cu content in the hybrid nps as was already reported in section 3 1 in case of the cu tnt n the cu loading was about six times lower compared to cu tnt ac taking into account that copper ions can form complexes with amino acid residues of the bsa molecules 43 44 the high cu content can promote binding of the foulant with the membrane surface such a phenomenon was much more possible for the membranes modified with cu tnt ac which exhibited stronger binding affinities due to a higher cu content compared to the samples modified with cu tnt n the interactions between metal ions present in cu tnts could contribute to the membrane fouling thus increasing its severity 39 in view of the above it is clear that a balance between high water permeability and fouling resistance is a key issue when designing the cu tnts modified membranes no significant influence of the modification on the rejection of bsa was found for all the examined membranes the retention coefficients ranged from 99 4 0 2 to 99 6 0 2 regardless of membrane preparation conditions 3 3 antibacterial performance of membranes fig 5 shows antibacterial ability of the prepared membranes against s epidermidis and e coli generally it was noticed that the addition of cu tnts into membranes matrices improved their antibacterial properties against both bacteria nevertheless for all examined membranes higher log reduction values were obtained in case of e coli compared to s epidermidis fig 5 moreover no significant differences between the antibacterial activity of the membranes modified with two various types of cu tnts against e coli was observed on the opposite in case of s epidermidis the membranes containing cu tnt ac m3 m6 m9 exhibited significantly higher antimicrobial action compared to cu tnt n regardless of the conditions of membrane fabrication these differences can be attributed to the higher cu content in case of cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n the antibacterial mechanism of cu is not fully understood taking into account that metallic cu is very sensitive to air and that cu oxides are thermodynamically more stable than metallic cu the formation of an oxide layer on the surface of the cu nps typically occurs 45 therefore the antibacterial properties of cu nps should be discussed in terms of the activity of cu oxides taking this into account applerot et al 46 based on their investigations on cuo antibacterial action towards gram negative e coli and gram positive s aureus reported that i smaller nps diameter of circa 2 nm possessed higher antibacterial activity and higher affinity to bacterial cells in case of both examined bacteria compared to large nps circa 800 nm ii cuo nps not only attached to the bacterial surface but also penetrated the cell membrane iii the reduction of bacterial growth was more efficient in case of e coli than s aureus iv cuo nps produced reactive oxygen species ros being responsible for oxidative stress leading to bacterial cells damage furthermore based on analysis of the action of cu2 ions and cuo nps they concluded that the antibacterial properties are mainly due to attachment of cuo nps to bacterial cell and ros production by the cuo nps rather than the action of soluble copper ions both phenomena cause an increase in membrane cell permeability resulting in an uncontrolled transport of cuo nps into the bacterial cell and ultimately cells death 46 however in case of the mixed matrix membranes fabricated in the present study the cu nps were deposited on tnts and additionally fixed in the porous polymeric structure thus the mechanism based on penetration of cu nps is little probable nonetheless since the cu tnts were present on membranes surface as was found from afm analysis the mechanism can be related to a direct contact between cu species and bacteria cells similarly as in case of copper surfaces 47 48 the data presented in fig 5 revealed that the antibacterial action of the prepared membranes was more efficient in case of e coli compared to s epidermidis these results are in agreement with literature reports 46 showing higher inhibition of bacterial growth in case of gram negative compared to gram positive bacteria this phenomenon is commonly explained by the differences in the bacterial cell wall structure the gram negative bacteria do not possess a thick peptidoglycan layer found in gram positive bacteria that could possibly act as a protective layer thus the cell wall destruction due to physical interaction between nps and the cell wall or the penetration of copper ions released from the nps into the cell of gram negative bacteria is facilitated 49 analysis of the results presented in fig 5 revealed also that the membranes preparation conditions pes content non solvent temperature had no significant effect on the antibacterial performance of membranes this can be explained by the same content 1 wt of cu tnt ac or cu tnt n in the two types of membranes 4 conclusions mixed matrix pes membranes fabricated under different conditions and modified with two various cu tnts have been thoroughly studied with particular emphasis on determination of anti bio fouling properties the permeability of the cu tnts modified membranes was higher compared to the neat ones and the difference was especially significant in case of 15 wt pes content in the casting dope a slightly higher pure water permeability was observed in case of the membranes modified with cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n which was explained by a higher cu content in the former nps the fouling by bsa was the most significant in case of the membranes characterized by the highest water permeability i e casted at 20 c from a solution containing 15 wt pes while the lowest permeate flux decline was observed for the membranes exhibiting the lowest permeability i e prepared at 10 c from the casting dope containing 16 wt pes the bsa membrane fouling was slightly higher in case of the membranes containing cu tnt ac compared to cu tnt n which could be explained by a higher binding affinity resulting from complex formation between cu2 in nps present in membranes matrix and amino acid residues of the bsa in case of higher cu content the addition of cu tnts improved the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes a higher biocidal ability was observed for e coli than s epidermidis which was explained by the differences in the cell wall structure moreover the inhibition of the growth of s epidermidis was depended on the kind of cu tnts used for membrane modification being more effective for the nps with higher cu content on the opposite no significant influence of cu amount in the hybrid nps on the antibacterial ability against e coli was observed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

control strategy synthetic wastewater glycogen accumulating organisms gao 1 introduction most batch wastewater treatment plants are controlled statically with fixed treatment steps although other industrial processes have evolved in the field of automation present day industrial wastewater treatment plants have not yet fully benefitted from this evolution industrial wastewater treatment plants mainly implement sensor guided process in chemical of physical treatment steps such as ph control or flow control in biological process dissolved oxygen do sensors are mainly used and only for set point control 1 a main obstacle for dynamically controlled wastewater systems is a lack of understanding and knowledge although many plants around the world implement one or another kind of control the systems often function inadequately data are interpreted incorrectly sensors are maintained poorly or control setting are not adequate the implementation of standardization and a coupling between the design and operation could add an immense benefit 2 to develop a standard dynamic control an extensive understanding of the relationship between the different biological process and the sensor profiles is needed preliminarily research in floccular and aerobic granular sludge ags systems has shown the effectiveness of sensor guided biological processes such as aerobic carbon oxidation

anaerobic step in an ags system enriched with gao has been suggested in different studies filipe et al 13 observed a strong tendency of the ph to increase during the anaerobic uptake of acetate by gao while studying ph profiles in gao sbrs zhang et al 14 observed an increasing ph during the first half of the anaerobic step followed by a ph decrease in the second half of the anaerobic step the change in the ph profile coincided with a depletion of the available volatile fatty acids vfa furthermore zeng et al 18 investigated the hydrogen ion productionrate hpr during anaerobic uptake of vfa by gao the authors concluded that the hpr is influenced by two factors the first factor is the uptake of acetate the uptake of 1 mol acetate consumes 1 mol of hydrogen ions resulting in a negative hpr the second factor is the formation of co2 during the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa dissolved co2 equilibrates with co3 2 resulting in a positive hpr the combination of these two factors result in a net negative hpr or a ph increase during acetate uptake by gaos these finding suggest the possibility of using the ph profile for dynamic control of the anaerobic step in an anaerobic aerobic ags system the control has to terminate the anaerobic step when the ph increase stops the objective of this study was twofold the first objective was to form and retain stable ags in a ph based and an our

systems both work as closed loop control systems sensor profile patterns determine the duration of the anaerobic and aerobic step to utilize the relationship between the anaerobic acetate uptake and the ph profile the anaerobic control calculates the ph moving slope during the anaerobic step the control strategy uses four calculation variables cv cv1 is the sample interval of the sensor value cv2 is the number of sensor values per slope calculation cv3 is the cut off point and is determined by a minimal slope cv4 is the required number of slope values that meet the cut off requirement the control strategy runs through 3 loops to dynamically control the duration of the anaerobic step fig 2 the use of higher cv1 and cv2 values resulted in smooth slope profiles high stability but caused a longer delay on the cut off point low accuracy a cv1 value of 60 s and a cv2 value of 10 resulted in a stable slope profile with an acceptable delay of 21 min set point cv3 and cv4 were kept constant at respectively 0 and 15 from day 1 till day 215 to examine the effect of the delay in the anaerobic period cv4 was decreased to 7 from day 175 200 and to 2 from day 200 225 to rule out premature or

used as described in dobbeleers et al 6 the oxygen level in the reactor was controlled with an on off aeration control keeping the oxygen concentration between 1 and 2 mg l this resulted in an oxygen

spour1 and spour2 when a fixed number spour1 of sequentially calculated our values drop below a minimal set point spour2 the aerobic step was terminated the spour2 was adjusted during the study to obtain a specific oxygen uptake rate between 2 4 mgo2 gmlvss h to rule out premature or overdue terminations of the aerobic step the aerobic dynamical control strategy had a build in minimal and

phase the ags formation and the reactor performance were investigated the manipulated variables were the duration of the anaerobic and aerobic steps the control variables were the ph and the our the duration of the anaerobic step was controlled with the ph sensor and the duration of the aerobic step was controlled with the our 3 1 1 anaerobic step the first 43 days the ph and ph slope profile during the anaerobic step were continuously changing due to an increasing anaerobic cod uptake the influent volume was steadily increased from 500 ml to 1000 ml depending on the evolution of the ph profile the volume was increased when the ph profile showed a negative slope at the end of the anaerobic step indicating a complete uptake of the vfa 13 14 18 during this period the anaerobic step was operated statically 2 h the evolution of the ph slope profile is shown in fig 3 a between day 1 and 20 the ph slope continuously increased during the anaerobic step which is not the expected and reported gao ph profile 14 from day 20 the ph profile exhibited a negative slope at the end of the anaerobic step on day 45 the anaerobic dynamic control was activated and the influent volume was set at 1000 ml fig 3b the anaerobic step duration continuously decreased between day 44 and 61 from day 61 to 102 the duration stabilized at 0 922 0 107 h furthermore the ph slope profile stabilized as shown in fig 3a during the second phase the impact of rapidly varying influent cod on the ags performance was investigated furthermore the flexibility of the anaerobic and aerobic control strategy was studied to study the behaviour of the dynamic anaerobic control the influent cod was varied between day 135 and 175 ranging from approximately 750 1750 mg l the ph slope during the anaerobic step decreased faster with a lower influent cod compared to a higher influent cod fig 4 a this behaviour enabled the dynamic anaerobic control to elongate or shorten the anaerobic step depending on the influent cod fig 4b the influent cod concentration and the anaerobic step duration were linearly correlated with a r2 of 0 564 and a p value of 1 11 10 6 the doc uptake efficiency at point spb when the ph slope switches from positive to negative and at point spc at the end of the anaerobic step remained high during the influent cod variations at respectively 98 0 2 6 and 99 0 1 6 from day 1 till day 175 the anaerobic strategy operated with a built in delay of approximately 21 min two factors cause the delay first the ph running slope calculation only detects a negative slope several minutes after the ph starts decreasing secondly the negative slope detection is maintained for 15 min 15 slope calculations cv4 fig 2 before the anaerobic step is terminated between day 175 and 215 cv4 was systematically reduced first to 7 then to 2 for the remainder of the study this decreased the delay respectively to 13 min then to 9 min meanwhile the influent concentration was kept constant the anaerobic step between day 175 and 215 continued to operate with a similar doc uptake efficiency at spb and spc of respectively 98 4 1 56 and 99 0 1 8 3 1 2 aerobic step fig 5 a shows the our profile at different influent cod concentrations the starting our profiles remain high around 60 mgo2 l h independent of the influent cod as the aerobic step progresses the our profiles of lower influent cods decrease faster than the our profile of higher influent cods the our set point spour1 was kept at 3 our values and set point spour2 was adjusted to maintain a specific oxygen uptake rate between 2 4

correlated with a r2 of 0 262 and a p value of 0 003 3 2 aerobic granular sludge characteristic and performance 3 2 1 granular sludge formation and stability the reactor was seeded with floccular sludge form a domestic wastewater treatment plant the first granule like structure appeared around 40 days the mlvss value decreased steadily during this period from 2 3 to 1 4 g l the particle size distribution dv50 remained unchanged at around 125 μm furthermore microscopic images showed little evolution in the sludge morphology fig 7 a and b yet the sludge settleability improved the svi5 and svi30 decreased from respectively 173 and 83 3 ml g to 61 1 and 39 9 ml g fig 6 between day 40 and 102 the particle size distribution dv50 increased steadily and stabilized after day 74 at 204 3 8 μm the increase in the dv50 coincided with an increase in the mlvss the mlvss stabilized after day 64 at 2 531 0 138 g l the sludge settleability improved the svi5 and svi30 decreased to 36 and 24 ml g day 96 the svi5 svi30 ratio systematically decreased and from day 80 onwards the svi5 svi30 ratio was about 1 fig 6 as seen in the microscopic images the floccular sludge evolved into granular sludge fig 7c and d between day 125 and 175 the influent cod was varied while the ver and the dynamic control were kept unchanged the mean granule size increased during this period to around 500 μm the svi5 and svi30 remained unchanged at respectively 34 4 2 ml g and 29 4 7 ml g after day 175 the influent cod was kept constant at 1250 mg l and the dv50 decreased and stabilized at around 400 μm 3 2 2 cod removal efficiency while feeding the reactor a constant influent cod during phase 1 the effluent cod was on average 30 5 15 mgo2 l with a maximal value of 55 mgo2 l and a removal efficiency of 97 5 1 2 in phase 2 while feeding the reactor a varying influent cod the average effluent cod was 50 2 19 mg l with a maximal value of 96 mg l and a removal efficiency of 96 0 1 6 4 discussion in this study we investigated the use of sensor guided dynamically controlled anaerobic and aerobic steps in a anaerobic aerobic ags sbr fed with a varying acetate based high cod p wastewater little has been reported about the feasibility and performance of dynamically operated ags sbrs kishida et al 9 reported on a conductivity guided anaerobic step in a pao enriched ags sbr with short influent variations de vleeschauwer et al 5 discussed the impact of rapidly varying cod and po4 p influent concentrations on an anaerobic aerobic ags system with a conductivity based anaerobic and our based aerobic step the anaerobic dynamic control successfully controlled the anaerobic duration and ensured a complete cod uptake results from this study indicate the potential of a ph based and our based dynamically controlled ags during the study ags was successfully formed and maintained while achieving a good effluent quality 4 1 aerobic granular sludge formation and stability ags formation is influenced by different factors such as the reactor design reactor operation and wastewater and sludge composition 17 by applying an anaerobic feast and aerobic starvation strategy the selection of slow growing microorganisms with an anaerobic cod uptake capacity was stimulated 12 the combination of a high influent cod p ratio and an anaerobic aerobic reactor strategy stimulated the selection of gao and promoted granulation 11 in this study the role of the shear force on ags formation was reduced by applying a low rpm additionally a long setting time 10 min was applied to minimize the impact of the hydraulic selection pressure the applied selection pressure was approximatly 0 15m h a possible relation was observed between the ags particle size distribution and the reactor feeding strategy with a constant influent cod the particle size distribution stabilized after 80 days when the influent cod was varied the dv50 increased rapidly from 200 μm to 500 μm within 14 days the dv50 remained at around 500 μm during the influent cod variations afterwards the influent cod was maintained at 1250 mg l and the dv50 decreased to around 400 μm the evolution of the granules size and the applied feeding strategy possibly indicates an important role of the influent cod concentration on the granule particle size distribution this was possibly due to a higher cod concentration gradient during the anaerobic step 4 2 ph based anaerobic dynamic control this study illustrates the effectiveness of a ph based dynamically controlled anaerobic step in a gao anaerobic aerobic ags system after an adjustment period of 45 days the anaerobic dynamic control shortened the anaerobic step due to an increasing anaerobic cod uptake rate this was possibly linked to the adaptation of the sludge to the wastewater composition throughout the study the anaerobic dynamic control system guaranteed a maximal cod uptake during the anaerobic step ensuring no cod leaked to the subsequent aerobic phase even when the influent cod concentrations were varied additionally the anaerobic set points cv1 cv2 cv3 and cv4 could be kept constant independent from the sludge concentration because the control strategy is only influenced by the ion concentration in the bulk solution and not by the sludge concentration this made the control strategy very easy to use this is not the case for the aerobic set point spour2 as the our is influenced by the sludge concentration 3 it should be pointed out that from day 45 till day 175 the anaerobic step was stopped with a delay of approximately 21 min after the termination of the doc uptake two factors caused this delay first the ph running slope calculation only detected a negative slope several minutes after the ph started decreasing secondly to obtain an accurate termination the negative slope detection was maintained for 15 min before the anaerobic step was stopped the impact of the reduction of this delay was investigated while feeding the reactor a constant cod concentration the results of the study indicate that the delay could be reduced to approximately 9 min without having any impact on the ags stability or the reactor performance 4 3 our based aerobic dynamic control this study confirms the reported applicability of the our as a dynamic control tool to control the duration of the aerobic step in wastewater treatment 3 4 the our mgo2 l h is a sludge concentration dependent unit the our set point needs to be altered when the sludge mlss increases or decreases caluwé et al 3 adjusted the minimal our set point to ensure a minimal sour between 3 8 and 2 5 mgo2 gmlss h in this study the our set points were also adjusted to ensure a minimal sour between 2 4 mgo2 gmlss h the incorporation of an online mlss sensor a turbidity sensor could automate the needed adjustments of the our set point 5 conclusion ags can be successfully formed and retained in an anaerobic aerobic reactor dynamically operated based on the ph and our depending on the ags activity and the influent cod concentration the anaerobic and aerobic step durations varied to ensure a complete anaerobic uptake and aerobic oxidation of the influent cod based on these findings together with the earlier reported combined anaerobic aerobic strategy for ags performing enhanced biological phosphate removal 5 we now have a set of control strategies to monitor and control anaerobic aerobic ags reactors fed with high or low cod p wastewater with variable influent cod the sensors used ph do and conductivity are inexpensive and robust furthermore these finding add to the existing array of biological control strategies in wastewater treatments aerobic carbon oxidation nitrification denitrification and anaerobic cod uptake additional studies are needed to study the effect of gao pao competition especially in systems fed with wastewater with intermediate cod p ratios that may promote both gao and pao further research will focus in the application of the different control systems during the treatment of real variable industrial wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14207,this study developed a control system using ph and do sensors to dynamically control an aerobic granular sludge ags reactor while varying the influent chemical oxygen demand cod with a high cod

the aerobic step ags was successfully formed and retained for 220 days the sludge volume index svi5 and svi30 remained below 50 ml g and the average granule size dv50 increased to approximately 500 μm the anaerobic and aerobic step durations were effectively controlled guaranteeing 1 an optimal anaerobic cod uptake which is key to granulation and 2 a good effluent quality keywords anaerobic dynamic control strategy synthetic wastewater glycogen accumulating organisms gao 1 introduction most batch wastewater treatment plants are controlled statically with fixed treatment steps although other industrial processes have evolved in the field of automation present day industrial wastewater treatment plants have not yet fully benefitted from this evolution industrial wastewater treatment plants mainly implement sensor guided process in chemical of physical treatment steps such as ph control or flow control in biological process dissolved oxygen do sensors are mainly used and only for set point control 1 a main obstacle for dynamically controlled wastewater systems is a lack of understanding and knowledge although many plants around the world implement one or another kind of control the systems often function inadequately data are interpreted incorrectly sensors are maintained poorly or control setting are not adequate the implementation of standardization and a coupling between the design and operation could add an immense benefit 2 to develop a standard dynamic control an extensive understanding of the relationship between the different biological process and the sensor profiles is needed preliminarily research in floccular and aerobic granular sludge ags systems has shown the effectiveness of sensor guided biological processes such as aerobic carbon oxidation nitrification denitrification and anaerobic cod uptake in a floccular or granular sequencing batch reactor sbr the aerobic step duration can be controlled using the oxygen uptake rate our 3 5 to

biological phosphorus removal ebpr ags reactor treating low cod p wastewater in anaerobic aerobic ags systems treating high cod p wastewater glycogen accumulating organisms gao are reported to be the

cell growth by applying an anaerobic feast and aerobic famine strategy gao can be selected which is an important requirement for ags formation 11 12 the potential of a ph based dynamically controlled anaerobic step in an ags system enriched with gao has been suggested in different studies filipe et al 13 observed a strong tendency of the ph to increase during the anaerobic uptake of acetate by gao while studying ph profiles in gao sbrs zhang et al 14 observed an increasing ph during the first half of the anaerobic step followed by a ph decrease in the second half of the anaerobic step the change in the ph profile coincided with a depletion of the available volatile fatty acids vfa furthermore zeng et al 18 investigated the hydrogen ion productionrate hpr during anaerobic uptake of vfa by gao the authors concluded that the hpr is influenced by two factors the first factor is the uptake of acetate the uptake of 1 mol acetate consumes 1 mol of hydrogen ions resulting in a negative hpr the second factor is the formation of co2 during the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa dissolved co2 equilibrates with co3 2 resulting in a positive hpr the combination of these two factors result in a net negative hpr or a ph increase during acetate uptake by gaos these finding suggest the possibility of using the ph profile for dynamic control of the anaerobic step in an anaerobic aerobic ags system the control has to terminate the anaerobic step when the ph increase stops the objective of this study was twofold the first objective was to form and retain stable ags in a ph based and an our based dynamically controlled anaerobic aerobic ags system fed with high cod p wastewater the second objective was to investigate the performance and effectiveness of the dynamic control system while rapidly varying the influent cod concentration the ph and oxygen uptake rate were the control variables and the anaerobic and aerobic step duration were the manipulated variables of the control 2

control strategy runs through 3 loops to dynamically control the duration of the anaerobic step fig 2 the use of higher cv1 and cv2 values resulted in smooth slope profiles high stability but caused a longer delay on the cut off point low accuracy a cv1 value of 60 s and a cv2 value of 10 resulted in a stable slope profile with an acceptable delay of 21 min set point cv3 and cv4 were kept constant at respectively 0 and 15 from day 1 till day 215 to examine the effect of the delay in the anaerobic period cv4 was decreased to 7 from day 175 200 and to 2 from day 200 225 to rule out premature or

removal efficiency while feeding the reactor a constant influent cod during phase 1 the effluent cod was on average 30 5 15 mgo2 l with a maximal value of 55 mgo2 l and a removal efficiency of 97 5 1 2 in phase 2 while feeding the reactor a varying influent cod the average effluent cod was 50 2 19 mg l with a maximal value of 96 mg l and a removal efficiency of 96 0 1 6 4 discussion in this study we investigated the use of sensor guided dynamically controlled anaerobic and aerobic steps in a anaerobic aerobic ags sbr fed with a varying acetate based high cod p wastewater little has been reported about the feasibility and performance of dynamically operated ags sbrs kishida et al 9 reported on a conductivity guided anaerobic step in a pao enriched ags sbr with short influent variations de vleeschauwer et al 5 discussed the impact of rapidly varying cod and po4 p influent concentrations on an anaerobic aerobic ags system with a conductivity based anaerobic and our based aerobic step the anaerobic dynamic control successfully controlled the anaerobic duration and ensured a complete cod uptake results from this study indicate the potential of a ph based and our based dynamically controlled ags during the study ags was successfully formed and maintained while achieving a good effluent quality 4 1 aerobic granular sludge formation and stability ags formation is influenced by different factors such as the reactor design reactor operation and wastewater and sludge composition 17 by applying an anaerobic feast and aerobic starvation strategy the selection of slow growing microorganisms with an anaerobic cod uptake capacity was stimulated 12 the combination of a high influent cod p ratio and an anaerobic aerobic reactor strategy stimulated the selection of gao and promoted granulation 11 in this study the role of the shear force on ags formation was reduced by applying a low rpm additionally a long setting time 10 min was applied to minimize the impact of the hydraulic selection pressure the applied selection pressure was approximatly 0 15m h a possible relation was observed between the ags particle size distribution and the reactor feeding strategy with a constant influent cod the particle size distribution stabilized after 80 days when the influent cod was varied the dv50 increased rapidly from 200 μm to 500 μm within 14 days the dv50 remained at around 500 μm during the influent cod variations afterwards the influent cod was maintained at 1250 mg l and the dv50 decreased to around 400 μm the evolution of the granules size and the applied feeding strategy possibly indicates an important role of the influent cod concentration on the granule particle size distribution this was possibly due to a higher cod concentration gradient during the anaerobic step 4 2 ph based anaerobic dynamic control this study illustrates the effectiveness of a ph based dynamically controlled anaerobic step in a gao anaerobic aerobic ags system after an adjustment period of 45 days the anaerobic dynamic control shortened the anaerobic step due to an increasing anaerobic cod uptake rate this was possibly linked to the adaptation of the sludge to the wastewater composition throughout the study the anaerobic dynamic control system guaranteed a maximal cod uptake during the anaerobic step ensuring no cod leaked to the subsequent aerobic phase even when the influent cod concentrations were varied additionally the anaerobic set points cv1 cv2 cv3 and cv4 could be kept constant independent from the sludge concentration because the control strategy is only influenced by the ion concentration in the bulk solution and not by the sludge concentration this made the control strategy very easy to use this is not the case for the aerobic set point spour2 as the our is influenced by the sludge concentration 3 it should be pointed out that from day 45 till day 175 the anaerobic step was stopped with a delay of approximately 21 min after the termination of the doc uptake two factors caused this delay first the ph running slope calculation only detected a negative slope several minutes after the ph started decreasing secondly to obtain an accurate termination the negative slope detection was maintained for 15 min before the anaerobic step was stopped the impact of the reduction of this delay was investigated while feeding the reactor a constant cod concentration the results of the study indicate that the delay could be reduced to approximately 9 min without having any impact on the ags stability or the reactor performance 4 3 our based aerobic dynamic control this study confirms the reported applicability of the our as a dynamic control tool to control the duration of the aerobic step in wastewater treatment 3 4 the our mgo2 l h is a sludge concentration dependent unit the our set point needs to be altered when the sludge mlss increases or decreases caluwé et al 3 adjusted the minimal our set point to ensure a minimal sour between 3 8 and 2 5 mgo2 gmlss h in this study the our set points were also adjusted to ensure a minimal sour between 2 4 mgo2 gmlss h the incorporation of an online mlss sensor a turbidity sensor could automate the needed adjustments of the our set point 5 conclusion ags can be successfully formed and retained in an anaerobic aerobic reactor dynamically operated based on the ph and our depending on the ags activity and the influent cod concentration the anaerobic and aerobic step durations varied to ensure a complete anaerobic uptake and aerobic oxidation of the influent cod based on these findings together with the earlier reported combined anaerobic aerobic strategy for ags performing enhanced biological phosphate removal 5 we now have a set of control strategies to monitor and control anaerobic aerobic ags reactors fed with high or low cod p wastewater with variable influent cod the sensors used ph do and conductivity are inexpensive and robust furthermore these finding add to the existing array of biological control strategies in wastewater treatments aerobic carbon oxidation nitrification denitrification and anaerobic cod uptake additional studies are needed to study the effect of gao pao competition especially in systems fed with wastewater with intermediate cod p ratios that may promote both gao and pao further research will focus in the application of the

the water flux and selectivity of the fo membranes so that the j w for the tfn 0 25 containing 250 ppm of fillers in the fo mode was obtained 59 3 lmh using 1 m nacl as a draw solution and deionized water as feed solution which was around 102 greater than with the tfc membrane at the same time the selectivity was about 1 5 times those of the control membrane without gqds mof particles which is one of the most critical goals in membrane designing keywords forward osmosis fo desalination membrane thin film nanocomposite tfn metal organic framework mof gqds uio 66 nh2 1 introduction desalination is achieving popularity as an alternative water supply resource as many municipalities and utilities worldwide are facing developing population growth pressures shortage of proper local water resources and more forceful water quality laws 1 2 water desalination consists of separation processes that provide new freshwater from seawater and other water sources which are too saline for use several desalting processes and systems were considered that tried to reduce the cost of the water produced and improve process sustainability which one of them is forward osmosis process 3 4 forward osmosis fo as a novel membrane technology is a process that utilizes osmotic pressure to drive water from contaminated or saline water feed solution over a semi permeable membrane that preserves the dissolved solutes 5 6 this flux is driven by osmotic pressure produced by a draw solution or osmotic agent this osmotic separation requires little energy only the pumping of fluids to the membrane element as it occurs automatically due to the trend toward thermodynamic equilibrium therefore it consumes low amounts of energy and materials and has an associated important and frequently appreciated impact on the environment 7 industrial applications of fo membranes are restricted due to their high fouling tendency low hydrophilicity and poor performance 8 therefore to obtain high water flux fo membranes without loss of selectivity at the forward osmosis process typically most fo membranes have been formed using interfacial polymerization ip method to construct thin film composite tfc structures with a particular layer on the top surface of support 9 10 metal organic frameworks mofs as a new class of crystalline porous inorganic organic hybrid materials are a prominent component for this purpose 11 12 herein first the uio 66 nh2 metal organic frameworks mofs were modified with graphene quantum dots gqds to facilitate the water attraction on mof surface as well as improve porosity and hydrophilicity of the top surface of the forward osmosis fo membranes then new thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes were prepared through modifying the tfc membranes with the loading of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites on polyamide pa layer on the top surface of the pes membranes the effects of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites on hydrophilicity surface porosity and morphology of the membranes were studied the fo performance of the prepared membranes in fo was evaluated in terms of water flux reverse solute flux and anti fouling properties 2 experimental 2 1 materials and

nanocrystals were prepared according to the previously reported procedures 13 14 in brief zirconium chloride 2 aminoterephthalic acid and dmf were mixed with the composition of 0 46 g zrcl4 0 36 g bdc nh2 10 ml dmf after stirring for 30 min at room temperature the resulting homogeneous solution was transferred into a 100 ml teﬂon lined autoclave sealed and maintained at 110 c for 24 h next the resulting yellow powder was collected by centrifuging and then re dispersed in 10 ml fresh dmf for 2 h the final product was isolated by centrifugation washed with ethanol 3 20 ml and dried at 150 c under reduced pressure for 12 h 2 3 preparation of graphene quantum dots gqds gqds were prepared by directly pyrolyzing of citric acid fig 1 according to a literature procedure 15 briefly in a 5 ml beaker 2 g of citric acid was heated at 200 c in an oven for 30 min a few minutes later the melted citric acid undergoes a color change from colorless to pale yellow and finally turns to orange after 30 min which confirms the formation of gqds the resulting viscous liquid was added slowly to 100 ml of 10 mg ml naoh solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature to neutralize the solution eventually the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to yield gqds solids 2 4 synthesis of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites for the synthesis of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites first the acyl chloride functionalized graphene quantum dots gqds cocl were synthesized as follows in a round bottom flask containing 10 ml thionyl chloride 0 1 g of gqds was added and heated at reflux condition 80 c for 24 h under argon atmosphere after completion of the reaction the excess socl2 solution was removed by blowing ar gas inside the flask subsequently the obtained solids were dispersed in 20 ml ch2cl2 and marked as a solution meanwhile solution b was prepared by dispersing of 0 2 g uio 66 nh2 in 20 ml ch2cl2 for 15 min and subsequently adding 1 ml of et3n after both solutions were prepared the solution a was added drop by drop to the latter solution b under vigorously stirring and refluxed for 24 h the solid product was collected by centrifuging washed three times with ch2cl2 and water 3 20 ml respectively and dried 24 h at room temperature the synthesis process of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites is illustrated in fig 1 2 5 preparation of polyethersulfone pes substrate flat sheet pes substrate was fabricated by using a casting solution containing 2 g pes dissolved in 5 6 g peg and 8 4 g dmf after keeping a casting solution in the open atmosphere for 24 h for removing the trapped air bubbles the dope solution was poured on a clean glass plate and cast using a casting knife setting at a gate height of 120 μm afterward the glass plate was immersed in a water bath to initiate phase inversion the obtained pes substrates were kept in deionized di before any utilization 2 6 preparation of the tfc and tfn membranes the thin ﬁlm pa layer of fo membranes was formed at the top surfaces of hand cast pes substrates by in situ interfacial polymerization ip of aqueous mpd and organic tmc monomers solutions the preparation process is shown in fig 2 briefly for tfc membranes synthesis the top surface of pes substrate was treated with aqueous mpd 2 wt solution for 2 min and after removing of the excess solution of mpd from the surface the treated membrane was reacted with organic tmc 0 15 wt solution for 1 min the resultant membrane dried shortly in the air and then heated in a 60 c for 10 min to create a dense polyamide layer a similar procedure was performed for the preparation of tfn membranes and the prepared membranes regarding the filler concentration in mpd solution 100 200 250 and 500 ppm were labeled as tfn 0 1 tfn 0 2 tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 respectively all the prepared fo membranes were kept in fresh di water before use 2 7 instruments ft ir spectra were obtained with an unicam matson1000 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer in kbr pellets 400 4000 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd patterns were recorded by xpert pro diffractometer system mpd panalytical company using a cu ka radiation source the morphology and chemical compositions of the membranes were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem mira3 tescan xmu model equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds before taking of fe sem images all samples fractured to small fragments under liquid nitrogen and then coated with a uniform thin gold layer furthermore the surface roughness of tfc and tfns membranes were investigated by atomic force microscope afm entegra afmnt mdt model before the measurement first the membranes were fixed on a glass slides by using double sided tape and then 4 μm 4 μm areas were scanned at a rate of 0 5 hz the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane samples was obtained at 25 c by contact angle goniometer ezdiad bardash e fars technology co ca es10 model for this purpose samples were prepared similar to the afm measurements method and subsequently the contact angle between the water and membrane surface was measured at five different points of each sample 2 8 fo performance the membrane s performance in fo processes was studied by using a lab scale fo setup at room temperature all prepared membranes were assayed at two fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro modes which were the active polyamide layer of the membrane in contact with the feed and draw solution al fs and al ds respectively the 0 5 m 1 m 1 5 m and 2 m nacl solutions and di water were applied as the draw and feed solution respectively that flowed counter currently on each side of the membrane with a flow rate of 200 ml min the feed conductivity was measured by a calibrated conductometer after permeation time of 15 min water flux j w lm 2 h 1 abbreviated as lmh and salt reverse flux j s gm 2 h 1 abbreviated as gmh were calculated using the following equations 1 j w δ v a m δ t 2 j s c f v f c i v i a m δ t where δ v l represents the volume of the permeated water through the membrane over a permeation time of δ t h a m represent the membrane s effective area m2 c f and c i represents the final and initial concentration of nacl at the feed solution side respectively v f and v i represents the final and initial feed volumes respectively the pure water permeability coefficient a lm 2 h 1 bar 1 and the salt permeability coefficient b lm 2 h 1 of all samples including tfc and tfns were determined by using a single fo experiment method that already proposed by tirafferi et al 16 in this method first j w and j s values determine under four successive steps of single fo experiment at unique draw solution concentration and then mentioned parameters are calculated by fitting the obtained j w and j s values to the corresponding fo transport equations through a least squares non linear regression 2 9 fo fouling experiment the anti fouling properties of the tfc tfn 0 1 and tfn 0 25 membranes were assessed by dynamic fouling experiments in a lab scale fo setup under al fs mode the 1 m nacl aqueous solution and simulated wastewater were employed as the fs and ds respectively synthetic wastewater was prepared according to a literature procedure by dissolving 0 5 mm cacl2 0 61 mm mgso4 9 20 mm nacl 0 5 mm nahco3 0 45 mm kh2po4 and 0 93 mm nh4cl 17 and 500 mg l bsa in di water was used as the organic foulant after cleaning the fo system by circulating di water on both feed and draw sides for about 30 min baseline water flux j 0 was obtained with the fo operation condition without bsa contaminant to eliminate dilution of draw solution afterward for determining the dynamic water flux j t bsa with a concentration of 500 mg l was added to the fs to start fouling phenomenon all fouling experiments were kept running for 6 5 h in room temperature and the j t j 0 ratio was taken with a 10 min interval during the fouling test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites and fo membranes the chemical structure of the uio 66 nh2 gqds and gqds uio 66 nh2 was studied using ftir spectroscopy and the spectra are shown in fig 3 b for gqds the absorptions at 1604 1573 overlapped together 1397 and 1258 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibration of cc asymmetrical stretching of coo symmetrical stretching of coo and bending vibration of coh respectively moreover wideband centered at 3396 cm 1 belong to oh vibration and the absorption bands located at 1077 cm 1 corresponding to the coh stretching vibration 15 18 19 as this figure shows the ftir spectrum of uio 66 nh2 particles significantly differences from the free 2 aminoterephthalic acid ligand the observed characteristic peak at 3322 and 3456 cm 1 which observes in both spectra attributing to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the primary amine respectively the vibrational modes of the νc n νas coo νs coo and νaromatic c c bonds could also be observed at 1258 1384 1571 1433 and 1503 cm 1 respectively 20 22 moreover downshift in the vibrational frequency of the co bond from 1687 to 1571 cm 1 at the uio 66 nh2 spectrum in comparison to bdc nh2 corroborate the successful synthesis of the uio 66 nh2 nanocrystals the gqds mof composites spectrum demonstrated the characteristic peaks of the uio 66 nh2 in the region of 400 1000 cm 1 and 3000 4000 cm 1 the new absorption peaks found at 1077 and 2987 cm 1 can be attributed to the νc oh and ν c h respectively which also observe in gqds spectrum and proves the effective incorporation of gqds in uio 66 nh2 furthermore comparison of the uio 66 nh2 and gqds mof spectra shows little decrease in the intensity of the carbonyl stretching ν c o 1659 cm 1 of amide group at gqds mof spectrum which confirms the replacing of the gqds and water molecules with existing dmf molecules in the structure 23 so it proves the successful insertion of the gqds in mofs structure it should be noted that due to the formation of new amide bond co nh between mof particles and gqds this peak doesn t eliminate perfectly in the gqds mof spectrum the morphology of the gqds uio 66 nh2 composites was investigated by fe sem as seen in fig 3a the gqds uio 66 nh2 particles display octahedral like morphology with a size of around 500 nm furthermore the separatability of the synthesized composites is evident in these images the powder xrd patterns of gqds gqds uio 66 nh2 synthesized and simulated uio 66 nh2 are shown in fig 3c the broad peak from 10 40 in the pxrd pattern of gqds indicates that the controlled carbonization of citric acid will produce an amorphous graphite structure and matched well with the reported literature 15 24 the excellent agreement between the pxrd patterns of the synthesized and simulated uio 66 nh2 and also its reported structure in the literature indicates the similarity of the crystalline structure of these materials and also suggests the successful synthesis of the mofs 25 27 moreover the resemblance of the gqds uio 66 nh2 pattern to the pristine uio 66nh2 pattern indicating that the incorporation of gqds did not disturb the uio 66 nh2 crystal structure fig 4 features the ftir spectra of the pes substrate tfc and tfn membranes strong bands at the wavenumbers of 1578 1489 1317 1240 and 1157 cm 1 are due to the presence of the ν benzene ring ν c c ν as c so2 c ν c o c ν s c so2 c modes of the pes support layer which are evident in all conducted ftir analysis 28 29 appearing two new peaks at around 1653 and 1542 cm 1 in composites membranes spectra tfc and tfns which are respectively attributed to the carbonyl stretching ν c o and amine bending δn h vibrations of the amide group indicates the successful formation of polyamide layer over the pes substrate 30 31 considering that the tfc and tfn membranes also contain a primary and secondary amines group at the pa layer the weak broad characteristic peak at 3370 3500 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching modes of nh bonding due to the low concentration of fillers at the pa active layer no apparent differences were found between the ft ir spectra of modified and unmodified membranes fig 5 a and b illustrate the pxrd patterns of all prepared membranes the broad peak from 10 24 that observes in all patterns is ascribed to the amorphous polyamide layer due to the low loading percentage of modifier particles at the pa layer the characteristic peaks of inserted fillers could not be detected in pxrd patterns of tfn membranes with the loading of 100 200 ppm appearing a weak peak at about 2θ 7 3 in the tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 patterns which attributed to 111 plane of uio 66 nh2 nanocrystals again conﬁrming the successful incorporation of gqds mof composites into the pa active layer fig 6 presents the water contact angle ca data of the pristine and modified membranes with different contents of gqds mof particles at room temperature after stabilization the water ca analysis was done to investigate the influence of fillers incorporation on surface hydrophilicity of the fo membranes the results show that the water ca of the modified fo membranes was remarkably decreased by increasing the percentage of particle loading in other words the chemical composition of the rejection layer was affected by incorporated particles the water contact angle of the unmodified fo membrane was 73 tfc which after modiﬁcation its value signiﬁcantly decreased to 45 tfn 0 5 this reduction in ca value verifies the presence of hydrophilic particles compared to the modified membranes with lower contents of fillers 0 250 ppm the higher surface hydrophilicity of the tfn 0 5 also might be due to its rougher surface these highly hydrophilic surfaces can facilitate the transportation of water molecules through the membrane and consequently improves water permeability the quantitative surface roughness of the tfc and tfn membranes were investigated by afm analysis and the obtained average roughness parameter ra is presented in fig 6 afm analysis depicts that the surface roughness of fo membranes can be altered by gqds mof composites loading and also proves the successful decoration of particles between the pa rejection layer and the porous support layer as the 3d afm images show in fig 7 compared to the control membrane with the increase in the concentration of fillers at the active layer from 0 to 250 ppm the ridge and valley structure elevation of the membranes got shorter which means the formation of smoother polyamide layer on the top surface of the pes substrate owing to the aggregation of gqds mof nanocrystals at higher loading percentages which top surface fe sem images corroborate it fig 8 the ra value increases for tfn 0 5 membrane and a rougher surface forms in this case the tfn 0 25 with the ra value of 43 86 nm possessed the lowest average roughness parameter among the all analyzed membrane which is remarkably lower than that of the pristine tfc membrane 75 48 nm the fe sem analysis was performed to investigate the morphological structure of the pa rejection layer and porous pes substrate of the prepared membranes the top surface and cross sectional fe sem images of tfc and tfn membranes are exhibited in fig 8 observation of the typical ridge and valley morphology of the polyamide layer in top surface images of all membranes confirms the successful formation of the pa active layer on a porous pes substrate the diffusion speed of mpd monomers into the organic phase impressed by the fillers concentration at aqueous phase and membranes with a high loading percentage of gqds mof possessing a thinner pa layer 32 33 hence in some areas of the tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 membranes specified points in fig 8d and e the pores of the support layer are apparent below the pa layer the afm analysis in a good agreement with this fact in tfn 0 25 case but aggregating of the fillers in the tfn 0 5 membrane makes it impossible to see this decrease in surface roughness furthermore the bright points at modified membrane surfaces belong to the mof nanocrystals because these images were recorded by the backscattered electron image detector and heavy zr metal have strong backscatter in compared to light elements of the linker pes substrate and pa layer besides the surface chemical composition of the modified and unmodified membranes was studied by eds analysis and the corresponding spectra are demonstrated in fig 8 the zr peak in all modified membranes eds spectra reveals the presence of mof particles at the pa layer even though the eds technique cannot be used to quantify the filler concentration as shown in fig 8 it is evident that the wt of zr increased at higher loading of gqds mof composites the eds elemental mapping of the tfc tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 are shown in fig 9 more n atoms in the eds mapping of the pristine and tfn 0 25 membranes fig 9a and b were observed compared to the tfn 0 5 membrane fig 9c that is because of the thinner and incomplete formation of pa active layer over the entire surface of pes substrate cross sectional fe sem images show finger like structures of the porous pes substrate which is desirable to reduce the internal concentration polarization icp of the fo membranes 3 2 osmotic performance and intrinsic separation properties of membranes fo performance of all membranes including pristine tfc and modified membranes with different loading of synthesized particles was appraised under the fo and pro modes fig 10 a and b feature the water ﬂux and reverse salt ﬂux of fo membranes at a 1 m concentration of nacl salt as draw solution and di water as feed solution as depicted all tfn membranes exhibited higher water flux j w than that of the control membrane in both al fs and al ds tested modes this growth in water ﬂux charts arises from the hydrophilic nature of the gqds uio 66 nh2 composites fig 6 and extra channels for water transportation amidst the membrane that provides by mof particles it should be noted that due to less internal concentration polarization icp all samples in al ds mode owning higher j w values than al fs mode 34 the water flux of tfn membranes improves by raising the concentration of the filler and the best result belongs to tfn 0 25 with a dosage of 250 ppm 59 26 and 85 3 lmh at fo and pro modes respectively it can be seen from fig 10b that as the concentration of the particles increases from 0 to 250 ppm the reverse salt ﬂux rises from 13 97 to 19 08 gmh and from 27 26 to 36 80 gmh in al fs and al ds modes respectively contrary to the expectation that uio 66 nh2 nanocrystals have a specific pore window size and the transportation of the hydrated na and cl ions should be restricted by these pores 35 36 the results show higher reverse solute ﬂux for tfn membranes with a higher content of fillers tfn 0 2 tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 this contradiction may be attributed to defects at the pa layer formation especially in the tfn 0 5 sample that the nitrogen element mapping of fig 9c shows this very well moreover particles aggregation fig 7e that can form new nonselective pores between the pa layer and fillers is the other possible reason compared to tfc and other modified membranes decrease in j s value of the tfn 0 1 membrane can be attributed to the presence of mofs embedded in the polyamide layer because similar to the tfc membrane the formation of a polyamide layer also occurs completely in the tfn 0 1 membrane and the used mofs have nanometer sized cavities with windows size smaller than a diameter of hydrated na and cl ions that limited their permeability through membranes formation of an almost defect free pa layer in the tfn 0 1 membrane is stemmed from the presence of linker and gqds in the gqds mof structure which can cause more and better interactions with the pa matrix and decrease the forming of non selective cavities between the filler and polymer phase this advantage helps the modified tfn 0 1 membrane to achieve a high water flux without selectivity loss 37 the effect of this compatibility is well observed at low loading tfn 0 1 but at higher loading due to particle aggregation and thus creating unwanted cavities it is not observed it should be mentioned that the js and jw values for the tfn 0 5 membrane are lower than for the tfn 0 25 this trend is probably due to the partial filling of the substrate s pores by the imported modifier particles which can act as a barrier and reduce the permeability speed of water and salt the reverse salt ﬂux water ﬂux ratio of all membrane samples is demonstrated in fig 11 this ratio which known as selectivity of forward osmosis membranes is one of the most important parameters of fo membranes and generally high selective membranes show a low j s j w value compared with the pristine tfc membrane the j s j w value of all tfn membranes is less than 0 35 g l at fo mode despite the high j s values these low ratios indicating that incorporation of gqds mof composites in the pa active layer significantly improve the selectivity of the modified membranes the same trend was observed in the pro mode according to fig 11 the tfn 0 25 membrane with j s j w ratio of 0 32 and 0 43 g l exhibits the best selectivity among all tested membranes at the fo and pro modes respectively fig 12 show water ﬂux values of the tfc and tfn 0 25 membranes as a function of draw solution concentration in both al ds and al fs modes although in all cases the j w value increase with enhancing of ds concentration due to the higher osmotic pressure difference on the two sides of the membrane fig 12 increment at pro mode is significantly higher than fo mode because of lower icp as can be seen there is a near linear relation between water flux growth and ds concentration simultaneously reverse solute permeation from ds to fs increases because of higher salt concentration gradient through the rejection layer of membranes fig 13 the active layer transport properties including water permeability coefficient a and salt permeability coefficient b of the fo membranes were determined by the fo based protocol and the results are reported in table 1 as shown the a values for all modified membranes are appreciably higher than those of the tfc unmodified membrane at the same time the salt permeability coefficient of the tfn membranes slightly increases compared to the pristine tfc membrane despite these high values the modiﬁed membrane shows a relatively lower b a ratio than the tfc membrane and maintaining the selectivity at high values for instance the a b and b avalues for the tfn 0 25 membrane are 4 88 lmh bar 1 1 356 lmh and 0 28 bar respectively which are significantly different from the obtained values for tfc membrane 2 23 lmh bar 1 0 868 lmh and 0 39 bar respectively in all experiments the coefficients of determination for both water and salt fluxes r w 2 and rs 2 is greater than 0 95 which are consistent with recommended values 16 3 3 antifouling characteristic of the membranes the anti fouling properties of the tfc tfn 0 1 and tfn 0 25 membranes were investigated in the presence of bsa as a model foulant and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 14 it can be seen that all tested membranes show water flux decline with different degrees during the experiment the control membrane tfc has the most significant water flux decline which indicates a higher fouling propensity of this membrane in comparison to the tfc membrane the better anti fouling performance of the modified membranes can be attributed to the more hydrophilic and smoother surface of these membranes 38 39 higher surface wettability of the tfn 0 1 and tfn 0 25 membranes as shown in fig 6 is desirable for strongly binding of water molecules to these hydrophilic surfaces especially in tfn 0 25 and formation of a thin water layer on their surfaces which can act as a barrier to prevent the growth of hydrophobic organic contaminants on the membrane surface besides the smoother surface of gqds mof incorporated membranes can minimize membrane fouling through lowering adhesion sites on the membrane surface thus the accumulation of foulants in valley structures gets low and antifouling property of the membrane improves due to having a lower water ca and ra value the tfn 0 25 membrane displays the smallest deviation from the initial water flux and lower membrane fouling tendency between the all tested membranes after the continuous 6 5 h fouling test the tfn 0 25 membrane with the water flux decline of 18 exhibits the best anti fouling performance among evaluated membranes table 2 compares the fo performance of tfc and tfn 0 25 membranes in the present study with other reported membranes containing various fillers the considerable water flux and comparable selectivity of the tfn 0 25 membrane indicate that porous and hydrophilic particles are useful components for introducing at the pa layer the observed difference in the water flux values for the control tfc membranes can be attributed to the different preparation conditions which affect the internal concentration polarization icp by altering the structural parameter s thickness tortuosity porosity and therefore effects on the fo water flux different preparation conditions include i the absence of the pore former 43 44 ii use of low loading percentages of additives 40 42 which causes forming a lower porous support layer than present work resulting higher value of the s parameter and iii formation of straight needle like canals without tortuosity which reduces the structural parameter lower than the previously reported work 40 44 4 conclusion the gqds uio 66 nh2 composites were synthesized successfully and decorated at the polyamide rejection layer during the in situ interfacial polymerization step the inserted fillers change the hydrophilicity morphology thickness and roughness properties of the pa selective layer which subsequently affects the water permeability selectivity and anti fouling properties of the membranes in summary the incorporating of synthesized gqds mof composites at pa active layer has following advantages i augments the water ﬂux due to supplying extra channels for transportation of water molecules and presence of hydrophilic mofs and gqds at filler structure ii improves the selectivity because of having a pore aperture size smaller than a diameter of hydrated na and cl ions and iii enhance compatibility with the polyamide layer matrix due to presence of organic ligands and gqds at modifier structure of all the fo membranes the tfn 0 25 membranes had the best performance with the water ﬂux of 59 2 and 85 3 lmh in the fo and pro modes respectively at 1 m nacl

the water flux and selectivity of the fo membranes so that the j w for the tfn 0 25 containing 250 ppm of fillers in the fo mode was obtained 59 3 lmh using 1 m nacl as a draw solution and deionized water as feed solution which was around 102 greater than with the tfc membrane at the same time the selectivity was about 1 5 times those of the control membrane without gqds mof particles which is one of the most critical goals in membrane designing keywords forward osmosis fo desalination membrane thin film nanocomposite tfn metal organic framework mof gqds uio 66 nh2 1 introduction desalination is achieving popularity as an alternative water supply resource as many municipalities and utilities worldwide are facing developing population growth pressures shortage of proper local water resources and more forceful water quality laws 1 2 water desalination consists of separation processes that provide new freshwater from seawater and other water sources which are too saline for use several desalting processes and systems were considered that tried to reduce the cost of the water produced and improve process sustainability which one of them is forward osmosis process 3 4 forward osmosis fo as a novel membrane technology is a process that utilizes osmotic pressure to drive water from contaminated or saline water feed solution over a semi permeable membrane that preserves the dissolved solutes 5 6 this flux is driven by osmotic pressure produced by a draw solution or osmotic agent this osmotic separation requires little energy only the pumping of fluids to the membrane element as it occurs automatically due to the trend toward thermodynamic equilibrium therefore it consumes low amounts of energy and materials and has an associated important and frequently appreciated impact on the environment 7 industrial applications of fo membranes are restricted due to their high fouling tendency low hydrophilicity and poor performance 8 therefore to obtain high water flux fo membranes without loss of selectivity at the forward osmosis process typically most fo membranes have been formed using interfacial polymerization ip method to construct thin film composite tfc structures with a particular layer on the top surface of support 9 10 metal organic frameworks mofs as a new class of crystalline porous inorganic organic hybrid materials are a prominent component for this purpose 11 12 herein first the uio 66 nh2 metal organic frameworks mofs were modified with graphene quantum dots gqds to facilitate the water attraction on mof surface as well as improve porosity and hydrophilicity of the top surface of the forward osmosis fo membranes then new thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes were prepared through modifying the tfc membranes with the loading of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites on polyamide pa layer on the top surface of the pes membranes the effects of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites on hydrophilicity surface porosity and morphology of the membranes were studied the fo performance of the prepared membranes in fo was evaluated in terms of water flux reverse solute flux and anti fouling properties 2 experimental 2 1 materials and

nanocrystals were prepared according to the previously reported procedures 13 14 in brief zirconium chloride 2 aminoterephthalic acid and dmf were mixed with the composition of 0 46 g zrcl4 0 36 g bdc nh2 10 ml dmf after stirring for 30 min at room temperature the resulting homogeneous solution was transferred into a 100 ml teﬂon lined autoclave sealed and maintained at 110 c for 24 h next the resulting yellow powder was collected by centrifuging and then re dispersed in 10 ml fresh dmf for 2 h the final product was isolated by centrifugation washed with ethanol 3 20 ml and dried at 150 c under reduced pressure for 12 h 2 3 preparation of graphene quantum dots gqds gqds were prepared by directly pyrolyzing of citric acid fig 1 according to a literature procedure 15 briefly in a 5 ml beaker 2 g of citric acid was heated at 200 c in an oven for 30 min a few minutes later the melted citric acid undergoes a color change from colorless to pale yellow and finally turns to orange after 30 min which confirms the formation of gqds the resulting viscous liquid was added slowly to 100 ml of 10 mg ml naoh solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature to neutralize the solution eventually the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to yield gqds solids 2 4 synthesis of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites for the synthesis of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites first the acyl chloride functionalized graphene quantum dots gqds cocl were synthesized as follows in a round bottom flask containing 10 ml thionyl chloride 0 1 g of gqds was added and heated at reflux condition 80 c for 24 h under argon atmosphere after completion of the reaction the excess socl2 solution was removed by blowing ar gas inside the flask subsequently the obtained solids were dispersed in 20 ml ch2cl2 and marked as a solution meanwhile solution b was prepared by dispersing of 0 2 g uio 66 nh2 in 20 ml ch2cl2 for 15 min and subsequently adding 1 ml of et3n after both solutions were prepared the solution a was added drop by drop to the latter solution b under vigorously stirring and refluxed for 24 h the solid product was collected by centrifuging washed three times with ch2cl2 and water 3 20 ml respectively and dried 24 h at room temperature the synthesis process of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites is illustrated in fig 1 2 5 preparation of polyethersulfone pes substrate flat sheet pes substrate was fabricated by using a casting solution containing 2 g pes dissolved in 5 6 g peg and 8 4 g dmf after keeping a casting solution in the open atmosphere for 24 h for removing the trapped air bubbles the dope solution was poured on a clean glass plate and cast using a casting knife setting at a gate height of 120 μm afterward the glass plate was immersed in a water bath to initiate phase inversion the obtained pes substrates were kept in deionized di before any utilization 2 6 preparation of the tfc and tfn membranes the thin ﬁlm pa layer of fo membranes was formed at the top surfaces of hand cast pes substrates by in situ interfacial polymerization ip of aqueous mpd and organic tmc monomers solutions the preparation process is shown in fig 2 briefly for tfc membranes synthesis the top surface of pes substrate was treated with aqueous mpd 2 wt solution for 2 min and after removing of the excess solution of mpd from the surface the treated membrane was reacted with organic tmc 0 15 wt solution for 1 min the resultant membrane dried shortly in the air and then heated in a 60 c for 10 min to create a dense polyamide layer a similar procedure was performed for the preparation of tfn membranes and the prepared membranes regarding the filler concentration in mpd solution 100 200 250 and 500 ppm were labeled as tfn 0 1 tfn 0 2 tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 respectively all the prepared fo membranes were kept in fresh di water before use 2 7 instruments ft ir spectra were obtained with an unicam matson1000 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer in kbr pellets 400 4000 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd patterns were recorded by xpert pro diffractometer system mpd panalytical company using a cu ka radiation source the morphology and chemical compositions of the membranes were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem mira3 tescan xmu model equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds before taking of fe sem images all samples fractured to small fragments under liquid nitrogen and then coated with a uniform thin gold layer furthermore the surface roughness of tfc and tfns membranes were investigated by atomic force microscope afm entegra afmnt mdt model before the measurement first the membranes were fixed on a glass slides by using double sided tape and then 4 μm 4 μm areas were scanned at a rate of 0 5 hz the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane samples was obtained at 25 c by contact angle goniometer ezdiad bardash e fars technology co ca es10 model for this purpose samples were prepared similar to the afm measurements method and subsequently the contact angle between the water and membrane surface was measured at five different points of each sample 2 8 fo performance the membrane s performance in fo processes was studied by using a lab scale fo setup at room temperature all prepared membranes were assayed at two fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro modes which were the active polyamide layer of the membrane in contact with the feed and draw solution al fs and al ds respectively the 0 5 m 1 m 1 5 m and 2 m nacl solutions and di water were applied as the draw and feed solution respectively that flowed counter currently on each side of the membrane with a flow rate of 200 ml min the feed conductivity was measured by a calibrated conductometer after permeation time of 15 min water flux j w lm 2 h 1 abbreviated as lmh and salt reverse flux j s gm 2 h 1 abbreviated as gmh were calculated using the following equations 1 j w δ v a m δ t 2 j s c f v f c i v i a m δ t where δ v l represents the volume of the permeated water through the membrane over a permeation time of δ t h a m represent the membrane s effective area m2 c f and c i represents the final and initial concentration of nacl at the feed solution side respectively v f and v i represents the final and initial feed volumes respectively the pure water permeability coefficient a lm 2 h 1 bar 1 and the salt permeability coefficient b lm 2 h 1 of all samples including tfc and tfns were determined by using a single fo experiment method that already proposed by tirafferi et al 16 in this method first j w and j s values determine under four successive steps of single fo experiment at unique draw solution concentration and then mentioned parameters are calculated by fitting the obtained j w and j s values to the corresponding fo transport equations through a least squares non linear regression 2 9 fo fouling experiment the anti fouling properties of the tfc tfn 0 1 and tfn 0 25 membranes were assessed by dynamic fouling experiments in a lab scale fo setup under al fs mode the 1 m nacl aqueous solution and simulated wastewater were employed as the fs and ds respectively synthetic wastewater was prepared according to a literature procedure by dissolving 0 5 mm cacl2 0 61 mm mgso4 9 20 mm nacl 0 5 mm nahco3 0 45 mm kh2po4 and 0 93 mm nh4cl 17 and 500 mg l bsa in di water was used as the organic foulant after cleaning the fo system by circulating di water on both feed and draw sides for about 30 min baseline water flux j 0 was obtained with the fo operation condition without bsa contaminant to eliminate dilution of draw solution afterward for determining the dynamic water flux j t bsa with a concentration of 500 mg l was added to the fs to start fouling phenomenon all fouling experiments were kept running for 6 5 h in room temperature and the j t j 0 ratio was taken with a 10 min interval during the fouling test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of gqds uio 66 nh2 composites and fo membranes the chemical structure of the uio 66 nh2 gqds and gqds uio 66 nh2 was studied using ftir spectroscopy and the spectra are shown in fig 3 b for gqds the absorptions at 1604 1573 overlapped together 1397 and 1258 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibration of cc asymmetrical stretching of coo symmetrical stretching of coo and bending vibration of coh respectively moreover wideband centered at 3396 cm 1 belong to oh vibration and the absorption bands located at 1077 cm 1 corresponding to the coh stretching vibration 15 18 19 as this figure shows the ftir spectrum of uio 66 nh2 particles significantly differences from the free 2 aminoterephthalic acid ligand the observed characteristic peak at 3322 and 3456 cm 1 which observes in both spectra attributing to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the primary amine respectively the vibrational modes of the νc n νas coo νs coo and νaromatic c c bonds could also be observed at 1258 1384 1571 1433 and 1503 cm 1 respectively 20 22 moreover downshift in the vibrational frequency of the co bond from 1687 to 1571 cm 1 at the uio 66 nh2 spectrum in comparison to bdc nh2 corroborate the successful synthesis of the uio 66 nh2 nanocrystals the gqds mof composites spectrum demonstrated the characteristic peaks of the uio 66 nh2 in the region of 400 1000 cm 1 and 3000 4000 cm 1 the new absorption peaks found at 1077 and 2987 cm 1 can be attributed to the νc oh and ν c h respectively which also observe in gqds spectrum and proves the effective incorporation of gqds in uio 66 nh2 furthermore comparison of the uio 66 nh2 and gqds mof spectra shows little decrease in the intensity of the carbonyl stretching ν c o 1659 cm 1 of amide group at gqds mof spectrum which confirms the replacing of the gqds and water molecules with existing dmf molecules in the structure 23 so it proves the successful insertion of the gqds in mofs structure it should be noted that due to the formation of new amide bond co nh between mof particles and gqds this peak doesn t eliminate perfectly in the gqds mof spectrum the morphology of the gqds uio 66 nh2 composites was investigated by fe sem as seen in fig 3a the gqds uio 66 nh2 particles display octahedral like morphology with a size of around 500 nm furthermore the separatability of the synthesized composites is evident in these images the powder xrd patterns of gqds gqds uio 66 nh2 synthesized and simulated uio 66 nh2 are shown in fig 3c the broad peak from 10 40 in the pxrd pattern of gqds indicates that the controlled carbonization of citric acid will produce an amorphous graphite structure and matched well with the reported literature 15 24 the excellent agreement between the pxrd patterns of the synthesized and simulated uio 66 nh2 and also its reported structure in the literature indicates the similarity of the crystalline structure of these materials and also suggests the successful synthesis of the mofs 25 27 moreover the resemblance of the gqds uio 66 nh2 pattern to the pristine uio 66nh2 pattern indicating that the incorporation of gqds did not disturb the uio 66 nh2 crystal structure fig 4 features the ftir spectra of the pes substrate tfc and tfn membranes strong bands at the wavenumbers of 1578 1489 1317 1240 and 1157 cm 1 are due to the presence of the ν benzene ring ν c c ν as c so2 c ν c o c ν s c so2 c modes of the pes support layer which are evident in all conducted ftir analysis 28 29 appearing two new peaks at around 1653 and 1542 cm 1 in composites membranes spectra tfc and tfns which are respectively attributed to the carbonyl stretching ν c o and amine bending δn h vibrations of the amide group indicates the successful formation of polyamide layer over the pes substrate 30 31 considering that the tfc and tfn membranes also contain a primary and secondary amines group at the pa layer the weak broad characteristic peak at 3370 3500 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching modes of nh bonding due to the low concentration of fillers at the pa active layer no apparent differences were found between the ft ir spectra of modified and unmodified membranes fig 5 a and b illustrate the pxrd patterns of all prepared membranes the broad peak from 10 24 that observes in all patterns is ascribed to the amorphous polyamide layer due to the low loading percentage of modifier particles at the pa layer the characteristic peaks of inserted fillers could not be detected in pxrd patterns of tfn membranes with the loading of 100 200 ppm appearing a weak peak at about 2θ 7 3 in the tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 patterns which attributed to 111 plane of uio 66 nh2 nanocrystals again conﬁrming the successful incorporation of gqds mof composites into the pa active layer fig 6 presents the water contact angle ca data of the pristine and modified membranes with different contents of gqds mof particles at room temperature after stabilization the water ca analysis was done to investigate the influence of fillers incorporation on surface hydrophilicity of the fo membranes the results show that the water ca of the modified fo membranes was remarkably decreased by increasing the percentage of particle loading in other words the chemical composition of the rejection layer was affected by incorporated particles the water contact angle of the unmodified fo membrane was 73 tfc which after modiﬁcation its value signiﬁcantly decreased to 45 tfn 0 5 this reduction in ca value verifies the presence of hydrophilic particles compared to the modified membranes with lower contents of fillers 0 250 ppm the higher surface hydrophilicity of the tfn 0 5 also might be due to its rougher surface these highly hydrophilic surfaces can facilitate the transportation of water molecules through the membrane and consequently improves water permeability the quantitative surface roughness of the tfc and tfn membranes were investigated by afm analysis and the obtained average roughness parameter ra is presented in fig 6 afm analysis depicts that the surface roughness of fo membranes can be altered by gqds mof composites loading and also proves the successful decoration of particles between the pa rejection layer and the porous support layer as the 3d afm images show in fig 7 compared to the control membrane with the increase in the concentration of fillers at the active layer from 0 to 250 ppm the ridge and valley structure elevation of the membranes got shorter which means the formation of smoother polyamide layer on the top surface of the pes substrate owing to the aggregation of gqds mof nanocrystals at higher loading percentages which top surface fe sem images corroborate it fig 8 the ra value increases for tfn 0 5 membrane and a rougher surface forms in this case the tfn 0 25 with the ra value of 43 86 nm possessed the lowest average roughness parameter among the all analyzed membrane which is remarkably lower than that of the pristine tfc membrane 75 48 nm the fe sem analysis was performed to investigate the morphological structure of the pa rejection layer and porous pes substrate of the prepared membranes the top surface and cross sectional fe sem images of tfc and tfn membranes are exhibited in fig 8 observation of the typical ridge and valley morphology of the polyamide layer in top surface images of all membranes confirms the successful formation of the pa active layer on a porous pes substrate the diffusion speed of mpd monomers into the organic phase impressed by the fillers concentration at aqueous phase and membranes with a high loading percentage of gqds mof possessing a thinner pa layer 32 33 hence in some areas of the tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 membranes specified points in fig 8d and e the pores of the support layer are apparent below the pa layer the afm analysis in a good agreement with this fact in tfn 0 25 case but aggregating of the fillers in the tfn 0 5 membrane makes it impossible to see this decrease in surface roughness furthermore the bright points at modified membrane surfaces belong to the mof nanocrystals because these images were recorded by the backscattered electron image detector and heavy zr metal have strong backscatter in compared to light elements of the linker pes substrate and pa layer besides the surface chemical composition of the modified and unmodified membranes was studied by eds analysis and the corresponding spectra are demonstrated in fig 8 the zr peak in all modified membranes eds spectra reveals the presence of mof particles at the pa layer even though the eds technique cannot be used to quantify the filler concentration as shown in fig 8 it is evident that the wt of zr increased at higher loading of gqds mof composites the eds elemental mapping of the tfc tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 are shown in fig 9 more n atoms in the eds mapping of the pristine and tfn 0 25 membranes fig 9a and b were observed compared to the tfn 0 5 membrane fig 9c that is because of the thinner and incomplete formation of pa active layer over the entire surface of pes substrate cross sectional fe sem images show finger like structures of the porous pes substrate which is desirable to reduce the internal concentration polarization icp of the fo membranes 3 2 osmotic performance and intrinsic separation properties of membranes fo performance of all membranes including pristine tfc and modified membranes with different loading of synthesized particles was appraised under the fo and pro modes fig 10 a and b feature the water ﬂux and reverse salt ﬂux of fo membranes at a 1 m concentration of nacl salt as draw solution and di water as feed solution as depicted all tfn membranes exhibited higher water flux j w than that of the control membrane in both al fs and al ds tested modes this growth in water ﬂux charts arises from the hydrophilic nature of the gqds uio 66 nh2 composites fig 6 and extra channels for water transportation amidst the membrane that provides by mof particles it should be noted that due to less internal concentration polarization icp all samples in al ds mode owning higher j w values than al fs mode 34 the water flux of tfn membranes improves by raising the concentration of the filler and the best result belongs to tfn 0 25 with a dosage of 250 ppm 59 26 and 85 3 lmh at fo and pro modes respectively it can be seen from fig 10b that as the concentration of the particles increases from 0 to 250 ppm the reverse salt ﬂux rises from 13 97 to 19 08 gmh and from 27 26 to 36 80 gmh in al fs and al ds modes respectively contrary to the expectation that uio 66 nh2 nanocrystals have a specific pore window size and the transportation of the hydrated na and cl ions should be restricted by these pores 35 36 the results show higher reverse solute ﬂux for tfn membranes with a higher content of fillers tfn 0 2 tfn 0 25 and tfn 0 5 this contradiction may be attributed to defects at the pa layer formation especially in the tfn 0 5 sample that the nitrogen element mapping of fig 9c shows this very well moreover particles aggregation fig 7e that can form new nonselective pores between the pa layer and fillers is the other possible reason compared to tfc and other modified membranes decrease in j s value of the tfn 0 1 membrane can be attributed to the presence of mofs embedded in the polyamide layer because similar to the tfc membrane the formation of a polyamide layer also occurs completely in the tfn 0 1 membrane and the used mofs have nanometer sized cavities with windows size smaller than a diameter of hydrated na and cl ions that limited their permeability through membranes formation of an almost defect free pa layer in the tfn 0 1 membrane is stemmed from the presence of linker and gqds in the gqds mof structure which can cause more and better interactions with the pa matrix and decrease the forming of non selective cavities between the filler and polymer phase this advantage helps the modified tfn 0 1 membrane to achieve a high water flux without selectivity loss 37 the effect of this compatibility is well observed at low loading tfn 0 1 but at higher loading due to particle aggregation and thus creating unwanted cavities it is not observed it should be mentioned that the js and jw values for the tfn 0 5 membrane are lower than for the tfn 0 25 this trend is probably due to the partial filling of the substrate s pores by the imported modifier particles which can act as a barrier and reduce the permeability speed of water and salt the reverse salt ﬂux water ﬂux ratio of all membrane samples is demonstrated in fig 11 this ratio which known as selectivity of forward osmosis membranes is one of the most important parameters of fo membranes and generally high selective membranes show a low j s j w value compared with the pristine tfc membrane the j s j w value of all tfn membranes is less than 0 35 g l at fo mode despite the high j s values these low ratios indicating that incorporation of gqds mof composites in the pa active layer significantly improve the selectivity of the modified membranes the same trend was observed in the pro mode according to fig 11 the tfn 0 25 membrane with j s j w ratio of 0 32 and 0 43 g l exhibits the best selectivity among all tested membranes at the fo and pro modes respectively fig 12 show water ﬂux values of the tfc and tfn 0 25 membranes as a function of draw solution concentration in both al ds and al fs modes although in all cases the j w value increase with enhancing of ds concentration due to the higher osmotic pressure difference on the two sides of the membrane fig 12 increment at pro mode is significantly higher than fo mode because of lower icp as can be seen there is a near linear relation between water flux growth and ds concentration simultaneously reverse solute permeation from ds to fs increases because of higher salt concentration gradient through the rejection layer of membranes fig 13 the active layer transport properties including water permeability coefficient a and salt permeability coefficient b of the fo membranes were determined by the fo based protocol and the results are reported in table 1 as shown the a values for all modified membranes are appreciably higher than those of the tfc unmodified membrane at the same time the salt permeability coefficient of the tfn membranes slightly increases compared to the pristine tfc membrane despite these high values the modiﬁed membrane shows a relatively lower b a ratio than the tfc membrane and maintaining the selectivity at high values for instance the a b and b avalues for the tfn 0 25 membrane are 4 88 lmh bar 1 1 356 lmh and 0 28 bar respectively which are significantly different from the obtained values for tfc membrane 2 23 lmh bar 1 0 868 lmh and 0 39 bar respectively in all experiments the coefficients of determination for both water and salt fluxes r w 2 and rs 2 is greater than 0 95 which are consistent with recommended values 16 3 3 antifouling characteristic of the membranes the anti fouling properties of the tfc tfn 0 1 and tfn 0 25 membranes were investigated in the presence of bsa as a model foulant and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 14 it can be seen that all tested membranes show water flux decline with different degrees during the experiment the control membrane tfc has the most significant water flux decline which indicates a higher fouling propensity of this membrane in comparison to the tfc membrane the better anti fouling performance of the modified membranes can be attributed to the more hydrophilic and smoother surface of these membranes 38 39 higher surface wettability of the tfn 0 1 and tfn 0 25 membranes as shown in fig 6 is desirable for strongly binding of water molecules to these hydrophilic surfaces especially in tfn 0 25 and formation of a thin water layer on their surfaces which can act as a barrier to prevent the growth of hydrophobic organic contaminants on the membrane surface besides the smoother surface of gqds mof incorporated membranes can minimize membrane fouling through lowering adhesion sites on the membrane surface thus the accumulation of foulants in valley structures gets low and antifouling property of the membrane improves due to having a lower water ca and ra value the tfn 0 25 membrane displays the smallest deviation from the initial water flux and lower membrane fouling tendency between the all tested membranes after the continuous 6 5 h fouling test the tfn 0 25 membrane with the water flux decline of 18 exhibits the best anti fouling performance among evaluated membranes table 2 compares the fo performance of tfc and tfn 0 25 membranes in the present study with other reported membranes containing various fillers the considerable water flux and comparable selectivity of the tfn 0 25 membrane indicate that porous and hydrophilic particles are useful components for introducing at the pa layer the observed difference in the water flux values for the control tfc membranes can be attributed to the different preparation conditions which affect the internal concentration polarization icp by altering the structural parameter s thickness tortuosity porosity and therefore effects on the fo water flux different preparation conditions include i the absence of the pore former 43 44 ii use of low loading percentages of additives 40 42 which causes forming a lower porous support layer than present work resulting higher value of the s parameter and iii formation of straight needle like canals without tortuosity which reduces the structural parameter lower than the previously reported work 40 44 4 conclusion the gqds uio 66 nh2 composites were synthesized successfully and decorated at the polyamide rejection layer during the in situ interfacial polymerization step the inserted fillers change the hydrophilicity morphology thickness and roughness properties of the pa selective layer which subsequently affects the water permeability selectivity and anti fouling properties of the membranes in summary the incorporating of synthesized gqds mof composites at pa active layer has following advantages i augments the water ﬂux due to supplying extra channels for transportation of water molecules and presence of hydrophilic mofs and gqds at filler structure ii improves the selectivity because of having a pore aperture size smaller than a diameter of hydrated na and cl ions and iii enhance compatibility with the polyamide layer matrix due to presence of organic ligands and gqds at modifier structure of all the fo membranes the tfn 0 25 membranes had the best performance with the water ﬂux of 59 2 and 85 3 lmh in the fo and pro modes respectively at 1 m nacl

2 nanostructures and removal of indigo carmine and chloride ion during electrocoagulation under polarity change at room temperature the magnesium hydroxide byproducts generated using az31 magnesium alloy anodes and az31 and aluminum electrodes are fully characterized after electrocoagulation a remarkable in situ removal of chloride ions and non purgeable dissolved organic carbon up to 69 1 and 90 4 respectively are respectively achieved for the samples with 0 and 2 min polarity changes due to the speciation of dissolved elements in the aqueous media the organic matter removal is inversely proportional to the chloride ion removal capability moreover it is demonstrated that the polarity change affects the structure the crystallinity and the crystallite size of the magnesium hydroxide nanostructures formed during the treatment keywords wastewater treatment hydrotalcite like compounds chloride ion removal electrochemical synthesis nanomaterials 1 introduction nowadays one of the less investigated topics of industrial concern is the removal of anions from contaminated streams in this regards layered materials represent an alternative of treatment because they can exchange inorganic or organic anions in their interlayer space in recent years inorganic materials with characteristic morphologies and properties have garnered increasing attention because of their broad range of applications magnesium oxide mgo magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and mg al layered double hydroxides ldhs have shown potential use in electronics 1 2 optics 3 4 catalysis 5 6 adsorption separation processes 7 8 water treatment 9 11 and nanodevices 12 14 here a special focus is made on the application of such nanostructured magnesium hydroxide brucite materials for wastewater treatment brucite is a layered magnesium hydroxide mineral in brucite oh ions are hexagonally closed packed and mg2 ions occupy alternate layers of octahedral sites resulting in the stacking of neutrally charged layers 15 the β hydroxides are isostructural with brucite while in α hydroxides a fraction x of the hydroxyl ions is replaced by water molecules leading to positively charged layers of the composition m oh 2 x h2o x x 16 in comparison layered hydroxides salts lhss are formed when the x fraction is replaced by anions becoming m oh 2 x an x n 17 18 on the other hand a partial substitution of trivalent cations m iii for divalent cations m ii is developed in layered double hydroxides ldhs also known as hydrotalcite like composite ht or anionic clays those materials are described by the general formula m ii 1 xm iii x oh 2 ax n n mh2o in the α hydroxides and both lhss and ldhs anions and water molecules are incorporated in the interlayer region to neutralize the charge 19 electrocoagulation is an economical alternative to traditional wastewater treatment processes it is based on the destabilization of suspended emulsified or dissolved pollutants in an aqueous medium by the in situ dissolution of the metal from sacrificial anodes with the simultaneous formation of the hydroxyl ion and hydrogen gas 20 although electrocoagulation is promising due to its simplicity anode passivation is one of its disadvantages nevertheless the polarity switching process could reduce passivation and increase up to 20 the discoloration of wastewaters 21 recently it has been shown that mg al cl ldh can be synthesized by using electrocoagulation ec 22 also the formation of mg al f layered double hydroxides by electrocoagulation can lead to the defluoridation with aluminum anodes in systems containing mg2 or ca2 aqueous ions 23 similarly electrochemically synthesized green rust can be modified in situ with aluminum and magnesium to remove up to 98 6 of arsenic from aqueous solutions 24 wastewaters containing dyes are especially difficult to degrade mostly due to their varied synthetic origins and strong color in this context several authors have explored the use of mg oh 2 as a coagulant for dye removal for instance it has been used to treat high ph reactive orange red and yellow wastewater 25 26 and indigo carmine 27 also it has been shown that mg oh 2 hexagonal nanosheets combined with graphene oxide allow the adsorption of the congo red dye 28 most of the studies about coagulation with magnesium hydroxide focus on the removal efficiencies of the dyes along with the flocs characterization 25 27 while others have sorted out the intercalation of dyes into ldhs by direct hydrolysis and anion exchange 29 on the other hand few studies have explored the synthesis of mg oh 2 during electrocoagulation and its potential for wastewater treatment so far only the effects of the operational parameters on the removal of indigo carmine ic from synthetic solutions by using electrocoagulation with magnesium electrodes have been explored 30 31 the main objective of this paper is to optimize the electrocoagulation of indigo carmine by using az31 alloy anodes under polarity change and asses the simultaneous removal of non purgeable dissolved organic carbon npoc and chloride ions using magnesium hydroxide based nanostructures synthesized in operando indeed we demonstrated the formation of mg al layered double hydroxide using az31 alloy and aluminum as electrodes the morphology and structure of the precipitates were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ftir spectra and transmission electron microscopy tem also the concentration of npoc and chloride ions were measured after electrocoagulation thermal behavior and decomposition process of the sample without polarity changed were studied through thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential scanning calorimetry dsc 2 material and methods 2 1 electrocoagulation experiments tests were conducted in a batch mode in a 1 l glass reactor using parallel electrode plates with 0 9 l of a solution prepared by dissolving indigo carmine sigma aldrich and 1 800 mg l 1 of sodium chloride ar grade in deionized water it is important to note that the concentration of the dye and nacl resemble those used in photocatalysis or iron electrocoagulation studies 32 and those reported for industrial effluents 18 besides sodium chloride is usually used in the textile industry for dye fixation az31 alloy and aluminum plates were both used as electrodes these plates with an effective area of 76 5 cm2 and 46 6 cm2 respectively were suspended and clamped together using polyethylene belts guaranteeing an interelectrode distance of 0 5 cm a brisco thermometer and a thermo scientific brand plate model sp131635q were used to measure the temperature and control the stirring respectively fig 1 two different configurations were used in the first configuration both electrodes were made of az31 alloy for the second configuration az31 alloy and aluminum were used as plates a bk precision dc regulated power supply model 1665 is used as direct current power source and a manual polarity inverter unit are connected to the electrodes applying a current intensity of 0 34a at room temperature 25 1 c until a specific electric charge supply of 0 86 ah l 1 and 1 3 ah l 1 were reached for the az31 az31 and az31 al system respectively the same procedure has been reported previously 22 before testing electrodes are subjected to dry abrasion with emery paper no 600 and 1200 then the electrodes are rinsed with distilled water for about 5 min to remove metal traces after electrocoagulation the solution is quickly filtrated and dried in an oven at 105 c for 2 h then macerated and referred for analysis the sample without polarity changed is labelled az31 0 finally az31 2 and az31 7 5 indicate 2 min and 7 5 min polarity changes for each electrode while az31 al means that az31 and al electrodes with 8 min and 5 min polarity changes respectively the polarity reversal frequency prf describes the number of cycles with original and reversed electrode polarity within one hour cycles h 1 it is defined as 33 1 p r f 60 m i n t 0 t r where t0 is the duration of the original electrode polarity min and tr is the duration of the reversed electrode polarity min in contrast the polarity reversal intervals duration ratio id is defined as the ratio of the original and reversed polarity interval duration within one cycle 33 the id for all the apc samples was 1 except for az31 al with id 1 6 experiments were replicated once and the details are presented in table 1 2 2 analytical methods and characterization to measure the ph and electrical conductivity mscm 1 standardized at 25 c we use a multiparameter sensor mark thermo scientific orion star a329 for the determination of the non purgeable dissolved organic carbon npoc mg l 1 the samples are filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and analyzed by the toc vcph equipment based on a calibration curve prepared with potassium phthalate c8h5ko4 determination of chloride ions by titration with silver nitrate is made before and after the electrocoagulation process in order to calculate the chloride ion removed the chemical and structural features of the synthesized materials are obtained from different analytical techniques including xrd ftir and tga dsc powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns are collected on an x pert pro panalytical diffractometer with cukα radiation λ 0 1542 nm over a range between 4 90 rietveld refinements of the sample displacement phase intensity lattice parameters and preferred orientation are performed using gsas 2001 fourier transform infrared ftir spectra in a range between 350 4000 cm 1 are obtained on a jasco ftir 4100 spectrometer by measuring the ir absorbance of a kbr disc containing 2 wt of the sample thermal gravimetric and differential scanning calorimeter analyses were carried out on a tga dsc mettler toledo device with 7 mg of the sample under a nitrogen atmosphere at a constant flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 for transmission electron microscopy tem imaging samples are ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol in a branson 1510 ultrasonic cleaner 70 w and 42 khz and then loaded onto copper grids micrographs are obtained in a jeol 1011 de 100kv tem microscope additionally high resolution images of samples az31 0 and az31 2 are obtained with a jeol jem 2100 f field emission electron microscope 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray diffraction the xrd patterns of the materials obtained after electrocoagulation are illustrated in fig 2 the x ray diffraction patterns of samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al show a series of basal peaks like the standard pattern of magnesium hydroxide jcpds file n 96 210 1439 indexed to the hexagonal crystal system and the space group p 3m1 164 fig 3 the powders were polycrystalline with a strong 101 crystal plane orientation at 2θ of 37 91 degrees as is shown in fig 2 this means that crystal growth preferentially occurred along the c axis 34 35 no diffraction peaks of other secondary phases were observed in the xrd patterns of these samples demonstrating the formation of a pure single phase on the other hand the sample az31 2 showed fluctuations with some asymmetrical peaks indicating either an amorphous or poorly crystallized structure this sample resembles the peaks of carbonate containing hydrotalcite and gibbsite obtained during electrocoagulation with aluminum and az31 electrodes in a previous work without indigo carmine 22 nevertheless magnesium hydroxide corresponding to the jcpds file n 96 900 3876 was also identified its cell parameters being a 5 5410 å and c 4 8440 å standard patterns of hydrotalcite icsd file n 98 000 6183 and gibbsite jcpds file n 96 900 8283 with cell parameters a 3 0514 å and c 22 8100 å and a 8 6840 b 5 0708 å and c 12 5227 å respectively were used during the identification table 2 shows the phases and structural parameters obtained by x ray diffraction after refinement of the crystalline samples the optimized parameters lattice constants and crystallite size in the rietveld refinement showed reasonable values of χ2 resulting in a good agreement between the calculated and the experimental xrd profiles supplementary figs s1 s3 the basal spacing coincides with the magnesium hydroxide lattice parameter c and it is in agreement with the value of 4 8 å reported for the neutral brucite lattice 36 on the other hand the crystallite size in the perpendicular direction of samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al were assessed to be 80 02 nm 33 61 nm and 28 74 nm respectively the samples obtained under polarity change showed in both directions a smaller crystallite size than the sample without polarity change smaller crystallite sizes for the plane 101 of mg oh 2 have been obtained by using precipitation methods 35 reports on the direct intercalation of indigo carmine into zn lhs zn al ldhs and mg al ldh have shown basal spacings of 19 07 å 17 6 å and 22 2 å respectively 18 29 37 thus the indigo carmine ion length ca 17 2 å can incorporate in the interlayer region on the other hand for mg al ldh the interlayer space is around 7 89 å for chloride uptake 38 40 conversely the basal distance obtained from the rietveld refinement for the samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al was ca 4 779 å therefore the mechanisms of dye and chloride removal during electrocoagulation are different from intercalation between layers for those experimental conditions xrd results reveal that the crystallinity of the samples is affected by the polarity reversal frequency furthermore it is known that the structure and properties of aqueous interfaces with brucite and other clay minerals are strongly affected by a structural and compositional disorder of the interfaces 41 rietveld refinement allowed to detect variations in the intensity distribution and a small shift in the peak positions of the xrd spectra see supplementary fig s4 those features may be related to the presence of crystalline defects like point defects or small dislocation loops 42 fig s1 the structural disorder can cause important effects on the activity of layered materials for instance enhance its catalytic performance 43 44 tune its electric properties 44 allow anion and cation exchange 41 45 and enable the formation of molecular assemblies for targeted systems delivery 46 in contrast in the energy storage field some negative effects have been discovered recently for magnesium 47 therefore further studies are required to fully understand the effects of the ec in the crystal structure of the precipitates produced 3 2 mid infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir spectra of the powders obtained after electrocoagulation are presented in fig 4 according to the ic ftir spectrum see supplementary fig s5 the series of bands recorded between 1033 and 476 cm 1 are attributed to the dye nevertheless the strong band at 1614 cm 1 that establishes cc ring stretching vibration in the dye 37 vanished indicating that the bond was broken the characteristic absorption band of the sulfonate so3 group of indigo carmine is observed around 1192 cm 1 28 37 the fixation of this group can be shown by the shift of the band at 1192 cm 1 to 1200 cm 1 for samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al although all samples show the so3 band the peak intensity without polarity change is weak which is consistent with the low reduction on npoc found for this sample while peaks from the az31 7 5 and az31 al samples show similar intensities and similar organic matter npoc removals the adsorption of indigo carmine on mg oh 2 involves an electrostatic interaction between negatively charged sulfonate groups and positively charged mg oh 2 similar results explain the adsorption affinity of congo red on mg oh 2 hexagonal nanosheet graphene oxide composites 28 the bands around 1641 cm 1 are related to hco3 stretching vibration 48 instead of cc bending vibrations corresponding to the dye because they can be noted even in the absence of ic considering naturally present co2 in the environment and dissolved in the electrolyte at the ph of electrocoagulation experiments between 10 8 and 11 19 the following reactions eq 2 and eq 3 may explain the co3 2 bands observed 49 it is already established that contamination by atmospheric co2 is common on layered materials 48 besides the adsorption of carbonate onto the surface of mg oh 2 films grown over az31 magnesium alloy substrates has been also demonstrated elsewhere 50 51 2 c o 2 a q o h a q h c o 3 a q 3 h c o 3 a q o h a q h 2 o l c o 3 2 a q dissolved inorganic carbon is available in water like bicarbonate hco3 carbonic acid h2co3 and carbonate co3 2 their availability depends on the ph values of the water carbon dioxide is dissolved in the molecular form as free hydrated co2 and less than 1 reacts with water to form h2co3 at ph 4 5 predominates co2 at ph 8 3 the hco3 ions are predominant and at ph 10 5 the ions co3 2 prevail 52 strong and broad absorbance bands between 3425 and 3445 cm 1 are common for samples az31 7 5 and az31 al which are associated the nh stretching mode 53 the sharp and intense peak at 3699 cm 1 in az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al samples can be attributed to the oh stretching in the crystal structure of mg oh 2 50 on the other hand highlighted band 435 cm 1 could be assigned to the bending vibration modes of metal oxygen m mg2 al3 54 55 it is worth noting that the sample az31 7 5 min overlaps several bands in this region making a clear identification difficult in contrast sample az31 2 shows a characteristic broad peak between 3600 and 3200 cm 1 associated with the stretching mode of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups from both the hydroxide layers and interlayer water in hydrotalcite like phases 48 we can also observe the presence of an intense absorption band at 1367 cm 1 arising from the carbonate anion in the interlayer space 37 56 additionally distinguishable peaks appear below 1033 cm 1 the bands of the alo6 3 condensed groups and mgaloh translation are assigned to 438 cm 1 and 553 cm 1 respectively 48 while the band at 674 cm 1 is consistent with ic furthermore other peaks belonging to the aromatic ring and so3 groups are seen at 1033 cm 1 and 1192 cm 1 without any shift the vanishing of the cc bonds and the nh bond indicate a change in the chemical nature of indigo carmine in the sample which means that the dye was transformed during electrocoagulation nevertheless it is estimated that less than 5 of the dye is chemically modified under az31 0 conditions 3 3 morphological characterization the morphology of the particles obtained during electrocoagulation without polarity change and with 2 and 7 5 min polarity changes are presented in fig 5 all samples show the same particle morphology made of a random arrangement of thin platelets morphing into a nanostructure referred to as flake like 57 58 it has been reported that magnesium hydroxide has a natural tendency to form hexagonal platelets due to the magnesium cation is six fold coordinated by hydroxyl groups thus forming mg oh 6 4 octahedra 58 59 the lateral dimension of the platelets seen in fig 5 a b for the az31 0 sample typically range between 377 506 nm for the az31 7 5 samples it ranges between 126 and 263 nm as seen in fig 5 e f fig 5 c d suggest features smaller than 137 nm for the az31 2 samples but clear platelet structures could hardly be distinguished these features are consistent with other reports 60 61 these sizes are significantly different from the crystallite sizes estimated using rietveld refinement calculations based on the xrd results this suggests that particles are polycrystalline consistent with the xrd results tem micrographs also confirm that polarity changes yield smaller particles decreasing in size as the polarity reverse frequency increases the ph and the chemical nature of the ions present in the solution are related to the crystal growth 59 indeed the point of zero charge of mg oh 2 s is at ph 10 8 62 below the point of zero charge protonated magnesium sites mgoh2 predominate above that deprotonated magnesium sites mgo are dominant because of the gain or loss of protons by the hydroxyl groups of the brucite 41 the ph reached during electrocoagulation was ca 11 as such some of the particles are positively charged so that hydroxyl ions can be adsorbed onto the basal plane of the crystallites and promote the edgewise growth of the particles as previsouly described elsewhere 59 on the other hand the agglomeration into a flake like morphology is typical of magnesium hydroxides and ldhs due to a fast nucleation process because of an the excess of hydroxyl ions 59 63 64 the selected area electron diffraction saed patterns for az31 0 and az31 2 powders are shown in fig 6 a b the diffraction rings observed in fig 6 a for the az31 0 samples can be assigned to the 101 202 104 and 001 planes from brucite with lattice spacings of 2 37 å 1 79 å 1 59 å and 4 86 å respectively the bright spots in those rings suggest that the az31 0 particles are polycrystalline in contrast fig 6 b shows a poorly crystalline powder structure for the az31 2 samples these saed patterns are consistent with the xrd results from fig 2 3 4 thermogravimetric analysis tga dsc fig 7 shows the thermogravimetric profile for the az31 0 sample recorded from 30 c to 900 c it displays one blunt endothermic peak observed by dsc with its maximum at 90 c this peak can be attributed to the removal of physisorbed water total mass loss of 10 8 at 223 c obtained by tga afterward a smooth continuous weight loss occurs until 331 c which is followed by an abrupt mass loss of 22 94 up to 448 c this second mass loss step corresponds to a broad endothermic band observed by dsc with the maximum at 400 c which is consistent with the decomposition of magnesium hydroxide to mgo 65 and the complete oxidation of the organic matter 18 nevertheless in this study this peak is slightly shifted towards higher temperatures compared with data reported for other authors at around 350 c 58 65 or 381 3 c 66 the observed mass loss up to 448 c was 33 74 which is slightly larger than the theoretical value from the mg oh 2 to mgo transformation 30 8 58 65 this may be due to the presence of indigo carmine over the surface of the powder yielding the color of the powders above 600 c the mass loss was 6 8 overall we record a total mass loss of 40 54 up to 900 c 3 5 pollutants removal npoc and chloride ion removal with normalized removal results for each solution treated by electrocoagulation are given in table 3 organic matter removals of 57 1 79 6 and 90 4 are reached for the az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 2 samples respectively in addition chloride ion removals of 69 1 20 0 and 7 8 are also reached for the az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 2 samples respectively an increase in npoc removal associated with a decrease in chloride ion removal is observed for all the samples obtained using the az31 az31 electrodes furthermore the organic matter removal capacity increases as the polarity reversal frequency increases while the chloride ion removal capacity decreases this stems from the inorganic speciation of dissolved elements in the aqueous media which affects the mechanism of coagulation and flocculation involved protonated magnesium sites mgoh2 predominate below ph 10 8 while deprotonated magnesium sites mgo dominate at higher ph although aluminum is also dissolved from the az31 electrodes its relative amount is expected to be much smaller compared to the concentration of magnesium consequently the analysis of these samples focuses only on the speciation of magnesium except for the sample az31 2 were gibbsite was identified the precipitate surface is positively charged during the electrocoagulation process without polarity change az31 0 due to the solution ph as previously demonstrate by the authors using zeta potential measurements 31 moreover the indigo carmine being an anionic dye with a pka value of 12 6 67 has a negative surface charge density that remains unchanged at the ph of the process therefore sulfonate groups so3 positioned at the extremes of the dye molecule and chloride ion may have been adsorbed in the protonated magnesium sites providing npoc and chloride ion removals slightly higher than 50 a related point to consider here is that the indigo carmine anion length and the big crystallite size of the particles formed may have reduced the removal capacity due to the orientation of the dye anion and the surface area available for adsorption respectively this is consistent with our previous report on the mechanisms of charge neutralization during indigo carmine removal by electrocoagulation with az31 and high purity magnesium anodes 31 secondly the dominant removal mechanism for the sample az31 7 5 at ph above 11 may have also involved the sweep flocculation where closely packed hydroxide precipitates tend to form a three dimensional network structure that entrap the pollutants after charge neutralization 68 69 in this aqueous system the electrostatic attraction between cl ic anion and magnesium hydroxide is less probable due to the presence of deprotonated magnesium sites mgo which explains the low chloride ion removal obtained under this polarity reversal frequency experiment otherwise the increase in the removal of npoc may be explained by the fact that sweep flocculation favors the removal of big molecules while small molecules like chloride ion are hardly removed similar results explain the removals obtained for the az31 al samples nevertheless they show an increased interaction with ic due to the presence of aluminum in a higher concentration at ph higher than 8 all the aluminum species are converted to al oh 4 70 thus the likelyhood for interactions between the coagulant and the chloride ion is diminished while the electrostatic attraction with aluminum hydroxides is unlikely regardless it has been reported that ic removal decreases at ph higher than 11 for electrocoagulation by using aluminum electrodes 71 al oh 4 may form interparticle bridging with the remaining mgoh2 sites to aid the sweep flocculation this means that the simultaneous presence of magnesium and aluminum or so called heterocoagulation favors the removal of organic matter on account of this the high ic removal can also be attributed to the highest specific electric charge applied 1 3 ah l vs 0 86 ah l the amorphous structure of the precipitates in the case of the sample az31 2 may have contributed to improving the organic matter removal because of its higher surface free energy 68 moreover the xrd analysis confirms gibbsite along with hydrotalcite and brucite structures in this case the low percentage of chloride removal is attributed again to the electrostatic repulsion between hydroxyaluminum species and chloride ions while the results of npoc are explained by a combination of sweep flocculation heterocoagulation and probably intercalation despite the high selectivity of ldh towards carbonate anions some of the carbonates and water intercalated in the hydrotalcite may have been exchanged by ic anions since the basal spacing of hydrotalcite is large enough to incorporate the ic anion 4 conclusions in this paper we report the simultaneous removal of npoc and chloride ion by electrocoagulation process with polarity change of az31 electrodes the mechanism of coagulation which depends on the speciation of dissolved elements in the aqueous media affects the removal of npoc and chloride the increase in polarity reversal frequency favors the organic matter removal instead of chloride adsorption a remarkable 69 of chloride removal capacity can be reached in situ during electrocoagulation without polarity change while the magnesium hydroxide precipitate is by produced electrostatic repulsion between al oh 4 and chloride ions significantly reduces the chloride removal capacity in the az31 2 and az31 al samples the removal of organic matter is favored by the electrostatic attraction between magnesium species and the dye as well as the sweep flocculation under polarity change intercalation may have also been present during the electrocoagulation performed at 2 min polarity change due to the joint presence of the hydrotalcite gibbsite and brucite crystalline phases the polarity change affects the structure the crystallinity and the crystallite size of the particles formed during the treatment while the increase in the polarity reversal frequency reduces the crystallite size of the precipitates x ray diffraction analysis shows that magnesium hydroxide is synthetized by electrocoagulation of indigo carmine and sodium chloride solution at room temperature without polarity change and with 7 5 min polarity change in the electrode system az31 az31 otherwise brucite is also formed in the electrode system az31 al besides the results conofirm the formation of hydrotalcite in the presence of indigo carmine by using only az31 electrodes and 15 cycles h 1 as polarity reversal frequency the tem images show that non uniform flake like magnesium hydroxide aggregate structures form with a wide range of sizes besides ftir results suggest that carbonates are a common

aluminum anodes in systems containing mg2 or ca2 aqueous ions 23 similarly electrochemically synthesized green rust can be modified in situ with aluminum and magnesium to remove up to 98 6 of arsenic from aqueous solutions 24 wastewaters containing dyes are especially difficult to degrade mostly due to their varied synthetic origins and strong color in this context several authors have explored

these plates with an effective area of 76 5 cm2 and 46 6 cm2 respectively were suspended and clamped together using polyethylene belts guaranteeing an interelectrode distance of 0 5 cm a brisco thermometer and a thermo scientific brand plate model sp131635q were used to measure the temperature and control the stirring respectively fig 1 two different configurations were used in the first configuration both electrodes were made of az31 alloy for the second configuration az31 alloy and aluminum were used as plates a bk precision dc regulated power supply model 1665 is used as direct current power source and a manual polarity inverter unit are connected to the electrodes applying a current intensity of 0 34a at room temperature 25 1 c until a specific electric charge supply of 0 86 ah l 1 and 1 3 ah l 1 were reached for the az31 az31 and az31 al system respectively the same procedure has been reported previously 22 before testing electrodes are subjected to dry abrasion with emery paper no 600 and 1200 then the electrodes are rinsed with distilled water for about 5 min to remove metal traces after electrocoagulation the solution is quickly filtrated and dried in an oven at 105 c for 2 h then macerated and referred for analysis the sample without polarity changed is labelled az31 0 finally az31 2 and az31 7 5 indicate 2 min and 7 5 min polarity changes for each electrode while az31 al means that az31 and al electrodes with 8 min and 5 min polarity changes respectively the polarity reversal frequency prf describes the number of cycles with original and reversed electrode polarity within one hour cycles h 1 it is defined as 33 1 p r f 60 m i n t 0 t r where t0 is the duration of the original electrode polarity min and tr is the duration of the reversed electrode polarity min in contrast the polarity reversal intervals duration ratio id is defined as the ratio of the original and reversed polarity interval duration within one cycle 33 the id for all the apc samples was 1 except for az31 al with id 1 6 experiments were replicated once and the details are presented in table 1 2 2 analytical methods and characterization to measure the ph and electrical conductivity mscm 1 standardized at 25 c we use a multiparameter sensor mark thermo scientific orion star a329 for the determination of the non purgeable dissolved organic carbon npoc mg l 1 the samples are filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and analyzed by the toc vcph equipment based on a calibration curve prepared with potassium phthalate c8h5ko4 determination of chloride ions by titration with silver nitrate is made before and after the electrocoagulation process in order to calculate the chloride ion removed the chemical and structural features of the synthesized materials are obtained from different analytical techniques including xrd ftir and tga dsc powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns are collected on an x pert pro panalytical diffractometer with cukα radiation λ 0 1542 nm over a range between 4 90 rietveld refinements of the sample displacement phase intensity lattice parameters and preferred orientation are performed using gsas 2001 fourier transform infrared ftir spectra in a range between 350 4000 cm 1 are obtained on a jasco ftir 4100 spectrometer by measuring the ir absorbance of a kbr disc containing 2 wt of the sample thermal gravimetric and differential scanning calorimeter analyses were carried out on a tga dsc mettler toledo device with 7 mg of the sample under a nitrogen atmosphere at a constant flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 for transmission electron microscopy tem imaging samples are ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol in a branson 1510 ultrasonic cleaner 70 w and 42 khz and then loaded onto copper grids micrographs are obtained in a jeol 1011 de 100kv tem microscope additionally high resolution images of samples az31 0 and az31 2 are obtained with a jeol jem 2100 f field emission electron microscope 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray diffraction the xrd patterns of the materials obtained after electrocoagulation are illustrated in fig 2 the x ray diffraction patterns of samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al show a series of basal peaks like the standard pattern of magnesium hydroxide jcpds file n 96 210 1439 indexed to the hexagonal crystal system and the space group p 3m1 164 fig 3 the powders were polycrystalline with a strong 101 crystal plane orientation at 2θ of 37 91 degrees as is shown in fig 2 this means that crystal growth preferentially occurred along the c axis 34 35 no diffraction peaks of other secondary phases were observed in the xrd patterns of these samples demonstrating the formation of a pure single phase on the other hand the sample az31 2 showed fluctuations with some asymmetrical peaks indicating either an amorphous or poorly crystallized structure this sample resembles the peaks of carbonate containing hydrotalcite and gibbsite obtained during electrocoagulation with aluminum and az31 electrodes in a previous work without indigo carmine 22 nevertheless magnesium hydroxide corresponding to the jcpds file n 96 900 3876 was also identified its cell parameters being a 5 5410 å and c 4 8440 å standard patterns of hydrotalcite icsd file n 98 000 6183 and gibbsite jcpds file n 96 900 8283 with cell parameters a 3 0514 å and c 22 8100 å and a 8 6840 b 5 0708 å and c 12 5227 å respectively were used during the identification table 2 shows the phases and structural parameters obtained by x ray diffraction after refinement of the crystalline samples the optimized parameters lattice constants and crystallite size in the rietveld refinement showed reasonable values of χ2 resulting in a good agreement between the calculated and the experimental xrd profiles supplementary figs s1 s3 the basal spacing coincides with the magnesium hydroxide lattice parameter c and it is in agreement with the value of 4 8 å reported for the neutral brucite lattice 36 on the other hand the crystallite size in the perpendicular direction of samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al were assessed to be 80 02 nm 33 61 nm and 28 74 nm respectively the samples obtained under polarity change showed in both directions a smaller crystallite size than the sample without polarity change smaller crystallite sizes for the plane 101 of mg oh 2 have been obtained by using precipitation methods 35 reports on the direct intercalation of indigo carmine into zn lhs zn al ldhs and mg al ldh have shown basal spacings of 19 07 å 17 6 å and 22 2 å respectively 18 29 37 thus the indigo carmine ion length ca 17 2 å can incorporate in the interlayer region on the other hand for mg al ldh the interlayer space is around 7 89 å for chloride uptake 38 40 conversely the basal distance obtained from the rietveld refinement for the samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al was ca 4 779 å therefore the mechanisms of dye and chloride removal during electrocoagulation are different from intercalation between layers for those experimental conditions xrd results reveal that the crystallinity of the samples is affected by the polarity reversal frequency furthermore it is known that the structure and properties of aqueous interfaces with brucite and other clay minerals are strongly affected by a structural and compositional disorder of the interfaces 41 rietveld refinement allowed to detect variations in the intensity distribution and a small shift in the peak positions of the xrd spectra see supplementary fig s4 those features may be related to the presence of crystalline defects like point defects or small dislocation loops 42 fig s1 the structural disorder can cause important effects on the activity of layered materials for instance enhance its catalytic performance 43 44 tune its electric properties 44 allow anion and cation exchange 41 45 and enable the formation of molecular assemblies for targeted systems delivery 46 in contrast in the energy storage field some negative effects have been discovered recently for magnesium 47 therefore further studies are required to fully understand the effects of the ec in the crystal structure of the precipitates produced 3 2 mid infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir spectra of the powders obtained after electrocoagulation are presented in fig 4 according to the ic ftir spectrum see supplementary fig s5 the series of bands recorded between 1033 and 476 cm 1 are attributed to the dye nevertheless the strong band at 1614 cm 1 that establishes cc ring stretching vibration in the dye 37 vanished indicating that the bond was broken the characteristic absorption band of the sulfonate so3 group of indigo carmine is observed around 1192 cm 1 28 37 the fixation of this group can be shown by the shift of the band at 1192 cm 1 to 1200 cm 1 for samples az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al although all samples show the so3 band the peak intensity without polarity change is weak which is consistent with the low reduction on npoc found for this sample while peaks from the az31 7 5 and az31 al samples show similar intensities and similar organic matter npoc removals the adsorption of indigo carmine on mg oh 2 involves an electrostatic interaction between negatively charged sulfonate groups and positively charged mg oh 2 similar results explain the adsorption affinity of congo red on mg oh 2 hexagonal nanosheet graphene oxide composites 28 the bands around 1641 cm 1 are related to hco3 stretching vibration 48 instead of cc bending vibrations corresponding to the dye because they can be noted even in the absence of ic considering naturally present co2 in the environment and dissolved in the electrolyte at the ph of electrocoagulation experiments between 10 8 and 11 19 the following reactions eq 2 and eq 3 may explain the co3 2 bands observed 49 it is already established that contamination by atmospheric co2 is common on layered materials 48 besides the adsorption of carbonate onto the surface of mg oh 2 films grown over az31 magnesium alloy substrates has been also demonstrated elsewhere 50 51 2 c o 2 a q o h a q h c o 3 a q 3 h c o 3 a q o h a q h 2 o l c o 3 2 a q dissolved inorganic carbon is available in water like bicarbonate hco3 carbonic acid h2co3 and carbonate co3 2 their availability depends on the ph values of the water carbon dioxide is dissolved in the molecular form as free hydrated co2 and less than 1 reacts with water to form h2co3 at ph 4 5 predominates co2 at ph 8 3 the hco3 ions are predominant and at ph 10 5 the ions co3 2 prevail 52 strong and broad absorbance bands between 3425 and 3445 cm 1 are common for samples az31 7 5 and az31 al which are associated the nh stretching mode 53 the sharp and intense peak at 3699 cm 1 in az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 al samples can be attributed to the oh stretching in the crystal structure of mg oh 2 50 on the other hand highlighted band 435 cm 1 could be assigned to the bending vibration modes of metal oxygen m mg2 al3 54 55 it is worth noting that the sample az31 7 5 min overlaps several bands in this region making a clear identification difficult in contrast sample az31 2 shows a characteristic broad peak between 3600 and 3200 cm 1 associated with the stretching mode of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups from both the hydroxide layers and interlayer water in hydrotalcite like phases 48 we can also observe the presence of an intense absorption band at 1367 cm 1 arising from the carbonate anion in the interlayer space 37 56 additionally distinguishable peaks appear below 1033 cm 1 the bands of the alo6 3 condensed groups and mgaloh translation are assigned to 438 cm 1 and 553 cm 1 respectively 48 while the band at 674 cm 1 is consistent with ic furthermore other peaks belonging to the aromatic ring and so3 groups are seen at 1033 cm 1 and 1192 cm 1 without any shift the vanishing of the cc bonds and the nh bond indicate a change in the chemical nature of indigo carmine in the sample which means that the dye was transformed during electrocoagulation nevertheless it is estimated that less than 5 of the dye is chemically modified under az31 0 conditions 3 3 morphological characterization the morphology of the particles obtained during electrocoagulation without polarity change and with 2 and 7 5 min polarity changes are presented in fig 5 all samples show the same particle morphology made of a random arrangement of thin platelets morphing into a nanostructure referred to as flake like 57 58 it has been reported that magnesium hydroxide has a natural tendency to form hexagonal platelets due to the magnesium cation is six fold coordinated by hydroxyl groups thus forming mg oh 6 4 octahedra 58 59 the lateral dimension of the platelets seen in fig 5 a b for the az31 0 sample typically range between 377 506 nm for the az31 7 5 samples it ranges between 126 and 263 nm as seen in fig 5 e f fig 5 c d suggest features smaller than 137 nm for the az31 2 samples but clear platelet structures could hardly be distinguished these features are consistent with other reports 60 61 these sizes are significantly different from the crystallite sizes estimated using rietveld refinement calculations based on the xrd results this suggests that particles are polycrystalline consistent with the xrd results tem micrographs also confirm that polarity changes yield smaller particles decreasing in size as the polarity reverse frequency increases the ph and the chemical nature of the ions present in the solution are related to the crystal growth 59 indeed the point of zero charge of mg oh 2 s is at ph 10 8 62 below the point of zero charge protonated magnesium sites mgoh2 predominate above that deprotonated magnesium sites mgo are dominant because of the gain or loss of protons by the hydroxyl groups of the brucite 41 the ph reached during electrocoagulation was ca 11 as such some of the particles are positively charged so that hydroxyl ions can be adsorbed onto the basal plane of the crystallites and promote the edgewise growth of the particles as previsouly described elsewhere 59 on the other hand the agglomeration into a flake like morphology is typical of magnesium hydroxides and ldhs due to a fast nucleation process because of an the excess of hydroxyl ions 59 63 64 the selected area electron diffraction saed patterns for az31 0 and az31 2 powders are shown in fig 6 a b the diffraction rings observed in fig 6 a for the az31 0 samples can be assigned to the 101 202 104 and 001 planes from brucite with lattice spacings of 2 37 å 1 79 å 1 59 å and 4 86 å respectively the bright spots in those rings suggest that the az31 0 particles are polycrystalline in contrast fig 6 b shows a poorly crystalline powder structure for the az31 2 samples these saed patterns are consistent with the xrd results from fig 2 3 4 thermogravimetric analysis tga dsc fig 7 shows the thermogravimetric profile for the az31 0 sample recorded from 30 c to 900 c it displays one blunt endothermic peak observed by dsc with its maximum at 90 c this peak can be attributed to the removal of physisorbed water total mass loss of 10 8 at 223 c obtained by tga afterward a smooth continuous weight loss occurs until 331 c which is followed by an abrupt mass loss of 22 94 up to 448 c this second mass loss step corresponds to a broad endothermic band observed by dsc with the maximum at 400 c which is consistent with the decomposition of magnesium hydroxide to mgo 65 and the complete oxidation of the organic matter 18 nevertheless in this study this peak is slightly shifted towards higher temperatures compared with data reported for other authors at around 350 c 58 65 or 381 3 c 66 the observed mass loss up to 448 c was 33 74 which is slightly larger than the theoretical value from the mg oh 2 to mgo transformation 30 8 58 65 this may be due to the presence of indigo carmine over the surface of the powder yielding the color of the powders above 600 c the mass loss was 6 8 overall we record a total mass loss of 40 54 up to 900 c 3 5 pollutants removal npoc and chloride ion removal with normalized removal results for each solution treated by electrocoagulation are given in table 3 organic matter removals of 57 1 79 6 and 90 4 are reached for the az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 2 samples respectively in addition chloride ion removals of 69 1 20 0 and 7 8 are also reached for the az31 0 az31 7 5 and az31 2 samples respectively an increase in npoc removal associated with a decrease in chloride ion removal is observed for all the samples obtained using the az31 az31 electrodes furthermore the organic matter removal capacity increases as the polarity reversal frequency increases while the chloride ion removal capacity decreases this stems from the inorganic speciation of dissolved elements in the aqueous media which affects the mechanism of coagulation and flocculation involved protonated magnesium sites mgoh2 predominate below ph 10 8 while deprotonated magnesium sites mgo dominate at higher ph although aluminum is also dissolved from the az31 electrodes its relative amount is expected to be much smaller compared to the concentration of magnesium consequently the analysis of these samples focuses only on the speciation of magnesium except for the sample az31 2 were gibbsite was identified the precipitate surface is positively charged during the electrocoagulation process without polarity change az31 0 due to the solution ph as previously demonstrate by the authors using zeta potential measurements 31 moreover the indigo carmine being an anionic dye with a pka value of 12 6 67 has a negative surface charge density that remains unchanged at the ph of the process therefore sulfonate groups so3 positioned at the extremes of the dye molecule and chloride ion may have been adsorbed in the protonated magnesium sites providing npoc and chloride ion removals slightly higher than 50 a related point to consider here is that the indigo carmine anion length and the big crystallite size of the particles formed may have reduced the removal capacity due to the orientation of the dye anion and the surface area available for adsorption respectively this is consistent with our previous report on the mechanisms of charge neutralization during indigo carmine removal by electrocoagulation with az31 and high purity magnesium anodes 31 secondly the dominant removal mechanism for the sample az31 7 5 at ph above 11 may have also involved the sweep flocculation where closely packed hydroxide precipitates tend to form a three dimensional network structure that entrap the pollutants after charge neutralization 68 69 in this aqueous system the electrostatic attraction between cl ic anion and magnesium hydroxide is less probable due to the presence of deprotonated magnesium sites mgo which explains the low chloride ion removal obtained under this polarity reversal frequency experiment otherwise the increase in the removal of npoc may be explained by the fact that sweep flocculation favors the removal of big molecules while small molecules like chloride ion are hardly removed similar results explain the removals obtained for the az31 al samples nevertheless they show an increased interaction with ic due to the presence of aluminum in a higher concentration at ph higher than 8 all the aluminum species are converted to al oh 4 70 thus the likelyhood for interactions between the coagulant and the chloride ion is diminished while the electrostatic attraction with aluminum hydroxides is unlikely regardless it has been reported that ic removal decreases at ph higher than 11 for electrocoagulation by using aluminum electrodes 71 al oh 4 may form interparticle bridging with the remaining mgoh2 sites to aid the sweep flocculation this means that the simultaneous presence of magnesium and aluminum or so called heterocoagulation favors the removal of organic matter on account of this the high ic removal can also be attributed to the highest specific electric charge applied 1 3 ah l vs 0 86 ah l the amorphous structure of the precipitates in the case of the sample az31 2 may have contributed to improving the organic matter removal because of its higher surface free energy 68 moreover the xrd analysis confirms gibbsite along with hydrotalcite and brucite structures in this case the low percentage of chloride removal is attributed again to the electrostatic repulsion between hydroxyaluminum species and chloride ions while the results of npoc are explained by a combination of sweep flocculation heterocoagulation and probably intercalation despite the high selectivity of ldh towards carbonate anions some of the carbonates and water intercalated in the hydrotalcite may have been exchanged by ic anions since the basal spacing of hydrotalcite is large enough to incorporate the ic anion 4 conclusions in this paper we report the simultaneous removal of npoc and chloride ion by electrocoagulation process with polarity change of az31 electrodes the mechanism of coagulation which depends on the speciation of dissolved elements in the aqueous media affects the removal of npoc and chloride the increase in polarity reversal frequency favors the organic matter removal instead of chloride adsorption a remarkable 69 of chloride removal capacity can be reached in situ during electrocoagulation without polarity change while the magnesium hydroxide precipitate is by produced electrostatic repulsion between al oh 4 and chloride ions significantly reduces the chloride removal capacity in the az31 2 and az31 al samples the removal of organic matter is favored by the electrostatic attraction between magnesium species and the dye as well as the sweep flocculation under polarity change intercalation may have also been present during the electrocoagulation performed at 2 min polarity change due to the joint presence of the hydrotalcite gibbsite and brucite crystalline phases the polarity change affects the structure the crystallinity and the crystallite size of the particles formed during the treatment while the increase in the polarity reversal frequency reduces the crystallite size of the precipitates x ray diffraction analysis shows that magnesium hydroxide is synthetized by electrocoagulation of indigo carmine and sodium chloride solution at room temperature without polarity change and with 7 5 min polarity change in the electrode system az31 az31 otherwise brucite is also formed in the electrode system az31 al besides the results conofirm the formation of hydrotalcite in the presence of indigo carmine by using only az31 electrodes and 15 cycles h 1 as polarity reversal frequency the tem images show that non uniform flake like magnesium hydroxide aggregate structures form with a wide range of sizes besides ftir results suggest that carbonates are a common
