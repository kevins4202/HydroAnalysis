1210,we investigated the relationship between some water quality parameters and microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria in different conditions of water temperature we also proposed to predict chlorophyll a concentration in the billings reservoir using three machine learning techniques our results indicate that in the condition of higher water temperatures with high density of cyanobacteria microcystin concentration can increase severely 102 μg l besides the magnitude observed in higher concentrations in water temperatures above 25 3 c classified as high extreme event higher frequencies of inadequate values of microcystin 87 5 chlorophyll a 70 and cyanobacteria 82 5 compared to cooler temperatures 19 6 c were observed the prediction of chlorophyll a in billings reservoir presented

availability the data that supports the findings of this study are available on infoáguas from cetesb https sistemainfoaguas cetesb sp gov br 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most dangerous factors for the aquatic ecosystem it affects water quality and aquatic life protection wang et al 2023 this phenomenon is related to water bodies nutrients enrichment by natural forces such as storms and surface runoff and anthropogenic actions which many times have accelerated the increase of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems ziaie et al 2019 halac et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 it has become a worldwide concern mainly related to reservoirs and lakes which with more stable water favor the appearance of the effects of eutrophication halac et al 2020 the increasing of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water besides the increase in turbidity may generate frequent phytoplankton blooms which are many times toxic organisms being a hazard to human health and aquatic ecosystem saha et al 2022 cyanobacteria is a group of gram negative photosynthetic prokaryotes that inhabits diverse types of environments from desert crusts to fresh and marine waters and in diverse geographic locations from tropical areas to the poles monchamp et al 2019 cyanobacteria blooms a biological and harmful phenomenon that is increasing worldwide smucker et al 2021 might enrich a water body with several types of toxins neurotoxic hepatotoxic or cytotoxic substances becoming a hazard to human health and being responsible for anoxia and food web alterations savadova et al 2018 thus cyanotoxins such as microcystin are important indicators of water quality in water supply reservoirs due to many implications on human health and impacts on the aquatic environment although the conventional method of drinking water treatment e g coagulation flocculation and filtration removes cyanobacteria cells as well as intracellular cyanotoxins there is a necessity of an additional treatment for extracellular cyanotoxins coffer et al 2021 a well known and harmful cyanotoxin is microcystin zhao et al 2019 microcystins are toxins produced intracellularly within cyanobacteria cells these toxins are formed by hepatotoxic cyclic peptides onyango et al 2020 these toxins are produced by microcystis a cyanobacteria genus characterized as non n2 fixing colonial cyanobacteria bogard et al 2020 reductions in water column irradiance high temperature and nitrogen availability can contribute to the dominance of n2 fixing colonial bacteria kramer et al 2018 complementarily other species of cyanobacteria can also produce this toxin such as planktothrix oscillatoria nostoc and dolichospermum water temperature is one of the most important physical factors of a lake s ecological ecosystem due to its importance in controlling biological activity through metabolic rates marañón et al 2018 yang et al 2018 also temperature limits the primary production globally thomas et al 2017 gerhard et al 2019 therefore to understand and evaluate phytoplankton biomass development it is crucial to evaluate the global changes generated on lake ecosystems bergström and karlsson 2019 and assess the effects due to global change on phytoplankton biomass and communities composition for this purpose chlorophyll a is often used as an indicator of phytoplanktonic biomass that is an index of algae and cyanobacterial blooms due to nutrient enrichment epa environmental protection agency u s a 2015 knowing the importance of chlorophyll a as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass and ecological status in water bodies huang et al 2022 kim et al 2022 many studies have been done applying machine learning techniques to predict the concentration of this pigment in freshwater estuaries and marine environments carvalho et al 2022 huang et al 2022 kim and ahn 2022 kim et al 2022 kim and ahn 2022 found that using the random forest model the best model included 10 parameters including total phosphorus and water temperature kim et al 2022 found that the best model for the prediction of chlorophyll a was xgboost with svr also presenting good performance they found particulate organic matter and dissolved oxygen as the most important environmental factors huang et al 2022 also used the random forest method with high accuracy and total phosphorus as the most important factor for chlorophyll a prediction besides the application for chlorophyll a prediction random forest has also been applied for algal community structure prediction liu et al 2022 the authors found satisfactory results thus demonstrating the robustness capacity of random forest for diverse applications in freshwater ecology areas in this context this study firstly aimed to analyze the influence of physical water temperature wt and chemical nutrients aspects of water quality on the production of microcystin in billings reservoir according to ribeiro et al 2020 this reservoir is one of the biggest sources of water supply of são paulo metropolitan region rmsp however it has been presenting recurrent cyanobacterial blooms resulting in inadequate levels of cyanotoxins therefore considering the already known adverse impacts to the ecosystem and public health caused by these blooms it is of fundamental importance to carry out studies that allow us to identify the main natural and anthropic factors that contribute to their occurrence and in addition to seek the elaboration of models that allow predicting these phenomena with high reliability for this objective the hypothesis that we assumed was that the level of toxin in this reservoir is regulated by nutrients in elevated temperatures besides that we aimed to find scenarios that are most probable to find high microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria concentrations to get to this objective we proposed to use different treatments using a statistical inference 20th and 80th percentile as extreme values for this objective we assumed the hypothesis that the ideal condition would be in high temperatures with high nutrient concentrations the third objective of this work was to compare different methods of prediction of chla to achieve this objective we proposed to use randomforest rf linear regression lr and support machine vector smv to simulate the variation of chlorophyll a over the variation of the chosen predictors and to test the model to evaluate the models we used the following metrics coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse we therefore bring a novel methodology to evaluate the correlation between microcystin and environmental factors such as nutrients and abundance of cyanobacteria in different levels of water temperature besides that the prediction of chlorophyll a using a few predictors and the applied techniques is also novel for this important brazilian water reservoir 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed by collecting public data from são paulo environmental agency companhia ambiental do estado de são paulo cetesb 2022 from billings reservoir data were collected from 1987 to 2020 with approximately three to four campaigns per year however in some years with one or two campaigns this reservoir is located west of são paulo city 23 47 s 46 40 w its watershed posseses an area of 560 km2 and the reservoir s uses are fisheries flow control leisure power generation and water supply moschini carlos et al 2009 due to various blooms of cyanobacteria and a decrease in water quality registered the reservoir was subdivided into five regions central body i central body ii taquacetuba bororé rio grande rio pequeno and capivari pedra branca to facilitate management and to monitor the quality of this aquatic environment ribeiro et al 2020 billings reservoir is the largest freshwater in the são paulo metropolitan region with an area of 127km2 and volume of 1228 7 106 m3 and a maximum depth of 18 m marcondes et al 2021 fig 1 shows the the location of são paulo in brazil left upper part the location of the reservoir in the state of são paulo right upper part and the sampling points location in the reservoir lower part 2 2 data more than seventy parameters were initially downloaded from cetesb website companhia ambiental do estado de são paulo cetesb 2022 for the initial evaluation of the environmental quality of this water body in four different locations however we selected only a few of them based on the objectives of this study and also on some previous studies that applied these parameters in studies related to aspects of water quality therefore the chosen parameters were chlorophyll a chla μg l cyanobacteria cyano cell ml 1 water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do mg l 1 ph biochemical oxygen demand bod mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod mg l 1 ammoniacal nitrogen mg l 1 total nitrogen tn mg l 1 total phosphorus tp mg l 1 nitrite mg l 1 nitrate mg l 1 manganese mg l 1 magnesium mg l 1 potassium mg l 1 sodium mg l 1 turbidity ntu and microcystin μg l 1 2 3 classifications and treatments 2 3 1 extreme events of water temperature for the first objective of this research we divided the values of wt into three categories based on percentile high extreme events ee of wt were classified as being the values equal or superior to the value found on the 80th percentile 25 3 c low extreme events of wt were classified as being the values equal or inferior to the value found on the 20th percentile 19 6 c intermediate range of wt is defined by the values between the extreme events 2 3 2 extreme events of other water quality parameters for the treatment to find the optimum condition for increasing microcystin chla and cyano concentration we defined extreme events of low and high values for do tp tpn and wt mentioned previously for do the values were 3 mg l 1 low ee and 9 3 mg l 1 high ee for tp the values were 0 04 mg l 1 low ee and 0 43 mg l 1 high ee for tn the values were 1 mg l 1 low ee and 2 59 mg l 1 high ee in addition we performed one more treatment for fig a3 see appendixes we considered in this analysis only the high ee of some parameters to calculate the percentage of high values of microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria the parameters with respective values were ammoniacal nitrogen 4 328 mg l 1 kn 6 45 mg l 1 nitrate 1 13 mg l 1 nitrite 0 15 mg l 1 tn 2 59 mg l 1 tp 0 43 mg l 1 and wt 25 3 c 2 3 3 definition of elevated chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations and cyanobacteria density we defined the high values of chla 50 μg l 1 and cyanobacteria 100 000 cell ml 1 based on the limits established by the world health organization who 2003 as being the minimum value to be considered as of high potential risk for human health in recreational waters in case of cyanobacteria dominance for microcystin extreme values were considered as being equal or superior to the maximum limit established 1 μg l 1 for drinking water in accordance with environmental protection agency usa and brazilian legislation epa environmental protection agency u s a 2015 rego et al 2019 2 4 statistical analyses 2 4 1 evaluation of linear correlations correlation analysis was applied to identify the best relationships among the water quality parameters with the objective of explaining mainly the factors that are influencing microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria concentrations in billings reservoir to evaluate the strength and the significance of correlation the coefficient of determination r2 pearson s r value and p value were used we assumed as significant p values lower than 0 1 p value 0 1 a confidence level of 90 however most of all correlations were smaller compared to this established limit previously 2 4 2 frequency of unacceptable values to analyze the effects of ee on water quality parameters we calculated the frequency of unacceptable values of chlorophyll a cyanobacteria and microcystin in those conditions we used the following formula to calculate 1 frequency x i x n where xi is the amount of observations above the limit for the parameters for an extreme event condition xn is the total number of observations 2 5 machine learning ml in this study three techniques of ml were applied random forest breiman 2001 support vector machine cortes and vapnik 1995 and linear regression simple and multiple we transformed the variables chla cyano tp and tn using log10 before the prediction initially we created and tested the correlations between chla and cyano n 224 chla and tp n 395 and chla and tn n 107 in this first moment we did not split the dataset in training and testing as objectives to see the relationship between the dependent variable with the selected independent variables once we found the best predictor between these parameters we split the dataset randomly using the following function set seed 020622 in r software in this new test we split the dataset into training 75 n 155 and testing 25 n 52 for the new prediction we also added the parameter wt and we excluded tn due to lower amount of observations compared to other parameters the models were validated using a 10 fold cross validation procedure the codes generated to predict chlorophyll a using svm rf and lm are in the end of appendixes different values of the hyperparameters for the rf and svm models were tested earlier also other environmental variables were included in the model however with inferior results table 1 shows the parameters with respective values used in each prediction for the evaluation of the predictions we used the following metrics coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse 3 results 3 1 correlations between the water quality parameters no extreme events water quality in billings reservoir varied over time microcystin varied from a low concentration 0 16 μg l to an extremely high concentration 236 μg l the maximum value was found in a rainy period in january 2015 the highest value in a rainy condition could be the result of nutrient inputs from agricultural run off gibbs et al 2022 melaram et al 2022 which favor the growth of toxic organisms and consequently the production of the toxin in this collection a high concentration of chla 946 24 μg l and cyanobacteria 3 248 655 cell ml with low dissolved oxygen concentration 4 56 mg l 1 in high water temperature 27 78 c chlorophyll a varied from 2 81 μg l to 1470 μg l was also observed the highest concentration of chla was also found in a rainy period in january of 2015 for this point there is no information about microcystin concentration however the concentration of cyanobacteria remained high 3 333 935 cell ml with high do concentration 8 25 mg l 1 and water temperature 27 64 c this value of cyanobacteria was the maximum density found in billings reservoir using this dataset the smallest density was of 106 cell ml in a dry period in september 2007 this collection also presented low concentration of microcystin 0 16 μg l do 5 1 mg l 1 chla 6 94 μg l tp 0 02 mg l 1 and water temperature 19 3 c tp varied from very low concentration 0 006 mg l 1 to elevated concentration 9 5 mg l 1 the high concentration of tp was seen in september 1991 with low value of wt 21 c and do 2 5 mg l 1 for the verification of environmental conditions that may be contributing to a decrease in water quality we applied linear regressions which is a statistical tool to evaluate the correlation between two variables through the coefficient of determination r2 pearson r value and p value from this point some water quality parameters presented significant correlations between themselves for billings reservoir data the variability of chlorophyll a might be explained by the variability of the following parameters see appendices table a1 wt chla log10 pearson s r 0 31 p value 0 0005 n 423 ph chla log10 pearson s r 0 27 p value 0 0005 n 425 microcystin both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 70 p value 0 0005 n 49 cyanobacteria both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 65 p value 0 0005 n 224 bod both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 62 p value 0 0005 n 353 cod both transformed log10 pearson s r 0

0005 n 230 and na both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 38 p value 0 0005 n 230 these results inform that some chemical elements are important factors for chla production in billings reservoir in order of importance according to pearson s r value are phosphorus tp nitrogen tn and kn potassium k magnesium mg and sodium na in addition the mentioned result above also informs that cyanobacteria is supposed to be the dominant species in the phytoplankton community most of all times from 10 water samples at least 6 times the variation of chlorophyll a might be explained by cyanobacteria variation besides that the increase in turbidity in billings reservoir is more inclinable to be due to algal biomass than soil particles and minerals in the selected sampling points bod presented moderate relationship with chlorophyll a which means that for these sampling points the increase in bod concentration is frequently explained by autochthonous organic matter from primary producers biomass finally we found that wt although it presents weaker relationship with chla is also influencing in the increase of this pigment chla in billings reservoir presents a moderate to strong relationship with microcystin which can be used as a predictor of this toxin cyanobacteria presented significant correlations with chla as observed previously tp both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 45 p value 0 0005 n 211 turbidity both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 56 p value 0 0005 n 221 k both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 28 p value 0 0005 n 137 na both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 21 p value 0

0005 n 49 while microcystin presented significant correlations with chla and cyanobacteria as observed previously wt microcystin transformed log10 pearson s r 0 53 p value 0 0005 n 48 tp both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 48 p value 0 0005 n 48 and k both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 24 p value 0 0005 n 34 3 2 correlation between microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria with phosphorus and nitrogen in wt extreme conditions having verified the correlations with other parameters we selected some of the predictors of each variable that are well described in the literature to test our hypothesis that microcystin concentration is influenced by climatic conditions and the availability of nutrients we also verified the correlations with nutrients in extreme events of wt for chla and cyanobacteria the extreme events of wt were defined by the 20th percentile low wt and the 80th hight wt fig 2 shows the correlation between microcystin and total phosphorus a b microcystin and cyanobacteria c d and microcystin and chlorophyll a e f in high and low extreme conditions of water temperature low ee 19 6 c high ee 25 3 c in billings reservoir despite the low number of collected observations for microcystin ntotal 51 and between these ranges nhigh ee 8 nlow ee 9 we can see a stronger and significative correlation between the toxin concentration and some water quality parameters in the condition of high ee although tp was significantly correlated with microcystin in high temperatures this relationship is not observed with nitrogen microcystin in higher values of wt were therefore stronger correlated to cyanobacteria density r2 0 93 p value 0 0002 n 8 tp r2 0 89 p value 0 0004 n 7 and chla r2 0 82 p value 0 002 n 8 between the intermediate values no extreme events were found weaker but significant correlations between microcystin and chla log10 r2 0 31 p value 0 002 n 31 and microcystin and cyano log10 r2 0 12 p value 0 07 n 29 significant correlation between microcystin and tp log10 r2 0 09 p value 0 05 n 31 was not found we suggest that the elevated temperatures are driving the production of microcystin in adequate levels of tp in high ee a lower number of observations of microcystin with nitrogen forms were seen nammoniacal 4 nkn 5 nnitrate 4 nnitrite 4 ntn 3 even in low number of observations significant correlations between microcystin and nitrogen forms in this condition were not found differently from tp also in low ee nammoniacal 7 nkn 7 nnitrate 9 nnitrite 8 ntn 2 no significant correlations were found between microcystin and nitrogen forms n 4 among the intermediate values nammoniacal 25 nkn 26 nnitrate 27 nnitrite 19 ntn 5 significant correlations were found just to kn and tn with microcystin kn r2 0 14 p value 0 06 tn r2 0 82 p value 0 04 kn which quantifies the sum of ammonia particulate nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen in the sample rus et al 2012 presented a weak relationship in the intermediate values of wt while tn presented a strong correlation most especially in the analysis presented in fig 2 we can see that with an increase in the water temperature 25 3 c under the condition of microcystin producers species present in the water and high concentration of phosphorus this toxin can achieve very elevated concentrations in billings reservoir 102 μg l besides the microcystin correlation with the water quality parameters in the extreme conditions of wt we also investigated the correlation between cyanobacteria and nutrients and chlorophyll a fig 3 and chlorophyll a and nutrients fig 4 in high ee of wt we found a strong relationship between cyanobacteria and total phosphorus r2 0 57 p value 0 0005 cyanobacteria and total nitrogen r2 0 42 p value 0 02 and cyanobacteria and chlorophyll a r2 0 73 p value 0 00005 see fig 3 in the intermediate values of wt we found although significative a weaker correlation between cyanobacteria and tp r2 0 19 p value 0 0005 and a weaker correlation between cyanobacteria and chla r2 0 31 p value 0 0005 a nonsignificative relationship between cyanobacteria and tn was observed in the intermediate ranges of wt in the low ee only the correlation between cyanobacteria and chla was significant r2 0 25 p value 0 005 it means that in cooler wt the increase of chla is 25 explained by cyanobacteria density it reinforces the preference of cyanobacteria species of billings reservoir for warmer waters in relation to the other nitrogen forms ammoniacal nitrate nitrite kn in high ee only nitrite r2 0 20 p value 0 06 presented a significant correlation with cyanobacteria however in the intermediate range there is no significant correlation between nitrite and cyanobacteria no significant result was also observed in the correlation between these variables in low ee no significant correlation was observed between the other forms in low ee in the intermediate ranges ammoniacal nitrogen r2 0 08 p value 0 003 and kn r2 0 05 p value 0 02 presented a significant correlation with cyanobacteria in relation to chla and nutrients as observed previously for microcystin and cyanobacteria the correlation was stronger in high ee of wt it is important to point out that chla presented a significative correlation with tp in the three conditions high ee r2 0 77 p value 0 000005 intermediate values r2 0 40 p value 0 000005 low ee r2 0 08 p value 0 02 chla and tn presented significant correlation only for the conditions of high ee r2 0 53 p value 0 000005 and intermediate values of wt r2 0 39 p value 0 000005 there is no significant correlation between chla and tn in low ee of wt in comparison with other nitrogen forms chla presented significant correlations with kn in high ee of wt r2 0 10 p value 0 02 intermediate values of wt r2 0 36 p value 0 000005 and in low ee r2 0 09 p value 0 04 chla was not significantly correlated with ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate p value 0 1 90 of confidence level however chla was correlated with nitrite in high ee of wt r2 0 36 p value 0 00002 and in intermediate values r2 0 08 p value 0 002 no significant correlation between chla and nitrite was found in low ee of wt fig a1 see appendixes shows boxplot graphs for microcystin chlorophyll a cyanobacteria and total phosphorus in different ranges of water temperature these different ranges of wt were selected to identify in which ranges occur the highest values of the parameters it is possible to see that higher concentrations of microcystin were found between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 although between 28 c and 30 c wt 28 30 high concentrations of microcystin were also seen for chla the smallest variability was seen between 17 c and 20 c wt 17 20 the highest variability and median were observed between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 there are high values of chla in all wt ranges indicating that low wt does not limit chla to low concentrations cyanobacteria presented higher concentrations of high densities between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 and between 28 c and 30 c wt 28 30 tp is not directly associated with wt its concentration increases in the water by sewage release diffuse pollution or resuspension from sediment however in this case we verified that the highest medians were seen between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 and 17 c and 20 c wt 17 20 fig a2 see appendixes shows the coefficient of determination r2 and rmse with the significance of the microcystin prediction using chlorophyll a cyanobacteria and tp as a predictor in the three conditions wt 19 6 c wt 19 6 c wt 25 3 c wt 25 3 c cyanobacteria presented the highest value of r2 and lowest rmse in the condition of high temperatures wt 25 3 c chlorophyll a presented smaller r2 and higher rmse than cyanobacteria and tp in high ee wt 25 3 c tp presented high r2 value in high ee of wt and the highest rmse value in cooler water wt 19 6 c see fig 5 3 3 treatments to find the optimum condition for high observations of microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria besides the correlation of the parameters chla microcystin cyano in extreme conditions of wt we did some treatments to identify the variability of these variables under different conditions of water temperature associated with nutrients and dissolved oxygen concentration despite the limited number of observations these results give us an initial idea about the range that these parameters can reach for each condition and what treatment is most favorable to have higher and lower values for each variable of course in a scenario with a larger dataset the results would be stronger through this new approach to evaluating the effects of different conditions on chla cyano and microcystin using the established values by the 20th and 80th percentile it was possible to see that in the condition of high wt and do chla had the highest amplitude in this condition higher numbers of observations were seen above the threshold established by who in recreational water considering high risk for human health in case of cyanobacteria dominance in the conditions of low wt and high do and low wt and do some observations were higher than the threshold however most observations were lower than 50 μg l the only observation for the condition of high wt and low do presented a low chla concentration in this condition the smallest density of cyanobacteria for the treatments using wt and do was observed cyanobacteria presented values above the limit in three conditions high wt and do low wt and high do and low wt and do however in the condition of low wt and do it is more expected to have cyanobacteria densities lower than the limit established by who as possible high risk for human health cyano 100 00 cell ml in addition for the conditions of high wt and do and low wt and high do all values of cyanobacteria were higher than the used threshold although microcystin had low number of observations for all treatments it was possible to note that it followed the trends of chla and cyano for these treatments as expected low concentration in the condition of low wt and do and higher observations at high wt and do as observed previously tp plays an important role for chla and microcystin production and cyano abundance in billings reservoir mainly in the condition of high wt see figs 2a 3a 4a associating the extreme conditions of wt with the extreme conditions of tp we found that in scenarios of low tp concentration smaller values of chla cyano and microcystin were observed for chla most of all values were below the established limit while for cyano the values were predominantly higher than the limit although lower values were also found microcystin had only one observation which stood below the limit in the condition of low wt and tp finally in the condition of high wt and tp the values were so much higher compared to those conditions of low tp for the conditions considering wt and tn lower values of chla were seen than for the conditions of high wt and low tn and low wt and high tn for cyano low density was observed in low wt and high tn microcystin presented lower concentration in low wt and high tn and a high concentration in the condition of high wt and tn in this condition high values of chla and cyano were also observed we also performed another test considering only high extreme events of wt ammoniacal nitrogen nitrate nitrite kn tp and tn to identify the frequency of inadequate values of chla cyano and microcystin fig a3 low observations of microcystin were seen mainly in high extreme events of kn nitrate and tn where all those observations n 3 were higher than the limit established by the environmental protection agency usa epa and brazilian legislation epa environmental protection agency u s a 2015 rego et al 2019 from this analysis we can also see that there is a higher probability of seeing the effects of high extreme events of wt in cyano abundance and microcystin when compared to the photosynthetic pigment chla in relation to nitrogen forms with the exceptions of nitrate and nitrite in high extreme events of kn ammoniacal nitrogen and tn these events were more important to chla and microcystin than cyano high ee of tp presented high frequency of inadequate values for the three parameters reinforcing that this element has been crucial for increasing cyanobacteria abundance chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations in billings reservoir 3 4 chlorophyll a prediction we used three important machine learning techniques to predict the chla concentration in billings reservoir initially it was used just one parameter to simplify the models for the prediction to verify the importance of each variable on chla production cyanobacteria total phosphorus and total nitrogen were chosen as the predictors due to high correlation and significance between chla and these parameters observed in the previous results fig 6 shows the observed points of each collection corresponding in each variable with the generated curve by rf and svm models and the correlation between observed and predicted values although lr curve was not plotted we calculated the metrics for this model as well the lr model presented a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 43 in the relationship between chla and cyano the svm presented a r2 equal to 0 37 and rf presented a r2 of 0 41 after the construction of the models we also tested using all values in the dataset to verify which technique presented higher capability of chla prediction using cyano as predictor lr presented the lowest r2 0 45 and highest rmse 0 31 with svm presenting the intermediate values of metrics r2 0 54 rmse 0 28 and rf being the best technique r2 0 87 rmse 0 15 in the correlation between chla and tp the lr model presented a r2 of 0 41 while svm presented a r2 of 0 45 and rf a r2 of 0 41 however the results of predictions showed the best result for rf r2 0 59 rmse 0 26 followed by svm r2 0 49 rmse 0 29 and lr r2 0 41 rmse 0 31 in the correlation between chla and tn lr presented a r2 of 0 34 while svm a r2 of 0 22 and rf a r2 of 0 13 despite the lower values of the models the correlation between observed and predicted values showed a better correlation rf presented the best result r2 0 73 rmse 0 19 followed by svm r2 0 36 rmse 0 29 and lr r2 0 34 rmse 0 30 after this previous analysis using all datasets with one parameter to create the model and test with all values we created a model using three predictors cyano wt and tp we used 75 of the data randomly selected to create the model for the models we obtained the following results r2 0 62 lr r2 0 54 svm and r2 0 60 rf due to a low number of available observations nmodel 155 ntest 52 and considering only three parameters to estimate the chla concentration this result is satisfactory amorim et al 2021 used 12 parameters to predict chlorophyll a it is also important to point out that the construction of the model using only these parameters presented good results for billings reservoir which is recognized by blooms of cyanobacteria in the case of oligotrophic reservoir and lakes or in other conditions other parameters will be needed to be addressed to the model as observed by shin et al 2020 amorim et al 2021 ly et al 2021 and carvalho et al 2022 fig 7 shows the points selected to create the model and for the test and the results of the correlations between observed and predicted values using the three techniques it is possible to see that for these three techniques we obtained higher values of r2 and lower values of rmse compared to the previous analysis using one parameter with all datasets the only exception is for rf using cyanobacteria 4 discussion this study provides an investigation of how water temperature affects the microcystin and chlorophyll a production and cyanobacteria density in an important reservoir in brazil billings reservoir this study brings a new approach to understanding the correlation between the environmental variables which many times are correlated without the characterization of the different climatic conditions of the collections most specifically we performed linear correlations in high and low extreme events of wt defined by the percentile 20th and 80th investigations of the relationship between microcystin and nutrients have been evaluated and discussed in many studies wu et al 2006 wang et al 2010 yu et al 2014 fortin et al 2015 these studies include the relationship between microcystin in different tn tp ratio ranges to calculate the probability of microcystin concentration exceeding a certain value of concentration scott et al 2013 correlation of different microcystins rr yr lr and water quality parameters wu et al 2006 verification of microcystin concentrations in values of tn tp ratio fortin et al 2015 variation of microcystin concentration in different sites and months with the correlation between this toxin and water quality parameters yu et al 2014 correlation between extracellular and intracellular microcystins and water quality parameters wang et al 2010 but none of these studies investigated the correlation between microcystin and water quality parameters in different conditions of wt the strength and significance of the correlations between the variables chla cyano and microcystin and nutrients were influenced by the condition of wt it is important to point out that overall chla was significantly correlated with wt ph cyano microcystin bod cod kn tp tn turbidity k mg and na cyano beyond chla and microcystin was significantly correlated with tp turbidity k na kn tn bod and wt microcystin was significantly correlated with chla cyano wt tp and k however we considered only chla cyano microcystin tp and tn for the correlation analysis in the extreme conditions of wt the strongest correlation between the parameters with nutrients was seen in the highest wt values see figs 2 3 and 4 in high ee of wt microcystin was strongly correlated with cyano tp and chla it indicates that these parameters could be important predictors of microcystin concentration in billings reservoir in warmer seasons the importance of water temperature for microcystin production was also observed by wu et al 2006 this behavior can be explained since water temperature is a physical parameter that regulates various biological and chemical processes in aqueous systems marañón et al 2018 according to the metabolic theory of ecology mte temperature and size influence the metabolic rate of all animals fernández gonzález and marañón 2021 therefore temperature influence includes metabolic activities of photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria and microalgae besides the influence of wt adequate levels of nutrients in this study more strongly related to phosphorus are necessary for microcystin production these results are corroborated by pham 2019 who suggests that an increase in temperature with the nutrient concentrations may drive more frequent cyanobacteria blooms and higher concentrations of microcystin therefore higher water temperature influences the metabolic activities and phosphorus is a vital component for algae growth and metabolites production such as chlorophyll a and microcystin zhang et al 2022 microcystin concentration did not present a significant correlation with nitrogen in high and low extreme events of wt the only significant correlations between microcystin and nitrogen were microcystin and kn and microcystin and tn in the intermediate range of wt martin et al 2020 tested three concentrations of nitrogen through nitrate to evaluate the response in microcystin concentration in high nitrogen concentration the authors suggest that the limitation is due to other nutrients such as phosphorus but in low concentration it resulted in nitrogen limitation they concluded that overall nitrogen concentration produced low effect on the overall response of microcystin pimentel and giani 2014 also found that nutrient deprivation can also influence microcystin production despite that high concentrations of microcystin were seen in extreme events of ammoniacal nitrogen kn and tn see fig a3 monchamp et al 2014 did not find a direct effect of nitrogen on microcystin concentration but an effect on cyanobacteria species composition nitrogen presented a weaker correlation with cyanobacteria in the three observed conditions compared to phosphorus tn presented only a significant correlation with cyanobacteria at high ee of wt gobler et al 2016 affirm that there is still a gap in the understanding of the influence of nitrogen in cyanobacteria blooms tp demonstrated to be most important for chla and microcystin production and cyanobacteria density in the studied water body gardner et al 2008 affirm that in some cases phosphorus might limit the primary production while for other lakes nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in our results phosphorus seems to be the limiting nutrient for algal growth cyanobacteria abundance and microcystin production mainly at higher temperatures wen et al 2020 affirm that p is a limiting nutrient in lakes and reservoirs in the condition of high ee of wt wt 25 3 c we found that 87 5 of the observations n 8 of microcystin were higher than the limit established by epa and brazilian legislation in the intermediate values of wt 67 7 of the observations n 31 were higher than the limit and in low ee of wt wt 19 6 c 44 4 of the observations n 9 were higher than the limit some studies have been performed among other objectives to understand the conditions of temperature that influence microcystin concentration dziallas and grossart 2011 scherer et al 2017 bui et al 2018 walls et al 2018 trung et al 2022 dziallas and grossart 2011 found higher values of microcystin mc yr and mc lr in higher values of wt at 26 c and 32 c when compared to 20 c we also found in our results higher concentrations of microcystin in wt above 26 c when compared to temperatures below 26 c fig a1 scherer et al 2017 found that in elevated temperatures occurs the increased gene expression of at least one microcystin gene but the range of wt with higher values of microcystin is not the same for those microcystin concentrations seen by walls et al 2018 between 20 c and 25 c in their study the lake is predominantly dominated by planktothrix agardhii while billings reservoir might have other species dominating the phytoplankton community with higher microcystin production capacity in higher temperatures as our results indicate we suggest that a possible specie that is dominating the phytoplankton community is microcystis which is a specie recognized for its preference in warmer waters liu et al 2011 found a strong correlation between water temperature and microcystis biomass r2 0 90 n 129 in lake taihu imai et al 2009 found that species of microcystin were significantly higher in cell density in certain ranges of wt m aeruginosa higher at 35 c m wesenbergii at 25 c or 30 c than at 20 c bui et al 2018 verified that increased wt can promote growth of tropical microcystis lower microcystin concentrations above 28 c compared to the range between 26 c and 28 c with one exception above 28 c were also observed by trung et al 2022 they found higher concentrations of microcystin at 27 c compared to the concentrations at 31 c 35 c and 37 c the authors affirm that lower microcystin values in higher wt might be a consequence of the binding of microcystin to proteins due to a higher oxidative stress caused by higher temperatures which is mitigated through the binding of microcystin to proteins this fact of the increase of microcystin in the increase in the values of wt is limited to certain ranges as also observed by bui et al 2018 the authors found a higher concentration at 27 c than at 37 c in high ee of wt chla presented 70 of the observations n 91 above the limit established by world health organization who 2003 as a potential risk for human health in case of dominance of cyanobacteria in recreational waters in intermediate values 47 2 of the observations n 258 were above the limit and in low ee of wt 28 3 of the observations were higher than the limit in relation to cyanobacteria in high ee of wt 82 5 was above the limit n 40 while in the intermediate values it was 71 n 138 and in low ee of wt n 45 60 above the limit gardner et al 2008 also found an increase in chla in increasing wt and a decrease in chla in decreasing wt beaulieu et al 2013 also found a strong correlation between chla production log10 and wt and tp concentration in relation to the prediction of chla in billings reservoir initially our results show rf as the best model while the cyanobacteria was the best predictor currently many studies have been developed to evaluate the prediction of chla in freshwater bodies estuaries and marine environment mainly with a hold out method diouf and seck 2019 shin et al 2020 amorim et al 2021 chang et al 2021 after that we divided our data in 75 to create the model and 25 to test the model using cyano tp and wt as predictors our results indicated that based on values of r2 and rmse the best model for chla prediction in billings reservoir was svm as observed by jiang et al 2011 mamun et al 2020 and amorim et al 2021 but not observed by carvalho that found rf as one of the best predictions of chla in addition the best model observed was considering only three parameters cyanobacteria tp and wt 5 conclusion through this investigation we can provide interesting aspects of microcystin production in billings reservoir previous studies brought precious information about the influence of wt on microcystin concentration our results are corroborated by the findings of some of these studies dziallas and grossart 2011 scherer et al 2017 trung et al 2022 the range with higher concentrations of this toxin was between 26 c and 28 c still in wt above 25 3 c higher frequencies of unacceptable values of microcystin chla and cyano were found reinforcing that in warmer seasons the production of the toxin might increase considerably mainly in high concentration of tp in this study in billings reservoir phosphorus was the limiting nutrient for cyano chla and microcystin through the machine learning techniques we discovered that chla in billings reservoir is extremely dependent of cyano density tp concentration and wt svm presented the best result compared to rf and multiple lr credit authorship contribution

1210,we investigated the relationship between some water quality parameters and microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria in different conditions of water temperature we also proposed to predict chlorophyll a concentration in the billings reservoir using three machine learning techniques our results indicate that in the condition of higher water temperatures with high density of cyanobacteria microcystin concentration can increase severely 102 μg l besides the magnitude observed in higher concentrations in water temperatures above 25 3 c classified as high extreme event higher frequencies

availability the data that supports the findings of this study are available on infoáguas from cetesb https sistemainfoaguas cetesb sp gov br 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most dangerous factors for the aquatic ecosystem it affects water quality and aquatic life protection wang et al 2023 this phenomenon is related to water bodies nutrients enrichment by natural forces such as storms and surface runoff and anthropogenic actions which many times have accelerated the increase of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems ziaie et al 2019 halac et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 it has become a worldwide concern mainly related to reservoirs and lakes which with more stable water favor the appearance of the effects of eutrophication halac et al 2020 the increasing of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water besides the increase in turbidity may generate frequent phytoplankton blooms which are many times toxic organisms being a hazard to human health and aquatic ecosystem saha et al 2022 cyanobacteria is a group of gram negative photosynthetic prokaryotes that inhabits diverse types of environments from desert crusts to fresh and marine waters and in diverse geographic locations from tropical areas to the poles monchamp et al 2019 cyanobacteria blooms a biological and harmful phenomenon that is increasing worldwide smucker et al 2021 might enrich a water body with several types of toxins neurotoxic hepatotoxic or cytotoxic substances becoming a hazard to human health and being responsible for anoxia and food web alterations savadova et al 2018 thus cyanotoxins such as microcystin are important indicators of water quality in water supply reservoirs due to many implications on human health and impacts on the aquatic environment although the conventional method of drinking water treatment e g coagulation flocculation and filtration removes cyanobacteria cells as well as intracellular cyanotoxins there is a necessity of an additional treatment for extracellular cyanotoxins coffer et al 2021 a well known and harmful cyanotoxin is microcystin zhao et al 2019 microcystins are toxins produced intracellularly within cyanobacteria cells these toxins are formed by hepatotoxic cyclic peptides onyango et al 2020 these toxins are produced by microcystis a cyanobacteria genus characterized as non n2 fixing colonial cyanobacteria bogard et al 2020 reductions in water column irradiance high temperature and nitrogen availability can contribute to the dominance of n2 fixing colonial bacteria kramer et al 2018 complementarily other species of cyanobacteria can also produce this toxin such as planktothrix oscillatoria nostoc and dolichospermum water temperature is one of the most important physical factors of a lake s ecological ecosystem due to its importance in controlling biological activity through metabolic rates marañón et al 2018 yang et al 2018 also temperature limits the primary production globally thomas et al 2017 gerhard et al 2019 therefore to understand and evaluate phytoplankton biomass development it is crucial to evaluate the global changes generated on lake ecosystems bergström and karlsson 2019 and assess the effects due to global change on phytoplankton biomass and communities composition for this purpose chlorophyll a is often used as an indicator of phytoplanktonic biomass that is an index of algae and cyanobacterial blooms due to nutrient enrichment epa environmental protection agency u s a 2015 knowing the importance of chlorophyll a as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass and ecological status in water bodies huang et al 2022 kim et al 2022 many studies have been done applying machine learning techniques to predict the concentration of this pigment in freshwater estuaries and marine environments carvalho et al 2022 huang et al 2022 kim and ahn 2022 kim et al 2022 kim and ahn 2022 found that using the random forest model the best model included 10 parameters including total phosphorus and water temperature kim et al 2022 found that the best model for the prediction of chlorophyll a was xgboost with svr also presenting good performance they found particulate organic matter and dissolved oxygen as the most important environmental factors huang et al 2022 also used the random forest method with high accuracy and total phosphorus as the most important factor for chlorophyll a prediction besides the application for chlorophyll a prediction random forest has also been applied for algal community structure prediction liu et al 2022 the authors found satisfactory results thus demonstrating the robustness capacity of random forest for diverse applications in freshwater ecology areas in this context this study firstly aimed to analyze the influence of physical water temperature wt and chemical nutrients aspects of water quality on the production of microcystin in billings reservoir according to ribeiro et al 2020 this reservoir is one of the biggest sources of water supply of são paulo metropolitan region rmsp however it has been presenting recurrent cyanobacterial blooms resulting in inadequate levels of cyanotoxins therefore considering the already known adverse impacts to the ecosystem and public health caused by these blooms it is of fundamental importance to carry out studies that allow us to identify the main natural and anthropic factors that contribute to their occurrence and in addition to seek the elaboration of models that allow predicting these phenomena with high reliability for this objective the hypothesis that we assumed was that the level of toxin in this reservoir is regulated by nutrients in elevated temperatures besides that we aimed to find scenarios that are most probable to find high microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria concentrations to get to this objective we proposed to use different treatments using a statistical inference 20th and 80th percentile as extreme values for this objective we assumed the hypothesis that the ideal condition would be in high temperatures with high nutrient concentrations the third objective of this work was to compare different methods of prediction of chla to achieve this objective we proposed to use randomforest rf linear regression lr and support machine vector smv to simulate the variation of chlorophyll a over the variation of the chosen predictors and to test the model to evaluate the models we used the following metrics coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse we therefore bring a novel methodology to evaluate the correlation between microcystin and environmental factors such as nutrients and abundance of cyanobacteria in different levels of water temperature besides that the prediction of chlorophyll a using a few predictors and the applied techniques is also novel for this important brazilian water reservoir 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed by collecting public data from são paulo environmental agency companhia ambiental do estado de são paulo cetesb 2022 from billings reservoir data were collected from 1987 to 2020 with approximately three to four campaigns per year however in some years with one or two campaigns this reservoir is located west of são paulo city 23 47 s 46 40 w its watershed posseses an area of 560 km2 and the reservoir s uses are fisheries flow control leisure power generation and water supply moschini carlos et al 2009 due to various blooms of cyanobacteria and a decrease in water quality registered the reservoir was subdivided into five regions central body i central body ii taquacetuba bororé rio grande rio pequeno and capivari pedra branca to facilitate management and to monitor the quality of this aquatic environment ribeiro et al 2020 billings reservoir is the largest freshwater in the são paulo metropolitan region with an area of 127km2 and volume of 1228 7 106 m3 and a maximum depth of 18 m marcondes et al 2021 fig 1 shows the the location of são paulo in brazil left upper part the location of the reservoir in the state of são paulo right upper part and the sampling points location in the reservoir lower part 2 2 data more than seventy parameters were initially downloaded from cetesb website companhia ambiental do estado de são paulo cetesb 2022 for the initial evaluation of the environmental quality of this water body in four different locations however we selected only a few of them based on the objectives of this study and also on some previous studies that applied these parameters in studies related to aspects of water quality therefore the chosen parameters were chlorophyll a chla μg l cyanobacteria cyano cell ml 1 water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do mg l 1 ph biochemical oxygen demand bod mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod mg l 1 ammoniacal nitrogen mg l 1 total nitrogen tn mg l 1 total phosphorus tp mg l 1 nitrite mg l 1 nitrate mg l 1 manganese mg l 1 magnesium mg l 1 potassium mg l 1 sodium

categories based on percentile high extreme events ee of wt were classified as being the values equal or superior to the value found on the 80th percentile 25 3 c low extreme events of wt were classified as being the values equal or inferior to the value found on the 20th percentile 19 6 c intermediate range of wt is defined by the values between the extreme events 2 3 2 extreme events of other water quality parameters for the treatment to find the optimum condition for increasing microcystin chla and cyano concentration we defined extreme events of low and high values for do tp tpn and wt mentioned previously for do the values were 3 mg l 1 low ee and 9 3 mg l 1 high ee for tp the values were 0 04 mg l 1 low ee and 0 43 mg l 1 high ee for tn the values were 1 mg l 1 low ee and 2 59 mg l 1 high ee in addition we performed one more treatment for fig a3 see appendixes we considered in this analysis only the high ee of some parameters to calculate the percentage of high values of microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria the parameters with respective values were ammoniacal nitrogen 4 328 mg l 1 kn 6 45 mg l 1 nitrate 1 13 mg l 1 nitrite 0 15 mg l 1 tn 2 59 mg l 1 tp 0 43 mg l 1 and wt 25 3 c 2 3 3 definition of elevated chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations and cyanobacteria density we defined the high values of chla 50 μg l 1 and cyanobacteria 100 000 cell ml 1 based on the limits established by the world health organization who 2003 as being the minimum value to be considered as of high potential risk for human health in recreational waters in case of cyanobacteria dominance for microcystin extreme values were considered as being equal or superior to the maximum limit established 1 μg l 1 for drinking water in accordance with environmental protection agency usa and brazilian legislation epa environmental protection agency u s a 2015 rego et al 2019 2 4 statistical analyses 2 4 1 evaluation of linear correlations correlation analysis was applied to identify the best relationships among the water quality parameters with the objective of explaining mainly the factors that are influencing microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria concentrations in billings reservoir to evaluate the strength and the significance of correlation the coefficient of determination r2 pearson s r value and p value were used we assumed as significant p values lower than 0 1 p value 0 1 a confidence level of 90 however most of all correlations were smaller compared to this established limit previously 2 4 2 frequency of unacceptable values to analyze the effects of ee on water quality parameters we calculated the frequency of unacceptable values of chlorophyll a cyanobacteria and microcystin in those conditions we used the following formula to calculate 1 frequency x i x n where xi is the amount of observations above the limit for the parameters for an extreme event condition xn is the total number of observations 2 5 machine learning ml in this study three techniques of ml were applied random forest breiman 2001 support vector machine cortes and vapnik 1995 and linear regression simple and multiple we transformed the variables chla cyano tp and tn using log10 before the prediction initially we created and tested the correlations between chla and cyano n 224 chla and tp n 395 and chla and tn n 107 in this first moment we did not split the dataset in training and testing as objectives to see the relationship between the dependent variable with the selected independent variables once we found the best predictor between these parameters we split the dataset randomly using the following function set seed 020622 in r software in this new test we split the dataset into training 75 n 155 and testing 25 n 52 for the new prediction we also added the parameter wt and we excluded tn due to lower amount of observations compared to other parameters the models were validated using a 10 fold cross validation procedure the codes generated to predict chlorophyll a using svm rf and lm are in the end of appendixes different values of the hyperparameters for the rf and svm models were tested earlier also other environmental variables were included in the model however with inferior results table 1 shows the parameters with respective values used in each prediction for the evaluation of the predictions we used the following metrics coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse 3 results 3 1 correlations between the water quality parameters no extreme events water quality in billings reservoir varied over time microcystin varied from a low concentration 0 16 μg l to an extremely high concentration 236 μg l the maximum value was found in a rainy period in january 2015 the highest value in a rainy condition could be the result of nutrient inputs from agricultural run off gibbs et al 2022 melaram et al 2022 which favor the growth of toxic organisms and consequently the production of the toxin in this collection a high concentration of chla 946 24 μg l and cyanobacteria 3 248 655 cell ml with low dissolved oxygen concentration 4 56 mg l 1 in high water temperature 27 78 c chlorophyll a varied from 2 81 μg l to 1470 μg l was also observed the highest concentration of chla was also found in a rainy period in january of 2015 for this point there is no information about microcystin concentration however the concentration of cyanobacteria remained high 3 333 935 cell ml with high do concentration 8 25 mg l 1 and water temperature 27 64 c this value of cyanobacteria was the maximum density found in billings reservoir using this dataset the smallest density was of 106 cell ml in a dry period in september 2007 this collection also presented low concentration of microcystin 0 16 μg l do 5 1 mg l 1 chla 6 94 μg l tp 0 02 mg l 1 and water temperature 19 3 c tp varied from very low concentration 0 006 mg l 1 to elevated concentration 9 5 mg l 1 the high concentration of tp was seen in september 1991 with low value of wt 21 c and do 2 5 mg l 1 for the verification of environmental conditions that may be contributing to a decrease in water quality we applied linear regressions which is a statistical tool to evaluate the correlation between two variables through the coefficient of determination r2 pearson r value and p value from this point some water quality parameters presented significant correlations between themselves for billings reservoir data the variability of chlorophyll a might be explained by the variability of the following parameters see appendices table a1 wt chla log10 pearson s r 0 31 p value 0 0005 n 423 ph chla log10 pearson s r 0 27 p value 0 0005 n 425 microcystin both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 70

0005 n 230 and na both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 38 p value 0 0005 n 230 these results inform that some chemical elements are important factors for chla production in billings reservoir in order of importance according to pearson s r value are phosphorus tp nitrogen tn and kn potassium k magnesium mg and sodium na in addition the mentioned result above also informs that cyanobacteria is supposed to be the dominant species in the phytoplankton community most of all times from 10 water samples at least 6 times the variation of chlorophyll a might be explained by cyanobacteria variation besides that the increase in turbidity in billings reservoir is more inclinable to be due to algal biomass than soil particles and minerals in the selected sampling points bod presented moderate relationship with chlorophyll a which means that for these sampling points the increase in bod concentration is frequently explained by autochthonous organic matter from primary producers biomass finally we found that wt although it presents weaker relationship with chla is also influencing in the increase of this pigment chla in billings reservoir presents a moderate to strong relationship with microcystin which can be used as a predictor of this toxin cyanobacteria presented significant correlations with chla as observed previously tp both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 45 p value 0

transformed log10 pearson s r 0 48 p value 0 0005 n 48 and k both transformed log10 pearson s r 0 24 p value 0 0005 n 34 3 2 correlation between microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria with phosphorus and nitrogen in wt extreme conditions having verified the correlations with other parameters we selected some of the predictors of each variable that are well described in the literature to test our hypothesis that microcystin concentration is influenced by climatic conditions and the availability of nutrients we also verified the correlations with nutrients in extreme events of wt for chla and cyanobacteria the extreme events of wt were defined by the 20th percentile low wt and the 80th hight wt fig 2 shows the correlation between microcystin and total phosphorus a b microcystin and cyanobacteria c d and microcystin and chlorophyll a e f in high and low extreme conditions of water temperature low ee 19 6 c high ee 25 3 c in billings reservoir despite the low number of collected observations for microcystin ntotal 51 and between these ranges nhigh ee 8 nlow ee 9 we can see a stronger and significative correlation between the toxin concentration and some water quality parameters in the condition of high ee although tp was significantly correlated with microcystin in high temperatures this relationship is not observed with nitrogen microcystin in higher values of wt were therefore stronger correlated to cyanobacteria density r2 0 93 p value 0 0002 n 8 tp r2 0 89 p value 0 0004 n 7 and chla r2 0 82 p value 0 002 n 8 between the intermediate values no extreme events were found weaker but significant correlations between microcystin and chla log10 r2 0 31 p value 0 002 n 31 and microcystin and cyano log10 r2 0 12 p value 0 07 n 29 significant correlation between microcystin and tp log10 r2 0 09 p value 0 05 n 31 was not found we suggest that the elevated temperatures are driving the production of microcystin in adequate levels of tp in high ee a lower number of observations of microcystin with nitrogen forms were seen nammoniacal 4 nkn 5 nnitrate 4 nnitrite 4 ntn 3 even in low number of observations significant correlations between microcystin and nitrogen forms in this condition were not found differently from tp also in low ee nammoniacal 7 nkn 7 nnitrate 9 nnitrite 8 ntn 2 no significant correlations were found between microcystin and nitrogen forms n 4 among the intermediate values nammoniacal 25 nkn 26 nnitrate 27 nnitrite 19 ntn 5 significant correlations were found just to kn and tn with microcystin kn r2 0 14 p value 0 06 tn r2 0 82 p value 0 04 kn which quantifies the sum of ammonia particulate nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen in the sample rus et al 2012 presented a weak relationship in the intermediate values of wt while tn presented a strong correlation most especially in the analysis presented in fig 2 we can see that with an increase in the water temperature 25 3 c under the condition of microcystin producers species present in the water and high concentration of phosphorus this toxin can achieve very elevated concentrations in billings reservoir 102 μg l besides the microcystin correlation with the water quality parameters in the extreme conditions of wt we also investigated the correlation between cyanobacteria and nutrients and chlorophyll a fig 3 and chlorophyll a and nutrients fig 4 in high ee of wt we found a strong relationship between cyanobacteria and total phosphorus r2 0 57 p value 0 0005 cyanobacteria and total nitrogen r2 0 42 p value 0 02 and cyanobacteria and chlorophyll a r2 0 73 p value 0 00005 see fig 3 in the intermediate values of wt we found although significative a weaker correlation between cyanobacteria and tp r2 0 19 p value 0 0005 and a weaker correlation between cyanobacteria and chla r2 0 31 p value 0 0005 a nonsignificative relationship between cyanobacteria and tn was observed in the intermediate ranges of wt in the low ee only the correlation between cyanobacteria and chla was significant r2 0 25 p value 0 005 it means that in cooler wt the increase of chla is 25 explained by cyanobacteria density it reinforces the preference of cyanobacteria species of billings reservoir for warmer waters in relation to the other nitrogen forms ammoniacal nitrate nitrite kn in high ee only nitrite r2 0 20 p value 0 06 presented a significant correlation with cyanobacteria however in the intermediate range there is no significant correlation between nitrite and cyanobacteria no significant result was also observed in the correlation between these variables in low ee no significant correlation was observed between the other forms in low ee in the intermediate ranges ammoniacal nitrogen r2 0 08 p value 0 003 and kn r2 0 05 p value 0 02 presented a significant correlation with cyanobacteria in relation to chla and nutrients as observed previously for microcystin and cyanobacteria the correlation was stronger in high ee of wt it is important to point out that chla presented a significative correlation with tp in the three conditions high ee r2 0 77 p value 0 000005 intermediate values r2 0 40 p value 0 000005 low ee r2 0 08 p value 0 02 chla and tn presented significant correlation only for the conditions of high ee r2 0 53 p value 0 000005 and intermediate values of wt r2 0 39 p value 0 000005 there is no significant correlation between chla and tn in low ee of wt in comparison with other nitrogen forms chla presented significant correlations with kn in high ee of wt r2 0 10 p value 0 02 intermediate values of wt r2 0 36 p value 0 000005 and in low ee r2 0 09 p value 0 04 chla was not significantly correlated with ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate p value 0 1 90 of confidence level however chla was correlated with nitrite in high ee of wt r2 0 36 p value 0 00002 and in intermediate values r2 0 08 p value 0 002 no significant correlation between chla and nitrite was found in low ee of wt fig a1 see appendixes shows boxplot graphs for microcystin chlorophyll a cyanobacteria and total phosphorus in different ranges of water temperature these different ranges of wt were selected to identify in which ranges occur the highest values of the parameters it is possible to see that higher concentrations of microcystin were found between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 although between 28 c and 30 c wt 28 30 high concentrations of microcystin were also seen for chla the smallest variability was seen between 17 c and 20 c wt 17 20 the highest variability and median were observed between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 there are high values of chla in all wt ranges indicating that low wt does not limit chla to low concentrations cyanobacteria presented higher concentrations of high densities between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 and between 28 c and 30 c wt 28 30 tp is not directly associated with wt its concentration increases in the water by sewage release diffuse pollution or resuspension from sediment however in this case we verified that the highest medians were seen between 26 c and 28 c wt 26 28 and 17 c and 20 c wt 17 20 fig a2 see appendixes shows the coefficient of determination r2 and rmse with the significance of the microcystin prediction using chlorophyll a cyanobacteria and tp as a predictor in the three conditions wt 19 6 c wt 19 6 c wt 25 3 c wt 25 3 c cyanobacteria presented the highest value of r2 and lowest rmse in the condition of high temperatures wt 25 3 c chlorophyll a presented smaller r2 and higher rmse than cyanobacteria and tp in high ee wt 25 3 c tp presented high r2 value in high ee of wt and the highest rmse value in cooler water wt 19 6 c see fig 5 3 3 treatments to find the optimum condition for high observations of microcystin chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria besides the correlation of the parameters chla microcystin cyano in extreme conditions of wt we did some treatments to identify the variability of these variables under different conditions of water temperature associated with nutrients and dissolved oxygen concentration despite the limited number of observations these results give us an initial idea about the range that these parameters can reach for each condition and what treatment is most favorable to have higher and lower values for each variable of course in a scenario with a larger dataset the results would be stronger through this new approach to evaluating the effects of different conditions on chla cyano and microcystin using the established values by the 20th and 80th percentile it was possible to see that in the condition of high wt and do chla had the highest amplitude in this condition higher numbers of observations were seen above the threshold established by who in recreational water considering high risk for human health in case of cyanobacteria dominance in the conditions of low wt and high do and low wt and do some observations were higher than the threshold however most observations were lower than 50 μg l the only observation for the condition of high wt and low do presented a low chla concentration in this condition the smallest density of cyanobacteria for the treatments using wt and do was observed cyanobacteria presented values above the limit in three conditions high wt and do low wt and high do and low wt and do however in the condition of low wt and do it is more expected to have cyanobacteria densities lower than the limit established by who as possible high risk for human health cyano 100 00 cell ml in addition for the conditions of high wt and do and low wt and high do all values of cyanobacteria were higher than the used threshold although microcystin had low number of observations for all treatments it was possible to note that it followed the trends of chla and cyano for these treatments as expected low concentration in the condition of low wt and do and higher observations at high wt and do as observed previously tp plays an important role for chla and microcystin production and cyano abundance in billings reservoir mainly in the condition of high wt see figs 2a 3a 4a associating the extreme conditions of wt with the extreme conditions of tp we found that in scenarios of low tp concentration smaller values of chla cyano and microcystin were observed for chla most of all values were below the established limit while for cyano the values were predominantly higher than the limit although lower values were also found microcystin had only one observation which stood below the limit in the condition of low wt and tp finally in the condition of high wt and tp the values were so much higher compared to those conditions of low tp for the conditions considering wt and tn lower values of chla were seen than for the conditions of high wt and low tn and low wt and high tn for cyano low density was observed in low wt and high tn microcystin presented lower concentration in low wt and high tn and a high concentration in the condition of high wt and tn in this condition high values of chla and cyano were also observed we also performed another test considering only high extreme events of wt ammoniacal nitrogen nitrate nitrite kn tp and tn to identify the frequency of inadequate values of chla cyano and microcystin fig a3 low observations of microcystin were seen mainly in high extreme events of kn nitrate and tn where all those observations n 3 were higher than the limit established by the environmental protection agency usa epa and brazilian legislation epa environmental protection agency u s a 2015 rego et al 2019 from this analysis we can also see that there is a higher probability of seeing the effects of high extreme events of wt in cyano abundance and microcystin when compared to the photosynthetic pigment chla in relation to nitrogen forms with the exceptions of nitrate and nitrite in high extreme events of kn ammoniacal nitrogen and tn these events were more important to chla and microcystin than cyano high ee of tp presented high frequency of inadequate values for the three parameters reinforcing that this element has been crucial for increasing cyanobacteria abundance chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations in billings reservoir 3 4 chlorophyll a prediction we used three important machine learning techniques to predict the chla concentration in billings reservoir initially it was used just one parameter to simplify the models for the prediction to verify the importance of each variable on chla production cyanobacteria total phosphorus and total nitrogen were chosen as the predictors due to high correlation and significance between chla and these parameters observed in the previous results fig 6 shows the observed points of each collection corresponding in each variable with the generated curve by rf and svm models and the correlation between observed and predicted values although lr curve was not plotted we calculated the metrics for this model as well the lr model presented a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 43 in the relationship between chla and cyano the svm presented a r2 equal to 0 37 and rf presented a r2 of 0 41 after the construction of the models we also tested using all values in the dataset to verify which technique presented higher capability of chla prediction using cyano as predictor lr presented the lowest r2 0 45 and highest rmse 0 31 with svm presenting the intermediate values of metrics r2 0 54 rmse 0 28 and rf being the best technique r2 0 87 rmse 0 15 in the correlation between chla and tp the lr model presented a r2 of 0 41 while svm presented a r2 of 0 45 and rf a r2 of 0 41 however the results of predictions showed the best result for rf r2 0 59 rmse 0 26 followed by svm r2 0 49 rmse 0 29 and lr r2 0 41 rmse 0 31 in the correlation between chla and tn lr presented a r2 of 0 34 while svm a r2 of 0 22 and rf a r2 of 0 13 despite the lower values of the models the correlation between observed and predicted values showed a better correlation rf presented the best result r2 0 73 rmse 0 19 followed by svm r2 0 36 rmse 0 29 and lr r2 0 34 rmse 0 30 after this previous analysis using all datasets with one parameter to create the model and test with all values we created a model using three predictors cyano wt and tp we used 75 of the data randomly selected to create the model for the models we obtained the following results r2 0 62 lr r2 0 54 svm and r2 0 60 rf due to a low number of available observations nmodel 155 ntest 52 and considering only three parameters to estimate the chla concentration this result is satisfactory amorim et al 2021 used 12 parameters to predict chlorophyll a it is also important to point out that the construction of the model using only these parameters presented good results for billings reservoir which is recognized by blooms of cyanobacteria in the case of oligotrophic reservoir and lakes or in other conditions other parameters will be needed to be addressed to the model as observed by shin et al 2020 amorim et al 2021 ly et al 2021 and carvalho et al 2022 fig 7 shows the points selected to create the model and for the test and the results of the correlations between observed and predicted values using the three techniques it is possible to see that for these three techniques we obtained higher values of r2 and lower values of rmse compared to the previous analysis using one parameter with all datasets the only exception is for rf using cyanobacteria 4 discussion this study provides an investigation of how water temperature affects the microcystin and chlorophyll a production and cyanobacteria density in an important reservoir in brazil billings reservoir this study brings a new approach to understanding the correlation between the environmental variables which many times are correlated without the characterization of the different climatic conditions of the collections most specifically we performed linear correlations in high and low extreme events of wt defined by the percentile 20th and 80th investigations of the relationship between microcystin and nutrients have been evaluated and discussed in many studies wu et al 2006 wang et al 2010 yu et al 2014 fortin et al 2015 these studies include the relationship between microcystin in different tn tp ratio ranges to calculate the probability of microcystin concentration exceeding a certain value of concentration scott et al 2013 correlation of different microcystins rr yr lr and water quality parameters wu et al 2006 verification of microcystin concentrations in values of tn tp ratio fortin et al 2015 variation of microcystin concentration in different sites and months with the correlation between this toxin and water quality parameters yu et al 2014 correlation between extracellular and intracellular microcystins and water quality parameters wang et al 2010 but none of these studies investigated the correlation between microcystin and water quality parameters in different conditions of wt the strength and significance of the correlations between the variables chla cyano and microcystin and nutrients were influenced by the condition of wt it is important to point out that overall chla was significantly correlated with wt ph cyano microcystin bod cod kn tp tn turbidity k mg and na cyano beyond chla and microcystin was significantly correlated with tp turbidity k na kn tn bod and wt microcystin was significantly correlated with chla cyano wt tp and k however we considered only chla cyano microcystin tp and tn for the correlation analysis in the extreme conditions of wt the strongest correlation between the parameters with nutrients was seen in the highest wt values see figs 2 3 and 4 in high ee of wt microcystin was strongly correlated with cyano tp and chla it indicates that these parameters could be important predictors of microcystin concentration in billings reservoir in warmer seasons the importance of water temperature for microcystin production was also observed by wu et al 2006 this behavior can be explained since water temperature is a physical parameter that regulates various biological and chemical processes in aqueous systems marañón et al 2018 according to the metabolic theory of ecology mte temperature and size influence the metabolic rate of all animals fernández gonzález and marañón 2021 therefore temperature influence includes metabolic activities of photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria and microalgae besides the influence of wt adequate levels of nutrients in this study more strongly related to phosphorus are necessary for microcystin production these results are corroborated by pham 2019 who suggests that an increase in temperature with the nutrient concentrations may drive more frequent cyanobacteria blooms and higher concentrations of microcystin therefore higher water temperature influences the metabolic activities and phosphorus is a vital component for algae growth and metabolites production such as chlorophyll a and microcystin zhang et al 2022 microcystin concentration did not present a significant correlation with nitrogen in high and low extreme events of wt the only significant correlations between microcystin and nitrogen were microcystin and kn and microcystin and tn in the intermediate range of wt martin et al 2020 tested three concentrations of nitrogen through nitrate to evaluate the response in microcystin concentration in high nitrogen concentration the authors suggest that the limitation is due to other nutrients such as phosphorus but in low concentration it resulted in nitrogen limitation they concluded that overall nitrogen concentration produced low effect on the overall response of microcystin pimentel and giani 2014 also found that nutrient deprivation can also influence microcystin production despite that high concentrations of microcystin were seen in extreme events of ammoniacal nitrogen kn and tn see fig a3 monchamp et al 2014 did not find a direct effect of nitrogen on microcystin concentration but an effect on cyanobacteria species composition nitrogen presented a weaker correlation with cyanobacteria in the three observed conditions compared to phosphorus tn presented only a significant correlation with cyanobacteria at high ee of wt gobler et al 2016 affirm that there is still a gap in the understanding of the influence of nitrogen in cyanobacteria blooms tp demonstrated to be most important for chla and microcystin production and cyanobacteria density in the studied water body gardner et al 2008 affirm that in some cases phosphorus might limit the primary production while for other lakes nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in our results phosphorus seems to be the limiting nutrient for algal growth cyanobacteria abundance and microcystin production mainly at higher temperatures wen et al 2020 affirm that p is a limiting nutrient in lakes and reservoirs in the condition of high ee of wt wt 25 3 c we found that 87 5 of the observations n 8 of microcystin were higher than the limit established by epa and brazilian legislation in the intermediate values of wt 67 7 of the observations n 31 were higher than the limit and in low ee of wt wt 19 6 c 44 4 of the observations n 9 were higher than the limit some studies have been performed among other objectives to understand the conditions of temperature that influence microcystin concentration dziallas and grossart 2011 scherer et al 2017 bui et al 2018 walls et al 2018 trung et al 2022 dziallas and grossart 2011 found higher values of microcystin mc yr and mc lr in higher values of wt at 26 c and 32 c when compared to 20 c we also found in our results higher concentrations of microcystin in wt above 26 c when compared to temperatures below 26 c fig a1 scherer et al 2017 found that in elevated temperatures occurs the increased gene expression of at least one microcystin gene but the range of wt with higher values of microcystin is not the same for those microcystin concentrations seen by walls et al 2018 between 20 c and 25 c in their study the lake is predominantly dominated by planktothrix agardhii while billings reservoir might have other species dominating the phytoplankton community with higher microcystin production capacity in higher temperatures as our results indicate we suggest that a possible specie that is dominating the phytoplankton community is microcystis which is a specie recognized for its preference in warmer waters liu et al 2011 found a strong correlation between water temperature and microcystis biomass r2 0 90 n 129 in lake taihu imai et al 2009 found that species of microcystin were significantly higher in cell density in certain ranges of wt m aeruginosa higher at 35 c m wesenbergii at 25 c or 30 c than at 20 c bui et al 2018 verified that increased wt can promote growth of tropical microcystis lower microcystin concentrations above 28 c compared to the range between 26 c and 28 c with one exception above 28 c were also observed by trung et al 2022 they found higher concentrations of microcystin at 27 c compared to the concentrations at 31 c 35 c and 37 c the authors affirm that lower microcystin values in higher wt might be a consequence of the binding of microcystin to proteins due to a higher oxidative stress caused by higher temperatures which is mitigated through the binding of microcystin to proteins this fact of the increase of microcystin in the increase in the values of wt is limited to certain ranges as also observed by bui et al 2018 the authors found a higher concentration at 27 c than at 37 c in high ee of wt chla presented 70 of the observations n 91 above the limit established by world health organization who 2003 as a potential risk for human health in case of dominance of cyanobacteria in recreational waters in intermediate values 47 2 of the observations n 258 were above the limit and in low ee of wt 28 3 of the observations were higher than the limit in relation to cyanobacteria in high ee of wt 82 5 was above the limit n 40 while in the intermediate values it was 71 n 138 and in low ee of wt n 45 60 above the limit gardner et al 2008 also found an increase in chla in increasing wt and a decrease in chla in decreasing wt beaulieu et al 2013 also found a strong correlation between chla production log10 and wt and tp concentration in relation to the prediction of chla in billings reservoir initially our results show rf as the best model while the cyanobacteria was the best predictor currently many studies have been developed to evaluate the prediction of chla in freshwater bodies estuaries and marine environment mainly with a hold out method diouf and seck 2019 shin et al 2020 amorim et al 2021 chang et al 2021 after that we divided our data in 75 to create the model and 25 to test the model using cyano tp and wt as predictors our results indicated that based on values of r2 and rmse the best model for chla prediction in billings reservoir was svm as observed by jiang et al 2011 mamun et al 2020 and amorim et al 2021 but not observed by carvalho that found rf as one of the best predictions of chla in addition the best model observed was considering only three parameters cyanobacteria tp and wt 5 conclusion through this investigation we can provide interesting aspects of microcystin production in billings reservoir previous studies brought precious information about the influence of wt on microcystin concentration our results are corroborated by the findings of some of these studies dziallas and grossart 2011 scherer et al 2017 trung et al 2022 the range with higher concentrations of this toxin was between 26 c and 28 c still in wt above 25 3 c higher frequencies of unacceptable values of microcystin chla and cyano were found reinforcing that in warmer seasons the production of the toxin might increase considerably mainly in high concentration of tp in this study in billings reservoir phosphorus was the limiting nutrient for cyano chla and microcystin through the machine learning techniques we discovered that chla in billings reservoir is extremely dependent of cyano density tp concentration and wt svm presented the best result compared to rf and multiple lr credit authorship contribution

1211,iron coated sand ics is a by product from drinking water treatment made of sand coated with ferric iron hydr oxides it is considered a suitable material for large scale measures for phosphate removal from natural and agricultural waters to prevent eutrophication previous studies demonstrated that the residence time of water must be very long to reach equilibrium partitioning between phosphate and ics but specifics for application are missing first sem edx images were used to support the conceptual assumption that p adsorption inside the coating is a transport limited process second a conceptual model of phosphate adsorption was proposed considering two types of sites one type with fast adsorption kinetics and reaching equilibrium with the percolating solution and another type for which adsorption is also reversible but described by pseudo first order kinetics the latter is conceived to account for transport limited adsorption in the interior of the coating while the former fraction of sites is assumed to be easily accessible and located close to the grain surface third the kinetics of phosphate adsorption on ics were quantitatively determined to describe and predict phosphate retention in filters under various flow conditions the model was calibrated and validated with long term column experiments which lasted for 3500 h to approach equilibrium on the slowly reacting sites the model reproduced the outflowing phosphate concentrations the pronounced increase after a few pore volumes and the slow increase over the remaining part of the experiment the parameterized model was also able to predict the time evolution of phosphate concentrations in the outflow of column experiments with different flow velocities flow interruption and in desorption experiments the equilibrium partition coefficient for the experimental conditions was identified as 28 1 l g fe at ph 6 8 and a phosphate concentration of 1 7 mg p l the optimized first order mass transfer coefficient for the slow adsorption process was 1 56 10 4 h 1 implying that the slow adsorption process has a time scale of several months however based on the parameterized model the slow adsorption process accounted for 95 5 of the equilibrium adsorption capacity emphasizing the potential relevance of this process for practical applications the implications for the design operation

quality bol et al 2018 de klein and koelmans 2011 dupas et al 2018 kronvang et al 2007 schoumans et al 2014 withers et al 2014 because of the legacy p stored in the soil reducing manure and fertilizer application is insufficient to reduce p loads reaching surface waters barcala et al 2020 bieroza et al 2019 gu et al 2017 sharpley et al 2013 phytoremediation reducing the p in the soils by plant uptake can reduce the legacy p but it will take decades before p losses to surface waters are reduced fiorellino et al 2017 koopmans et al 2004 lucas et al 2021 stoll et al 2021 one option for short term p load reduction is the implementation of permeable reactive barriers filled with iron fe containing materials they can remove p from percolating water on its hydrological pathway from groundwater to surface waters das gupta et al 2012 nur et al 2014 penn et al 2011 2017 2020 rittmann et al 2011 stoner et al 2012 particularly well suited are byproducts from water treatment containing ferric iron hydr oxides given their easy availability and high binding affinity for p iron coated sand ics and fe sludge are residuals of deferrization of drinking water a common procedure for deferrization is to oxidize dissolved fe ii and remove the produced fe hydr oxides using sand filters by this an fe coating develops around the sand grains resulting in ics ippolito et al 2011 sharma et al 2002 van beek et al 2016 2020 ics and fe sludge have been used to adsorb phosphate in soils in filters around or at the end of tile drains and in decentralized water treatment at farms boujelben et al 2008 chardon et al 2021 koopmans et al 2020 lambert et al 2020 moelants et al 2011 vandermoere et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the adsorption capacity of ics is often underestimated as slow adsorption kinetics controlled by intra particle diffusion are neglected ajmal et al 2018 koopmans et al 2004 willett et al 1988 iron hydr oxides in the coating of ics are usually poorly crystalline or amorphous and exhibit a large specific surface area accounting for a high adsorption capacity chardon et al 2012 koopmans et al 2020 however the coating can be several hundreds of micrometers thick implying that the outer surface only represents a minor part of the total interfacial area the outer surface of the ics is in direct contact with the percolating water and the rates of adsorption are only controlled by the kinetics of the reaction however adsorption sites located in the interior of the coating can only be accessed via intra particle diffusion the time scale of intra particle diffusion is generally much longer than that of the surface reactions and hence the phosphate adsorption rates in the interior of the coating are transport limited the long term adsorption capacity of ics can be underestimated when neglecting the slow transport limited kinetics the time scale of the slow adsorption exceeds the duration of typical batch adsorption experiments chardon et al 2012 showed that the experimentally derived adsorption capacity of fe sludge progressively increased in batch experiments over the duration of 21 days and in column experiments which lasted 238 days even further the relevance of processes with different time scales was also reflected in the column experiments p concentrations in the effluent quickly increased without reaching the inflow concentrations instead a quasi steady state was reached at different p concentrations depending on the amount of fe sludge in the column this implies that the removal efficiency of fe containing filters depends on the contact time of the water in the filter being a function of pore volume and flow rates lambert et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022 investigated phosphate adsorption on ics in batch and column experiments zhang et al 2022 reported that the p outflow concentrations reached a quasi steady state while the experimental data in lambert et al 2020 only represent fast p adsorption as experiments were stopped before the quasi steady state was reached in both studies the bohart adams model was applied to describe the breakthrough curves of phosphate the bohart adams model only accounts for the kinetics of one irreversible adsorption reaction and consequently its performance is limited when dealing with processes proceeding with different paces lambert et al 2020 parameterized the model for the pronounced increase in dissolved p concentrations until adsorption equilibrium is reached for the fast reacting sites however when changing flow velocities the contribution of the slow adsorption processes to p retention varied and consequently column experiments with different flow velocities required individual optimization of model parameters in particular the obtained p adsorption capacity was larger for the column operated at slow flow than that at fast flow and both were significantly larger than the capacity obtained in a 1 day batch experiment furthermore lambert et al 2020 reported that a pilot filter operated with intermittent resting periods performed better than when operated with continuous flow for the same treated volumes these results demonstrate that slow adsorption kinetics need to be considered for optimizing the operation of ics filters and the need for a reactive transport model which accounts for the kinetics of both fast and slow adsorption processes here and in the following the term kinetics is used in the broadest sense encompassing rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions as well as transport processes such as diffusion zhang 2008 the objective of this study was to develop a quantitative model for phosphate adsorption on ics that can adequately account for slowly proceeding phosphate adsorption which can be easily implemented and applied to optimize the operation of ics containing filters electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy was used to illustrate the model consideration that phosphate retention in the interior of the iron coating is transport limited a process based physical model including kinetic adsorption of phosphate on ics was parameterized using long term column measurements the model represents the slow kinetics dominated by the diffusion of phosphate inside the ics coating and the fast adsorption on the outer surface of the ics it is shown that the model can be a valuable tool to optimize the design and operation of ics filters over their whole lifespan with different flow velocities and intermittent flow regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 iron coated sand the ics used in this study was provided by aquaminerals bv https aquaminerals com en the material was obtained from one mixed batch originating from different drinking water production sites the ics received no pre treatment was obtained air dried and stored in the dark at room temperature the ics contained on average 127 2 mg g fe 9 4 mg g mn 0 5 mg g s 9 6 mg g ca and 0 9 mg g p 0 1 mg g standard deviation determined by total destruction the brunauer emmet teller specific surface area bet ssa was 71 2 m2 g and was determined using argon gas with an asiqwin instrument quantachrome instruments in addition the pore size distribution in the ics was determined with the bet ssa analysis nano pores with a diameter between 0 42 and 2 00 nm were related to 54 of the specific surface and mesopores between 2 00 and 50 0 nm to 46 details of the measurement are specified in the supplement material 2 2 column experiments we performed flow experiments in 3 columns named i ii and iii the three columns were made from transparent polyethylene tubes of 30 8 cm height and 4 3 cm internal diameter the column dimensions were selected accounting for dispersivity and reducing boundary flow effects along the tube walls bromly et al 2007 lewis and sjöstrom 2010 the reactive core of the columns contained 30 g of ics and 300 g of quartz sand both with grain diameters between 1 18 mm and 2 00 mm the ics was mixed with quartz sand to reduce the breakthrough times by maintaining column dimensions according to recommendations based on previous column experiments bromly et al 2007 lewis and sjöstrom 2010 quartz sand is commonly used as an inert filling material in column experiments chardon et al 2012 jerez and flury 2006 mystrioti et al 2015 pérez lópez et al 2007 and it is assumed that it does not contribute to phosphate retention in the columns this implies that equilibrium constants or partition coefficients kp l g determined for the whole stationary phase can be normalized to the content of ics two layers of 180 g quartz gravel 2 mm were added at the top and bottom of the columns to improve the flow distribution the columns were fed from the bottom via tubes of 0 8 mm internal diameter which were also used for the outflow the total volume of the tubing was 14 5 cm3 and taken into consideration in the parametrization of the models the inflow solution was stored in 10 l glass bottles protected from the light with black plastic bags the bottles cups were modified to work as mariotte bottles maroto et al 2002 to maintain a constant head pressure of approximately 2 cm above the columns assuring full saturation a peristaltic pump masterflex l s with the corresponding tubing 13 l s masterflex was used for each column to maintain a constant flow the flow rate at the given pump speed was checked prior to the experiments different flow regimes were used in the three different columns including constant flow at various velocities but also variable flow patterns furthermore one column was used for a desorption experiment the chosen flow rates correspond to the range of flow velocities measured in field applications of ics for retaining phosphate in drainage systems barcala et al 2022 groenenberg et al 2013 the flow rate in column i was 0 65 ml min for 3500 h over 560 pore volumes for the first 1440 h column ii was running in parallel to column i with a flow rate of 0 65 ml min afterward the flow rate was reduced to 0 39 ml min for600 hours we also aimed to maintain the flow rate in column iii at 0 65 ml min during the first 1440 h of the experiment but clogging occurred the cause of the clogging was the obstruction of the outflow tube by particles the issue was solved by flushing the tube with water the tube was cleaned six times during this period although unintended clogging provided the opportunity to study the effect of interrupted flow and the data were included in this study after the problematic tube had been replaced for a new one column iii was used without interruptions during 720 h in a desorption experiment at 0 65 ml min in addition a second adsorption experiment with a flow rate of 0 39 ml min was performed in column iii for the last 600 h adsorption experiments were performed with a solution prepared from demineralized water containing 1 70 0 05 mg l p in the form of monobasic sodium phosphate solution in order to maintain the ionic strength constant 0 10 m nacl was also added the desorption experiment was performed with 0 10 m nacl without p the ph was adjusted with naoh to 6 80 0 05 and controlled weekly in the inflow and outflow the retention times at 0 65 ml min where 375 min in column i 329 min in column ii and 301 min in column iii samples were collected every 8 h with an autosampler sc 4dxs elemental scientific in 50 ml pe centrifuge tubes pre acidified with 1 ml 6 m hcl the volume collected by the autosampler during a sampling interval served as a periodic control of the flow rate p concentrations mg l equivalent to mg p l in samples were measured photometrically dr3900 hach as samples form a blue complex that follows beer s law when reacting with an acidified ammonium heptamolybdate solution and freshly added ascorbic acid murphy and riley 1962 for the first 40 days one sample per day was analyzed with icp oes avio 500 perkin elmer as an independent measurement because stanmod simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 can only deal with constant flow velocities the data series from columns i and ii were quality checked and a few points that were affected by flow rate reductions were removed preliminary tracer experiments were performed in all columns to determine pore volumes and porosities for this 0 10 m nacl solution was used containing additionally 0 10 m nabr the flow was 0 65 ml min samples were taken manually every 12 min for 9 h electric conductivity ec was measured and bromine br concentrations were determined by ion chromatography ics6000 thermo scientific to determine the breakthrough of the non reactive tracer 2 3 ics imaging techniques sem edx analyses were performed to investigate the structure of the ics coating and to examine the p distribution this was done to illustrate the conceptual idea of transport limited uptake of p inside the coating sem micrographs and elemental maps were made for fresh ics and for ics after adsorption from column iii the grains were embedded in resin and polished to investigate cross sections secondary electron and backscattered electron images were acquired on a sem evo 15 zeiss using the smartsem user interface v 6 06 semi qualitative chemical compositions were obtained using edx esprit v 2 1 bruker xflash 2 4 reactive transport model the conceptual model was parametrized into a reactive transport model using the advection dispersion equation and including two reactive adsorption terms in order to account for different adsorption rates two types of adsorption sites were included fast reacting sites for which the reaction progresses in time scales shorter than the hydraulic residence and conceived to reach equilibrium with the p concentrations in the mobile phase and sites for which the adsorption is kinetically controlled adsorption of p to ics is conceived as a reversible process the fast adsorption process was characterized by linear adsorption using an equilibrium partition coefficient kp the assumption of linearity is warranted at relatively low p concentrations as the relative occupation of adsorption sites remains low in equilibrium and the concentrations of occupied sites can be neglected in the mass balance for the reactive sites when the content of vacant sites can be assumed to be constant the kinetics of p adsorption to ics simplify to pseudo first order rate laws for p adsorption and desorption solely depending on the p concentration in the mobile phase and p adsorbed to slowly reacting sites respectively the derivation of the equations is available in the supplementary material based on this conceptual model the corresponding mass balance equations for p in the mobile and stationary phase in one dimension read 1 1 ρf k p θ c t d 2 c x 2 v c x ρα θ s eq s 2 s t α s eq s where c is the p concentration mg l in the mobile phase x is the longitudinal coordinate cm t is time h ρ is the bulk ics density g l f is the fraction of fast reacting sites θ is the porosity kp is the equilibrium constant or partition coefficient l g d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 h v is the pore water velocity equal to the darcian flow velocity divided by porosity cm h α can be attributed to the rate constant for p desorption but also conceived as the exchange coefficient between the stagnant and mobile phase 1 h see supplementary material for details and s is the p concentration in the solid phase for which adsorption is kinetically controlled mg g s eq is not an extra variable but the equilibrium concentration in the solid phase of the slow sites equal to k p 1 f c the concentration of p bound to the fast reacting sites being in equilibrium with the percolating solution is not a state variable in the model but is calculated based on the product of f c and kp 2 5 model solution and parameter estimation at constant flow and constant p concentrations in the inflow the equation system has an analytical solution that has been implemented in the code stanmod simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 we used the module cxtfit toride et al 1995 for parameter estimation that minimizes the root mean squared error rmse between the experimental and calculated concentrations the hydraulic properties pore water velocity v and the porosity θ of each column were determined separately from the tracer experiments we identified adsorption parameters f α and kp by calibrating the p concentrations in the effluent of column i over the first 690 h of the experiment during the first 690 h icp oes was used to measure p concentrations afterward the photometric method was used having a higher analytical uncertainty and some irregularities occurred in the flow such as short periods of flow decrease these points were still included in the data series as the long term p retention could still be observed the model was validated by calculating rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 for the effluent concentrations in column i over the whole experiment duration of 3500 h the concentrations in column ii during the first1440 hours and the p concentration of the last 600 h of column iii in the latter case the experiment was conceived as an independent p removal experiment and any possibly remaining p in the column after the preceding adsorption and desorption experiments was neglected for variable flow rates eqs 1 and 2 do not have an analytical solution therefore we implemented a numerical solution using the r packages reactran and desolve soetaert and herman 2009 soetaert and meysman 2012 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 the model in r was fed with the calibrated parameters obtained from column i the dynamic model allows to validate the experiment with intermittent flow velocities flow interruptions we calculated the rmse and r2 between the parametrized model s results and the effluent of column iii during the flow interruptions and for the desorption experiments the model is available at https github com victoriabarcala ics adsorptionmodel the optimized value for kp is conditional and accounts for the affinity of sorption sites for p at the given conditions plus the total concentration of sites for example phosphate adsorption to ferric iron hydr oxides depends among other factors on ph and ionic strength morel and hering 1993 to assess the possibility to extrapolate the model to other conditions we compared the obtained value of kp with calculated values based on surface complexation models for this the generic diffuse double layer ddl model parameterized by dzombak and morel 1991 for hydrous ferric oxide and implemented in mineql version 5 0 was used to calculate the p partition for the given experimental conditions and calculate the corresponding kp 2 6 practical example we used the numerical r model to set up a practical example illustrating the implications of considering the kinetics of p adsorption in the application of ics the example considers the use of ics to remove dissolved p from water at the effluent of tile drains installed in an agricultural area thus the chosen setting parameters are close to reality the average p concentration in the incoming water is assumed to be 1 0 mg l and the target p concentration should be below 0 15 mg l after passing the filter this concentration was chosen as the dutch implementation of the water framework directive establishes a 0 15 mg l limit in total phosphorus for open regional waters such as ditches fraters et al 2021 the filter has a porosity of 0 50 1770 g l bulk density with a fe concentration of 0 13 mg fe g ics and the filter dimensions are 40x40x40 cm the flow rate during operation is 4 l h we compare the efficiency of four different filter operations i continuous flow ii resting 3 months a year during summertime iii resting 1 week and iv 2 weeks per month 3 results 3 1 microscopy and ics analysis the coatings around ics grains have a thickness between 100 μm and 300 μm and often exhibited an anisotropic structure fig 1 the fe rich coating is traversed by mn rich layers typically exhibiting a higher porosity fig 1 a and 1 b in the investigated coatings edx analyses show a distinct p enrichment in their outer part fig 1 d highlight point 1 and 1 f point 4 edx spectra are available in the supplementary material in the outer parts fig 1 f point 4 comprising about 20 of the coating p fe ratios were around 0 040 and about 10 times larger than in the p poor areas fig 1 f point 5 with ratios about 0 004 additionally several thin layers with elevated p fe ratios were identified close to the core fig 1 f point 3 no p was detected in the mn rich areas fig 1 f point 6 the coatings were disrupted by several cracks some of the cracks exhibited p enrichments at the margins fig 1 d point 2 however most cracks seen on figs 1 c and 1 d do not show this feature and were possibly created when vacuuming the sample before sem analysis 3 2 adsorption experiments the general features of the time evolution of p concentrations in the effluent of column i were representative of the adsorption experiments with all columns after an initial increase in outflow concentrations a quasi steady state was reached at concentrations lower than in the inflow solution fig 2 a between hours 240 and 960 the outflow concentrations were about 1 05 mg l for column i representing 62 of the inflow concentration the pronounced increase in p concentrations occurred significantly later than the hydraulic retention time reflecting the retention of p via adsorption also at the beginning of the experiment a one site model assuming equilibrium partitioning of p cannot trace the measured effluent p concentrations fig 2 a in particular the model cannot produce a prolonged period of virtually constant concentrations below inflow concentration in contrast the two site model based on eqs 1 2 was able to reproduce the features of the concentration curve including the pronounced increase after the first days of operation and the plateau concentration reached after about 240 h fig 2 the equilibrium constant for the fast sites kp was identified with 0 155 l g for the ics sand mix and 3 57 l g for pure ics with 95 confidence intervals 1 15 5 98 l g table 1 the small value for the fraction of fast adsorption sites f 0 045 indicates that most adsorption sites were located within the fe coating the small value for the mass transfer coefficient α 1 56 10 4 h 1 reflects the slow transfer process hydraulic parameters have been identified separately through tracer tests which showed recovery rates of 97 the dispersion coefficient d was fitted to 30 cm2 h and the peclet number to 5 05 the tracer test curves and sensitivity analysis of the parameters in stanmod are available in the supplementary material the model was first validated for column i by modeling the whole duration of the experiment 3500 h beyond the first 960 h for which parameters were determined the larger deviation between observed and calculated data is associated with an increase in analytical uncertainty due to the switch in the analytical method notably the model accounted for the slow increase in p concentration as the system was approaching equilibrium fig 2 b and 3 b the change in outflow concentration due to the slow adsorption process is emphasized when comparing concentrations at an early and a late stage of the experiment in fig 3 b by the end of the experiment the effluent concentration in column i reached around 1 35 mg l corresponding to a p content in the solid phase of around 2 16 mg g ics or 17 0 mg g fe 0 03 p fe molar ratio at this moment the effluent concentrations were still below the inflow concentration implying that equilibrium was not reached with the model we extended the running time to two years the projected outflow p concentration was 1 60 mg l 94 of the inflow concentration and the concentration in the solid phase was 6 00 mg g ics or 47 02 mg g fe this value is close to the expected p loading in equilibrium s eq tot c k of 6 07 mg g ics or 47 57 mg g fe 0 09 p fe molar ratio we thus conclude that when the experiment ended about 36 of the equilibrium concentration in the solid was reached we obtained more validation results by running the transport model for the other columns with the parameters f α and kp identified for column i and the specific hydraulic parameters for each column the model reproduced very well the effluent concentrations from column ii fig 2 c table 1 and column iii fig 2 d table 1 at different flow velocities when column iii reached quasi steady state the effluent concentrations were around 0 75 mg l and significantly lower than the values reached in columns i and ii with higher flow velocities the flow rate in column ii was decreased to 0 39 ml min to investigate the effect of changing the flow rate on the p concentrations at quasi steady state as expected p concentrations decreased and stabilized at a new quasi steady state about 0 2 mg l lower than effluent concentrations of column i fig 3 a illustrating the increasing effect of the slow adsorption process at increasing contact time stop flow situations were studied with the early column iii data where unintended flow interruptions due to obstructions in the outflow tube our conceptual model predicts the transfer of p from fast to slow sites due to diffusion during stopped flow accompanied by decreasing concentrations of dissolved p in the column consequently we expect lower p concentrations in the effluent after resuming the flow similar to the initial phase of the column experiments indeed at most flow interruptions the p concentrations in the effluent followed the expected pattern and the previous concentrations were approached with some retardation fig 4 a the numerical model was able to reproduce the stop flow regime in column iii r2 0 91 table 1 figs 4 c and 4 d show the calculated time evolution of the concentrations in the mobile and stationary phases inside column iii the flow interruptions were reflected in a pronounced decrease in dissolved p concentrations in particular at the lower part of the column where the solution was entering the continuation of p adsorption during stopped flow resulted in increasing contents of adsorbed p fig 4 d after 1481 h but only 693 h with flow 1 39 mg g ics of p were adsorbed being 22 of the equilibrium concentration later 0 57 mg g about 40 of the previously adsorbed mass was recovered in the desorption experiment in 720 h the transfer of phosphate from fast to slowly reacting sites becomes less efficient when the slow sites approach equilibrium as the distance from equilibrium s eq s which drives the transfer becomes smaller during the desorption experiment in column iii the effluent concentrations decreased and reached a quasi state concentration of about 0 4 mg l fig 4 b this can be attributed to the release of p from the slow reacting sites the quasi steady state behavior was well reproduced by the model while the agreement between the model s results and observation is lower in the transition period as concentrations drop faster than predicted the desorption process was modeled with the same mass transport rate α implying that transport limitations also retard desorption consequently techniques only relying on p desorption may not be efficient for phosphate recovery due to the long time scale of desorption 4 discussion 4 1 expediency of the two side model considering transport limited kinetics for the adsorption process in a two site model was crucial to reproduce p outflow concentrations of long term column experiments the two site adsorption model proved suitable to describe and predict p retention for different operational scenarios including the variations in constant flow velocities interrupted flow and desorption although parameterized for one column experiment for a limited duration it was able to reproduce the features of the observed effluent p concentrations in all other experimental settings in particular quasi steady state concentrations being key in determining the p removal throughout the experiments were well reproduced at all flow conditions only during transient flow periods when resuming the flow or after abrupt changes in inflow concentrations the predictive capability of the model was lower the apparent delay in the predicted p concentrations in the outflow after flow interruptions or in the desorption experiment can be partially attributed to the remaining solution in the inert gravel layer at the top of the column this layer is not included in the dynamic model and dissolved p concentrations do not change during no flow concentrations due to the absence of ics the reactive model does not include an explicit description of the intra coating diffusion process instead the transport limitation is accounted for in the parameter α which can be interpreted as an exchange coefficient between the stagnant phase intra coating porosity and a mobile phase see supplementary material for details an equivalent approach was used before to describe phosphate desorption from soil particles koopmans et al 2004 adsorption was considered to be reversible and to follow a linear isotherm the desorption experiment demonstrates that adsorption of p to ics is reversible studying p adsorption onto ics lambert et al 2020 employed langmuir and freundlich isotherms for dissolved p concentrations in the range of 0 1200 mg l both isotherms may be approximated by a linear relationship at concentrations lower than 20 mg l in our study dissolved p concentrations remain below levels at which deviation from linearity is typically reported for p adsorption isotherms and solid phase contents remain below the saturation capacity for example reported for ferrihydrites wang et al 2013 the linear approximation is justified in the context of applying ics for p removal in drainage water in the netherlands which typically have soluble reactive phosphate concentrations below 2 mg l p rozemeijer et al 2014 4 2 model parameters despite the dilution of ics with non reactive sand and the long duration of the experiment equilibrium between dissolved and adsorbed p was not achieved the correlation of parameters f kp and α complicate the unequivocal determination of each parameter particularly the pronounced initial increase in p concentrations can be reproduced with infinite combinations of f and kp similarly quasi steady state concentrations are controlled by a combination of kp and α however the very slow increase in dissolved p concentrations after the initial increase constraints α and allows a robust estimation of the partition coefficient kp and consequently f the major part of the adsorption capacity lays inside the coating the fraction of fast adsorption sites f was only 4 5 reflecting the small number of sites at the outermost layer of the coating which is in direct contact with the porewater sem edx analyses support the conceptual assumption that p adsorption inside the coating is a transport limited process p is not homogeneously distributed but enriched in the outer part of the coating and in some narrow layers inside the coating although sem edx micrographs indicate the possibility of p transport through macro pores in the coating transport into the bulk of the coating is likely controlled by diffusion through the intra porosity of the fe precipitates which is supposed to be faster than solid diffusion willett et al 1988 the fe hydr oxides in the coating are expected to be of low crystallinity comparable to the structure of ferrihydrite a pore width between 0 42 and 50 nm was obtained from bet analyses being about half of them mesopores 2 50 nm the range of pore widths indicates that the majority of pores are sufficiently large to allow for diffusion of hydrogen and dihydrogen phosphate with stoke s radii of 0 35 and 0 26 nm respectively hong et al 2009 the relevance of mesopores for p adsorption was demonstrated by suresh kumar et al 2017 who found at low p concentrations a linear relationship between the mesopore bet specific surface area and p adsorption in granulated activated carbon coated with fe oxides the pore size values for 2 l and 6 l ferrihydrite obtained by wang et al 2013 range from 1 6 to 4 4 nm the relatively large variability of pore sizes measured for ics can be explained by changing conditions in the surrounding water during the growth of the coating the composition of the inflow water in the sand filter can be variable as well as the position of the grains in the filter caused by backflushing both types of events might affect the structure of fe precipitates in the sand filters jentzsch and penn 2006 van beek et al 2020 and hence pore size distribution based on the optimized mass transfer coefficient α of 1 56 10 4 h 1 the time scale of the slow adsorption process is about 6400 h consequently the required equilibration times for determining kp in batch experiments using ics grains would be much longer than the duration of the column experiments this implies that column experiments in combination with reactive transport modeling appear to be more efficient for estimating the equilibrium partition coefficient of p for ics furthermore there are practical limitations for the use of batch experiments to constrain kp for ics as the coating can be lost during shaking and reduced to small pieces chardon et al 2012 the obtained value of kp compares well to those reported in other studies we found kp 3 56 l g for pure ics or 28 1 l g fe deduced from the estimated kp for the ics sand mixture see table 1 at an equilibrium p concentration of 1 70 mg l corresponding to p contents of 6 06 mg g ics or 47 7 mg p g fe 0 09 p fe molar ratio in the solid phase wang et al 2013 report a value of 52 3 mg g fe for 2 l ferrihydrite powder in equilibrium with 1 0 mg l dissolved p while chardon et al 2012 obtained 56 83 mg g fe for iron sludge from drinking water treatment in column experiments at 3 95 mg l after 283 days 6792 h lambert et al 2020 report a maximum adsorption of 16 3 mg g fe for ics in a column experiment after 280 days 6720 h and a 20 mg l inflow concentration surprisingly the value is lower than ours as the inflow concentrations in lambert et al 2020 experiment were considerably higher and the duration of their experiment was longer compared to our experiments however the amount of ics in the column used by lambert et al 2020 was 195 g about seven times larger than in this study at a comparable flow rate of 2 53 cm h the experiment only captured the pronounced initial increase in effluent concentrations and not the prolonged slow increase afterward in this stage of the experiment adsorption at the slow sites is of lower relevance leading to lower values when calculating an apparent partition coefficient according to our results the equilibrium solid concentration at a dissolved p concentration of 20 mg l is 120 7 mg g fe when only considering the fraction with fast rates 4 5 of total adsorbed 5 5 mg g fe are reached which is close to the value obtained by lambert et al 2020 in their batch experiments with 24 h equilibration time 5 93 mg g fe per surface area the maximum p adsorption we obtained was 0 084 mg m2 which is very similar to the value of 0 081 mg m2 obtained by koopmans et al 2020 for fe containing precipitates from drinking water treatment which was used 14 months for soil amendment the optimized partition coefficient kp is conditional and expected to depend on ph ionic strength and the presence of other ions adsorbing to ics the model was calibrated and validated for ph 6 80 0 05 0 10 m ionic strength 1 70 0 05 mg l inflow concentration and no competing ions higher ph reduces p adsorption r zhang et al 2022 due to competing oh ions and a decreasing surface charge at higher ph differences in ionic strengths can alter p adsorption by mitigating electrostatic effects the effect of ph and ionic strength could be accounted for when applying surface complexation models including the acid base chemistry of surface sites and electrostatic corrections such as the generic ddl model parameterized by dzombak and morel 1991 for hydrous ferric oxides hfo the generic ddl provides a kp value of 36 10 l g fe for hfo at our experimental conditions this value is 28 higher than the kp we obtained for ics but is in the same order of magnitude the corresponding surface excess of 0 064 mg m2 is however lower than calculated by the ddl model as dzombak and morel 1991 consider a theoretical ssa of 600 m2 g for hfo which is higher than the bet surface area of ics nevertheless we consider the possibility that based on the ddl model the kp value could be adjusted to other conditions by determining the relative effect of p distribution when changing ph or ionic strength next to ph and ionic strength the equilibrium distribution coefficient can be affected by the presence of ions such as organic matter sulfate carbonates silicates and arsenate competing with phosphate for surface sites grafe et al 2002 hiemstra 2018 liu et al 2018 mendez and hiemstra 2019 and should be taken into consideration when treating natural waters also temperature is expected to effect both equilibrium concentrations and rate constants but the temperature effect is out of the scope of this study 4 3 implications for practical applications the contribution of slow sites to p adsorption has practical consequences for the design operation and lifespan of ics filters integrating stop flow periods in the operation of filters allows the regeneration of fast adsorption sites but the resting times have to be sufficient for p to be transferred to slow sites we tested five different operation scenarios i continuous flow ii resting 3 months a year during summer time iii resting 1 week and iv 2 weeks per month for a 40x40x40 cm filter with 4 l h flow and 1 mg l inflow water the target is to keep concentrations below 0 15 mg l the scenarios are not strictly comparable scenarios ii and iii treat the same volume 75 of the total volume in scenario i scenarios ii and iii demonstrate the contributions of slow kinetics and the effect of different lengths in the resting periods on p retention to make the treated volume in scenario iv comparable to scenario i we assumed that 2 filter compartments of the given dimensions are used with alternating resting periods every 2 weeks fig 5 displays the p concentrations in the effluent for all scenarios scenario ii exhibits a larger recovery than scenario iii this effect is reached because the resting period is longer nevertheless after 24 000 h 2 years in operation they both reach a comparable final concentration of about 0 15 mg l and retain a similar mass of p for the same treated volume about 0 065 kg p comparing scenarios i and iv with the same treated volume the continuous filter scenario i needs to be replaced three times in five years every 1 65 years to meet the 0 15 mg l target instead scenario ii can meet the target using only two filters and alternating operation every 2 weeks making use of two filters scenario ii retains 0 342 kg while scenario i retains 0 167 kg p using three filters in five years 5 summary and conclusion a quantitative model for phosphate adsorption on ics was developed which was able to account for slow adsorption reactions with the intention to provide a tool for optimizing the application of ics filters the conceptual two site model including transport limited adsorption kinetics was supported by electron microscopic analyses of ics long term column experiments under several flow conditions were used to calibrate and validate the model the model reproduced phosphate concentration of continuous and intermittent flow conditions as well as adsorption and desorption adsorption proceeded rapidly on a small number of sites 4 5 and is described with a linear equilibrium adsorption model adsorption on most sites proceeded slowly on the time scale of months which we related to intra particle diffusion the calculated maximum adsorption capacity under experimental conditions was 47 7 mg g fe or 0 084 mg m2 at 1 70 mg p l inflow implying an equilibrium partition coefficient of 28 1 l g fe the model was used to test how ics filter operation can be optimized to exploit the high capacity of the slow adsorption an example shows how introducing resting periods improve the phosphate removal and operation duration of ics filters from your results we conclude phosphate adsorption on ics takes place at two times scales fast adsorbing sites at the outside of the grains and slow kinetic adsorption into the iron coating only 4 5 of sites are in equilibrium and represent fast accessible sites optimal ics filter operation contains recovery phases flow interruptions in the time scale of the slow adsorption process weeks to months can extend the filter operation time significantly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1211,iron coated sand ics is a by product from drinking water treatment made of sand coated with ferric iron hydr oxides it is considered a suitable material for large scale measures for phosphate removal from natural and agricultural waters to prevent eutrophication previous studies demonstrated that the residence time of water must be very long to reach equilibrium partitioning between phosphate and ics but specifics for application are missing first sem edx images were used to support the conceptual assumption that p adsorption inside the coating is a transport limited process second a conceptual model of phosphate adsorption was proposed considering two types of sites one type with fast adsorption kinetics and reaching equilibrium with the percolating solution and another type for which adsorption is also reversible but described by pseudo first order kinetics the latter is conceived to account for transport limited adsorption in the interior of the coating while the former fraction of sites is assumed to be easily accessible and located close to the grain surface third the kinetics of phosphate adsorption on ics were quantitatively determined to describe and predict phosphate retention in filters under various flow conditions the model was calibrated and validated with long term column experiments which lasted for 3500 h to approach equilibrium on the slowly reacting sites the model reproduced the outflowing phosphate concentrations the pronounced increase after a few pore volumes and the slow increase over the remaining part of the experiment the parameterized model was also able to predict the time evolution of phosphate concentrations in the outflow of column experiments with different flow velocities flow interruption and in desorption experiments the equilibrium partition coefficient for the experimental conditions was identified as 28 1 l g fe at ph 6 8 and a phosphate concentration of 1 7 mg p l the optimized first order mass transfer coefficient for the slow adsorption process was 1 56 10 4 h 1 implying that the slow adsorption process has a time scale of several months however based on the parameterized model the slow adsorption process accounted for 95 5 of the equilibrium adsorption capacity emphasizing the potential relevance of this process for practical applications the implications for the design operation

quality bol et al 2018 de klein and koelmans 2011 dupas et al 2018 kronvang et al 2007 schoumans et al 2014 withers et al 2014 because of the legacy p stored in the soil reducing manure and fertilizer application is insufficient to reduce p loads reaching surface waters barcala et al 2020 bieroza et al 2019 gu et al 2017 sharpley et al 2013 phytoremediation reducing the p in the soils by plant uptake can reduce the legacy p but it will take decades before p losses to surface waters are reduced fiorellino et al 2017 koopmans et al 2004 lucas et al 2021 stoll et al 2021 one option for short term p load reduction is the implementation of permeable reactive barriers filled with iron fe containing materials they can remove p from percolating water on its hydrological pathway from groundwater to surface waters das gupta et al 2012 nur et al 2014 penn et al 2011 2017 2020 rittmann et al 2011 stoner et al 2012 particularly well suited are byproducts from water treatment containing ferric iron hydr oxides given their easy availability and high binding affinity for p iron coated sand ics and fe sludge are residuals of deferrization of drinking water a common procedure for deferrization is to oxidize dissolved fe ii and remove the produced fe hydr oxides using sand filters by this an fe coating develops around the sand grains resulting in ics ippolito et al 2011 sharma et al 2002 van beek et al 2016 2020 ics and fe sludge have been used to adsorb phosphate in soils in filters around or at the end of tile drains and in decentralized water treatment at farms boujelben et al 2008 chardon et al 2021 koopmans et al 2020 lambert et al 2020 moelants et al 2011 vandermoere et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the adsorption capacity of ics is often underestimated as slow adsorption kinetics controlled by intra particle diffusion are neglected ajmal et al 2018 koopmans et al 2004 willett et al 1988 iron hydr oxides in the coating of ics are usually poorly crystalline or amorphous and exhibit a large specific surface area accounting for a high adsorption capacity chardon et al 2012 koopmans et al 2020 however the coating can be several hundreds of micrometers thick implying that the outer surface only represents a minor part of the total interfacial area the outer surface of the ics is in direct contact with the percolating water and the rates of adsorption are only controlled by the kinetics of the reaction however adsorption sites located in the interior of the coating can only be accessed via intra particle diffusion the time scale of intra particle diffusion is generally much longer than that of the surface reactions and hence the phosphate adsorption rates in the interior of the coating are transport limited the long term adsorption capacity of ics can be underestimated when neglecting the slow transport limited kinetics the time scale of the slow adsorption exceeds the duration of typical batch adsorption experiments chardon et al 2012 showed that the experimentally derived adsorption capacity of fe sludge progressively increased in batch experiments over the duration of 21 days and in column experiments which lasted 238 days even further the relevance of processes with different time scales was also reflected in the column experiments p concentrations in the effluent quickly increased without reaching the inflow concentrations instead a quasi steady state was reached at different p concentrations depending on the amount of fe sludge in the column this implies that the removal efficiency of fe containing filters depends on the contact time of the water in the filter being a function of pore volume and flow rates lambert et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022 investigated phosphate adsorption on ics in batch and column experiments zhang et al 2022 reported that the p outflow concentrations reached a quasi steady state while the experimental data in lambert et al 2020 only represent fast p adsorption as experiments were stopped before the quasi steady state was reached in both studies the bohart adams model was applied to describe the breakthrough curves of phosphate the bohart adams model only accounts for the kinetics of one irreversible adsorption reaction and consequently its performance is limited when dealing with processes proceeding with different paces lambert et al 2020 parameterized the model for the pronounced increase in dissolved p concentrations until adsorption equilibrium is reached for the fast reacting sites however when changing flow velocities the contribution of the slow adsorption processes to p retention varied and consequently column experiments with different flow velocities required individual optimization of model parameters in particular the obtained p adsorption capacity was larger for the column operated at slow flow than that at fast flow and both were significantly larger than the capacity obtained in a 1 day batch experiment furthermore lambert et al 2020 reported that a pilot filter operated with intermittent resting periods performed better than when operated with continuous flow for the same treated volumes these results demonstrate that slow adsorption kinetics need to be considered for optimizing the operation of ics filters and the need for a reactive transport model which accounts for the kinetics of both fast and slow adsorption processes here and in the following the term kinetics is used in the broadest sense encompassing rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions as well as transport processes such as diffusion zhang 2008 the objective of this study was to develop a quantitative model for phosphate adsorption on ics that can adequately account for slowly proceeding phosphate adsorption which can be easily implemented and applied to optimize the operation of ics containing filters electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy was used to illustrate the model consideration that phosphate retention in the interior of the iron coating is transport limited a process based physical model including kinetic adsorption of phosphate on ics was parameterized using long term column measurements the model represents the slow kinetics dominated by the diffusion of phosphate inside the ics coating and the fast adsorption on the outer surface of the ics it is shown that the model can be a valuable tool to optimize the design and operation of ics filters over their whole lifespan with different flow velocities and intermittent flow regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 iron coated sand the ics used in this study was provided by aquaminerals bv https aquaminerals com en the material was obtained from one mixed batch originating from different drinking water production sites the ics received no pre treatment was obtained air dried and stored in the dark at room temperature the ics contained on average 127 2 mg g fe 9 4 mg g mn 0 5 mg g s 9 6 mg g ca and 0 9 mg g p 0 1 mg g standard deviation determined by total destruction the brunauer emmet teller specific surface area bet ssa was 71 2 m2 g and was determined using argon gas with an asiqwin instrument quantachrome instruments in addition the pore size distribution in the ics was determined with the bet ssa analysis nano pores with a diameter between 0 42 and 2 00 nm were related to 54 of the specific surface and mesopores between 2 00 and 50 0 nm to 46 details of the measurement are specified in the supplement material 2 2 column experiments we performed flow experiments in 3 columns named i ii and iii the three columns were made from transparent polyethylene tubes of 30 8 cm height and 4 3 cm internal diameter the column dimensions were selected accounting for dispersivity and reducing boundary flow effects along the tube walls bromly et al 2007 lewis and sjöstrom 2010 the reactive core of the columns contained 30 g of ics and 300 g of quartz sand both with grain diameters between 1 18 mm and 2 00 mm the ics was mixed with quartz sand to reduce the breakthrough times by maintaining column dimensions according to recommendations based on previous column experiments bromly et al 2007 lewis and sjöstrom 2010 quartz sand is commonly used as an inert filling material in column experiments chardon et al 2012 jerez and flury 2006 mystrioti et al 2015 pérez lópez et al 2007 and it is assumed that it does not contribute to phosphate retention in the columns this implies that equilibrium constants or partition coefficients kp l g determined for the whole stationary phase can be normalized to the content of ics two layers of 180 g quartz gravel 2 mm were added at the top and bottom of the columns to improve the flow distribution the columns were fed from the bottom via tubes of 0 8 mm internal diameter which were also used for the outflow the total volume of the tubing was 14 5 cm3 and taken into consideration in the parametrization of the models the inflow solution was stored in 10 l glass bottles protected from the light with black plastic bags the bottles cups were modified to work as mariotte bottles maroto et al 2002 to maintain a constant head pressure of approximately 2 cm above the columns assuring full saturation a peristaltic pump masterflex l s with the corresponding tubing 13 l s masterflex was used for each column to maintain a constant flow the flow rate at the given pump speed was checked prior to the experiments different flow regimes were used in the three different columns including constant flow at various velocities but also variable flow patterns furthermore one column was used for a desorption experiment the chosen flow rates correspond to the range of flow velocities measured in field applications of ics for retaining phosphate in drainage systems barcala et al 2022 groenenberg et al 2013 the flow rate in column i was 0 65 ml min for 3500 h over 560 pore volumes for the first 1440 h column ii was running in parallel to column i with a flow rate of 0 65 ml min afterward the flow rate was reduced to 0 39 ml min for600 hours we also aimed to maintain the flow rate in column iii at 0 65 ml min during the first 1440 h of the experiment but clogging occurred the cause of the clogging was the obstruction of the outflow tube by particles the issue was solved by flushing the tube with water the tube was cleaned six times during this period although unintended clogging provided the opportunity to study the effect of interrupted flow and the data were included in this study after the problematic tube had been replaced for a new one column iii was used without interruptions during 720 h in a desorption experiment at 0 65 ml min in addition a second adsorption experiment with a flow rate of 0 39 ml min was performed in column iii for the last 600 h adsorption experiments were performed with a solution prepared from demineralized water containing 1 70 0 05 mg l p in the form of monobasic sodium phosphate solution in order to maintain the ionic strength constant 0 10 m nacl was also added the desorption experiment was performed with 0 10 m nacl without p the ph was adjusted with naoh to 6 80 0 05 and controlled weekly in the inflow and outflow the retention times at 0 65 ml min where 375 min in column i 329 min in column ii and 301 min in column iii samples were collected every 8 h with an autosampler sc 4dxs elemental scientific in 50 ml pe centrifuge tubes pre acidified with 1 ml 6 m hcl the volume collected by the autosampler during a sampling interval served as a periodic control of the flow rate p concentrations mg l equivalent to mg p l in samples were measured photometrically dr3900 hach as samples form a blue complex that follows beer s law when reacting with an acidified ammonium heptamolybdate solution and freshly added ascorbic acid murphy and riley 1962 for the first 40 days one sample per day was analyzed with icp oes avio 500 perkin elmer as an independent measurement because stanmod simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 can only deal with constant flow velocities the data series from columns i and ii were quality checked and a few points that were affected by flow rate reductions were removed preliminary tracer experiments were performed in all columns to determine pore volumes and porosities for this 0 10 m nacl solution was used containing additionally 0 10 m nabr the flow was 0 65 ml min samples were taken manually every 12 min for 9 h electric conductivity ec was measured and bromine br concentrations were determined by ion chromatography ics6000 thermo scientific to determine the breakthrough of the non reactive tracer 2 3 ics imaging techniques sem edx analyses were performed to investigate the structure of the ics coating and to examine the p distribution this was done to illustrate the conceptual idea of transport limited uptake of p inside the coating sem micrographs and elemental maps were made for fresh ics and for ics after adsorption from column iii the grains were embedded in resin and polished to investigate cross sections secondary electron and backscattered electron images were acquired on a sem evo 15 zeiss using the smartsem user interface v 6 06 semi qualitative chemical compositions were obtained using edx esprit v 2 1 bruker xflash 2 4 reactive transport model the conceptual model was parametrized into a reactive transport model using the advection dispersion equation and including two reactive adsorption terms in order to account for different adsorption rates two types of adsorption sites were included fast reacting sites for which the reaction progresses in time scales shorter than the hydraulic residence and conceived to reach equilibrium with the p concentrations in the mobile phase and sites for which the adsorption is kinetically controlled adsorption of p to ics is conceived as a reversible process the fast adsorption process was characterized by linear adsorption using an equilibrium partition coefficient kp the assumption of linearity is warranted at relatively low p concentrations as the relative occupation of adsorption sites remains low in equilibrium and the concentrations of occupied sites can be neglected in the mass balance for the reactive sites when the content of vacant sites can be assumed to be constant the kinetics of p adsorption to ics simplify to pseudo first order rate laws for p adsorption and desorption solely depending on the p concentration in the mobile phase and p adsorbed to slowly reacting sites respectively the derivation of the equations is available in the supplementary material based on this conceptual model the corresponding mass balance equations for p in the mobile and stationary phase in one dimension read 1 1 ρf k p θ c t d 2 c x 2 v c x ρα θ s eq s 2 s t α s eq s where c is the p concentration mg l in the mobile phase x is the longitudinal coordinate cm t is time h ρ is the bulk ics density g l f is the fraction of fast reacting sites θ is the porosity kp is the equilibrium constant or partition coefficient l g d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 h v is the pore water velocity equal to the darcian flow velocity divided by porosity cm h α can be attributed to the rate constant for p desorption but also conceived as the exchange coefficient between the stagnant and mobile phase 1 h see supplementary material for details and s is the p concentration in the solid phase for which adsorption is kinetically controlled mg g s eq is not an extra variable but the equilibrium concentration in the solid phase of the slow sites equal to k p 1 f c the concentration of p bound to the fast reacting sites being in equilibrium with the percolating solution is not a state variable in the model but is calculated based on the product of f c and kp 2 5 model solution and parameter estimation at constant flow and constant p concentrations in the inflow the equation system has an analytical solution that has been implemented in the code stanmod simunek et al 1999 van genuchten et al 2012 we used the module cxtfit toride et al 1995 for parameter estimation that minimizes the root mean squared error rmse between the experimental and calculated concentrations the hydraulic properties pore water velocity v and the porosity θ of each column were determined separately from the tracer experiments we identified adsorption parameters f α and kp by calibrating the p concentrations in the effluent of column i over the first 690 h of the experiment during the first 690 h icp oes was used to measure p concentrations afterward the photometric method was used having a higher analytical uncertainty and some irregularities occurred in the flow such as short periods of flow decrease these points were still included in the data series as the long term p retention could still be observed the model was validated by calculating rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 for the effluent concentrations in column i over the whole experiment duration of 3500 h the concentrations in column ii during the first1440 hours and the p concentration of the last 600 h of column iii in the latter case the experiment was conceived as an independent p removal experiment and any possibly remaining p in the column after the preceding adsorption and desorption experiments was neglected for variable flow rates eqs 1 and 2 do not have an analytical solution therefore we implemented a numerical solution using the r packages reactran and desolve soetaert and herman 2009 soetaert and meysman 2012 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 the model in r was fed with the calibrated parameters obtained from column i the dynamic model allows to validate the experiment with intermittent flow velocities flow interruptions we calculated the rmse and r2 between the parametrized model s results and the effluent of column iii during the flow interruptions and for the desorption experiments the model is available at https github com victoriabarcala ics adsorptionmodel the optimized value for kp is conditional and accounts for the affinity of sorption sites for p at the given conditions plus the total concentration of sites for example phosphate adsorption to ferric iron hydr oxides depends among other factors on ph and ionic strength morel and hering 1993 to assess the possibility to extrapolate the model to other conditions we compared the obtained value of kp with calculated values based on surface complexation models for this the generic diffuse double layer ddl model parameterized by dzombak and morel 1991 for hydrous ferric oxide and implemented in mineql version 5 0 was used to calculate the p partition for the given experimental conditions and calculate the corresponding kp 2 6 practical example we used the numerical r model to set up a practical example illustrating the implications of considering the kinetics of p adsorption in the application of ics the example considers the use of ics to remove dissolved p from water at the effluent of tile drains installed in an agricultural area thus the chosen setting parameters are close to reality the average p concentration in the incoming water is assumed to be 1 0 mg l and the target p concentration should be below 0 15 mg l after passing the filter this concentration was chosen as the dutch implementation of the water framework directive establishes a 0 15 mg l limit in total phosphorus for open regional waters such as ditches fraters et al 2021 the filter has a porosity of 0 50 1770 g l bulk density with a fe concentration of 0 13 mg fe g ics and the filter dimensions are 40x40x40 cm the flow rate during operation is 4 l h we compare the efficiency of four different filter operations i continuous flow ii resting 3 months a year during summertime iii resting 1 week and iv 2 weeks per month 3 results 3 1 microscopy and ics analysis the coatings around ics grains have a thickness between 100 μm and 300 μm and often exhibited an anisotropic structure fig 1 the fe rich coating is traversed by mn rich layers typically exhibiting a higher porosity fig 1 a and 1 b in the investigated coatings edx analyses show a distinct p enrichment in their outer part fig 1 d highlight point 1 and 1 f point 4 edx spectra are available in the supplementary material in the outer parts fig 1 f point 4 comprising about 20 of the coating p fe ratios were around 0 040 and about 10 times larger than in the p poor areas fig 1 f point 5 with ratios about 0 004 additionally several thin layers with elevated p fe ratios were identified close to the core fig 1 f point 3 no p was detected in the mn rich areas fig 1 f point 6 the coatings were disrupted by several cracks some of the cracks exhibited p enrichments at the margins fig 1 d point 2 however most cracks seen on figs 1 c and 1 d do not show this feature and were possibly created when vacuuming the sample before sem analysis 3 2 adsorption experiments the general features of the time evolution of p concentrations in the effluent of column i were representative of the adsorption experiments with all columns after an initial increase in outflow concentrations a quasi steady state was reached at concentrations lower than in the inflow solution fig 2 a between hours 240 and 960 the outflow concentrations were about 1 05 mg l for column i representing 62 of the inflow concentration the pronounced increase in p concentrations occurred significantly later than the hydraulic retention time reflecting the retention of p via adsorption also at the beginning of the experiment a one site model assuming equilibrium partitioning of p cannot trace the measured effluent p concentrations fig 2 a in particular the model cannot produce a prolonged period of virtually constant concentrations below inflow concentration in contrast the two site model based on eqs 1 2 was able to reproduce the features of the concentration curve including the pronounced increase after the first days of operation and the plateau concentration reached after about 240 h fig 2 the equilibrium constant for the fast sites kp was identified with 0 155 l g for the ics sand mix and 3 57 l g for pure ics with 95 confidence intervals 1 15 5 98 l g table 1 the small value for the fraction of fast adsorption sites f 0 045 indicates that most adsorption sites were located within the fe coating the small value for the mass transfer coefficient α 1 56 10 4 h 1 reflects the slow transfer process hydraulic parameters have been identified separately through tracer tests which showed recovery rates of 97 the dispersion coefficient d was fitted to 30 cm2 h and the peclet number to 5 05 the tracer test curves and sensitivity analysis of the parameters in stanmod are available in the supplementary material the model was first validated for column i by modeling the whole duration of the experiment 3500 h beyond the first 960 h for which parameters were determined the larger deviation between observed and calculated data is associated with an increase in analytical uncertainty due to the switch in the analytical method notably the model accounted for the slow increase in p concentration as the system was approaching equilibrium fig 2 b and 3 b the change in outflow concentration due to the slow adsorption process is emphasized when comparing concentrations at an early and a late stage of the experiment in fig 3 b by the end of the experiment the effluent concentration in column i reached around 1 35 mg l corresponding to a p content in the solid phase of around 2 16 mg g ics or 17 0 mg g fe 0 03 p fe molar ratio at this moment the effluent concentrations were still below the inflow concentration implying that equilibrium was not reached with the model we extended the running time to two years the projected outflow p concentration was 1 60 mg l 94 of the inflow concentration and the concentration in the solid phase was 6 00 mg g ics or 47 02 mg g fe this value is close to the expected p loading in equilibrium s eq tot c k of 6 07 mg g ics or 47 57 mg g fe 0 09 p fe molar ratio we thus conclude that when the experiment ended about 36 of the equilibrium concentration in the solid was reached we obtained more validation results by running the transport model for the other columns with the parameters f α and kp identified for column i and the specific hydraulic parameters for each column the model reproduced very well the effluent concentrations from column ii fig 2 c table 1 and column iii fig 2 d table 1 at different flow velocities when column iii reached quasi steady state the effluent concentrations were around 0 75 mg l and significantly lower than the values reached in columns i and ii with higher flow velocities the flow rate in column ii was decreased to 0 39 ml min to investigate the effect of changing the flow rate on the p concentrations at quasi steady state as expected p concentrations decreased and stabilized at a new quasi steady state about 0 2 mg l lower than effluent concentrations of column i fig 3 a illustrating the increasing effect of the slow adsorption process at increasing contact time stop flow situations were studied with the early column iii data where unintended flow interruptions due to obstructions in the outflow tube our conceptual model predicts the transfer of p from fast to slow sites due to diffusion during stopped flow accompanied by decreasing concentrations of dissolved p in the column consequently we expect lower p concentrations in the effluent after resuming the flow similar to the initial phase of the column experiments indeed at most flow interruptions the p concentrations in the effluent followed the expected pattern and the previous concentrations were approached with some retardation fig 4 a the numerical model was able to reproduce the stop flow regime in column iii r2 0 91 table 1 figs 4 c and 4 d show the calculated time evolution of the concentrations in the mobile and stationary phases inside column iii the flow interruptions were reflected in a pronounced decrease in dissolved p concentrations in particular at the lower part of the column where the solution was entering the continuation of p adsorption during stopped flow resulted in increasing contents of adsorbed p fig 4 d after 1481 h but only 693 h with flow 1 39 mg g ics of p were adsorbed being 22 of the equilibrium concentration later 0 57 mg g about 40 of the previously adsorbed mass was recovered in the desorption experiment in 720 h the transfer of phosphate from fast to slowly reacting sites becomes less efficient when the slow sites approach equilibrium as the distance from equilibrium s eq s which drives the transfer becomes smaller during the desorption experiment in column iii the effluent concentrations decreased and reached a quasi state concentration of about 0 4 mg l fig 4 b this can be attributed to the release of p from the slow reacting sites the quasi steady state behavior was well reproduced by the model while the agreement between the model s results and observation is lower in the transition period as concentrations drop faster than predicted the desorption process was modeled with the same mass transport rate α implying that transport limitations also retard desorption consequently techniques only relying on p desorption may not be efficient for phosphate recovery due to the long time scale of desorption 4 discussion 4 1 expediency of the two side model considering transport limited kinetics for the adsorption process in a two site model was crucial to reproduce p outflow concentrations of long term column experiments the two site adsorption model proved suitable to describe and predict p retention for different operational scenarios including the variations in constant flow velocities interrupted flow and desorption although parameterized for one column experiment for a limited duration it was able to reproduce the features of the observed effluent p concentrations in all other experimental settings in particular quasi steady state concentrations being key in determining the p removal throughout the experiments were well reproduced at all flow conditions only during transient flow periods when resuming the flow or after abrupt changes in inflow concentrations the predictive capability of the model was lower the apparent delay in the predicted p concentrations in the outflow after flow interruptions or in the desorption experiment can be partially attributed to the remaining solution in the inert gravel layer at the top of the column this layer is not included in the dynamic model and dissolved p concentrations do not change during no flow concentrations due to the absence of ics the reactive model does not include an explicit description of the intra coating diffusion process instead the transport limitation is accounted for in the parameter α which can be interpreted as an exchange coefficient between the stagnant phase intra coating porosity and a mobile phase see supplementary material for details an equivalent approach was used before to describe phosphate desorption from soil particles koopmans et al 2004 adsorption was considered to be reversible and to follow a linear isotherm the desorption experiment demonstrates that adsorption of p to ics is reversible studying p adsorption onto ics lambert et al 2020 employed langmuir and freundlich isotherms for dissolved p concentrations in the range of 0 1200 mg l both isotherms may be approximated by a linear relationship at concentrations lower than 20 mg l in our study dissolved p concentrations remain below levels at which deviation from linearity is typically reported for p adsorption isotherms and solid phase contents remain below the saturation capacity for example reported for ferrihydrites wang et al 2013 the linear approximation is justified in the context of applying ics for p removal in drainage water in the netherlands which typically have soluble reactive phosphate concentrations below 2 mg l p rozemeijer et al 2014 4 2 model parameters despite the dilution of ics with non reactive sand and the long duration of the experiment equilibrium between dissolved and adsorbed p was not achieved the correlation of parameters f kp and α complicate the unequivocal determination of each parameter particularly the pronounced initial increase in p concentrations can be reproduced with infinite combinations of f and kp similarly quasi steady state concentrations are controlled by a combination of kp and α however the very slow increase in dissolved p concentrations after the initial increase constraints α and allows a robust estimation of the partition coefficient kp and consequently f the major part of the adsorption capacity lays inside the coating the fraction of fast adsorption sites f was only 4 5 reflecting the small number of sites at the outermost layer of the coating which is in direct contact with the porewater sem edx analyses support the conceptual assumption that p adsorption inside the coating is a transport limited process p is not homogeneously distributed but enriched in the outer part of the coating and in some narrow layers inside the coating although sem edx micrographs indicate the possibility of p transport through macro pores in the coating transport into the bulk of the coating is likely controlled by diffusion through the intra porosity of the fe precipitates which is supposed to be faster than solid diffusion willett et al 1988 the fe hydr oxides in the coating are expected to be of low crystallinity comparable to the structure of ferrihydrite a pore width between 0 42 and 50 nm was obtained from bet analyses being about half of them mesopores 2 50 nm the range of pore widths indicates that the majority of pores are sufficiently large to allow for diffusion of hydrogen and dihydrogen phosphate with stoke s radii of 0 35 and 0 26 nm respectively hong et al 2009 the relevance of mesopores for p adsorption was demonstrated by suresh kumar et al 2017 who found at low p concentrations a linear relationship between the mesopore bet specific surface area and p adsorption in granulated activated carbon coated with fe oxides the pore size values for 2 l and 6 l ferrihydrite obtained by wang et al 2013 range from 1 6 to 4 4 nm the relatively large variability of pore sizes measured for ics can be explained by changing conditions in the surrounding water during the growth of the coating the composition of the inflow water in the sand filter can be variable as well as the position of the grains in the filter caused by backflushing both types of events might affect the structure of fe precipitates in the sand filters jentzsch and penn 2006 van beek et al 2020 and hence pore size distribution based on the optimized mass transfer coefficient α of 1 56 10 4 h 1 the time scale of the slow adsorption process is about 6400 h consequently the required equilibration times for determining kp in batch experiments using ics grains would be much longer than the duration of the column experiments this implies that column experiments in combination with reactive transport modeling appear to be more efficient for estimating the equilibrium partition coefficient of p for ics furthermore there are practical limitations for the use of batch experiments to constrain kp for ics as the coating can be lost during shaking and reduced to small pieces chardon et al 2012 the obtained value of kp compares well to those reported in other studies we found kp 3 56 l g for pure ics or 28 1 l g fe deduced from the estimated kp for the ics sand mixture see table 1 at an equilibrium p concentration of 1 70 mg l corresponding to p contents of 6 06 mg g ics or 47 7 mg p g fe 0 09 p fe molar ratio in the solid phase wang et al 2013 report a value of 52 3 mg g fe for 2 l ferrihydrite powder in equilibrium with 1 0 mg l dissolved p while chardon et al 2012 obtained 56 83 mg g fe for iron sludge from drinking water treatment in column experiments at 3 95 mg l after 283 days 6792 h lambert et al 2020 report a maximum adsorption of 16 3 mg g fe for ics in a column experiment after 280 days 6720 h and a 20 mg l inflow concentration surprisingly the value is lower than ours as the inflow concentrations in lambert et al 2020 experiment were considerably higher and the duration of their experiment was longer compared to our experiments however the amount of ics in the column used by lambert et al 2020 was 195 g about seven times larger than in this study at a comparable flow rate of 2 53 cm h the experiment only captured the pronounced initial increase in effluent concentrations and not the prolonged slow increase afterward in this stage of the experiment adsorption at the slow sites is of lower relevance leading to lower values when calculating an apparent partition coefficient according to our results the equilibrium solid concentration at a dissolved p concentration of 20 mg l is 120 7 mg g fe when only considering the fraction with fast rates 4 5 of total adsorbed 5 5 mg g fe are reached which is close to the value obtained by lambert et al 2020 in their batch experiments with 24 h equilibration time 5 93 mg g fe per surface area the maximum p adsorption we obtained was 0 084 mg m2 which is very similar to the value of 0 081 mg m2 obtained by koopmans et al 2020 for fe containing precipitates from drinking water treatment which was used 14 months for soil amendment the optimized partition coefficient kp is conditional and expected to depend on ph ionic strength and the presence of other ions adsorbing to ics the model was calibrated and validated for ph 6 80 0 05 0 10 m ionic strength 1 70 0 05 mg l inflow concentration and no competing ions higher ph reduces p adsorption r zhang et al 2022 due to competing oh ions and a decreasing surface charge at higher ph differences in ionic strengths can alter p adsorption by mitigating electrostatic effects the effect of ph and ionic strength could be accounted for when applying surface complexation models including the acid base chemistry of surface sites and electrostatic corrections such as the generic ddl model parameterized by dzombak and morel 1991 for hydrous ferric oxides hfo the generic ddl provides a kp value of 36 10 l g fe for hfo at our experimental conditions this value is 28 higher than the kp we obtained for ics but is in the same order of magnitude the corresponding surface excess of 0 064 mg m2 is however lower than calculated by the ddl model as dzombak and morel 1991 consider a theoretical ssa of 600 m2 g for hfo which is higher than the bet surface area of ics nevertheless we consider the possibility that based on the ddl model the kp value could be adjusted to other conditions by determining the relative effect of p distribution when changing ph or ionic strength next to ph and ionic strength the equilibrium distribution coefficient can be affected by the presence of ions such as organic matter sulfate carbonates silicates and arsenate competing with phosphate for surface sites grafe et al 2002 hiemstra 2018 liu et al 2018 mendez and hiemstra 2019 and should be taken into consideration when treating natural waters also temperature is expected to effect both equilibrium concentrations and rate constants but the temperature effect is out of the scope of this study 4 3 implications for practical applications the contribution of slow sites to p adsorption has practical consequences for the design operation and lifespan of ics filters integrating stop flow periods in the operation of filters allows the regeneration of fast adsorption sites but the resting times have to be sufficient for p to be transferred to slow sites we tested five different operation scenarios i continuous flow ii resting 3 months a year during summer time iii resting 1 week and iv 2 weeks per month for a 40x40x40 cm filter with 4 l h flow and 1 mg l inflow water the target is to keep concentrations below 0 15 mg l the scenarios are not strictly comparable scenarios ii and iii treat the same volume 75 of the total volume in scenario i scenarios ii and iii demonstrate the contributions of slow kinetics and the effect of different lengths in the resting periods on p retention to make the treated volume in scenario iv comparable to scenario i we assumed that 2 filter compartments of the given dimensions are used with alternating resting periods every 2 weeks fig 5 displays the p concentrations in the effluent for all scenarios scenario ii exhibits a larger recovery than scenario iii this effect is reached because the resting period is longer nevertheless after 24 000 h 2 years in operation they both reach a comparable final concentration of about 0 15 mg l and retain a similar mass of p for the same treated volume about 0 065 kg p comparing scenarios i and iv with the same treated volume the continuous filter scenario i needs to be replaced three times in five years every 1 65 years to meet the 0 15 mg l target instead scenario ii can meet the target using only two filters and alternating operation every 2 weeks making use of two filters scenario ii retains 0 342 kg while scenario i retains 0 167 kg p using three filters in five years 5 summary and conclusion a quantitative model for phosphate adsorption on ics was developed which was able to account for slow adsorption reactions with the intention to provide a tool for optimizing the application of ics filters the conceptual two site model including transport limited adsorption kinetics was supported by electron microscopic analyses of ics long term column experiments under several flow conditions were used to calibrate and validate the model the model reproduced phosphate concentration of continuous and intermittent flow conditions as well as adsorption and desorption adsorption proceeded rapidly on a small number of sites 4 5 and is described with a linear equilibrium adsorption model adsorption on most sites proceeded slowly on the time scale of months which we related to intra particle diffusion the calculated maximum adsorption capacity under experimental conditions was 47 7 mg g fe or 0 084 mg m2 at 1 70 mg p l inflow implying an equilibrium partition coefficient of 28 1 l g fe the model was used to test how ics filter operation can be optimized to exploit the high capacity of the slow adsorption an example shows how introducing resting periods improve the phosphate removal and operation duration of ics filters from your results we conclude phosphate adsorption on ics takes place at two times scales fast adsorbing sites at the outside of the grains and slow kinetic adsorption into the iron coating only 4 5 of sites are in equilibrium and represent fast accessible sites optimal ics filter operation contains recovery phases flow interruptions in the time scale of the slow adsorption process weeks to months can extend the filter operation time significantly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1212,hydrocarbon fate and transport in various categories of peatlands is complicated by the botanical origin and thus variations in the hydraulic structures and surface chemistry of its peat soils there has been no systematic evaluation of the role of different peat types on hydrocarbon migration thus two phase and three phase flow experiments were performed for living and partially decomposed peat cores from bog fen and swamp peatlands numerical simulations of water drainage were performed using hydrus 1d diesel water and diesel water air flow using matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst five water table wt fluctuations were imposed to explore its potential to reduce residual diesel saturation in peat columns our results demonstrate a good match of the relative water permeability k rw saturation s relations estimated using the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity s relation derived from hydrus 1d modeling of two phase flow and k rw s from mrst for three phase flow for all tested peat columns thus we recommended using two phase system based k rw s predictions if multiphase data are unavailable for peatland sites spill management plans we found the discharge of water and diesel both increase with increasing hydraulic conductivity while residual water and diesel were within the range of 0 42 0 52 and of 0 04 0 11 respectively high diesel discharge rates suggest that quick spill response is required to manage its spread in peatlands up to 29 of residual diesel saturation was yielded by the five wt fluctuations and thus we strongly recommend wt manipulation as a first step towards diesel decontamination progression in peatlands graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydrocarbon diesel immiscible flow water table fluctuation remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fuel hydrocarbon spills frequently impact natural environments including peatlands as a result of pipeline storage tank leakage train derailment etc canadian examples of accidental hydrocarbon spills in peatlands include the nipisi spill of 9500 m3 of crude oil in northern alberta blenkinsopp et al 1996 wang et al 1998 nexen long lake spill of 5000 m3 bitumen emulsion in northern alberta in 2015 aer 2015 and 200 m3 of gasoline and diesel fuel spilled from a train derailment in grande plée bleue peatland near levi qc in august 2004 tsb 2006 oil spills in peatlands can severely impact above and below ground micro organisms gupta et al 2020 having extensive and lasting consequences on peatland ecosystem services given the ecological impacts of such accidents the fate and transport of fuel hydrocarbon in peat soil and peatlands is not yet sufficiently characterized estimating the mobility of fuel hydrocarbon in peat might help designing suitable remediation techniques for peat which has never been tested and urgently required to support spill management in peatlands hydrocarbon spills form a non aqueous phase liquid napl in soils napl transport in peatlands like in other groundwater systems are controlled by soil s hydraulic and multiphase flow characteristics gharedaghloo and price 2017 2019 while peatlands can exhibit a range of hydraulic conductivity of up to five orders of magnitude within the top 50 cm of a given peatland rezanezhad et al 2016 2020 most laboratory studies on multiphase flow properties are for mineral soils having hydraulic conductivity ranges generally from 4 2 10 8 to 4 6 10 4 m s 1 essaid et al 2015 the pore structure and pore network of near surface peat varies significantly with depth gharedaghloo et al 2018 causing the multiphase flow relations to vary strongly down the peat profile gharedaghloo and price 2017 2019 underscored the need to investigate multiphase flow and capillary pressure saturation relative permeability p c s k r relations and residual saturation of napl s nr within peat soils to improve prediction of napl migration in peatlands they observed the s nr is a function of peat soil hydraulic properties and saturation history to evaluate the effects of peat properties on napl flow and retention gharedaghloo and price 2019 performed immiscible fluid diesel displacement experiments for bog peat soils they observed that the percolation velocity of diesel increased with peat hydraulic conductivity and residual diesel saturation positively correlated with peat bulk density ρ b they also observed that the residual diesel could be remobilized by water table fluctuations which they suggested as a potential field method to physically and non intrusively remove a fraction of the retained napl while their study shed light on napl transport in bog peat the variations of napl transport and trapping within other peat types remain unknown in this work we attempt to characterize horizontal napl flow within and between undisturbed bog fen and swamp peat columns also using diesel peat is the undecomposed remains of plants that accumulates in peatlands because the prevailing anaerobic conditions slow decomposition bog peat is dominated by sphagnum mosses fen peat comprises the remains of sedges brown mosses and sometimes sphagnum whereas swamp peat is typically formed from woody material and leaf litter paavilainen and päivänen 1995 the first objective of this study is to characterize the saturation relative permeability relations for three phase water diesel air flow within and between peatlands the second objective is to evaluate the role of water table fluctuations on remobilization of residual diesel we provide a comparative analysis of multiphase flow behaviours for bog fen and swamp peat soils with a set of recommendations for future research finally we discuss how the findings of this study will help policy makers and spill response managers prepare effective short and long term spill management and remediation plans for fuel hydrocarbon polluted peatlands 2 methods peat samples were collected from a bog located in the luther marsh wildlife management area 43 55 n 80 25 w a fen located in the fletcher creek ecological preserve area 43 24 n 80 7 w and a swamp located in the mccormick point peatland unofficial name 43 24 n 80 15 w all three sites in southern ontario canada the bog is dominated by sphagnum rubellum wilson with a covering of ericacea including chamaedaphne calyculata l moench rhododendron groenlandicum and vaccinium spp also investigated by price et al 2008 gharedaghloo and price 2019 the fen is a calcareous fen minerotrophic i e fed principally by water rich in calcium magnesium and bicarbonate dominated by carex flava l c livida sphagnum etc see duval et al 2012 the swamp peat was from forested peatland consisting scattered hardwood trees acer saccharinum fraxus nigra and tall shrubs ilex verticillate along with few herbs campbell et al 1997 at all sites large samples 50 cm l 10 cm w 10 cm d were extracted while frozen using a chainsaw and cut into layers representing 0 to 5 cm and 15 to 20 cm depths referred to herein as upper and lower layer respectively field samples 4 from each depth were wrapped in plastic film and then placed in a box of dimensions of 50 cm l 10 cm w 10 cm d to protect them from mechanical disturbance during transport to the laboratory in the laboratory 5 cm diameter and 35 cm length cores were cut from frozen peat samples such that the long axis represented the horizontal flow direction three such cores were prepared from each depth thus a total of 6 3 cores 2 depths for each peat type giving a total of 18 3 core 2 depths 3 peat types in this study each frozen core was then placed into polycarbonate columns of 50 cm length and 5 cm inner diameter considering the previously reported method used to minimize sample disturbance gharedaghloo and price 2019 rezanezhad et al 2012 mccarter et al 2018 peat cores were kept frozen while i collected from target sites ii transported to the laboratory iii shaped to the desired dimension and iv inserted into a column with similar inside dimensions likewise 18 small cores of 5 cm length and 8 cm inner diameter were extracted from the same initial frozen peat sample and placed in polycarbonate rings of similar dimension for measurement of porosity ф bulk density ρ b and ash contents small cores were saturated from the bottom with tap water and kept saturated for 36 h in a water bath considering these cores were used for hydrophysical characterizations the pore water chemistry changes due to tap water was assumed insignificant further we avoided purging these short and long columns with co2 to avoid any changes in gas saturation and ph of pore water next small cores were placed in a 1 bar pressure plate extractor soil moisture equipment corp model 1600 to characterize the soil water retention curves wrc using pressure heads of 20 40 60 80 100 160 300 and 700 cm soil water retention curve data were needed to inversely simulate van genuchten mualem vgm parameters using retc upon mass stabilization for each sample at each pressure head 1 g lost over 24 h mass of sample i e small core was recorded all small cores were subsequently dried at 80 c for 48 h to determine their dry weight for calculation of their ρ b and volumetrically determined porosity i e ф vol another 18 small cores of 5 cm length and 8 cm inner diameter were used to determine particle density pd pd was estimated using the pycnometer method outlined by blake and hartge 1986 by placing dry ground peat samples of known mass into a known volume of kerosene and calculated as 1 pd ρ b pd of each core was used to calculate pd based porosity i e ф pd as vol mass dry pd vol average of ф vol and ф pd was considered in two phase and three phase flow simulations constant head saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat tests were performed for each long core 5 times on each then k sat was calculated by applying darcy s law separately loss on ignition 500o c for 5 h in a muffle furnace tests were done to determine peat ash content ash content is a commonly reported feature to characterize the peat soil properties water drainage tests three trials on each core were prepared by saturating the long cores from below until the water level was 10 cm above core surface fig a1 a vertical flow system was used to direct flow along the horizontal pathway representing lateral flow in the respective peatland this was done to limit the systematic pore size variations along the core which are common in vertical peat profiles which incorporate increasingly decomposed peat with depth at time t 0 water was released from the bottom of the core and the outflow was collected from the bottom valve of the column until complete drainage by gravity i e up to t 1250 s some upper layer samples took less time to drain completely drainage of water allowed air entry into the peat matrix when the water table dropped below the peat surface to create an air water flow system the recorded outflow data were used to assess water relative permeability k rw in the two phase water air system using hydrus 1d simulations next a diesel displacement test was performed to estimate the diesel relative permeability k rn using the method described by gharedaghloo and price 2019 with this method 11 cm of diesel was added to the column above the surface of the water saturated peat water was allowed to flow out through the bottom valve causing diesel to enter into the peat the two phase flow system diesel water ended when all the diesel had flowed into the peat after which air entered into the pore spaces forming a three phase diesel water air flow system the volume and timing of the outflow liquid i e diesel and water were recorded by placing a graduated cylinder on a weighing scale and the discharge of diesel was recorded visually cumulative water and diesel outflow were recorded during two and three phase flow events for 48 h or until water diesel flow had stopped water drainage two phase water air and three phase water diesel air displacement tests were performed for each of 18 peat columns the amount of diesel left in the peat column at the end of the 48 h three phase displacement test was considered as residual diesel determined using mass balance approach to remobilize this residual napl from the peat column the water table wt fluctuation test was performed for each cycle the water table inside all peat columns was raised to the peat surface and then the column was allowed to drain under gravity and the effluent was collected the wt rise and fall process was repeated 5 times on each column each cycle hereafter referred to as wt1 wt2 wt5 respectively after which the peat cores were removed from the polycarbonate cylinder and sliced into 5 cm long segments these segments were squeezed with a hydraulic press 120 atm gharedaghloo and price 2019 to assess the remaining water and diesel content assuming the redistribution of water and diesel among sliced peat segments we reported the cumulative value of liquid water or diesel of all 5 segments one value per column cumulative diesel outflow data of a peat column were then used in multiphase flow modeling to estimate the diesel relative permeability relations of the peat column 2 1 modeling 2 1 1 retention curve fitting with retc measured water retention data of each short peat core was processed with the retc curve fitting program van genuchten et al 1991 and hydraulic conductivity assessed with the vgm model as described in annexure ii van genuchten 1980 retc parameters including residual volumetric moisture content θ r the tortuosity parameter l a parameter corresponding to the inverse of the air entry pressure α a measure of the pore size distribution n and m 1 1 n were calibrated for each small core by matching their measured soil water content matric potential θ ψ data saturated volumetric soil content θ s assumed equal to ф and measured k sat were provided as fixed values 2 1 2 two phase air water system water drainage was modeled for the tested columns using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 hydris 1d has been used in our previous observations and modeling studies for peat soils mccarter and price 2014 mccarter et al 2017 2019 simhayov et al 2018 dixon et al 2017 kettridge et al 2016 all assuming that compressibility is not an issue at pressures commonly experienced in most column experiments using gravity drainage nor at pressures caused by water table change commonly observed in most undisturbed peatlands sample shrinkage does occur at low pressures such as those commonly used in pressure chambers for determining residual moisture contents we drained a 35 cm column from which no evaporation occurred thus the pressure at the top of the column decreased to 35 cm at these pressures ranging from 0 35 cm no sample shrinkage occurred thus application of hydrus 1d is appropriate inverse modeling was used to estimate the peat s water retention characteristics by matching the measured and modeled drainage rates in hydrus 1d retc fitted values of θ r l α n and m were given an initial estimate table s1 the vgm parameters θ r α n and m were varied to obtain a pc s match the upper boundary condition was defined as zero water flux to allow air imbibition into peat and the lower boundary condition was defined as atmospheric with pressure head of 0 to represent drainage in pressure heads both agree with the real case where the upper one would be purely air imbibition into the pore space and the lower end of the column would be exposed to the room air and be at the atmospheric pressure the initial condition was a positive head value sufficient to ensure a saturated peat column then the cumulative bottom flux and k θ relation of water for the water air system were estimated later this relation was used in two phase napl water simulations 2 1 3 three phase system two phase flow and subsequently three phase flow in the peat column was modeled using matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst mrst 2017 lie 2019 a time varying napl injection boundary condition was defined at the top of the column for the two phase flow period of the experiment followed with a time varying air injection boundary condition at the top of column for the three phase flow period the bottom boundary condition of the column was defined as atmospheric bottom hole pressure bhp to allow gravity drainage of water and napl through the two phase and three phase flow periods water and diesel density were provided as 1 g cm3 and 0 83 g cm3 respectively dynamic viscosity of water and diesel were assigned as 1 mpa s and 2 mpa s gharedaghloo and price 2019 respectively in the inverse modeling processes the modeled cumulative water and diesel outflow volumes were calculated and compared to the observed values and the rmse of water and diesel outflow volume was calculated finally k r s relations of napl were calibrated by matching the cumulative drained water and napl time series with model predictions eq 1 and eq 2 describe the power law relative permeability relationship used to determine the curvature of the relative permeability relations n w and n n respectively are power index of water relative permeability and diesel relative permeability 1 k rw s e n w 2 k rn 1 s e n n 3 results 3 1 hydrophysical and hydraulic properties the upper layer i e 0 5 cm of the bog was loose sphagnum as shown in fig s1 the lower layer i e 15 20 cm of the bog was partially decomposed peat similarly the upper layer of the fen was peat soil containing components of sphagnum carex roots and poorly decomposed litter while its lower layer was composed of partially decomposed peat and calcareous materials in the swamp core the upper layer was dead and decomposed leaf litter and the lower layer was heavily rooted notably decomposed peat soil the average of ф vol and ф pd of the upper layer trended bog swamp fen table 1 a similar trend in ф was observed in the lower layer but where bog fen swamp for bog fen and swamp the upper layers had higher k sat than the respective lower layers while ρ b and ash content were lower for top layers k sat trended swamp bog fen while ρ b and ash content trended fen swamp bog pd ranged from 0 66 to 1 24 g m 3 trending bog swamp fen 3 2 water drainage vgm parameters were calibrated for each long core table 2 and table s2 by matching their water drainage time series with hydrus modeling results examples of cumulative water production for each depth and site type are shown in fig 1 data for all cores are shown in figs s2 s4 likewise the measured water retention curves ψ θ were used to calibrate each set of short core parameters with retc examples of matched retention curves are shown in fig 2 all data available in fig s5 s7 table s1 the residual water content θ r was highest in swamp peat 0 33 0 55 cm3 cm 3 followed by that in fen 0 24 0 44 cm3 cm 3 and bog 0 09 0 5 cm3 cm 3 vgm parameter patterns generated for long cores using hydrus table 2 matched well with those derived for short cores using retc table s1 but values are different the estimated values of α inversely related to the air entry pressure van genuchten 1980 ranged from 0 36 to 1 51 cm 1 and from 0 18 to 1 45 cm 1 for the upper and lower bog soil layer respectively in fen peat the equivalent values were 0 36 0 55 cm 1 for the upper layer and between 0 3 and 0 52 cm 1 for the lower peat layer in swamp the α parameter ranged from 0 18 to 1 12 cm 1 and 0 3 1 45 cm 1 for the upper and lower layers respectively the error associated with each match of observed and hydrus simulated data is listed in table 2 with rmse always 0 1 ml for water volumes ranging between 100 500 ml 3 3 diesel discharge measured and mrst modeled water and diesel production for bog fen and swamp columns matched well fig 3 data for all cores are shown in figs s8 s10 mrst generated parameters along with associated errors are listed in table 3 the measured and modeled liquid water diesel saturations ranged from 0 54 to 0 59 and 0 49 0 55 respectively and thus measured and simulated air saturations 0 41 0 46 and 0 40 0 47 respectively table 3 however there was no clear trend in liquid saturations within or between peat soils nor air saturations the maximum and minimum errors were 3 6 7 6 ml of diesel and 0 86 2 07 ml of diesel of diesel production from fen c and from bog f columns respectively there is no clear trend of errors within or between peat soils 3 4 reduction of residual diesel under water table fluctuation cycles water table fluctuations remobilized a fraction of the diesel in peat pore space table 4 in general more diesel was recovered from the deeper more decomposed bog and fen peat soils than from their upper layers average diesel reduction 26 5 vs 9 5 for bog and 16 8 and 9 6 for fen respectively however in swamp cores this trend was reversed with lower layers experiencing less reduction average 13 8 than upper layers 22 6 we found that one of the swamp cores swamp core f sampled at 15 20 cm depths at the same location had much lower recovery values than the other swamp cores 4 discussion hydrocarbon contamination can exist in a soil matrix as free dissolved or gas phase however the distinct differences in properties of peat from different peatland types verry et al 2011 necessitates independent assessment of their multiphase flow characteristics which is the goal of this paper in contrast to its distribution in a mineral soil matrix peat soil can have a much higher water content and a distinctly different hydraulic structure reflecting its botanical origin these properties can vary systematically within a peatland gharedaghloo and price 2017 and as demonstrated here between peatland types this necessitates independent assessment of multiphase flow characteristics of peat soil for different peat types and different stages of decomposition gharedaghloo and price 2019 and gupta et al 2020 established that multiple imbibition drainage cycles such as those caused by episodic wt level variations affect the distribution of phases free phase napl water and air in a manner that favours napl release from the peat matrix the implications of wt variation and napl redistribution needs to be further understood especially across different peatland types we found the magnitude of ф of the upper layer soil in bog swamp fen while in the case of the lower layer soils bog swamp fen table 1 we found porosity very close to the previously reported porosity by price et al 2008 and by gharedaghloo and price 2019 for the same bog peat when estimating using pd our values of pd were close to 0 75 g m 3 and the range suggested by whittington et al 2021 who suggested that the calculation of ф using pd can be more accurate than doing so volumetrically average of ф vol and ф pd and ρ b of bog and fen soils were comparable to previous observations from the same peatlands by gharedaghloo and price 2019 and duval 2010 respectively porosity for the swamp site has not previously been reported we found an inverse relationship between k sat and ρ b in all three peat types liu and lennartz 2018 fig 4 fen k sat values were comparatively lower than that in the other two peat types but in line with previous observations at this site duval 2010 at the swamp site k sat was similar between the upper layer 0 09 0 19 cm s 1 and the lower more decomposed soil 0 14 cm s 1 we found a good relationship p value 0 05 between ф and ρ b for bog fen and swamp soils using a linear mixed model the hydraulic parameters ф k sat and vgm parameters α n of this study were plotted fig 4 as a function of ρ b along side values presented by liu and lennartz 2018 values here represent a relatively narrow range of bulk densities compared to the data of liu and lennartz 2018 porosity expressed a function of ρ b showed a similar trend to liu and lennartz values k sat values from the shallow layer were within the range of those reported by liu and lennartz 2018 but the deeper peat values were relatively high for a given bulk density α values were similar to their reported values while n values representing the pore size distribution were distinctly higher for a given bulk density than those of liu and lennartz 2018 in general parameter values from our 15 20 cm peat plotted higher with respect to bulk density than those of liu and lennartz 2018 the large n values indicating a larger pore size distribution may be associated with macropores whose presence will elevate both ф and k sat overall the results indicate that hydraulic and vgm parameters are affected by peat decomposition depth and to a lesser extent peatland type information on and understanding of their influence will better enable us to predict hydrological parameters for two three phase flow we tested the water drainage i e two phase system from each peat core and found a faster water outflow higher k sat table 1 from the upper layer of the bog and swamp soils compared to the fen soils this suggests a greater abundance of large pore sizes causing a weaker capillary force in the upper layer of the bog and swamp soils in the fen soils drainage volume was higher but slower to drain compared to bog and swamp soils the ranges of residual water saturations of this study are in line with previous observations by gharedaghloo and price 2019 who reported ranges from 0 46 to 0 55 46 7 55 8 for bog soils the difference between the saturated water contents i e ф and residual water contents θ r trended bog fen swamp this would suggest that more discharge can be expected from bog soils for a given drop in water table compared to fen and swamp soils we drained a 35 cm column from which no evaporation occurred thus the pressure at the top of the column decreased to 35 cm we acknowledge that at moisture contents at the lower end of retention curves shown in fig 2 and the lower saturations fig 5 associated with pressures down to 750 cm these relationships become uncertain due to the effects of sample shrinkage especially relative permeability of water k rw however in none of our experimental setups nor in field scenarios do the pressures and saturations approach this value so this uncertainty will not impact our results or their applicability in real field conditions our laboratory derived residual water content θ r is likely to be the parameter most affected by shrinkage at low pressures 750 cm range however while errors in θ r alter the water retention curve they have little impact on the relationship in the portion used herein for modeling two phase and three phase flow we acknowledge that in field scenarios strong desiccation caused by evaporation over extended periods may alter the peat structure fortunately in such cases free phase napl will be less able to move field investigations into peat structure changes in natural settings are needed accompanied with experimental approaches to determine the implications for napl behavior under such conditions here we focus on the simpler scenario in which there is negligible peat volume change like water release we found cumulative water and diesel production from the upper bog soils were higher higher k sat table 1 than from lower more decomposed bog soils low k sat table 1 indicating a greater potential for diesel movement laterally in peatlands with less dense peat gharedaghloo and price 2017 the outflow of diesel from the upper layer soils tended to approach equilibrium quicker than it did in the deeper peat soils fig 3 following the pattern of hydraulic conductivity in this study measured and simulated diesel outflow and tendency to reach equilibrium matched well fig 3 confirming our parameterization of the capillary pressure relative permeability relationships of diesel in peat soils generally fitted values of the capillary pressure relative permeability relationship of diesel may cause the differences in observed and modeled outflow curves hassanizadeh et al 2002 hwang and powers 2003 o carroll et al 2005 in our study the well defined relationships between capillary pressure and saturation could be used to more efficiently calibrate multiphase flow parameters eight in our case these multiphase parameters were water saturation air saturation n w n n n a n n permeability and porosity considering the variability within and between peatland types due to state of peat decomposition hydrological and botanical character these eight parameters were required to accurately simulate diesel outflow we found any change in these eight parameters resulted in high errors in the diesel outflow thus the reduction in number of parameters required for accurate prediction of diesel outflow from peat soils is challenging given that this is the first study to estimate three phase flow through a peat matrix there is insufficient supporting data to allow us to reduce the number of parameters required to simulate multiphase flow and remains an important avenue for research given that our values are based on the total porosity the curves of our figures fig 2 and fig 5 represents the pore size distributions associated with total porosity here we consider the implications of using total porosity versus the use of an effective porosity associated with the mobile water fraction reported for peats mccarter et al 2019 in the context of diesel transport in peatlands one has to first select either mobile immobile porosity or total porosity based on research objectives and date availability if mobile porosity is used in the estimation the curve of the graphs will be different than those presented herein for mobile porosity based estimation this work can be repeated to model two phase and three phase flow by incorporating dual permeability mobile immobile regions of the peat matrix should these parameters become available given the difficulty and uncertainty associated with estimating mobile porosity we see value in using and reporting commonly reported and easy to determine values of total porosity nevertheless to better represent the peat structure in the estimation of three phase flow in peats we suggest the consideration of effective mobile porosity may confer some advantages in future research we did simulations for each column with varying combinations of 8 parameters until the minimum water and diesel error was 1 of spilled diesel volume minimum and maximum water error was 2 2 ml and 9 7 ml respectively with diesel error being 2 07 ml 0 86 of spilled diesel volume and 7 7 ml 3 2 of spilled diesel volume respectively table 3 table s3 also documents the low error of the mass balance of measured diesel from the respective peat columns gharedaghloo and price 2019 reported a similar range of errors for bog peat soils this could be practical for assessing oil spills in peatlands for which peat hydraulic properties vary strongly with degree of decompositions see fig 4 fig s14 to predict water and diesel discharge to downgradient locations we also observed a good match of the k rw s relations estimated using unsaturated hydraulic conductivity s from hydrus 1d modeling for water drainage in presence of air and k rw s from mrst for three phase i e water diesel air flow for all tested peat columns fig 5 and figs s11 s13 gharedaghloo and price 2019 first reported the applicability of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity to forecast the k rw s relation for water drainage in presence of napl this suggests the k rw s relations estimated from unsaturated k for the air water system can be useful in the absence of three phase k rw s relations for bog fen and swamp peatlands thus we recommended the use of the k rw s relations estimated from water air flow in estimating water k rw s in presence of napl in the bog soils the residual saturation was higher in the deeper more decomposed peat compared to that in the upper layer and were similar to those reported by gharedaghloo and price 2019 these findings support their hypothesis that the bog will favour transport in the near surface layers compared to its deeper layers however the transport in the near surface layers is less clear in case of fen and swamp soils as residual saturations varied over a similar range for both layers table 3 interestingly the air and liquid saturations for top layer and lower layer peat soils were distinctly different for bog fen and swamp peat soils table 3 gharedaghloo and price 2017 explain the stratification of napl such that little is imbibed into deeper peat the fluctuating water table in the source zone will move the lnapl outward into the drainage ditch where it can be collected without significantly smearing in the lower layers of peat based on the quick outflow of diesel from columns illustrated here immediate action is required to manage discharge from peat soils thus spills management response teams must have pre planned protocols to assess the fluid mobility in peatlands and a strategy like installing and pumping ditches to enhance wt fluctuation to recover spilled contaminant and restrict plume expansion as to the longer term ecosystem consequences the short periods of proposed water table lowering are unlikely to impact plant health gharedaghloo and price 2019 and gupta et al 2020 suggested imposing wt fluctuations as a non destructive approach for reducing residual napl in bog soils this could reduce later remediation costs we succeeded in reducing residual diesel up to 29 4 by applying five wt fluctuation cycles wt1 wt5 the initial three wt fluctuation cycles wt1 wt3 were more effective especially for the deeper more decomposed peat soils table 4 in later wt fluctuation cycles wt4 wt5 the amount of diesel removed from the peat matrix was either small or not measurable the residual napl remobilization with this approach could be used as a non destructive tool for napl removal from peatlands water table fluctuations in the field occur naturally or could be imposed by cycling effluent to a pumped interceptor ditch therein collecting the contaminant it seems likely that a series of water table manipulations can reduce napl saturation to residual saturation values whereupon there is no threat for its migration downgradient however a soluble fraction may continue to be generated whose fate also needs to be considered the hydraulic parameters that govern water and hence napl behavior in peatlands require a broader sampling since variability alone within a given peatland type is large liu and lennartz 2018 moreover transport in bogs and poor fens is strongly affected by microtopography mccarter and price 2017 with higher transport rates in hollows balliston et al 2018 in the current experiments soil samples from bog fen and swamp were treated identically however fen peatlands generally have a high and relatively stable water table bog water tables are typically lower and more variable while in swamps the water table is highly variable and periodically deep devito et al 1996 elmes et al 2021 these aspects have major implications for napl transport for example the fluctuating water table in shallow horizons of the bog peat may remobilize more residual napl as compared to the relatively stable water table in the shallow fen horizons thus remobilized napl can enhance its horizontal flux in bogs these conditions notably the high near surface permeability along with decreased peat permeability with depth enhances horizontal napl flux in bogs in typical fen peatlands there will be less napl outflow from remobilization during a water table fluctuation compared to bogs because there will be relatively less remobilization of napl under their relatively stable water table conditions in swamp peatlands the deeper and more variable water tables than in bogs and fens will spread napl vertically into the large variably saturated zone thus reduce the napl saturation hence horizontal mobility of napl to summarize one can expect relatively thin napl contaminated horizons in fen peatlands but more residual napl compared to that in bogs due to the fen s relatively stable water table a deeper water table may create comparatively thick napl contaminated zone in swamps hence increase the difficulty of remediation we strongly recommend to consider water table manipulations as a first step towards spill managements in peatlands we argue that the range of induced water table fluctuation should be no more than the maximum range observed in undisturbed systems and that drainage ditches at the perimeter of the contaminated source zone should be considered to restrict wider contamination 5 conclusion hydrocarbon resource development in and around peatlands impose risks of petroleum hydrocarbon leakage on these ecologically sensitive areas despite the potential severity of the consequences on downgradient aquatic ecosystems there is a gap in our knowledge of multiphase parameter values controlling liquid hydrocarbon redistribution within peatlands this research has attempted to improve our understanding of the nature of parameter variability in peat at different states of decomposition near surface and deeper layers in bog fen and swamp peat soils we simulated two phase air water and three phase napl water air flow through the peat matrix using hydrus 1d and mrst respectively the rate of diesel outflow from peat soils directly varied with the pattern of hydraulic conductivity a close range of liquid saturations was observed for all peat soils tested we found the k rw s relations estimated for water air system can be useful for water relative permeability data for diesel imbibition for bog fen and swamp peatlands previously gharedaghloo and price 2019 suggested the same for bog peat soils we found imposing wt drawdown was a non destructive tool to reduce residual diesel saturations by up to 29 likewise wt rises that maintain the moisture regimes of the vadose zone will work effectively since this increases k rw and thus lowers the diesel saturations thus we recommend imposing wt fluctuations for spill management as an alternate method than complete excavation of contaminated peat which is a common practice in contaminated peat sites future research is needed to incorporate more samples with a greater range of decomposition botanical origins and for frozen peat in the vadose zone from different landscapes it is imperative that larger peatland scale experiments be conducted to incorporate the inherent variability of hydraulic properties and hydrological behavior that drives water and napl

1212,hydrocarbon fate and transport in various categories of peatlands is complicated by the botanical origin and thus variations in the hydraulic structures and surface chemistry of its peat soils there has been no systematic evaluation of the role of different peat types on hydrocarbon migration thus two phase and three phase flow experiments were performed for living and partially decomposed peat cores from bog fen and swamp peatlands numerical simulations of water drainage were performed using hydrus 1d diesel water and diesel water air flow using matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst five water table wt fluctuations were imposed to explore its potential to reduce residual diesel saturation in peat columns our results demonstrate a good match of the relative water permeability k rw saturation s relations estimated using the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity s relation derived from hydrus 1d modeling of two phase flow and k rw s from mrst for three phase flow for all tested peat columns thus we recommended using two phase system based k rw s predictions if multiphase data are unavailable for peatland sites spill management plans we found the discharge of water and diesel both increase with increasing hydraulic conductivity while residual water and diesel were within the range of 0 42 0 52 and of 0 04 0 11 respectively high diesel discharge rates suggest that quick spill response is required to manage its spread in peatlands up to 29 of residual diesel saturation was yielded by the five wt fluctuations and thus we strongly recommend wt manipulation as a first step towards diesel decontamination progression in peatlands graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydrocarbon diesel immiscible flow water table fluctuation remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fuel hydrocarbon spills frequently impact natural environments including peatlands as a result of pipeline storage tank leakage train derailment etc canadian examples of accidental hydrocarbon spills in peatlands include the nipisi spill of 9500 m3 of crude oil in northern alberta blenkinsopp et al 1996 wang et al 1998 nexen long lake spill of 5000 m3 bitumen emulsion in northern alberta in 2015 aer 2015 and 200 m3 of gasoline and diesel fuel spilled from a train derailment in grande plée bleue peatland near levi qc in august 2004 tsb 2006 oil spills in peatlands can severely impact above and below ground micro organisms gupta et al 2020 having extensive and lasting consequences on peatland ecosystem services given the ecological impacts of such accidents the fate and transport of fuel hydrocarbon in peat soil and peatlands is not yet sufficiently characterized estimating the mobility of fuel hydrocarbon in peat might help designing suitable remediation techniques for peat which has never been tested and urgently required to support spill management in peatlands hydrocarbon spills form a non aqueous phase liquid napl in soils napl transport in peatlands like in other groundwater systems are controlled by soil s hydraulic and multiphase flow characteristics gharedaghloo and price 2017 2019 while peatlands can exhibit a range of hydraulic conductivity of up to five orders of magnitude within the top 50 cm of a given peatland rezanezhad et al 2016 2020 most laboratory studies on multiphase flow properties are for mineral soils having hydraulic conductivity ranges generally from 4 2 10 8 to 4 6 10 4 m s 1 essaid et al 2015 the pore structure and pore network of near surface peat varies significantly with depth gharedaghloo et al 2018 causing the multiphase flow relations to vary strongly down the peat profile gharedaghloo and price 2017 2019 underscored the need to investigate multiphase flow and capillary pressure saturation relative permeability p c s k r relations and residual saturation of napl s nr within peat soils to improve prediction of napl migration in peatlands they observed the s nr is a function of peat soil hydraulic properties and saturation history to evaluate the effects of peat properties on napl flow and retention gharedaghloo and price 2019 performed immiscible fluid diesel displacement experiments for bog peat soils they observed that the percolation velocity of diesel increased with peat hydraulic conductivity and residual diesel saturation positively correlated with peat bulk density ρ b they also observed that the residual diesel could be remobilized by water table fluctuations which they suggested as a potential field method to physically and non intrusively remove a fraction of the retained napl while their study shed light on napl transport in bog peat the variations of napl transport and trapping within other peat types remain unknown in this work we attempt to characterize horizontal napl flow within and between undisturbed bog fen and swamp peat columns also using diesel peat is the undecomposed remains of plants that accumulates in peatlands because the prevailing anaerobic conditions slow decomposition bog peat is dominated by sphagnum mosses fen peat comprises the remains of sedges brown mosses and sometimes sphagnum whereas swamp peat is typically formed from woody material and leaf litter paavilainen and päivänen 1995 the first objective of this study is to characterize the saturation relative permeability relations for three phase water diesel air flow within and between peatlands the second objective is to evaluate the role of water table fluctuations on remobilization of residual diesel we provide a comparative analysis of multiphase flow behaviours for bog fen and swamp peat soils with a set of recommendations for future research finally we discuss how the findings of this study will help policy makers and spill response managers prepare effective short and long term spill management and remediation plans for fuel hydrocarbon polluted peatlands 2 methods peat samples were collected from a bog located in the luther marsh wildlife management area 43 55 n 80 25 w a fen located in the fletcher creek ecological preserve area 43 24 n 80 7 w and a swamp located in the mccormick point peatland unofficial name 43 24 n 80 15 w all three sites in southern ontario canada the bog is dominated by sphagnum rubellum wilson with a covering of ericacea including chamaedaphne calyculata l moench rhododendron groenlandicum and vaccinium spp also investigated by price et al 2008 gharedaghloo and price 2019 the fen is a calcareous fen minerotrophic i e fed principally by water rich in calcium magnesium and bicarbonate dominated by carex flava l c livida sphagnum etc see duval et al 2012 the swamp peat was from forested peatland consisting scattered hardwood trees acer saccharinum fraxus nigra and tall shrubs ilex verticillate along with few herbs campbell et al 1997 at all sites large samples 50 cm l 10 cm w 10 cm d were extracted while frozen using a chainsaw and cut into layers representing 0 to 5 cm and 15 to 20 cm depths referred to herein as upper and lower layer respectively field samples 4 from each depth were wrapped in plastic film and then placed in a box of dimensions of 50 cm l 10 cm w 10 cm d to protect them from mechanical disturbance during transport to the laboratory in the laboratory 5 cm diameter and 35 cm length cores were cut from frozen peat samples such that the long axis represented the horizontal flow direction three such cores were prepared from each depth thus a total of 6 3 cores 2 depths for each peat type giving a total of 18 3 core 2 depths 3 peat types in this study each frozen core was then placed into polycarbonate columns of 50 cm length and 5 cm inner diameter considering the previously reported method used to minimize sample disturbance gharedaghloo and price 2019 rezanezhad et al 2012 mccarter et al 2018 peat cores were kept frozen while i collected from target sites ii transported to the laboratory iii shaped to the desired dimension and iv inserted into a column with similar inside dimensions likewise 18 small cores of 5 cm length and 8 cm inner diameter were extracted from the same initial frozen peat sample and placed in polycarbonate rings of similar dimension for measurement of porosity ф bulk density ρ b and ash contents small cores were saturated from the bottom with tap water and kept saturated for 36 h in a water bath considering these cores were used for hydrophysical characterizations the pore water chemistry changes due to tap water was assumed insignificant further we avoided purging these short and long columns with co2 to avoid any changes in gas saturation and ph of pore water next small cores were placed in a 1 bar pressure plate extractor soil moisture equipment corp model 1600 to characterize the soil water retention curves wrc using pressure heads of 20 40 60 80 100 160 300 and 700 cm soil water retention curve data were needed to inversely simulate van genuchten mualem vgm parameters using retc upon mass stabilization for each sample at each pressure head 1 g lost over 24 h mass of sample i e small core was recorded all small cores were subsequently dried at 80 c for 48 h to determine their dry weight for calculation of their ρ b and volumetrically determined porosity i e ф vol another 18 small cores of 5 cm length and 8 cm inner diameter were used to determine particle density pd pd was estimated using the pycnometer method outlined by blake and hartge 1986 by placing dry ground peat samples of known mass into a known volume of kerosene and calculated as 1 pd ρ b pd of each core was used to calculate pd based porosity i e ф pd as vol mass dry pd vol average of ф vol and ф pd was considered in two phase and three phase flow simulations constant head saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat tests were performed for each long core 5 times on each then k sat was calculated by applying darcy s law separately loss on ignition 500o c for 5 h in a muffle furnace tests were done to determine peat ash content ash content is a commonly reported feature to characterize the peat soil properties water drainage tests three trials on each core were prepared by saturating the long cores from below until the water level was 10 cm above core surface fig a1 a vertical flow system was used to direct flow along the horizontal pathway representing lateral flow in the respective peatland this was done to limit the systematic pore size variations along the core which are common in vertical peat profiles which incorporate increasingly decomposed peat with depth at time t 0 water was released from the bottom of the core and the outflow was collected from the bottom valve of the column until complete drainage by gravity i e up to t 1250 s some upper layer samples took less time to drain completely drainage of water allowed air entry into the peat matrix when the water table dropped below the peat surface to create an air water flow system the recorded outflow data were used to assess water relative permeability k rw in the two phase water air system using hydrus 1d simulations next a diesel displacement test was performed to estimate the diesel relative permeability k rn using the method described by gharedaghloo and price 2019 with this method 11 cm of diesel was added to the column above the surface of the water saturated peat water was allowed to flow out through the bottom valve causing diesel to enter into the peat the two phase flow system diesel water ended when all the diesel had flowed into the peat after which air entered into the pore spaces forming a three phase diesel water air flow system the volume and timing of the outflow liquid i e diesel and water were recorded by placing a graduated cylinder on a weighing scale and the discharge of diesel was recorded visually cumulative water and diesel outflow were recorded during two and three phase flow events for 48 h or until water diesel flow had stopped water drainage two phase water air and three phase water diesel air displacement tests were performed for each of 18 peat columns the amount of diesel left in the peat column at the end of the 48 h three phase displacement test was considered as residual diesel determined using mass balance approach to remobilize this residual napl from the peat column the water table wt fluctuation test was performed for each cycle the water table inside all peat columns was raised to the peat surface and then the column was allowed to drain under gravity and the effluent was collected the wt rise and fall process was repeated 5 times on each column each cycle hereafter referred to as wt1 wt2 wt5 respectively after which the peat cores were removed from the polycarbonate cylinder and sliced into 5 cm long segments these segments were squeezed with a hydraulic press 120 atm gharedaghloo and price 2019 to assess the remaining water and diesel content assuming the redistribution of water and diesel among sliced peat segments we reported the cumulative value of liquid water or diesel of all 5 segments one value per column cumulative diesel outflow data of a peat column were then used in multiphase flow modeling to estimate the diesel relative permeability relations of the peat column 2 1 modeling 2 1 1 retention curve fitting with retc measured water retention data of each short peat core was processed with the retc curve fitting program van genuchten et al 1991 and hydraulic conductivity assessed with the vgm model as described in annexure ii van genuchten 1980 retc parameters including residual volumetric moisture content θ r the tortuosity parameter l a parameter corresponding to the inverse of the air entry pressure α a measure of the pore size distribution n and m 1 1 n were calibrated for each small core by matching their measured soil water content matric potential θ ψ data saturated volumetric soil content θ s assumed equal to ф and measured k sat were provided as fixed values 2 1 2 two phase air water system water drainage was modeled for the tested columns using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 hydris 1d has been used in our previous observations and modeling studies for peat soils mccarter and price 2014 mccarter et al 2017 2019 simhayov et al 2018 dixon et al 2017 kettridge et al 2016 all assuming that compressibility is not an issue at pressures commonly experienced in most column experiments using gravity drainage nor at pressures caused by water table change commonly observed in most undisturbed peatlands sample shrinkage does occur at low pressures such as those commonly used in pressure chambers for determining residual moisture contents we drained a 35 cm column from which no evaporation occurred thus the pressure at the top of the column decreased to 35 cm at these pressures ranging from 0 35 cm no sample shrinkage occurred thus application of hydrus 1d is appropriate inverse modeling was used to estimate the peat s water retention characteristics by matching the measured and modeled drainage rates in hydrus 1d retc fitted values of θ r l α n and m were given an initial estimate table s1 the vgm parameters θ r α n and m were varied to obtain a pc s match the upper boundary condition was defined as zero water flux to allow air imbibition into peat and the lower boundary condition was defined as atmospheric with pressure head of 0 to represent drainage in pressure heads both agree with the real case where the upper one would be purely air imbibition into the pore space and the lower end of the column would be exposed to the room air and be at the atmospheric pressure the initial condition was a positive head value sufficient to ensure a saturated peat column then the cumulative bottom flux and k θ relation of water for the water air system were estimated later this relation was used in two phase napl water simulations 2 1 3 three phase system two phase flow and subsequently three phase flow in the peat column was modeled using matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst mrst 2017 lie 2019 a time varying napl injection boundary condition was defined at the top of the column for the two phase flow period of the experiment followed with a time varying air injection boundary condition at the top of column for the three phase flow period the bottom boundary condition of the column was defined as atmospheric bottom hole pressure bhp to allow gravity drainage of water and napl through the two phase and three phase flow periods water and diesel density were provided as 1 g cm3 and 0 83 g cm3 respectively dynamic viscosity of water and diesel were assigned as 1 mpa s and 2 mpa s gharedaghloo and price 2019 respectively in the inverse modeling processes the modeled cumulative water and diesel outflow volumes were calculated and compared to the observed values and the rmse of water and diesel outflow volume was calculated finally k r s relations of napl were calibrated by matching the cumulative drained water and napl time series with model predictions eq 1 and eq 2 describe the power law relative permeability relationship used to determine the curvature of the relative permeability relations n w and n n respectively are power index of water relative permeability and diesel relative permeability 1 k rw s e n w 2 k rn 1 s e n n 3 results 3 1 hydrophysical and hydraulic properties the upper layer i e 0 5 cm of the bog was loose sphagnum as shown in fig s1 the lower layer i e 15 20 cm of the bog was partially decomposed peat similarly the upper layer of the fen was peat soil containing components of sphagnum carex roots and poorly decomposed litter while its lower layer was composed of partially decomposed peat and calcareous materials in the swamp core the upper layer was dead and decomposed leaf litter and the lower layer was heavily rooted notably decomposed peat soil the average of ф vol and ф pd of the upper layer trended bog swamp fen table 1 a similar trend in ф was observed in the lower layer but where bog fen swamp for bog fen and swamp the upper layers had higher k sat than the respective lower layers while ρ b and ash content were lower for top layers k sat trended swamp bog fen while ρ b and ash content trended fen swamp bog pd ranged from 0 66 to 1 24 g m 3 trending bog swamp fen 3 2 water drainage vgm parameters were calibrated for each long core table 2 and table s2 by matching their water drainage time series with hydrus modeling results examples of cumulative water production for each depth and site type are shown in fig 1 data for all cores are shown in figs s2 s4 likewise the measured water retention curves ψ θ were used to calibrate each set of short core parameters with retc examples of matched retention curves are shown in fig 2 all data available in fig s5 s7 table s1 the residual water content θ r was highest in swamp peat 0 33 0 55 cm3 cm 3 followed by that in fen 0 24 0 44 cm3 cm 3 and bog 0 09 0 5 cm3 cm 3 vgm parameter patterns generated for long cores using hydrus table 2 matched well with those derived for short cores using retc table s1 but values are different the estimated values of α inversely related to the air entry pressure van genuchten 1980 ranged from 0 36 to 1 51 cm 1 and from 0 18 to 1 45 cm 1 for the upper and lower bog soil layer respectively in fen peat the equivalent values were 0 36 0 55 cm 1 for the upper layer and between 0 3 and 0 52 cm 1 for the lower peat layer in swamp the α parameter ranged from 0 18 to 1 12 cm 1 and 0 3 1 45 cm 1 for the upper and lower layers respectively the error associated with each match of observed and hydrus simulated data is listed in table 2 with rmse always 0 1 ml for water volumes ranging between 100 500 ml 3 3 diesel discharge measured and mrst modeled water and diesel production for bog fen and swamp columns matched well fig 3 data for all cores are shown in figs s8 s10 mrst generated parameters along with associated errors are listed in table 3 the measured and modeled liquid water diesel saturations ranged from 0 54 to 0 59 and 0 49 0 55 respectively and thus measured and simulated air saturations 0 41 0 46 and 0 40 0 47 respectively table 3 however there was no clear trend in liquid saturations within or between peat soils nor air saturations the maximum and minimum errors were 3 6 7 6 ml of diesel and 0 86 2 07 ml of diesel of diesel production from fen c and from bog f columns respectively there is no clear trend of errors within or between peat soils 3 4 reduction of residual diesel under water table fluctuation cycles water table fluctuations remobilized a fraction of the diesel in peat pore space table 4 in general more diesel was recovered from the deeper more decomposed bog and fen peat soils than from their upper layers average diesel reduction 26 5 vs 9 5 for bog and 16 8 and 9 6 for fen respectively however in swamp cores this trend was reversed with lower layers experiencing less reduction average 13 8 than upper layers 22 6 we found that one of the swamp cores swamp core f sampled at 15 20 cm depths at the same location had much lower recovery values than the other swamp cores 4 discussion hydrocarbon contamination can exist in a soil matrix as free dissolved or gas phase however the distinct differences in properties of peat from different peatland types verry et al 2011 necessitates independent assessment of their multiphase flow characteristics which is the goal of this paper in contrast to its distribution in a mineral soil matrix peat soil can have a much higher water content and a distinctly different hydraulic structure reflecting its botanical origin these properties can vary systematically within a peatland gharedaghloo and price 2017 and as demonstrated here between peatland types this necessitates independent assessment of multiphase flow characteristics of peat soil for different peat types and different stages of decomposition gharedaghloo and price 2019 and gupta et al 2020 established that multiple imbibition drainage cycles such as those caused by episodic wt level variations affect the distribution of phases free phase napl water and air in a manner that favours napl release from the peat matrix the implications of wt variation and napl redistribution needs to be further understood especially across different peatland types we found the magnitude of ф of the upper layer soil in bog swamp fen while in the case of the lower layer soils bog swamp fen table 1 we found porosity very close to the previously reported porosity by price et al 2008 and by gharedaghloo and price 2019 for the same bog peat when estimating using pd our values of pd were close to 0 75 g m 3 and the range suggested by whittington et al 2021 who suggested that the calculation of ф using pd can be more accurate than doing so volumetrically average of ф vol and ф pd and ρ b of bog and fen soils were comparable to previous observations from the same peatlands by gharedaghloo and price 2019 and duval 2010 respectively porosity for the swamp site has not previously been reported we found an inverse relationship between k sat and ρ b in all three peat types liu and lennartz 2018 fig 4 fen k sat values were comparatively lower than that in the other two peat types but in line with previous observations at this site duval 2010 at the swamp site k sat was similar between the upper layer 0 09 0 19 cm s 1 and the lower more decomposed soil 0 14 cm s 1 we found a good relationship p value 0 05 between ф and ρ b for bog fen and swamp soils using a linear mixed model the hydraulic parameters ф k sat and vgm parameters α n of this study were plotted fig 4 as a function of ρ b along side values presented by liu and lennartz 2018 values here represent a relatively narrow range of bulk densities compared to the data of liu and lennartz 2018 porosity expressed a function of ρ b showed a similar trend to liu and lennartz values k sat values from the shallow layer were within the range of those reported by liu and lennartz 2018 but the deeper peat values were relatively high for a given bulk density α values were similar to their reported values while n values representing the pore size distribution were distinctly higher for a given bulk density than those of liu and lennartz 2018 in general parameter values from our 15 20 cm peat plotted higher with respect to bulk density than those of liu and lennartz 2018 the large n values indicating a larger pore size distribution may be associated with macropores whose presence will elevate both ф and k sat overall the results indicate that hydraulic and vgm parameters are affected by peat decomposition depth and to a lesser extent peatland type information on and understanding of their influence will better enable us to predict hydrological parameters for two three phase flow we tested the water drainage i e two phase system from each peat core and found a faster water outflow higher k sat table 1 from the upper layer of the bog and swamp soils compared to the fen soils this suggests a greater abundance of large pore sizes causing a weaker capillary force in the upper layer of the bog and swamp soils in the fen soils drainage volume was higher but slower to drain compared to bog and swamp soils the ranges of residual water saturations of this study are in line with previous observations by gharedaghloo and price 2019 who reported ranges from 0 46 to 0 55 46 7 55 8 for bog soils the difference between the saturated water contents i e ф and residual water contents θ r trended bog fen swamp this would suggest that more discharge can be expected from bog soils for a given drop in water table compared to fen and swamp soils we drained a 35 cm column from which no evaporation occurred thus the pressure at the top of the column decreased to 35 cm we acknowledge that at moisture contents at the lower end of retention curves shown in fig 2 and the lower saturations fig 5 associated with pressures down to 750 cm these relationships become uncertain due to the effects of sample shrinkage especially relative permeability of water k rw however in none of our experimental setups nor in field scenarios do the pressures and saturations approach this value so this uncertainty will not impact our results or their applicability in real field conditions our laboratory derived residual water content θ r is likely to be the parameter most affected by shrinkage at low pressures 750 cm range however while errors in θ r alter the water retention curve they have little impact on the relationship in the portion used herein for modeling two phase and three phase flow we acknowledge that in field scenarios strong desiccation caused by evaporation over extended periods may alter the peat structure fortunately in such cases free phase napl will be less able to move field investigations into peat structure changes in natural settings are needed accompanied with experimental approaches to determine the implications for napl behavior under such conditions here we focus on the simpler scenario in which there is negligible peat volume change like water release we found cumulative water and diesel production from the upper bog soils were higher higher k sat table 1 than from lower more decomposed bog soils low k sat table 1 indicating a greater potential for diesel movement laterally in peatlands with less dense peat gharedaghloo and price 2017 the outflow of diesel from the upper layer soils tended to approach equilibrium quicker than it did in the deeper peat soils fig 3 following the pattern of hydraulic conductivity in this study measured and simulated diesel outflow and tendency to reach equilibrium matched well fig 3 confirming our parameterization of the capillary pressure relative permeability relationships of diesel in peat soils generally fitted values of the capillary pressure relative permeability relationship of diesel may cause the differences in observed and modeled outflow curves hassanizadeh et al 2002 hwang and powers 2003 o carroll et al 2005 in our study the well defined relationships between capillary pressure and saturation could be used to more efficiently calibrate multiphase flow parameters eight in our case these multiphase parameters were water saturation air saturation n w n n n a n n permeability and porosity considering the variability within and between peatland types due to state of peat decomposition hydrological and botanical character these eight parameters were required to accurately simulate diesel outflow we found any change in these eight parameters resulted in high errors in the diesel outflow thus the reduction in number of parameters required for accurate prediction of diesel outflow from peat soils is challenging given that this is the first study to estimate three phase flow through a peat matrix there is insufficient supporting data to allow us to reduce the number of parameters required to simulate multiphase flow and remains an important avenue for research given that our values are based on the total porosity the curves of our figures fig 2 and fig 5 represents the pore size distributions associated with total porosity here we consider the implications of using total porosity versus the use of an effective porosity associated with the mobile water fraction reported for peats mccarter et al 2019 in the context of diesel transport in peatlands one has to first select either mobile immobile porosity or total porosity based on research objectives and date availability if mobile porosity is used in the estimation the curve of the graphs will be different than those presented herein for mobile porosity based estimation this work can be repeated to model two phase and three phase flow by incorporating dual permeability mobile immobile regions of the peat matrix should these parameters become available given the difficulty and uncertainty associated with estimating mobile porosity we see value in using and reporting commonly reported and easy to determine values of total porosity nevertheless to better represent the peat structure in the estimation of three phase flow in peats we suggest the consideration of effective mobile porosity may confer some advantages in future research we did simulations for each column with varying combinations of 8 parameters until the minimum water and diesel error was 1 of spilled diesel volume minimum and maximum water error was 2 2 ml and 9 7 ml respectively with diesel error being 2 07 ml 0 86 of spilled diesel volume and 7 7 ml 3 2 of spilled diesel volume respectively table 3 table s3 also documents the low error of the mass balance of measured diesel from the respective peat columns gharedaghloo and price 2019 reported a similar range of errors for bog peat soils this could be practical for assessing oil spills in peatlands for which peat hydraulic properties vary strongly with degree of decompositions see fig 4 fig s14 to predict water and diesel discharge to downgradient locations we also observed a good match of the k rw s relations estimated using unsaturated hydraulic conductivity s from hydrus 1d modeling for water drainage in presence of air and k rw s from mrst for three phase i e water diesel air flow for all tested peat columns fig 5 and figs s11 s13 gharedaghloo and price 2019 first reported the applicability of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity to forecast the k rw s relation for water drainage in presence of napl this suggests the k rw s relations estimated from unsaturated k for the air water system can be useful in the absence of three phase k rw s relations for bog fen and swamp peatlands thus we recommended the use of the k rw s relations estimated from water air flow in estimating water k rw s in presence of napl in the bog soils the residual saturation was higher in the deeper more decomposed peat compared to that in the upper layer and were similar to those reported by gharedaghloo and price 2019 these findings support their hypothesis that the bog will favour transport in the near surface layers compared to its deeper layers however the transport in the near surface layers is less clear in case of fen and swamp soils as residual saturations varied over a similar range for both layers table 3 interestingly the air and liquid saturations for top layer and lower layer peat soils were distinctly different for bog fen and swamp peat soils table 3 gharedaghloo and price 2017 explain the stratification of napl such that little is imbibed into deeper peat the fluctuating water table in the source zone will move the lnapl outward into the drainage ditch where it can be collected without significantly smearing in the lower layers of peat based on the quick outflow of diesel from columns illustrated here immediate action is required to manage discharge from peat soils thus spills management response teams must have pre planned protocols to assess the fluid mobility in peatlands and a strategy like installing and pumping ditches to enhance wt fluctuation to recover spilled contaminant and restrict plume expansion as to the longer term ecosystem consequences the short periods of proposed water table lowering are unlikely to impact plant health gharedaghloo and price 2019 and gupta et al 2020 suggested imposing wt fluctuations as a non destructive approach for reducing residual napl in bog soils this could reduce later remediation costs we succeeded in reducing residual diesel up to 29 4 by applying five wt fluctuation cycles wt1 wt5 the initial three wt fluctuation cycles wt1 wt3 were more effective especially for the deeper more decomposed peat soils table 4 in later wt fluctuation cycles wt4 wt5 the amount of diesel removed from the peat matrix was either small or not measurable the residual napl remobilization with this approach could be used as a non destructive tool for napl removal from peatlands water table fluctuations in the field occur naturally or could be imposed by cycling effluent to a pumped interceptor ditch therein collecting the contaminant it seems likely that a series of water table manipulations can reduce napl saturation to residual saturation values whereupon there is no threat for its migration downgradient however a soluble fraction may continue to be generated whose fate also needs to be considered the hydraulic parameters that govern water and hence napl behavior in peatlands require a broader sampling since variability alone within a given peatland type is large liu and lennartz 2018 moreover transport in bogs and poor fens is strongly affected by microtopography mccarter and price 2017 with higher transport rates in hollows balliston et al 2018 in the current experiments soil samples from bog fen and swamp were treated identically however fen peatlands generally have a high and relatively stable water table bog water tables are typically lower and more variable while in swamps the water table is highly variable and periodically deep devito et al 1996 elmes et al 2021 these aspects have major implications for napl transport for example the fluctuating water table in shallow horizons of the bog peat may remobilize more residual napl as compared to the relatively stable water table in the shallow fen horizons thus remobilized napl can enhance its horizontal flux in bogs these conditions notably the high near surface permeability along with decreased peat permeability with depth enhances horizontal napl flux in bogs in typical fen peatlands there will be less napl outflow from remobilization during a water table fluctuation compared to bogs because there will be relatively less remobilization of napl under their relatively stable water table conditions in swamp peatlands the deeper and more variable water tables than in bogs and fens will spread napl vertically into the large variably saturated zone thus reduce the napl saturation hence horizontal mobility of napl to summarize one can expect relatively thin napl contaminated horizons in fen peatlands but more residual napl compared to that in bogs due to the fen s relatively stable water table a deeper water table may create comparatively thick napl contaminated zone in swamps hence increase the difficulty of remediation we strongly recommend to consider water table manipulations as a first step towards spill managements in peatlands we argue that the range of induced water table fluctuation should be no more than the maximum range observed in undisturbed systems and that drainage ditches at the perimeter of the contaminated source zone should be considered to restrict wider contamination 5 conclusion hydrocarbon resource development in and around peatlands impose risks of petroleum hydrocarbon leakage on these ecologically sensitive areas despite the potential severity of the consequences on downgradient aquatic ecosystems there is a gap in our knowledge of multiphase parameter values controlling liquid hydrocarbon redistribution within peatlands this research has attempted to improve our understanding of the nature of parameter variability in peat at different states of decomposition near surface and deeper layers in bog fen and swamp peat soils we simulated two phase air water and three phase napl water air flow through the peat matrix using hydrus 1d and mrst respectively the rate of diesel outflow from peat soils directly varied with the pattern of hydraulic conductivity a close range of liquid saturations was observed for all peat soils tested we found the k rw s relations estimated for water air system can be useful for water relative permeability data for diesel imbibition for bog fen and swamp peatlands previously gharedaghloo and price 2019 suggested the same for bog peat soils we found imposing wt drawdown was a non destructive tool to reduce residual diesel saturations by up to 29 likewise wt rises that maintain the moisture regimes of the vadose zone will work effectively since this increases k rw and thus lowers the diesel saturations thus we recommend imposing wt fluctuations for spill management as an alternate method than complete excavation of contaminated peat which is a common practice in contaminated peat sites future research is needed to incorporate more samples with a greater range of decomposition botanical origins and for frozen peat in the vadose zone from different landscapes it is imperative that larger peatland scale experiments be conducted to incorporate the inherent variability of hydraulic properties and hydrological behavior that drives water and napl

1213,the movement of nitrate to surface water bodies during snow accumulation and melting has been extensively studied but there are only limited studies on the influence of snow processes on nitrate leaching to groundwater the present study investigated the impact of snow processes on nitrate leaching to groundwater based on a simulation modeling approach using hydrus 1d hydrus 1d model has a temperature threshold based snow model in addition to water solute and heat simulation components the snow component in hydrus 1d was previously not applied to snow simulation studies since the method does not consider a detailed physical and process based representation of snow accumulation and melting in the present study hydrus 1d was used to simulate snow accumulation and melting over 30 years for a location in waverly lancaster county nebraska usa from the simulations it was observed that the calibrated temperature threshold based snow module in hydrus 1d is effective in simulating snow accumulation and melting as shown by the index of agreement and root mean squared error of 0 74 and 2 70 cm for calibration 15 years and 0 88 and 2 70 cm for validation 15 years respectively the impact of snow melt on nitrate leaching was studied based on a study area with corn cultivation waverly nebraska usa a long term 60 years analysis was carried out for irrigated and non irrigated agriculture with and without precipitation as snow a higher nitrate leaching to groundwater was observed in the order of irrigated with snow 54 038 kg ha irrigated without snow 53 516 kg ha non irrigated with snow 7 431 kg ha and non irrigated without snow 7 090 kg ha this displays a 0 98 and 4 81 increase in nitrate leaching due to snow in irrigated and non irrigated conditions respectively when extrapolated over the corn cultivated regions in nebraska this resulted in a difference of 1 2e 09 kg and 6 1e 08 kg of nitrate when considering snow in irrigated and non irrigated areas over 60 years this is the first study that has analyzed the long term impact of snow on nitrate transport to groundwater based on a simulation modeling approach the results show that snow accumulation and melting plays a vital role in the nitrate leaching into the groundwater and indicates the importance of considering snow components in similar studies keywords nitrate snowmelt groundwater

a model that can comprehensively simulate snow accumulation melting infiltration unsaturated saturated soil zone water heat and solute transport is essential for analyzing the impact of snowmelt on

accurately simulate water and solute dynamics in the unsaturated and saturated soil zones karandish and šimůnek 2019 shelia et al 2018 twarakavi et al 2008 compared hydrus 1d with other vadose zone models and observed that hydrus 1d gives an accurate characterization of vadose zone processes though the model does not simulate the freezing and thawing of the soil layers it has a simple snow

the limited physical and process based representation of snow accumulation and melting girons lopez et al 2020 and senese et al 2014 concluded that increasing the model complexities in snow modeling

straightforward approach for snowmelt simulations that requires fewer data requirements and computational demand bouamri et al 2018 stanzel et al 2008 therefore utilizing the proven vadose zone model capabilities of the hydrus 1d along with the temperature threshold based snow modeling component in it can be a potential approach for atmosphere snow soil groundwater interaction studies the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of snow accumulation and melting on residual soil nitrate leaching and transport to groundwater hydrus 1d was used as a modeling tool for carrying out this study since the temperature threshold based snow module in hydrus 1d has not been applied in snow soil groundwater interaction studies before this study is unique and it includes testing and validating the snow component of the model this was followed by an analysis of the impact of snow processes on the soil water flow dynamics and the nitrate leaching to groundwater geochemical

usa was selected for this study as extensive coring had been conducted to evaluate nitrate accumulation and transport in the vadose zone snow et al 2019 the area represents intensive agricultural land use with nitrogen fertilizer application and a site that receives snow which is a typical setting of the u s corn belt the study site is in the central part of the lower platte south natural resources district lps nrd which includes 64 7 km2 in eastern nebraska the quaternary alluvial and cretaceous dakota aquifers beneath the study site are mostly alluvial with depth to water table ranging from 3 0 m to 77 m this region has predominantly pleistocene age silt sand gravel and clay deposits within bedrock valleys druliner and mason 2001 waverly is the fastest growing community in nebraska and groundwater is the primary source of drinking water in this location druliner and mason 2001 mullison 2019 nitrate nitrogen concentration in groundwater samples in this region measured in 2020 was 5 0 mg l which is half of usepa s u s environmental protection agency maximum permissible level maize zea mays l is the primary crop grown in this region ehrman et al 2018 mullison 2019 the average yearly total snow depth in the study area from 1988 to 2018 30 years was 20 32 cm the maximum snow accumulation occurred in 2010 with 45 72 cm of snow and the minimum was in 2017 with only 5 08 cm of snow the minimum maximum and average temperatures recorded during this period were 26 5 c 37 3 c and 11 0 c respectively the average yearly precipitation in this region from 1988 to 2018 was 72 9 cm with a recorded maximum of 104 5 cm in 2015 and a minimum of 46 6 cm in 1988 high plains regional climate center climod 2022 2 2 analysis of soil hydraulic properties a 24 m deep undisturbed soil core was collected from the study area 40 53 13 2 n 96 32 7 26 w and analyzed for various soil properties at the university of nebraska water sciences laboratory the soil cores were divided into columns of 0 76 m long bulk density soil texture soil hydraulic conductivity retention parameters and percentage of sand silt and clay were analyzed for all the soil cores the van genuchten mualem s analytical model parameters for these layers were determined using the pressure plate apparatus method richards and fireman 1943 hydraulic conductivity was measured using a falling head method liu and evett 1992 based on the observed soil properties the entire soil core of 24 m was divided into 11 layers for considering the soil heterogeneity in the model simulations the soil hydraulic properties of the 11 layers are given in table 1 the primary soil types in this location are silty clay and silty clay loam 2 3 model the hydrus 1d model solves water flow in the unsaturated zone using modified one dimensional richards equation 1 θ t z k h h z k h s where θ is the volumetric water content dimensionless h is the soil water pressure head cm t is time day z is the vertical coordinate cm s is the sink term day 1 and k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h and the water content q depends on the soil water pressure head this makes richards equation a highly nonlinear equation that needs to be solved numerically hydrus 1d permits the use of five different analytical models to describe the soil hydraulic properties which are brooks and corey 1964 durner 1994 kosugi 1996 van genuchten 1980b vogel and cislerova 1988 the hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2005 simulates solute transport in variably saturated porous media using the standard advection dispersion reaction equation of the form 2 θc t ρ s t z θd c z qc z ϕ where c is the solution concentration g cm 3 s is the sorbed concentration g g 1 d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 day 1 ρ is the dry bulk density of the porous medium g cm 3 θ is the volumetric water content dimensionless q is the volumetric flux density cm day 1 which is obtained using the darcy buckingham law and ϕ is a sink source term accounting for various zero and first order or other reactions g cm 3 day 1 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 hydrus 1d simulates snow by allowing snow accumulation as a function of air temperature the model assumes that all the precipitation is converted to snow when the temperature goes below 2 c and assumes that all precipitation will remain in the form of liquid when the temperature is above 2 c jarvis 1994 a linear transition from liquid to snow is assumed between 2 and 2 c proportional to air temperature the proportionality constant is

it is reduced from the existing snow layer the simulated snow layer is in hydrus 1d is represented as snow water equivalent which is the amount of water present in the snowpack simunek et al 2005

major crop of nebraska corn is cultivated under both irrigated and rainfed non irrigated conditions throughout the u s in 2020 2 3e 06 ha irrigated 56 of total corn cultivated area and 1 82e 06 ha non irrigated 44 of total corn cultivated area corn were grown in nebraska usda nass this agriculturally intensive state is known to have the highest drinking water nitrate violation in the u s exner et al 2014 pennino et al 2017 usepa 2013 for analyzing the impact of snowmelt on nitrate transport four scenarios were formulated by considering the potential of groundwater nitrate contamination from the applied fertilizer and irrigation practices in the study area the scenarios include a case for simulation with snow allowing conversion of precipitation into snow layer and without snow not considering the conversion of precipitation into snow layer conditions this will provide a distinguishable insight into the impact of snow on water flow and nitrate transport though there are several studies on nitrate contamination from the irrigated and rainfed agricultural regions of nebraska juntakut et al 2019 wells et al 2018 there are no studies on the potential impact of snowmelt on residual soil nitrate transport to groundwater following are the four scenarios considered in this study a irrigated agriculture by allowing the conversion of precipitation into snow layer based on the temperature thresholds with irrigation with snow b irrigated agriculture by not considering the conversion of precipitation into snow layer with irrigation without snow c non irrigated agriculture by allowing the conversion of precipitation into snow layer based on the temperature thresholds without irrigation with snow d non irrigated agriculture by not considering the conversion of precipitation into snow layer without irrigation without snow the combination of these four scenarios can compare the impact of irrigation and snow melting on water and residual nitrate transport through the vadose zone identifying the potential of groundwater nitrate pollution 2 5 model simulations using hydrus 1d the model simulations were carried out for a duration of 60 years 01 01 1988 to 31 12 2048 with 22 281 days this duration was chosen for analyzing the long term impact of the snow rainfall irrigation and fertilizer application on nitrate transport to groundwater the soil core in the study area was collected and analyzed in 2018 the simulation period of 60 years starts from 30 years before 2018 and 30 years after 2018 and was based on the standard 30 year period reference for climate normals wmo 2017 for the simulations surface and atmospheric conditions precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration observed during the first 30 years 01 01 1988 12 31 2018 were repeated for the next 30 years 01 01 2019 12 31 2048 future climate predictions were not used for the simulations since the primary focus of the study was on long term impact rather than the impact of climate change on nitrate leaching hence model predictions assume weather conditions to remain similar to the past 30 years the boundary conditions used for simulating the first 30 years were repeated for the next 30 years a similar approach was adopted by beegum et al 2020 and rakowski and knowling 2018 for developing future scenarios in groundwater contamination modeling studies fig 1 shows a pictorial representation of the model setup and simulations using hydrus 1d a time variable atmospheric boundary condition was considered at the surface of the soil domain with prescribed precipitation soil evaporation transpiration and temperature the weather data from 1988 to 2018 was obtained from the high plains regional climate center climod for the nearest weather station applied nitrate was estimated based on the average observed yield from irrigated and non irrigated regions in the study area the average observed yield from the study area was 12 36 t ha and 9 26 t ha from irrigated and non irrigated land respectively and the average amount of nitrate application was 21 76 kg n ton of yield usda nass 2017 fernández et al 2009 in the model simulations 269 kg n ha and 201 7 kg n ha were applied for the irrigated and non irrigated scenarios respectively in the simulation analysis 50 of the total nitrate was applied in may the rest was applied in november and the 1 3rd of it was available in the following april mullison 2019 shapiro et al 2008 background initial nitrate concentration on 01 01 1988 was assumed to be negligible triggered irrigation was considered at the surface with 700 cm suggested levels by the university of nebraska extension as the pressure head for triggering irrigation at the rate of 1 25 cm day for two days a free drainage water flow boundary condition was considered at the bottom 24 m from the surface the nitrate flux at this boundary was assumed to be reaching groundwater as leached nitrate a concentration flux boundary condition was prescribed at the surface for the solute transport simulation and a zero concentration gradient was given as the lower boundary condition total nitrogen fertilizer applied was assumed to be in the form of nitrate nitrate transformations denitrification and immobilization of nitrate n were not considered and an equilibrium solute transport model was considered the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water was assumed as 1 64 cm2 day 1 li et al 2018 the heat flux boundary condition was used as the upper boundary condition for the heat transport simulation and a zero gradient was considered at the bottom boundary hansson et al 2004 a free drainage boundary condition was used for the bottom boundary root water uptake was simulated using the feddes model feddes et al 1978 a passive uptake uptake that does not consider plant growth dynamics or biological energy driven processes was considered šimůnek and hopmans 2009 feddes parameters were used from the database for different crops based on the studies by wesseling wesseling 1991 root growth was simulated using a root growth logistic growth function which describes the root growth during the growing season and a root distribution hoffman and van genuchten 1983 simulations assume that 50 of the maximum rooting depth 180 cm was reached at the midpoint of the growing season hydrus 1d model was first set up to simulate snow accumulation and melting since the study aimed to analyze the snow accumulation and melting impact on nitrate transport to groundwater it was essential to examine the model for its capabilities in snow predictions a period of 30 years 1988 to 2018 was used for calibration and validation of the snow simulation using hydrus 1d data were divided into two sets training set for calibration 1988 2003 and test set for validation 2004 2018 snow parameters snow melting constant smc cm days c and sublimation constant sc were manually calibrated for the training data this was followed by model simulation for the four scenarios presented in section 2 4 2 6 performance index statistical criteria used for estimating the performance of the model results with observed data were the index of agreement ia root mean squared error rmse and two sample t test these indices were calculated using the following equations 4 rmse i 1 n simulated observed 2 n 5 ia 1 0 i 1 n simulated i observed i 2 i 1 n simulated i observed i observed i observed mean 2 simulated and observed refers to the simulated and observed data at any time and n is the number of data ia reflects the degree to which the simulated variate accurately estimates the observed variate the agreement value of 1 0 indicates a perfect agreement and 0 0 indicates no agreement at all willmott 1981 lower rmse values indicate the closeness of observed values with the simulated values based on the two sample t test differences between the two data sets are considered significant if p values are 0 05 cressie and whitford 1986 3 results 3 1 snow simulation using hydrus 1d the observed and simulated snow from 1988 to 2003 are shown in fig 2a the calibration period s ia and rmse between the simulated and observed snow depth was 0 74 and 2 79 cm the value of the calibrated parameters was 0 60 cm days c for the smc and 0 40 for the sc respectively since the smc determines the amount of snow that will melt per degree change in the temperature increasing smc value lowered the snow depth and vice versa during the model calibration it was also observed that varying the smc significantly influenced the melting phase as per the snow modeling concept in the model the sc parameter in the model was to reduce the potential evaporation the model was validated for snow depth from 2004 to 2018 with the test data the ia and rmse were 0 88 and 2 70 cm during the validation respectively table 2 the observed and simulated snow from 2004 to 2018 is shown in fig 2b the mean absolute percentage error between the observed and simulated snow depth from 1988 to 2018 was 8 6 a critical analysis of the surface flux snow accumulation surface temperature and precipitation was carried out from 2007 to 2011 fig 3a b c and d this duration was chosen to include the year with observed maximum snow depth since 1988 and average snow depth in the other years the simulated snow depth captured the snow occurrence in all the years it was comparable to the measured snow depth generally observed from november to march every year fassnacht and hultstrand 2015 petr 2019 fig 3a it was during these months that the temperature generally went below freezing fig 3c a higher snow depth was observed from november 2009 to march 2010 due to the combined effect of higher precipitation and lower temperature during this period compared to other years fig 3b shows the precipitation and simulated snow depth the average rainfall from november to march 1988 to 2018 was 0 0682 cm day whereas the average rainfall from november 2009 to march 2010 was 0 095 cm day fig 3c shows the variation in the snow accumulation based on the temperature the lowest temperatures observed from november 2009 to march 2010 were 15 5 c 04 01 2010 followed by 13 c 09 01 2010 these temperatures were the lowest among the years shown in fig 3c the simulations also model the decrease in the accumulated snow and the corresponding increase in the surface flux as a function of temperature fig 3d shows the surface flux and accumulated snow depth negative and positive surface flux represents the flow downward infiltration and upward evaporation respectively the negative and positive flux from march to october of every year was generally a result of precipitation and evaporation the positive flux from november to march of every year was contributed by the snow melting component in addition to the rainfall infiltration a sudden increase in the downward flux was observed whenever there was a melting of the accumulative snow insight of fig 2d shows the increase in the downward flux from december 2009 to february 2010 as the snow layer decreases a detailed explanation of the correlation between temperature snow melting and surface flux is presented in section 3 2 3 2 scenario analysis once the model was calibrated and validated for the snow depth simulations were carried out for all four scenarios section 2 4 for the years 1988 to 2048 the water flow and solute mass balance error during the simulations for all the scenarios were 1 from the model simulations cumulative water fluxes for the irrigated conditions were higher than the non irrigated condition percentage increases in cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake in the irrigated condition compared to non irrigated condition with snow were 32 22 37 99 and 28 82 respectively percentage increases in cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake in the irrigated condition compared to non irrigated without snow were 31 92 36 96 and 28 82 respectively for irrigated and non irrigated conditions the cumulative fluxes surface flux root water uptake and bottom flux were higher when considering snow accumulation compared to without snow simulations but with a percentage increase of 1 0 when considering snow accumulation the runoff was lower in both irrigated and non irrigated conditions by 0 9 when compared to without snow simulations this resulted in an increase in the cumulative surface flux when snow was considered without snow simulations rainfall or irrigation higher than the soil s infiltration capacity is removed from the surface as runoff in simulations with snow the precipitation or irrigation is accumulated as snow based on the temperature threshold and infiltration or runoff from the accumulated snow layer will occur by melting for the irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake was 0 24 0 75 and 0 02 when considering snow compared to without snow in the simulation for the non irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake was 0 005 0 001 and 0 02 when considering snow compared to without snow in the simulation the increase in the fluxes with snow compared to without snow was higher for the irrigated condition compared to non irrigated condition and model results are consistent with the expected snow component influences on water flux fig 4a and b show the simulated snow depth and the water content at 20 cm from the surface for the irrigated and non irrigated conditions from 15 11 2009 to 04 05 2010 this duration was selected to closely examine the variations in the fluxes due to the snow component fig 4c and d show the surface flux and the surface temperature during this period for irrigated and non irrigated conditions for the case of with irrigation snow started accumulating on 04 12 2009 and continued till january 22 2010 a below zero degrees temperature was observed during this period fig 4c there was another snow layer from 01 02 2010 to 06 02 2010 for the irrigated condition surface flux was reduced whenever there was a snow accumulation fig 4c due to the conversion of precipitation into snow because of the reduction in the infiltration the water content at a depth of 20 cm from the surface was also reduced the precipitation was not converted to snow for the case without snow but resulted in surface flux this surface flux has led to an increase in the water content in the soil compared to the case with snow from 04 12 2009 till 18 12 2009 the water content remained constant 0 321 for the case with snow whereas in the case without snow it increased from 0 321 to 0 323 fig 4a the increase in the surface flux in the case without snow from zero to 1 21 cm day was observed from 04 12 2009 to 06 12 2009 fig 4c for the case with snow no surface flux was observed due to the snow formation during this period on 18 01 2010 when the snow depth started decreasing due to snow melting when temperature increased the surface flux started increasing due to the infiltration of the melted snow this has resulted in an increase in the water content from 0 321 to 0 323 for the case with snow from 18 01 2010 to 22 01 2010 fig 4a a similar trend was observed in the case without irrigation fig 4b and d the difference between irrigated and non irrigated conditions was mainly in the difference in surface flux and water content during the irrigated period from 09 04 2010 till 26 04 2010 the water content and surface flux were more in the case of irrigated conditions fig 4a and c compared to non irrigated conditions fig 4b and d due to the triggered irrigation during this period the influence of the variations in the water fluxes on the nitrate transport which is the main focus of this study was analyzed based on the solute transport simulations cumulative solute fluxes from the solute transport simulations are shown in fig 5 for both irrigated and non irrigated cases the cumulative surface solute flux cumulative bottom solute flux cumulative root solute uptake and bottom solute concentrations were higher with snow compared to without snow fig 5a to d for the irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface solute flux cumulative bottom solute flux cumulative root water uptake and bottom solute concentration was 6 96 0 98 5 37 and 5 30 when considering snow compared to without snow for the non irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface solute flux cumulative bottom solute flux cumulative root water uptake and bottom solute concentration was 0 95 4 8 1 07 and 3 78 when considering snow compared to without snow in the simulation fig 5b1 and b2 show the difference in the bottom solute flux at the end of the simulation the increase in the cumulative bottom solute flux in the case of snow shows that the snow component increases the residual soil nitrate leaching loss and transport to groundwater 4 discussion testing the hydrus 1d snow module for the effect of snow accumulation and melt infiltration prediction is important since the module had not been previously used for nitrate transport under atmosphere snow soil interaction studies though hydrus 1d has a simple temperature threshold based model for snow accumulation and meltwater infiltration simulations the model was able to simulate the snow processes well as shown by the ia and rmse of the observed and simulated snow depths in table 2 similar inferences were made in studies that used the temperature threshold models or compared temperature threshold based models with process level models lehning et al 2006 rajagopal and harpold 2016 rango and martinec 1995 valéry et al 2014 these studies claim that carefully calibrated temperature threshold models would be sufficient to simulate the snow processes over the years there have been several improvements in the mathematical representation of the snow processes improvements include incorporating more detailed processes that impact the snow e g land and atmospheric heat fluxes freezing and thawing flow fingers wind vegetation radiation dynamics in the snow density and snow insulation air humidity or air mass boundary passages etc feiccabrino et al 2012 feng et al 2008 marsh and woo 1984 stieglitz et al 2001 the temperature threshold based model in hydrus 1d does not consider the detailed processes mentioned above hydrus 1d primarily facilitates variations in soil water flow based on infiltration holding delay during snow accumulation and increase in the infiltration during rapid snow melting processes this concept holds valid when there is sufficient snow cover on the soil surface that insulates the soil from cold air and freezing iwata et al 2010 the effect of variations in the water flux and soil moisture during snow was well simulated and correlated with precipitation and temperature as shown in fig 4 from the scenario analysis the water fluxes cumulative surface flux and cumulative bottom flux were observed to be higher when considering snow in the simulations percentage increase is discussed in section 3 2 from the model simulations the higher cumulative surface flux was primarily due to the reduced runoff and higher surface flux during the melting phase in the soil as the snow starts accumulating at the soil surface the moisture content in the soil beneath the snow layer decreases due to the drainage of water to the lower layers reduction in the moisture content increases the pressure head gradient in the surface soil an increase in the surface flux was observed as the snow started melting it was also observed that the surface flux during melting was proportional to the duration and depth of the snow accumulated in addition to the soil moisture status similar variations in the soil moisture and soil water flux were observed in field scale studies by gustafson et al 2010 and yan et al 2021 in these studies a reduction in the soil moisture at the surface soil layers was observed during the snow accumulation period and a sudden increase in the soil moisture content during the snow melting there are only a limited number of studies on the long term field scale soil water dynamics in the surface soil layers during snow because of the logistic and technical difficulties in measuring complex interactions at the soil snow interface iwata et al 2010 the variations in the cumulative bottom flux explain the importance of snowmelt on nitrate transport to groundwater mainly due to increased infiltration the scenario analysis observed that the cumulative bottom solute flux with snow was higher than without snow for irrigated and non irrigated conditions when the snow was not considered in the simulations the cumulative bottom solute flux was 53 516 kg ha and 7 090 kg ha for cases of with and without irritation when considering snow in the simulation the cumulative bottom solute flux to groundwater was 54 038 kg ha and 7 431 kg ha for cases with and without irrigation respectively fig 5 this shows that simulating snow increased the nitrate transport to groundwater by 4 8 and 0 98 in the non irrigated and irrigated conditions respectively the percentage increase was higher in non irrigated conditions because of the higher nitrate concentration in the soil due to lower root solute uptake in case of non irrigated conditions average cumulative root nitrate uptake for irrigated condition was 1 7e 6 kg ha and non irrigated condition was 1 3e 6 kg ha from the two sample t test analyses the bottom solute flux with and without snow was observed to be significantly different with p values 0 05 p value of 0 01 and 1 4e 21 for irrigated and non irrigated conditions from the simulation results nitrate concentration in the groundwater was first observed in 2012 in the irrigated condition and in 2019 in the non irrigated condition this was based on the assumption that the groundwater was solute free at the start of simulation the yearly average increase in the nitrate concentration starting from the year of the first observance of nitrate in the groundwater was 1 501 and 1 486 kg ha year for the irrigated condition with and without snow respectively for the non irrigated condition the rate of increase of nitrate was 256 and 244 kg ha year for with and without snow respectively undisturbed soil cores from the agricultural regions spanning 14 7 km2 in the study area were collected in november 2018 and analyzed for nitrate concentration over the depth of the core snow et al 2019 to evaluate the model for the solute transport simulations model simulated nitrate concentration for with irrigation and with snow scenario was compared with the average of the measured nitrate concentrations fig 6 the simulated and measured nitrate concentration in the soil profile was found to be comparable with ia and rmse of 0 91 and 1 52 mg l respectively since the study primarily deals with long term simulations for analyzing the influence of snow on nitrate leaching long term nitrate leaching data from with and without snow conditions would be necessary for performing a scenario with and without snow based analysis of the measured and simulated nitrate concentration such detailed measured data is not available for the study area in addition the model also follows a set of assumptions on amount and timing of fertilizer application cropping history residual nitrate concentration nitrogen transformations etc therefore well formulated controlled with and without snow experiments with extensive data collection are essential for detailed model evaluation and for substantiating the findings of the current study the simulated percentage increase in nitrate leaching when snow is considered in this study is specific to the features of the soil core soil type weather depth of the water table etc surface and bottom boundary conditions amount of rainfall irrigation temperature free drainage etc the percentage increase in nitrate leaching with snow can vary with these factors for example for the same soil profile when the soil was assumed to be loamy soil the percentage increase in the nitrate leaching to groundwater when considering snow was 24 4 and 27 8 for irrigated and non irrigated conditions respectively the variation in the percentage increase in nitrate leaching with varying soil hydraulic properties and boundary conditions is not analyzed in detail in the present study and can be considered for future research the results from the current study were extrapolated to a larger agricultural region to know the impact over a regional scale according to usda nass 2020 state agriculture overview for nebraska the total corn cultivated in nebraska was 4 1e 06 ha total irrigated area 56 and non irrigated 44 were estimated as 2 3e 06 ha and 1 8e 06 ha respectively usda nass when the cumulative nitrate leaching to groundwater was scaled to the corn cultivated area in 2020 for nebraska this resulted in a difference of 1 2e 09 kg of nitrate and 6 1e 08 kg of nitrate into the groundwater over 60 years in irrigated and non irrigated conditions table 3 based on the year of the first occurrence of nitrate as 2012 for the irrigated condition the difference in the nitrate leaching to groundwater was 3 4e 07 kg year when considering snow compared to without snow simulations similarly considering 2019 as the year of the first occurrence of nitrate in the groundwater in non irrigated conditions the average yearly difference in the nitrate leaching was observed to be 2 1e 07 kg year when considering snow compared to without snow this shows the scale of increase in the nitrate leaching to groundwater due to the influence of snow which is generally neglected in groundwater contamination related studies similar observations were made from field experiments on snow impact on nitrate transport department of environmental quality idaho 2011 reported that the recent years of increased snowpack and recharge had increased the annual peak of nitrate levels in groundwater department of environmental quality idaho 2011 based on field experiment studies iwata et al 2010 iwata et al 2013 and 2018 observed that soil water movement during the snow melting period is a dominant factor controlling nitrate movement in areas with relatively large snow accumulation with thin frozen soil layers our study confirms that considering snowmelt must be part of investigation studies on nitrate leaching to groundwater 5 conclusion in most groundwater contamination related modeling studies the snow component is generally neglected this is either due to the limitation of the unsaturated saturated soil zone model of not having a snow simulation component or due to the data intensive and complex snow modeling routines the current study presents two major conclusions first our study shows that temperature threshold based snow estimation is a simple method but is effective in predicting the snow accumulation and melting process it indicates that a modeler can resort to well calibrated simple temperature threshold based snow models for snow simulations unless the purpose is to investigate the individual snow related processes second our study concludes that the snowmelt impacts the soil water dynamics and increases the solute fluxes into the groundwater this is the first study that has analyzed the potential long term impact of snow accumulation melting and infiltration on soil nitrate transport to groundwater based on a simulation modeling approach our paper highlights the importance of considering snow dynamics

1213,the movement of nitrate to surface water bodies during snow accumulation and melting has been extensively studied but there are only limited studies on the influence of snow processes on nitrate leaching to groundwater the present study investigated the impact of snow processes on nitrate leaching to groundwater based on a simulation modeling approach using hydrus 1d hydrus 1d model has a temperature threshold based snow model in addition to water solute and heat simulation components the snow component in hydrus 1d was previously not applied to snow simulation studies since the method does not consider a detailed physical and process based representation of snow accumulation and melting in the present study hydrus 1d was used to simulate snow accumulation and melting over 30 years for a location in waverly lancaster county nebraska usa from the simulations it was observed that the calibrated temperature threshold based snow module in hydrus 1d is effective in simulating snow accumulation and melting as shown by the index of agreement and root mean squared error of 0 74 and 2 70 cm for calibration 15 years and 0 88 and 2 70 cm for validation 15 years respectively the impact of snow melt on nitrate leaching was studied based on a study area with corn cultivation waverly nebraska usa a long term 60 years analysis was carried out for irrigated and non irrigated agriculture with and without precipitation as snow a higher nitrate leaching to groundwater was observed in the order of irrigated with snow 54 038 kg ha irrigated without snow 53 516 kg ha non irrigated with snow 7 431 kg ha and non irrigated without snow 7 090 kg ha this displays a 0 98 and 4 81 increase in nitrate leaching due to snow in irrigated and non irrigated conditions respectively when extrapolated over the corn cultivated regions in nebraska this resulted in a difference of 1 2e 09 kg and 6 1e 08 kg of nitrate when considering snow in irrigated and non irrigated areas over 60 years this is the first study that has analyzed the long term impact of snow on nitrate transport to groundwater based on a simulation modeling approach the results show that snow accumulation and melting plays a vital role in the nitrate leaching into the groundwater and indicates the importance of considering snow components in similar studies keywords nitrate snowmelt groundwater

hydrological event that will affect the leaching of nitrate to groundwater costa et al 2017 snow itself may contain minor sources of nitrate generally less than one mg l in precipitation but meltwater infiltration can result in leaching loss of residual soil nitrate likens et al 2021 usgs 1999 after harvest residual soil nitrate can still be high in the agricultural regions weitzman et al 2022 hong

during snow melting jiang and rode 2012 shrestha et al 2012 han et al 2010 in contrast there are only a few studies on the impact of snowmelt on nitrate transport to groundwater von waldow et al 2002 a model that can comprehensively simulate snow accumulation melting infiltration unsaturated saturated soil zone water heat and solute transport is essential for analyzing the impact of snowmelt on

unsaturated saturated soil and water flow simulation models hydrus 1d is a widely applied software package for simulating the one dimensional movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably

accurately simulate water and solute dynamics in the unsaturated and saturated soil zones karandish and šimůnek 2019 shelia et al 2018 twarakavi et al 2008 compared hydrus 1d with other vadose zone models and observed that hydrus 1d gives an accurate characterization of vadose zone processes though the model does not simulate the freezing and thawing of the soil layers it has a simple snow accumulation and melting routine based on the temperature threshold concept jarvis 1994 simunek et al 2005 this snow component in the model has not been widely applied in snow related studies claiming the limited physical and process based representation of snow accumulation and melting girons lopez et al 2020 and senese et al 2014 concluded that increasing the model complexities in snow modeling does not necessarily improve the model performances complex models e g energy balance model require detailed data that may not be available from conventional meteorological stations hourly temperature wind speed and direction relative humidity snow density solar radiation cloud cover fraction etc it is difficult to use these models for simulating snow processes over large geographical areas morin et al 2020 complex process based models would be necessary only for specific model applications requiring realistic details girons lopez et al 2020 threshold based snow model favors a reliable and straightforward approach for snowmelt simulations that requires fewer data requirements and computational demand bouamri et al 2018 stanzel et al 2008 therefore utilizing the proven vadose zone model capabilities of the hydrus 1d along with the temperature threshold based snow modeling component in it can be a potential approach for atmosphere snow soil groundwater interaction studies the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of snow accumulation and melting on residual soil nitrate leaching and transport to groundwater hydrus 1d was used as a modeling tool for carrying out this study since the temperature threshold based snow module in hydrus 1d has not been applied in snow soil groundwater interaction studies before this study is unique and it includes testing and validating the snow component of the model this was followed by an analysis of the impact of snow processes on the soil water flow dynamics and the nitrate leaching to groundwater geochemical processes were not considered in this study analysis and validation of the model simulations required identifying a study area data collection observed snow rainfall temperature soil hydraulic

major crop of nebraska corn is cultivated under both irrigated and rainfed non irrigated conditions throughout the u s in 2020 2 3e 06 ha irrigated 56 of total corn cultivated area and 1 82e 06 ha non irrigated 44 of total corn cultivated area corn were grown in nebraska usda nass this agriculturally intensive state is known to have the highest drinking water nitrate violation in the u s exner et al 2014 pennino et al 2017 usepa 2013 for analyzing the impact of snowmelt on nitrate transport four scenarios were formulated by considering the potential of groundwater nitrate contamination from the applied fertilizer and irrigation practices in the study area the scenarios include a case for simulation with snow allowing conversion of precipitation into snow layer and without snow not considering the conversion of precipitation into snow layer conditions this will provide a distinguishable insight into the impact of snow on water flow and nitrate transport though there are several studies on nitrate contamination from the irrigated and rainfed agricultural regions of nebraska juntakut et al 2019 wells et al 2018 there are no studies on the potential impact of snowmelt on residual soil nitrate transport to groundwater following are the four scenarios considered in this study a irrigated agriculture by allowing the conversion of precipitation into snow layer based on the temperature thresholds with irrigation with snow b irrigated agriculture by not considering the conversion of precipitation into snow layer with irrigation without snow c non irrigated agriculture by allowing the conversion of precipitation into snow layer based on the temperature thresholds without irrigation with snow d non irrigated agriculture by not considering the conversion of precipitation into snow layer without irrigation without snow the combination of these four scenarios can compare the impact of irrigation and snow melting on water and residual nitrate transport through the vadose zone identifying the potential of groundwater nitrate pollution 2 5 model simulations using hydrus 1d the model simulations were carried out for a duration of 60 years 01 01 1988 to 31 12 2048 with 22 281 days this duration was chosen for analyzing the long term impact of the snow rainfall irrigation and fertilizer application on nitrate transport to groundwater the soil core in the study area was collected and analyzed in 2018 the simulation period of 60 years starts from 30 years before 2018 and 30 years after 2018 and was based on the standard 30 year period reference for climate normals wmo 2017 for the simulations surface and atmospheric conditions precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration observed during the first 30 years 01 01 1988 12 31 2018 were repeated for the next 30 years 01 01 2019 12 31 2048 future climate predictions were not used for the simulations since the primary focus of the study was on long term impact rather than the impact of climate change on nitrate leaching hence model predictions assume weather conditions to remain similar to the past 30 years the boundary conditions used for simulating the first 30 years were repeated for the next 30 years a similar approach was adopted by beegum et al 2020 and rakowski and knowling 2018 for developing future scenarios in groundwater contamination modeling studies fig 1 shows a pictorial representation of the model setup and simulations using hydrus 1d a time variable atmospheric boundary condition was considered at the surface of the soil domain with prescribed precipitation soil evaporation transpiration and temperature the weather data from 1988 to 2018 was obtained from the high plains regional climate center climod for the nearest weather station applied nitrate was estimated based on the average observed yield from irrigated and non irrigated regions in the study area the average observed yield from the study area was 12 36 t ha and 9 26 t ha from irrigated and non irrigated land respectively and the average amount of nitrate application was 21 76 kg n ton of yield usda nass 2017 fernández et al 2009 in the model simulations 269 kg n ha and 201 7 kg n ha were applied for the irrigated and non irrigated scenarios respectively in the simulation analysis 50 of the total nitrate was applied in may the rest was applied in november and the 1 3rd of it was available in the following april mullison 2019 shapiro et al 2008 background initial nitrate concentration on 01 01 1988 was assumed to be negligible triggered irrigation was considered at the surface with 700 cm suggested levels by the university of nebraska extension as the pressure head for triggering irrigation at the rate of 1 25 cm day for two days a free drainage water flow boundary condition was considered at the bottom 24 m from the surface the nitrate flux at this boundary was assumed to be reaching groundwater as leached nitrate a concentration flux boundary condition was prescribed at the surface for the solute transport simulation and a zero concentration gradient was given as the lower boundary condition total nitrogen fertilizer applied was assumed to be in the form of nitrate nitrate transformations denitrification and immobilization of nitrate n were not considered and an equilibrium solute transport model was considered the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water was assumed as 1 64 cm2 day 1 li et al 2018 the heat flux boundary condition was used as the upper boundary condition for the heat transport simulation and a zero gradient was considered at the bottom boundary hansson et al 2004 a free drainage boundary condition was used for the bottom boundary root water uptake was simulated using the feddes model feddes et al 1978 a passive uptake uptake that does not consider plant growth dynamics or biological energy driven processes was considered šimůnek and hopmans 2009 feddes parameters were used from the database for different crops based on the studies by wesseling wesseling 1991 root growth was simulated using a root growth logistic growth function which describes the root growth during the growing season and a root distribution hoffman and van genuchten 1983 simulations assume that 50 of the maximum rooting depth 180 cm was reached at the midpoint of the growing season hydrus 1d model was first set up to simulate snow accumulation and melting since the study aimed to analyze the snow accumulation and melting impact on nitrate transport to groundwater it was essential to examine the model for its capabilities in snow predictions a period of 30 years 1988 to 2018 was used for calibration and validation of the snow simulation using hydrus 1d data were divided into two sets training set for calibration 1988 2003 and test set for validation 2004 2018 snow parameters snow melting constant smc cm days c and sublimation constant sc were manually calibrated for the training data this was followed by model simulation for the four scenarios presented in section 2 4 2 6 performance index statistical criteria used for estimating the performance of the model results with observed data were the index of agreement ia root mean squared error rmse and two sample t test these indices were calculated using the following equations 4 rmse i 1 n simulated observed 2 n 5 ia 1 0 i 1 n simulated i observed i 2 i 1 n simulated i observed i observed i observed mean 2 simulated and observed refers to the simulated and observed data at any time and n is the number of data ia reflects the degree to which the simulated variate accurately estimates the observed variate the agreement value of 1 0 indicates a perfect agreement and 0 0 indicates no agreement at all willmott 1981 lower rmse values indicate the closeness of observed values with the simulated values based on the two sample t test differences between the two data sets are considered significant if p values are 0 05 cressie and whitford 1986 3 results 3 1 snow simulation using hydrus 1d the observed and simulated snow from 1988 to 2003 are shown in fig 2a the calibration period s ia and rmse between the simulated and observed snow depth was 0 74 and 2 79 cm the value of the calibrated parameters was 0 60 cm days c for the smc and 0 40 for the sc respectively since the smc determines the amount of snow that will melt per degree change in the temperature increasing smc value lowered the snow depth and vice versa during the model calibration it was also observed that varying the smc significantly influenced the melting phase as per the snow modeling concept in the model the sc parameter in the model was to reduce the potential evaporation the model was validated for snow depth from 2004 to 2018 with the test data the ia and rmse were 0 88 and 2 70 cm during the validation respectively table 2 the observed and simulated snow from 2004 to 2018 is shown in fig 2b the mean absolute percentage error between the observed and simulated snow depth from 1988 to 2018 was 8 6 a critical analysis of the surface flux snow accumulation surface temperature and precipitation was carried out from 2007 to 2011 fig 3a b c and d this duration was chosen to include the year with observed maximum snow depth since 1988 and average snow depth in the other years the simulated snow depth captured the snow occurrence in all the years it was comparable to the measured snow depth generally observed from november to march every year fassnacht and hultstrand 2015 petr 2019 fig 3a it was during these months that the temperature generally went below freezing fig 3c a higher snow depth was observed from november 2009 to march 2010 due to the combined effect of higher precipitation and lower temperature during this period compared to other years fig 3b shows the precipitation and simulated snow depth the average rainfall from november to march 1988 to 2018 was 0 0682 cm day whereas the average rainfall from november 2009 to march 2010 was 0 095 cm day fig 3c shows the variation in the snow accumulation based on the temperature the lowest temperatures observed from november 2009 to march 2010 were 15 5 c 04 01 2010 followed by 13 c 09 01 2010 these temperatures were the lowest among the years shown in fig 3c the simulations also model the decrease in the accumulated snow and the corresponding increase in the surface flux as a function of temperature fig 3d shows the surface flux and accumulated snow depth negative and positive surface flux represents the flow downward infiltration and upward evaporation respectively the negative and positive flux from march to october of every year was generally a result of precipitation and evaporation the positive flux from november to march of every year was contributed by the snow melting component in addition to the rainfall infiltration a sudden increase in the downward flux was observed whenever there was a melting of the accumulative snow insight of fig 2d shows the increase in the downward flux from december 2009 to february 2010 as the snow layer decreases a detailed explanation of the correlation between temperature snow melting and surface flux is presented in section 3 2 3 2 scenario analysis once the model was calibrated and validated for the snow depth simulations were carried out for all four scenarios section 2 4 for the years 1988 to 2048 the water flow and solute mass balance error during the simulations for all the scenarios were 1 from the model simulations cumulative water fluxes for the irrigated conditions were higher than the non irrigated condition percentage increases in cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake in the irrigated condition compared to non irrigated condition with snow were 32 22 37 99 and 28 82 respectively percentage increases in cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake in the irrigated condition compared to non irrigated without snow were 31 92 36 96 and 28 82 respectively for irrigated and non irrigated conditions the cumulative fluxes surface flux root water uptake and bottom flux were higher when considering snow accumulation compared to without snow simulations but with a percentage increase of 1 0 when considering snow accumulation the runoff was lower in both irrigated and non irrigated conditions by 0 9 when compared to without snow simulations this resulted in an increase in the cumulative surface flux when snow was considered without snow simulations rainfall or irrigation higher than the soil s infiltration capacity is removed from the surface as runoff in simulations with snow the precipitation or irrigation is accumulated as snow based on the temperature threshold and infiltration or runoff from the accumulated snow layer will occur by melting for the irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake was 0 24 0 75 and 0 02 when considering snow compared to without snow in the simulation for the non irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface flux bottom flux and root water uptake was 0 005 0 001 and 0 02 when considering snow compared to without snow in the simulation the increase in the fluxes with snow compared to without snow was higher for the irrigated condition compared to non irrigated condition and model results are consistent with the expected snow component influences on water flux fig 4a and b show the simulated snow depth and the water content at 20 cm from the surface for the irrigated and non irrigated conditions from 15 11 2009 to 04 05 2010 this duration was selected to closely examine the variations in the fluxes due to the snow component fig 4c and d show the surface flux and the surface temperature during this period for irrigated and non irrigated conditions for the case of with irrigation snow started accumulating on 04 12 2009 and continued till january 22 2010 a below zero degrees temperature was observed during this period fig 4c there was another snow layer from 01 02 2010 to 06 02 2010 for the irrigated condition surface flux was reduced whenever there was a snow accumulation fig 4c due to the conversion of precipitation into snow because of the reduction in the infiltration the water content at a depth of 20 cm from the surface was also reduced the precipitation was not converted to snow for the case without snow but resulted in surface flux this surface flux has led to an increase in the water content in the soil compared to the case with snow from 04 12 2009 till 18 12 2009 the water content remained constant 0 321 for the case with snow whereas in the case without snow it increased from 0 321 to 0 323 fig 4a the increase in the surface flux in the case without snow from zero to 1 21 cm day was observed from 04 12 2009 to 06 12 2009 fig 4c for the case with snow no surface flux was observed due to the snow formation during this period on 18 01 2010 when the snow depth started decreasing due to snow melting when temperature increased the surface flux started increasing due to the infiltration of the melted snow this has resulted in an increase in the water content from 0 321 to 0 323 for the case with snow from 18 01 2010 to 22 01 2010 fig 4a a similar trend was observed in the case without irrigation fig 4b and d the difference between irrigated and non irrigated conditions was mainly in the difference in surface flux and water content during the irrigated period from 09 04 2010 till 26 04 2010 the water content and surface flux were more in the case of irrigated conditions fig 4a and c compared to non irrigated conditions fig 4b and d due to the triggered irrigation during this period the influence of the variations in the water fluxes on the nitrate transport which is the main focus of this study was analyzed based on the solute transport simulations cumulative solute fluxes from the solute transport simulations are shown in fig 5 for both irrigated and non irrigated cases the cumulative surface solute flux cumulative bottom solute flux cumulative root solute uptake and bottom solute concentrations were higher with snow compared to without snow fig 5a to d for the irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface solute flux cumulative bottom solute flux cumulative root water uptake and bottom solute concentration was 6 96 0 98 5 37 and 5 30 when considering snow compared to without snow for the non irrigated condition the percentage increase in the cumulative surface solute flux cumulative bottom solute flux cumulative root water uptake and bottom solute concentration was 0 95 4 8 1 07 and 3 78 when considering snow compared to without snow in the simulation fig 5b1 and b2 show the difference in the bottom solute flux at the end of the simulation the increase in the cumulative bottom solute flux in the case of snow shows that the snow component increases the residual soil nitrate leaching loss and transport to groundwater 4 discussion testing the hydrus 1d snow module for the effect of snow accumulation and melt infiltration prediction is important since the module had not been previously used for nitrate transport under atmosphere snow soil interaction studies though hydrus 1d has a simple temperature threshold based model for snow accumulation and meltwater infiltration simulations the model was able to simulate the snow processes well as shown by the ia and rmse of the observed and simulated snow depths in table 2 similar inferences were made in studies that used the temperature threshold models or compared temperature threshold based models with process level models lehning et al 2006 rajagopal and harpold 2016 rango and martinec 1995 valéry et al 2014 these studies claim that carefully calibrated temperature threshold models would be sufficient to simulate the snow processes over the years there have been several improvements in the mathematical representation of the snow processes improvements include incorporating more detailed processes that impact the snow e g land and atmospheric heat fluxes freezing and thawing flow fingers wind vegetation radiation dynamics in the snow density and snow insulation air humidity or air mass boundary passages etc feiccabrino et al 2012 feng et al 2008 marsh and woo 1984 stieglitz et al 2001 the temperature threshold based model in hydrus 1d does not consider the detailed processes mentioned above hydrus 1d primarily facilitates variations in soil water flow based on infiltration holding delay during snow accumulation and increase in the infiltration during rapid snow melting processes this concept holds valid when there is sufficient snow cover on the soil surface that insulates the soil from cold air and freezing iwata et al 2010 the effect of variations in the water flux and soil moisture during snow was well simulated and correlated with precipitation and temperature as shown in fig 4 from the scenario analysis the water fluxes cumulative surface flux and cumulative bottom flux were observed to be higher when considering snow in the simulations percentage increase is discussed in section 3 2 from the model simulations the higher cumulative surface flux was primarily due to the reduced runoff and higher surface flux during the melting phase in the soil as the snow starts accumulating at the soil surface the moisture content in the soil beneath the snow layer decreases due to the drainage of water to the lower layers reduction in the moisture content increases the pressure head gradient in the surface soil an increase in the surface flux was observed as the snow started melting it was also observed that the surface flux during melting was proportional to the duration and depth of the snow accumulated in addition to the soil moisture status similar variations in the soil moisture and soil water flux were observed in field scale studies by gustafson et al 2010 and yan et al 2021 in these studies a reduction in the soil moisture at the surface soil layers was observed during the snow accumulation period and a sudden increase in the soil moisture content during the snow melting there are only a limited number of studies on the long term field scale soil water dynamics in the surface soil layers during snow because of the logistic and technical difficulties in measuring complex interactions at the soil snow interface iwata et al 2010 the variations in the cumulative bottom flux explain the importance of snowmelt on nitrate transport to groundwater mainly due to increased infiltration the scenario analysis observed that the cumulative bottom solute flux with snow was higher than without snow for irrigated and non irrigated conditions when the snow was not considered in the simulations the cumulative bottom solute flux was 53 516 kg ha and 7 090 kg ha for cases of with and without irritation when considering snow in the simulation the cumulative bottom solute flux to groundwater was 54 038 kg ha and 7 431 kg ha for cases with and without irrigation respectively fig 5 this shows that simulating snow increased the nitrate transport to groundwater by 4 8 and 0 98 in the non irrigated and irrigated conditions respectively the percentage increase was higher in non irrigated conditions because of the higher nitrate concentration in the soil due to lower root solute uptake in case of non irrigated conditions average cumulative root nitrate uptake for irrigated condition was 1 7e 6 kg ha and non irrigated condition was 1 3e 6 kg ha from the two sample t test analyses the bottom solute flux with and without snow was observed to be significantly different with p values 0 05 p value of 0 01 and 1 4e 21 for irrigated and non irrigated conditions from the simulation results nitrate concentration in the groundwater was first observed in 2012 in the irrigated condition and in 2019 in the non irrigated condition this was based on the assumption that the groundwater was solute free at the start of simulation the yearly average increase in the nitrate concentration starting from the year of the first observance of nitrate in the groundwater was 1 501 and 1 486 kg ha year for the irrigated condition with and without snow respectively for the non irrigated condition the rate of increase of nitrate was 256 and 244 kg ha year for with and without snow respectively undisturbed soil cores from the agricultural regions spanning 14 7 km2 in the study area were collected in november 2018 and analyzed for nitrate concentration over the depth of the core snow et al 2019 to evaluate the model for the solute transport simulations model simulated nitrate concentration for with irrigation and with snow scenario was compared with the average of the measured nitrate concentrations fig 6 the simulated and measured nitrate concentration in the soil profile was found to be comparable with ia and rmse of 0 91 and 1 52 mg l respectively since the study primarily deals with long term simulations for analyzing the influence of snow on nitrate leaching long term nitrate leaching data from with and without snow conditions would be necessary for performing a scenario with and without snow based analysis of the measured and simulated nitrate concentration such detailed measured data is not available for the study area in addition the model also follows a set of assumptions on amount and timing of fertilizer application cropping history residual nitrate concentration nitrogen transformations etc therefore well formulated controlled with and without snow experiments with extensive data collection are essential for detailed model evaluation and for substantiating the findings of the current study the simulated percentage increase in nitrate leaching when snow is considered in this study is specific to the features of the soil core soil type weather depth of the water table etc surface and bottom boundary conditions amount of rainfall irrigation temperature free drainage etc the percentage increase in nitrate leaching with snow can vary with these factors for example for the same soil profile when the soil was assumed to be loamy soil the percentage increase in the nitrate leaching to groundwater when considering snow was 24 4 and 27 8 for irrigated and non irrigated conditions respectively the variation in the percentage increase in nitrate leaching with varying soil hydraulic properties and boundary conditions is not analyzed in detail in the present study and can be considered for future research the results from the current study were extrapolated to a larger agricultural region to know the impact over a regional scale according to usda nass 2020 state agriculture overview for nebraska the total corn cultivated in nebraska was 4 1e 06 ha total irrigated area 56 and non irrigated 44 were estimated as 2 3e 06 ha and 1 8e 06 ha respectively usda nass when the cumulative nitrate leaching to groundwater was scaled to the corn cultivated area in 2020 for nebraska this resulted in a difference of 1 2e 09 kg of nitrate and 6 1e 08 kg of nitrate into the groundwater over 60 years in irrigated and non irrigated conditions table 3 based on the year of the first occurrence of nitrate as 2012 for the irrigated condition the difference in the nitrate leaching to groundwater was 3 4e 07 kg year when considering snow compared to without snow simulations similarly considering 2019 as the year of the first occurrence of nitrate in the groundwater in non irrigated conditions the average yearly difference in the nitrate leaching was observed to be 2 1e 07 kg year when considering snow compared to without snow this shows the scale of increase in the nitrate leaching to groundwater due to the influence of snow which is generally neglected in groundwater contamination related studies similar observations were made from field experiments on snow impact on nitrate transport department of environmental quality idaho 2011 reported that the recent years of increased snowpack and recharge had increased the annual peak of nitrate levels in groundwater department of environmental quality idaho 2011 based on field experiment studies iwata et al 2010 iwata et al 2013 and 2018 observed that soil water movement during the snow melting period is a dominant factor controlling nitrate movement in areas with relatively large snow accumulation with thin frozen soil layers our study confirms that considering snowmelt must be part of investigation studies on nitrate leaching to groundwater 5 conclusion in most groundwater contamination related modeling studies the snow component is generally neglected this is either due to the limitation of the unsaturated saturated soil zone model of not having a snow simulation component or due to the data intensive and complex snow modeling routines the current study presents two major conclusions first our study shows that temperature threshold based snow estimation is a simple method but is effective in predicting the snow accumulation and melting process it indicates that a modeler can resort to well calibrated simple temperature threshold based snow models for snow simulations unless the purpose is to investigate the individual snow related processes second our study concludes that the snowmelt impacts the soil water dynamics and increases the solute fluxes into the groundwater this is the first study that has analyzed the potential long term impact of snow accumulation melting and infiltration on soil nitrate transport to groundwater based on a simulation modeling approach our paper highlights the importance of considering snow dynamics

1214,we present novel analytical approximations for the estimation of travel distance and relative height of solute concentration peaks within a single fracture system for pollutants that have been temporarily applied at a constant rate in the past these approximations are used to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration of atrazine as an example for many other so called legacy compounds that are still found in the groundwater of fractured rock aquifers even decades after their application has stopped this is done in a stochastic framework to account for the uncertainty in relevant parameters focusing on probabilities of exceeding the given legal concentration limit and the expected length of the recovery period we specifically consider the properties of the muschelkalk limestone aquifer in the ammer river catchment in sw germany and the three major types of carbonate rock facies shoal tempestite and basinal limestones atrazine sorption parameters have been determined in laboratory experiments the simulations confirm that diffusion limited sorption and desorption may cause considerable atrazine levels long after application stop for the properties of the considered rock facies types and corresponding parameter ranges atrazine concentration above the legal limit is supposed to be limited to locations referring to only a few years of travel time if the concentration exceeds the legal limit by the year 2022 it will take decades to centuries until recovery keywords stochastic modeling pesticide transport uncertainty analytical

in many regions of the world the quality of groundwater is at risk due to human activities and possible inputs of environmentally hazardous compounds today a large variety of anthropogenic compounds is being found in groundwater among these compounds there is a range of so called legacy contaminants including pesticides e g herbicides such as atrazine which are often detected in groundwater samples even decades after application stop farlin et al 2022 gutierrez and baran 2009 lapworth et al 2015 loos et al 2010 mcknight and finkel 2013 stuart et al 2012 often these compounds show no or

based on some hypothesis and classifying the model outcomes accordingly enemark et al 2019 the model outcome that confirms the hypothesis reads as 1 and 0 otherwise in this study stochastic simulations of solute transport within fractured sedimentary rocks are used for risk assessment with respect to legal limit concentrations of a target compound we test the hypothesis that groundwater contamination by pesticides observed in fractured aquifers baran et al 2008 burri et al 2019 mali et al 2021 mcmanus et al 2017 is caused by matrix diffusion and sorption in the rock matrix in this work an analytical model accounting for sorption and diffusive solute exchange with the rock matrix was employed to elucidate the transport characteristics of atrazine in a fractured limestone aquifer the sensitivity of atrazine transport on matrix properties effective diffusion sorption fracture apertures and application time periods is analysed based on simple analytical approximations for the relative maximum concentration peak and corresponding location of the peak along the streamline this allows breaking down the complexity of the sorptive compound transport and the knowledge about peak location and concentration to address the following questions for any given location in the aquifer in a stochastic way 1 will the concentration exceed the legal limit 2 will contaminant concentrations further increase or decline 3 how long will it take to achieve the legal limit we consider atrazine as an example of sorptive pollutants in groundwater still being detected long after stop of application input atrazine is one of the pesticides still contaminating groundwater with a trackable history of application soon after its discovery in 1958 müller 2008 atrazine 6 chloro n ethyl n 1 methylethyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine was among the most widely applied pesticides in agricultural use atrazine was used extensively as a non selective herbicide as a weed control component for the cultivation of maize sorghum and sugar cane in concentrations of 1 kg ha 1 and as a total herbicide in concentrations of up to 9 kg ha 1 tappe et al 2002 wide agricultural application of atrazine led to groundwater pollution exceeding the legal limit values in many countries worldwide nasseri et al 2009 tappe et al 2002 in europe atrazine was used until the early 1990s when it was

2 physico chemical parameters for atrazine transport in the upper muschelkalk aquifer in sw germany 2 1 geology and rock properties the fractured limestone muschelkalk aquifer is located in the river ammer catchment in the south west of germany d affonseca et al 2020 and comprises an important drinking water reservoir osenbrück et al 2021 the geological setting is well described in the literature koehrer et al 2010 palermo et al 2010 schauer and aigner 1997 warnecke and aigner 2019 and briefly outlined here three major types of carbonate rock facies may be distinguished within the aquifer shoal tempestite and basinal limestones palermo et al 2010 schauer and aigner 1997 these facies types are the result of different sedimentary and diagenetic conditions leading to different rock properties fig 1 the up to 5 m thick shoal facies contains light grey calcareous grain to packstone with bioclastic debris shell fragments and intraclasts as well as open pore spaces within shell debris partially filled with iron stained calcite the shoal facies has the highest porosity in the range of 10 30 the tempestite facies 8 15 m thick comprises medium to light grey 10 15 cm thick layers of limestones mostly calcareous bioclastic pack to wakestones composed of skeletal debris and lithoclasts mm cm sized with porosities of 0 5 10 the basinal facies comprises dark grey marlstones and micritic limestones with weak or absent wavy bedding and bioturbation low porosity 0 5 5 and considerably small pore sizes the field scale hydraulic conductivity of the upper muschelkalk aquifer varies from 2 6 10 6 to 1 10 4 m s 1 d affonseca et al 2020 which indicates representative fracture aperture ranges of 0 1 1 mm osenbrück et al 2021 petrova et al 2022 2 2 atrazine transport parameters to investigate the sorption properties of the rock facies of the upper muschelkalk samples were collected from a quarry in mötzingen fig 1 sampling locations were carefully selected according to the geological sedimentological and tectonic conditions of the study area osenbrück et al 2021 to quantify the distribution coefficient k d needed in the reactive transport equation eq 7 atrazine sorption isotherms were determined for the 3 major facies types fig 1 for each sample 10 g of pulverized rock typical particle size around 50 μm were mixed with 30 ml of water spiked with atrazine in 50 ml glass vials with teflon lined caps tests were performed in triplicates with initial aqueous concentrations of atrazine of 0 1 4 22 175 770 2930 3140 and 11 400 μg l 1 the vials were kept in a horizontal shaker 150 rpm for 10 days in the dark and at 20 c to separate soil solids from water the vials were kept standing for 3 days until fine particles settled a test with filtering the supernatant aqueous phase proved sufficient removal of particles by pure sedimentation around 20 ml of the supernatant water was transferred into clean 50 ml glass vials using glass pipettes attention was paid to transfer as much water as possible without resuspending the sediment as an internal standard we added 20 ng of atrazine d5 into the aqueous sample before further processing for quality control we used blanks with pure water procedure blank blanks with water and rock samples and water spiked with atrazine control for loss to the system all in triplicates we observed neither atrazine within the blanks nor significant losses from the system for chemical analysis low concentration samples 0 2 μg l 1 were enriched via solid phase extraction waters oasis hlb ma 1 cc samples with concentrations between 0 2 and 10 μg l 1 were filtered through 0 25 μm ptfe syringe filters and 2 vol of acetonitrile was added samples with concentrations above 10 μg l 1 were diluted with a milliq water acetronitrile mixture 98 2 atrazine was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent 1290 infinity hplc and 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with a poroshell 120 ec c18 2 7 μm 2 1 100 mm reversed phase column we measured 10 external standards with a range of 0 001 μg l 1 20 μg l 1 at the beginning and the end of the analysis to determine the calibration curve for the calculation of sample concentrations one standard 2 5 μg l 1 was measured repeatedly in every 20th run as quality control concerning potential instrument shifts both the external and the internal standard showed the same drift with increasing peak areas over time thus we used both calibration curves simultaneously for the quantification and accepted the remaining uncertainty as insignificant additionally the internal standard showed no dependency on the type of sample blank control or rock sample nor the corresponding processing of the sample spe filtration dilution confirming no significant losses or matrix effects on the measurement with an acceptable coefficient of variation of 10 fig 2 shows almost linear sorption isotherms with distribution

sedimentary rocks is about 2 2 boving and grathwohl 2001 ε m 1 denotes the tortuosity d aq ε m 1 is known as pore diffusion coefficient and rim is the retardation factor in the rock matrix we assume a time period of 33 years from the start of atrazine application until its ban 1958 1991 this neglects delayed leaching of atrazine stored in the upper soil layer which however would be very low because of the biodegradation of atrazine in agricultural soils chavez rodriguez et al 2021 atrazine persistence in groundwater was assumed to be related to its arguably absent degradation in the aquifer

barbash 1996 concentrations of atrazine in groundwater recharge depend on the application and properties of the soil and the unsaturated soil zone literature data on atrazine leaching vary widely

the ultimate catchment specific parameter ranges including porosity and distribution coefficients for each facies type were summarized in table 1 3 transport modeling 3 1 analytical solution and approximations we consider advective solute transport of a compound along a single fracture that is retarded by the interaction with the adjacent rock matrix fig 3 assuming an entirely void fracture with negligible solute retardation in the fracture the governing equation for the mass transport along the fracture being subject to exchange with the rock matrix is 2 c m t v c m x m im t where c m and m im denote solute concentration m l 3 in the fracture mobile region and total mass of solute in the rock matrix immobile region per unit volume m l 3 of the fracture v x and t denote flow velocity the spatial coordinate l t 1 in flow direction along the fracture l and time t in case of linear sorption the mass of solute per unit volume in the rock matrix is given by 3 m im 1 a a ε k d ρ c im dz where 1 a denotes the surface to volume ratio l 1 with a being the half fracture aperture of the fracture l z is the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the flow direction i e depth in the rock matrix and c im denotes the solute concentration m l 3 in pore water of the rock matrix ε k d and ρ denote porosity of the rock matrix dimensionless the distribution coefficient l3 m 1 and the dry bulk density of the matrix region m l 3 respectively combining eq 2 and eq 3 yields 4 c m t v c m x 1 a ε k d ρ a c im t dz to describe the transport of a solute that has been applied only over a

boundary conditions are c im x z 0 0 c im x t 0 c im x a t c m x t inserting eq 5 into eq 4 gives 6 c m t v c m x 1 a ε k d ρ d a c im z x a t following rahman et al 2004 who derived an analytical solution for the equivalent case of a macropore column by superposition of the solution developed by grisak and pickens 1981 for continuous solute input the solute concentration in the fracture is

concentration maximum propagating through the system fig 4 fig 4 depicts the concentration profile in the fracture fig 4 left and a breakthrough curve at a given location fig 4 right the conservative tracer which does not sorb in the solid phase has a sharp front and higher maximum concentration sorption of the solute in the rock matrix causes retardation and concentration tailing even decades after the application stopped thanks to unimodality of the plume concentrations along the fracture are linearly increasing until a maximum is reached followed by a monotonically decrease fig 5 top left the breakthrough curve at any location is also unimodal concentrations first increase until the peak is reached and then decrease with t 3 2 typical for back diffusion fig 5 top right to highlight the effect of both application time t and distance x a response surface was constructed fig 5 bottom in order to illustrate the concentration of atrazine in the fracture as a function of time and distance the contour plots of the peak travel time shown in fig 5 however allow arriving at simple solutions for the distance travelled by the peak and how the maximum concentration declines following a heuristic approach and a detailed analysis of the results obtained by the analytical model eq 7 and 8 fig 5 simple analytical approximations for the relative maximum concentration and location of the concentration maximum along the fracture were derived eq 9 and 10 these approximations follow from the investigation of the model behaviour in the parameter space fig 5 first obtained expressions eq 9 and 10 were verified through the local sensitivity of parameters following one at time approach and aiming to represent the direct effect of parameter variation figs 6 and 7 to confirm the combined effect of parameter variation eqs 9 and 10 were verified through the global parameter variation with corresponding solution eq 8 fig 8 the relative peak concentration c max c 0 was found to depend mainly on the application time t 0 and total time t like the solute mass in ordinary back diffusion e g diffusion into and out of a low permeability layer grathwohl 1998 9 c max c 0 t 0 4 t since diffusion into the rock matrix depends on the same physical parameters as of diffusion out of the rock matrix sorption and diffusion parameters cancel out the location of the peak concentration x cmax l may be approximated by the following equation which involves all transport parameters of the analytical solution eq 7 10 x cmax 2 a v t t 0 π ε k d ρ d aq ε 2 2 t 2 a v t k d ρ d aq ε 2 2 t d aq ε2 2 represents the effective diffusion coefficient boving and grathwohl 2001 and the denominator in the long term approximation t t 0 is a retardation factor the velocity v according to the cubic law v iρg 2 a 2 12 μ depends on the hydraulic gradient i and a 2 g μ ρ denoting acceleration of gravity dynamic groundwater viscosity and density resp the peak location depends on various parameters with different sensitivities of which the most significant is the aperture a x cmax then increases with a 3 to confirm the correct reflection of the local sensitivity one factor at a time method also known as monothetic analysis was implemented to the newly derived approximations the base model parameter set and corresponding parameter ranges typical for fractured aquifers are a 0 2 from 0 1 to 10 mm ε 1 from 1 to 20 t 0 33 from 10 to 100 years t 200 from t 0 to 1000 years i 3 10 3 k d 10 from 1 to 100 l kg 1 d aq 4 10 10 from 1 10 10 to 1 10 9 m2 s 1 to test the approximations fit to the solution eq 8 each of the model parameters was varied within the reasonable ranges 500 times while other parameters kept constant figs 6 and 7 illustrate the local sensitivity and compare both analytical solution eq 8 and approximations eqs 9 and 10 both analytical solution and approximation reflect that c max c 0 is not very sensitive to ε k d d aq and a aperture is by far the most sensitive parameter for x cmax showing a positive correlation while ε k d d aq showing a negative correlation approximated and analytical estimates of x cmax and c max c 0 for 500 values of each parameter closely mimic the true model behaviour with respect to changes of individual parameters in case of c max c 0 0 1 and t t 0 the approximation of x cmax represents the analytical solution reasonably well comparison for parameter settings from simultaneous random sampling within given parameter ranges confirms the good agreement of approximations and analytical solution for c max c 0 and x cmax see fig 8 the quality of analytical approximations was evaluated by computing the coefficient of determination r 2 11 r 2 k 1 n y k y k 2 k 1 n y k y 2 where y k y k and y denote the true values calculated values and mean of the true values accordingly computed values for an ensemble of 500 random parameter combinations resulted in r 2 of 0 99 and 1 0 for c max c 0 and x cmax accordingly large deviations are very low except for high concentrations a situation which occurs either close to the inlet of the fracture or if the solute breakthrough is fast due to slow matrix diffusion and low sorption these deviations are not relevant to practical applications that typically aim at long term predictions of sorptive compounds 3 2 model predictions under uncertainty from a practical point of view the critical characteristics of the sorptive compound s breakthrough curve are peak concentration and the time after the concentration finally drops below the groundwater legal limit threshold concentration c th farlin et al 2022 while the peak concentration only depends on the duration of the input and time eq 9 the peak location depends on retardation eq 10 i e sorption effective diffusion velocity and aperture as all relevant parameters can be estimated only with more or less uncertainty in the field stochastic model predictions are required assuming sorption coefficients determined in the lab can be quantified sufficiently well we consider solute input concentration fracture half aperture and porosity as the most uncertain parameters table 1 with given ranges of uncertain parameters a c in ε normalized to the range 0 1 a 3 dimensional halton sequence with the targeted ensemble size of 10 000 elements was generated each ensemble member included solute concentration c τ t where travel time τ is a proxy of distance reducing the influence of the aperture please see eq 10 for the parameter dependencies and t 64 refers to the time from the atrazine application in 1958 until 2022 please see fig 9 and appendix for illustration results were analysed with respect to three questions listed below q 1 will the concentration exceed the legal limit binary answer model runs are first evaluated with respect to the question of whether concentrations at a certain location travel time will exceed the legal limit value for atrazine in germany c th 0 1 μg l 1 in the future or not evaluation is binary if concentration c τ t t p for a certain travel time τ will exceed the limit the evaluation results in answer a 1 τ 1 otherwise in a 1 τ 0 q 2 will the concentration decline binary answer thanks to the unimodality of the concentration breakthrough curve concentrations monotonically decrease after the peak passed by fig 9 answers to question q2 are easily determined with the help of the travel time of the concentration peak at present time τ peak t p a 2 τ 0 τ τ peak t p and a 2 τ 1 τ τ peak t p q 3 if the concentration in the fracture now 2022 exceeds the legal limit c th how long will it take to drop below it c c th for the range of travel time where the concentration exceeds the legal limit the expected time t d until the concentration will drop below c th is calculated the ensemble of answers a1 and a2 is expressed in terms of facies specific probabilities p a1 τ 1 and p a2 τ 1 evaluations of recovery period t d are given as distributions 4 results and discussion 4 1 stochastic analysis answers a1 and a2 and recovery period t d were computed for an ensemble of 10 000 relevant model parameter settings for every rock facies type travel time was split in the interval 0 01 τ 3 years into 20 steps logarithmically increasing from 0 01 years to a maximum step size of 1 year for τ 3 years probabilities p a1 τ 1 and p a2 τ 1 are depicted in fig 10 in all facies types the highest probability to exceed the legal limit after 2022 refers to the young water the groundwater with longer travel times will stay below the legal limit although this generally holds for all rock facies it is most distinct for the shoal facies in shoal high matrix porosity leads to high atrazine attenuation in the rock matrix as a result already close to the fracture inlet the concentration will stay below c th for travel times longer than 0 6 years fig 10 left graph solid line for travel times larger than 0 2 years the peak concentration may still come in the future fig 10 left graph dashed line but will most likely not exceed c th as p a1 is reasonably low for τ 1 in tempestite the concentration peak passed already for τ 2 years fig 10 middle graph and is to come for larger travel times at the same time the probability of reaching c th for travel time between 2 and 6 years stays low fig 10 middle graph similar relationships with lower solute attenuation are expected for the basinal facies fig 10 right graph thus for travel times of up to 2 years the legal limit may be exceeded differences between basinal and tempestite are mainly due to the k d value which is almost four times higher in basinal than in tempestite facies types table 1 a comparison of results in shoal and tempestite reveals the significant control of the matrix porosity on solute transport though having similar k d values facies types show significant differences in the values of probability to exceed the legal limit while the probability to exceed the legal limit reflects the risk of atrazine contamination at a certain travel time the recovery period t d reveals the severity of the contamination if exceeding the atrazine concentration is highly likely based on probabilities see fig 10 then the recovery period refers to the intensity of contamination and duration of corresponding recovery time therefore the duration of the recovery is depicted against the probability of atrazine exceedance in the groundwater for shoal tempestite and basinal facies types fig 11 left to right in all facies types recovery durations have a tendency to the same value at p a1 0 the recovery duration varies only slightly in the range of hundreds of years for the probability 70 for probabilities larger than 70 the recovery duration is inversely proportional to the probability the minimum recovery duration corresponding to the probability of 90 is 30 60 years the width of possible recovery durations at a given probability value is varying between facies types the largest variability of the recovery period relates to the tempestite facies type fig 11 right due to the highest porosity variability and therefore highest uncertainty if atrazine in groundwater likely exceed the legal limit i e if p a1 1 is close to 100 which corresponds to travel times of only a few months see fig 10 the expected length of the recovery period t d ranges between 20 years tempestite and basinal and 50 years shoal 4 2 limitations in applicability to real catchments the description of solute transport of a sorptive compound in a fractured aquifer using a travel time based analytical solution for transport in a single fracture shows to be a computationally very efficient tool to develop a more specific picture of the behaviour of legacy compounds like atrazine in fractured rock using a simplified single fracture model the focus is set to the reactive part of the problem and the sensitivity to corresponding parameters the fate and behaviour of legacy compounds in real fractured rock aquifers however is also governed by the particular groundwater flow conditions resulting from the heterogeneity of aquifer properties and given hydraulic boundary conditions and forcing water quality predictions for real locations such as water supply wells are only possible if this hydraulics can be described in the model in a travel time based model framework this is done by means of a probability density function pdf of travel time e g cirpka and kitanidis 2000 petrova et al 2022 which quantifies the mixing of water in the well that has travelled along different streamtubes given such pdf of travel time for the location of interest the risk probability of unacceptable atrazine contamination can be simulated by convolution of this pdf with the probability profile of exceeding the legal limit concentration for atrazine in groundwater fig 10 the problem is that at best only mean or average travel time can be derived in terms of apparent groundwater age from isotopic data suckow 2014 however the mixing of water cannot be measured or reliably quantified in any other way note that even tracer tests wouldn t reflect the real situation of solutes being applied on large areas in agriculture this lack of information may be partly overcome by using parametric pdf such as gamma distributions petrova et al 2022 this is why despite the difficulties described above we see a potential for using the herein derived probability curves fig 10 for atrazine transport assessment the presented model is accounting for aquifers where no relevant microbial degradation of atrazine occurs in the saturated zone however any microbial degradation that take place in the unsaturated zone including dechlorination dealkylation hydroxylation and ring cleavage shuwen et al 2021 and may effectively attenuate atrazine concentration beegum et al 2020 is considered in the definition of the model s boundary condition namely the definition of the atrazine input concentration in the recharge entering the saturated zone a detailed knowledge of the atrazine degradation pathways in the subsurface would reduce the uncertainty of the current model by defining narrower range of the boundary condition input concentration table 1 any spatial variability of this concentration however cannot be taken into account such variability may result from spatial heterogeneity of soil characteristics variability in land surface characteristics and spatially differentiated application of atrazine as well as from spatially variable hydraulics in the vadose zone as we believe that it is vitally impossible to reliably estimate atrazine concentration in recharge to groundwater in a spatially differentiated way on the catchment scale we address atrazine input concentration as uncertain model input parameter with a rather broad range of possible values table 1 noticeably if atrazine degradation in the saturated zone of the aquifer cannot be considered negligible another solution instead of eq 8 10 must be considered due to the large time scale even small degradation rates i e half life in the order of years may remarkably decrease atrazine concentration e g sidborn and neretnieks 2007 this would lower the risk of exceeding the legal limit concentration for atrazine probability profiles shown in fig 10 will be shifted to the left 5 conclusions the stochastic analysis of pesticide transport in a fractured muschelkalk aquifer is summarized in the following conclusions sorption of the atrazine in the muschelkalk aquifer is almost linear and fairly similar in all facies k d values in the range 6 4 34 3 l kg 1 larger differences are observed for matrix porosities ε 0 1 0 3 for the tempestite and ε 0 01 0 05 for the basinal facies which strongly influence the effective diffusivity in rock matrix d e ε 2 2 newly derived approximations for maximum concentration and corresponding travel distance of the peak reflect and clarify parametric dependencies of pesticide transport in fractured systems the approximations could be applied to any other legacy compound as well higher risks can be anticipated for compounds that have been applied over a longer application period than atrazine and or at a higher input concentration in relation to the legal limit e g chlorinated hydrocarbons maximum pesticide concentration in the fracture depends only on the ratio of input time to total time whereas the retardation of the peak increases with the square root of time and is inverse proportional to the aperture fracture aperture and porosity are the most sensitive transport parameters followed by sorption and aqueous diffusion coefficients fractures with small apertures lead to slow transport and high attenuation of the peak concentration although the atrazine application stopped in 1991 increasing concentrations have to be expected in fractures with groundwater travel times of 0 6 2 years due to slow mass exchange and storage within the rock matrix all muschelkalk facies types will likely exhibit atrazine concentrations below legal limit of 0 1 μg l 1 if groundwater travel time exceeds 2 years in the view of the mean travel times estimated for the wells in the ammer catchment which are in the order decades petrova et al 2022 that implies very low probability to exceed the legal limit on the other side locations with the mean travel times up to 2 years deserve an increased attention in terms of the atrazine concentration increase if the legal limit of the concentration is exceeded at a given location it will take most likely centuries for recovery the curves of the probability of both legal limit exceedance and concentration decline fig 10 may be used as a reaction curve in catchment scale travel time based modeling see e g petrova et al 2022 article impact statement legacy pollutants in fractured aquifers

1214,we present novel analytical approximations for the estimation of travel distance and relative height of solute concentration peaks within a single fracture system for pollutants that have been temporarily applied at a constant rate in the past these approximations are used to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration of atrazine as an example for many other so called legacy compounds that are still found in the groundwater of fractured rock aquifers even decades after their application has stopped this is done in a stochastic framework to account for the uncertainty in relevant parameters focusing on probabilities of exceeding the given legal concentration limit and the expected length of the recovery period we specifically consider the properties of the muschelkalk limestone aquifer in the ammer river catchment in sw germany and the three major types of carbonate rock facies shoal tempestite and basinal limestones atrazine sorption parameters have been determined in laboratory experiments the simulations confirm that diffusion limited sorption and desorption may cause considerable atrazine levels long after application stop for the properties of the considered rock facies types and corresponding parameter ranges atrazine concentration above the legal limit is supposed to be limited to locations referring to only a few years of travel time if the concentration exceeds the legal limit by the year 2022 it will take decades to centuries until recovery keywords stochastic modeling pesticide transport uncertainty analytical

in many regions of the world the quality of groundwater is at risk due to human activities and possible inputs of environmentally hazardous compounds today a large variety of anthropogenic compounds is being found in groundwater among these compounds there is a range of so called legacy contaminants including pesticides e g herbicides such as atrazine which are often detected in groundwater samples even decades after application stop farlin et al 2022 gutierrez and baran 2009 lapworth et al 2015 loos et al 2010 mcknight and finkel 2013 stuart et al 2012 often these compounds show no or

acknowledges parametric or structural uncertainty assesses the sensitivity of the model improves the model quality and enhances predictive capability typically implemented stochastic methods include monte carlo kriging kitanidis 1991 gaussian random fields hammond et al 2005 hydro facies models dell arciprete et al 2012 multi point statistics and training images resulting ensembles of model outcomes are used for stochastic prediction with the uncertainty of parameters being acknowledged one way of stochastic prediction is conditioning the model outcomes into a series of yes no answers based on some hypothesis and classifying the model outcomes accordingly enemark et al 2019 the model outcome that confirms the hypothesis reads as 1 and 0 otherwise in this study stochastic simulations of solute transport within fractured sedimentary rocks are used for risk assessment with respect to legal limit concentrations of a target compound we test the hypothesis that groundwater contamination by pesticides observed in fractured aquifers baran et al 2008 burri et al 2019 mali et al 2021 mcmanus et al 2017 is caused by matrix diffusion and sorption in the rock matrix in this work an analytical model accounting for sorption and diffusive solute exchange with the rock matrix was employed to elucidate the transport characteristics of atrazine in a fractured limestone aquifer the sensitivity of atrazine transport on matrix properties effective diffusion sorption fracture apertures and application time periods is analysed based on simple analytical approximations for the relative maximum concentration peak and corresponding location of the peak along the streamline this allows breaking down the complexity of the sorptive compound transport and the knowledge about peak location and concentration to address the following questions for any given location in the aquifer in a stochastic way 1 will the concentration exceed the legal limit 2 will contaminant concentrations further increase or decline 3 how long will it take to achieve the legal limit we consider atrazine as an example of sorptive pollutants in groundwater still being detected long after stop of application input atrazine is one of the pesticides still contaminating groundwater with a trackable history of application soon after its discovery in 1958 müller 2008 atrazine 6 chloro n ethyl n 1 methylethyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine was among the most widely applied pesticides in agricultural use atrazine was used extensively as a non selective herbicide as a weed control component for the cultivation of maize sorghum and sugar cane in concentrations of 1 kg ha 1 and as a total herbicide in concentrations of up to 9 kg ha 1 tappe et al 2002 wide agricultural application of atrazine led to groundwater pollution exceeding the legal limit values in many countries worldwide nasseri et al 2009 tappe et al 2002 in europe atrazine was used until the early 1990s when it was banned or severely restricted in most european countries due to its potentially harmful properties in germany atrazine has been banned since 1991 the european water framework directive wfd e 2000 60 ec ojec 2000 established objectives to achieve a good qualitative and chemical status of groundwater nevertheless atrazine is continuously found in groundwater decades after official ban on its application vonberg et al 2014 the legal limit for all pesticides in source waters was set to 0 1 μg l 1 for single substances and 0 5 μg l 1 for the sum of pesticides incl relevant metabolites

2 physico chemical parameters for atrazine transport in the upper muschelkalk aquifer in sw germany 2 1 geology and rock properties the fractured limestone muschelkalk aquifer is located in the river ammer catchment in the south west of germany d affonseca et al 2020 and comprises an important drinking water reservoir osenbrück et al 2021 the geological setting is well described in the literature koehrer et al 2010 palermo et al 2010 schauer and aigner 1997 warnecke and aigner 2019 and briefly outlined here three major types of carbonate rock facies may be distinguished within the aquifer shoal tempestite and basinal limestones palermo et al 2010 schauer and aigner 1997 these facies types are the result of different sedimentary and diagenetic conditions leading to different rock properties fig 1 the up to 5 m thick shoal facies contains light grey calcareous grain to packstone with bioclastic debris shell fragments and intraclasts as well as open pore spaces within shell debris partially filled with iron stained calcite the shoal facies has the highest porosity in the range of 10 30 the tempestite facies 8 15 m thick comprises medium to light grey 10 15 cm thick layers of limestones mostly calcareous bioclastic pack to wakestones composed of skeletal debris and lithoclasts mm cm sized with porosities of 0 5 10 the basinal facies comprises dark grey marlstones and micritic limestones with weak or absent wavy bedding and bioturbation low porosity 0 5 5 and considerably small pore sizes the field scale hydraulic conductivity of the upper muschelkalk aquifer varies from 2 6 10 6 to 1 10 4 m s 1 d affonseca et al 2020 which indicates representative fracture aperture ranges of 0 1 1 mm osenbrück et al 2021 petrova et al 2022 2 2 atrazine transport parameters to investigate the sorption properties of the rock facies of the upper muschelkalk samples were collected from a quarry in mötzingen fig 1 sampling locations were carefully selected according to the geological sedimentological and tectonic conditions of the study area osenbrück et al 2021 to quantify the distribution coefficient k d needed in the reactive transport equation eq 7 atrazine sorption isotherms were determined for the 3 major facies types fig 1 for each sample 10 g of pulverized rock typical particle size around 50 μm were mixed with 30 ml of water spiked with atrazine in 50 ml glass vials with teflon lined caps tests were performed in triplicates with initial aqueous concentrations of atrazine of 0 1 4 22 175 770 2930 3140 and 11 400 μg l 1 the vials were kept in a horizontal shaker 150 rpm for 10 days in the dark and at 20 c to separate soil solids from water the vials were kept standing for 3 days until fine particles settled a test with filtering the supernatant aqueous phase proved sufficient removal of particles by pure sedimentation around 20 ml of the supernatant water was transferred into clean 50 ml glass vials using glass pipettes attention was paid to transfer as much water as possible without resuspending the sediment as an internal standard we added 20 ng of atrazine d5 into the aqueous sample before further processing for quality control we used blanks with pure water procedure blank blanks with water and rock samples and water spiked with atrazine control for loss to the system all in triplicates we observed neither atrazine within the blanks nor significant losses from the system for chemical analysis low concentration samples 0 2 μg l 1 were enriched via solid phase extraction waters oasis hlb ma 1 cc samples with concentrations between 0 2 and 10 μg l 1 were filtered through 0 25 μm ptfe syringe filters and 2 vol of acetonitrile was added samples with concentrations above 10 μg l 1 were diluted with a milliq water acetronitrile mixture 98 2 atrazine was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent 1290 infinity hplc and 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with a poroshell 120 ec c18 2 7 μm 2 1 100 mm reversed phase column we measured 10 external standards with a range of 0 001 μg l 1 20 μg l 1 at the beginning and the end of the analysis to determine the calibration curve for the calculation of sample concentrations one standard 2 5 μg l 1 was measured repeatedly in every 20th run as quality control concerning potential instrument shifts both the external and the internal standard showed the same drift with increasing peak areas over time thus we used both calibration curves simultaneously for the quantification and accepted the remaining uncertainty as insignificant additionally the internal standard showed no dependency on the type of sample blank control or rock sample nor the corresponding processing of the sample spe filtration dilution confirming no significant losses or matrix effects on the measurement with an acceptable coefficient of variation of 10 fig 2 shows almost linear sorption isotherms with distribution coefficients k d freundlich coefficients at 1 μg l 1 of 6 4 l kg 1 for shoal 8 5 l kg 1 for tempestite and 34 3 l kg 1 for the basinal facies fig 2 therefore retardation factors in the rock matrix r

sedimentary rocks is about 2 2 boving and grathwohl 2001 ε m 1 denotes the tortuosity d aq ε m 1 is known as pore diffusion coefficient and rim is the retardation factor in the rock matrix we assume a time period of 33 years from the start of atrazine application until its ban 1958 1991 this neglects delayed leaching of atrazine stored in the upper soil layer which however would be very low because of the biodegradation of atrazine in agricultural soils chavez rodriguez et al 2021 atrazine persistence in groundwater was assumed to be related to its arguably absent degradation in the aquifer reported atrazine degradation pathways under saturated conditions include physicochemical or biochemical processes into metabolites schocken and speedie 1984 radosevich et al 1996 low porosities and small pore sizes a in the muschelkalk osenbrück et al 2021 as well as mostly anoxic conditions in the aquifer petrova et al 2022 limit growth of the microorganisms which degrade atrazine metabolically barbash 1996 concentrations of atrazine in groundwater recharge depend on the application and properties of the soil and the unsaturated soil zone literature data on atrazine leaching vary widely

the ultimate catchment specific parameter ranges including porosity and distribution coefficients for each facies type were summarized in table 1 3 transport modeling 3 1 analytical solution and approximations we consider advective solute transport of a compound along a single fracture that is retarded by the interaction with the adjacent rock matrix fig 3 assuming an entirely void fracture with negligible solute retardation in the fracture the governing equation for the mass transport along the fracture being subject to exchange with the rock matrix is 2 c m t v c m x m im t where c m and m im denote solute concentration m l 3 in the fracture mobile region and total mass of solute in the rock matrix immobile region per unit volume m l 3 of the fracture v x and t denote flow velocity the spatial coordinate l t 1 in flow direction along the fracture l and time t in case of linear sorption the mass of solute per unit volume in the rock matrix is given by 3 m im 1 a a ε k d ρ c im dz where 1 a denotes the surface to volume ratio l 1 with a being the half fracture aperture of the fracture l z is the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the flow direction i e depth in the rock matrix and c im denotes the solute concentration m l 3 in pore water of the rock matrix ε k d and ρ denote porosity of the rock matrix dimensionless the distribution coefficient l3 m 1 and the dry bulk density of the matrix region m l 3 respectively combining eq 2 and eq 3 yields 4 c m t v c m x 1 a ε k d ρ a c im t dz to describe the transport of a solute that has been applied only over a

boundary conditions are c im x z 0 0 c im x t 0 c im x a t c m x t inserting eq 5 into eq 4 gives 6 c m t v c m x 1 a ε k d ρ d a c im z x a t following rahman et al 2004 who derived an analytical solution for the equivalent case of a macropore column by superposition of the solution developed by grisak and pickens 1981 for continuous solute input the solute concentration in the fracture is given by 7 c m x t c o erfc ε k d ρ x v d a 2 a t x v erfc ε k d ρ x v d a 2 a t x v t 0 expressing the spatial coordinate along the fracture in terms of travel time of water τ x v the relative concentration is given by 8 c m c o erfc ε k d ρ τ d a 2 a t τ erfc ε k d ρ τ d a 2 a t τ t 0 transport of any sorptive compound in the considered case eq 8 follows a unimodal function with a concentration maximum propagating through the system fig 4 fig 4 depicts the concentration profile in the fracture fig 4 left and a breakthrough curve at a given location fig 4 right the conservative tracer which does not sorb in the solid phase has a sharp front and higher maximum concentration sorption of the solute in the rock matrix causes retardation and concentration tailing even decades after the application stopped thanks to unimodality of the plume concentrations along the fracture are linearly increasing until a maximum is reached followed by a monotonically decrease fig 5 top left the breakthrough curve at any location is also unimodal concentrations first increase until the peak is reached and then decrease with t 3 2 typical for back diffusion fig 5 top right to highlight the effect of both application time t and distance x a response surface was constructed fig 5 bottom in order to illustrate the concentration of atrazine in the fracture as a function of time and distance the contour plots of the peak travel time shown in fig 5 however allow arriving at simple solutions for the distance travelled by the peak and how the maximum concentration declines following a heuristic approach and a detailed analysis of the results obtained by the analytical model eq 7 and 8 fig 5 simple analytical approximations for the relative maximum concentration and location of the concentration maximum along the fracture were derived eq 9 and 10 these approximations follow from the investigation of the model behaviour in the parameter space fig 5 first obtained expressions eq 9 and 10 were verified through the local sensitivity of parameters following one at time approach and aiming to represent the direct effect of parameter variation figs 6 and 7 to confirm the combined effect of parameter variation eqs 9 and 10 were verified through the global parameter variation with corresponding solution eq 8 fig 8 the relative peak concentration c max c 0 was found to depend mainly on the application time t 0 and total time t like the solute mass in ordinary back diffusion e g diffusion into and out of a low permeability layer grathwohl 1998 9 c max c 0 t 0 4 t since diffusion into the rock matrix depends on the same physical parameters as of diffusion out of the rock matrix sorption and diffusion parameters cancel out the location of the peak concentration x cmax l may be approximated by the following equation which involves all transport parameters of the analytical solution eq 7 10 x cmax 2 a v t t 0 π ε k d ρ d aq ε 2 2 t 2 a v t k d ρ d aq ε 2 2 t d aq ε2 2 represents the effective diffusion coefficient boving and grathwohl 2001 and the denominator in the long term approximation t t 0 is a retardation factor the velocity v according to the cubic law v iρg 2 a 2 12 μ depends on the hydraulic gradient i and a 2 g μ ρ denoting acceleration of gravity dynamic groundwater viscosity and density resp the peak location depends on various parameters with different sensitivities of which the most significant is the aperture a x cmax then increases with a 3 to confirm the correct reflection of the local sensitivity one factor at a time method also known as monothetic analysis was implemented to the newly derived approximations the base model parameter set and corresponding parameter ranges typical for fractured aquifers are a 0 2 from 0 1 to 10 mm ε 1 from 1 to 20 t 0 33 from 10 to 100 years t 200 from t 0 to 1000 years i 3 10 3 k d 10 from 1 to 100 l kg 1 d aq 4 10 10 from 1 10 10 to 1 10 9 m2 s 1 to test the approximations fit to the solution eq 8 each of the model parameters was varied within the reasonable ranges 500 times while other parameters kept constant figs 6 and 7 illustrate the local sensitivity and compare both analytical solution eq 8 and approximations eqs 9 and 10 both analytical solution and approximation reflect that c max c 0 is not very sensitive to ε k d d aq and a aperture is by far the most sensitive parameter for x cmax showing a positive correlation while ε k d d aq showing a negative correlation approximated and analytical estimates of x cmax and c max c 0 for 500 values of each parameter closely mimic the true model behaviour with respect to changes of individual parameters in case of c max c 0 0 1 and t t 0 the approximation of x cmax represents the analytical solution reasonably well comparison for parameter settings from simultaneous random sampling within given parameter ranges confirms the good agreement of approximations and analytical solution for c max c 0 and x cmax see fig 8 the quality of analytical approximations was evaluated by computing the coefficient of determination r 2 11 r 2 k 1 n y k y k 2 k 1 n y k y 2 where y k y k and y denote the true values calculated values and mean of the true values accordingly computed values for an ensemble of 500 random parameter combinations resulted in r 2 of 0 99 and 1 0 for c max c 0 and x cmax accordingly large deviations are very low except for high concentrations a situation which occurs either close to the inlet of the fracture or if the solute breakthrough is fast due to slow matrix diffusion and low sorption these deviations are not relevant to practical applications that typically aim at long term predictions of sorptive compounds 3 2 model predictions under uncertainty from a practical point of view the critical characteristics of the sorptive compound s breakthrough curve are peak concentration and the time after the concentration finally drops below the groundwater legal limit threshold concentration c th farlin et al 2022 while the peak concentration only depends on the duration of the input and time eq 9 the peak location depends on retardation eq 10 i e sorption effective diffusion velocity and aperture as all relevant parameters can be estimated only with more or less uncertainty in the field stochastic model predictions are required assuming sorption coefficients determined in the lab can be quantified sufficiently well we consider solute input concentration fracture half aperture and porosity as the most uncertain parameters table 1 with given ranges of uncertain parameters a c in ε normalized to the range 0 1 a 3 dimensional halton sequence with the targeted ensemble size of 10 000 elements was generated each ensemble member included solute concentration c τ t where travel time τ is a proxy of distance reducing the influence of the aperture please see eq 10 for the parameter dependencies and t 64 refers to the time from the atrazine application in 1958 until 2022 please see fig 9 and appendix for illustration results were analysed with respect to three questions listed below q 1 will the concentration exceed the legal limit binary answer model runs are first evaluated with respect to the question of whether concentrations at a certain location travel time will exceed the legal limit value for atrazine in germany c th 0 1 μg l 1 in the future or not evaluation is binary if concentration c τ t t p for a certain travel time τ will exceed the limit the evaluation results in answer a 1 τ 1 otherwise in a 1 τ 0 q 2 will the concentration decline binary answer thanks to the unimodality of the concentration breakthrough curve concentrations monotonically decrease after the peak passed by fig 9 answers to question q2 are easily determined with the help of the travel time of the concentration peak at present time τ peak t p a 2 τ 0 τ τ peak t p and a 2 τ 1 τ τ peak t p q 3 if the concentration in the fracture now 2022 exceeds the legal limit c th how long will it take to drop below it c c th for the range of travel time where the concentration exceeds the legal limit the expected time t d until the concentration will drop below c th is calculated the ensemble of answers a1 and a2 is expressed in terms of facies specific probabilities p a1 τ 1 and p a2 τ 1 evaluations of recovery period t d are given as distributions 4 results and discussion 4 1 stochastic analysis answers a1 and a2 and recovery period t d were computed for an ensemble of 10 000 relevant model parameter settings for every rock facies type travel time was split in the interval 0 01 τ 3 years into 20 steps logarithmically increasing from 0 01 years to a maximum step size of 1 year for τ 3 years probabilities p a1 τ 1 and p a2 τ 1 are depicted in fig 10 in all facies types the highest probability to exceed the legal limit after 2022 refers to the young water the groundwater with longer travel times will stay below the legal limit although this generally holds for all rock facies it is most distinct for the shoal facies in shoal high matrix porosity leads to high atrazine attenuation in the rock matrix as a result already close to the fracture inlet the concentration will stay below c th for travel times longer than 0 6 years fig 10 left graph solid line for travel times larger than 0 2 years the peak concentration may still come in the future fig 10 left graph dashed line but will most likely not exceed c th as p a1 is reasonably low for τ 1 in tempestite the concentration peak passed already for τ 2 years fig 10 middle graph and is to come for larger travel times at the same time the probability of reaching c th for travel time between 2 and 6 years stays low fig 10 middle graph similar relationships with lower solute attenuation are expected for the basinal facies fig 10 right graph thus for travel times of up to 2 years the legal limit may be exceeded differences between basinal and tempestite are mainly due to the k d value which is almost four times higher in basinal than in tempestite facies types table 1 a comparison of results in shoal and tempestite reveals the significant control of the matrix porosity on solute transport though having similar k d values facies types show significant differences in the values of probability to exceed the legal limit while the probability to exceed the legal limit reflects the risk of atrazine contamination at a certain travel time the recovery period t d reveals the severity of the contamination if exceeding the atrazine concentration is highly likely based on probabilities see fig 10 then the recovery period refers to the intensity of contamination and duration of corresponding recovery time therefore the duration of the recovery is depicted against the probability of atrazine exceedance in the groundwater for shoal tempestite and basinal facies types fig 11 left to right in all facies types recovery durations have a tendency to the same value at p a1 0 the recovery duration varies only slightly in the range of hundreds of years for the probability 70 for probabilities larger than 70 the recovery duration is inversely proportional to the probability the minimum recovery duration corresponding to the probability of 90 is 30 60 years the width of possible recovery durations at a given probability value is varying between facies types the largest variability of the recovery period relates to the tempestite facies type fig 11 right due to the highest porosity variability and therefore highest uncertainty if atrazine in groundwater likely exceed the legal limit i e if p a1 1 is close to 100 which corresponds to travel times of only a few months see fig 10 the expected length of the recovery period t d ranges between 20 years tempestite and basinal and 50 years shoal 4 2 limitations in applicability to real catchments the description of solute transport of a sorptive compound in a fractured aquifer using a travel time based analytical solution for transport in a single fracture shows to be a computationally very efficient tool to develop a more specific picture of the behaviour of legacy compounds like atrazine in fractured rock using a simplified single fracture model the focus is set to the reactive part of the problem and the sensitivity to corresponding parameters the fate and behaviour of legacy compounds in real fractured rock aquifers however is also governed by the particular groundwater flow conditions resulting from the heterogeneity of aquifer properties and given hydraulic boundary conditions and forcing water quality predictions for real locations such as water supply wells are only possible if this hydraulics can be described in the model in a travel time based model framework this is done by means of a probability density function pdf of travel time e g cirpka and kitanidis 2000 petrova et al 2022 which quantifies the mixing of water in the well that has travelled along different streamtubes given such pdf of travel time for the location of interest the risk probability of unacceptable atrazine contamination can be simulated by convolution of this pdf with the probability profile of exceeding the legal limit concentration for atrazine in groundwater fig 10 the problem is that at best only mean or average travel time can be derived in terms of apparent groundwater age from isotopic data suckow 2014 however the mixing of water cannot be measured or reliably quantified in any other way note that even tracer tests wouldn t reflect the real situation of solutes being applied on large areas in agriculture this lack of information may be partly overcome by using parametric pdf such as gamma distributions petrova et al 2022 this is why despite the difficulties described above we see a potential for using the herein derived probability curves fig 10 for atrazine transport assessment the presented model is accounting for aquifers where no relevant microbial degradation of atrazine occurs in the saturated zone however any microbial degradation that take place in the unsaturated zone including dechlorination dealkylation hydroxylation and ring cleavage shuwen et al 2021 and may effectively attenuate atrazine concentration beegum et al 2020 is considered in the definition of the model s boundary condition namely the definition of the atrazine input concentration in the recharge entering the saturated zone a detailed knowledge of the atrazine degradation pathways in the subsurface would reduce the uncertainty of the current model by defining narrower range of the boundary condition input concentration table 1 any spatial variability of this concentration however cannot be taken into account such variability may result from spatial heterogeneity of soil characteristics variability in land surface characteristics and spatially differentiated application of atrazine as well as from spatially variable hydraulics in the vadose zone as we believe that it is vitally impossible to reliably estimate atrazine concentration in recharge to groundwater in a spatially differentiated way on the catchment scale we address atrazine input concentration as uncertain model input parameter with a rather broad range of possible values table 1 noticeably if atrazine degradation in the saturated zone of the aquifer cannot be considered negligible another solution instead of eq 8 10 must be considered due to the large time scale even small degradation rates i e half life in the order of years may remarkably decrease atrazine concentration e g sidborn and neretnieks 2007 this would lower the risk of exceeding the legal limit concentration for atrazine probability profiles shown in fig 10 will be shifted to the left 5 conclusions the stochastic analysis of pesticide transport in a fractured muschelkalk aquifer is summarized in the following conclusions sorption of the atrazine in the muschelkalk aquifer is almost linear and fairly similar in all facies k d values in the range 6 4 34 3 l kg 1 larger differences are observed for matrix porosities ε 0 1 0 3 for the tempestite and ε 0 01 0 05 for the basinal facies which strongly influence the effective diffusivity in rock matrix d e ε 2 2 newly derived approximations for maximum concentration and corresponding travel distance of the peak reflect and clarify parametric dependencies of pesticide transport in fractured systems the approximations could be applied to any other legacy compound as well higher risks can be anticipated for compounds that have been applied over a longer application period than atrazine and or at a higher input concentration in relation to the legal limit e g chlorinated hydrocarbons maximum pesticide concentration in the fracture depends only on the ratio of input time to total time whereas the retardation of the peak increases with the square root of time and is inverse proportional to the aperture fracture aperture and porosity are the most sensitive transport parameters followed by sorption and aqueous diffusion coefficients fractures with small apertures lead to slow transport and high attenuation of the peak concentration although the atrazine application stopped in 1991 increasing concentrations have to be expected in fractures with groundwater travel times of 0 6 2 years due to slow mass exchange and storage within the rock matrix all muschelkalk facies types will likely exhibit atrazine concentrations below legal limit of 0 1 μg l 1 if groundwater travel time exceeds 2 years in the view of the mean travel times estimated for the wells in the ammer catchment which are in the order decades petrova et al 2022 that implies very low probability to exceed the legal limit on the other side locations with the mean travel times up to 2 years deserve an increased attention in terms of the atrazine concentration increase if the legal limit of the concentration is exceeded at a given location it will take most likely centuries for recovery the curves of the probability of both legal limit exceedance and concentration decline fig 10 may be used as a reaction curve in catchment scale travel time based modeling see e g petrova et al 2022 article impact statement legacy pollutants in fractured aquifers
