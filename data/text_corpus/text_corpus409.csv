2045,large groundwater level gwl data sets are often patchy with hydrographs containing continuous gaps and irregular measurement frequencies however most statistical time series analyses require regular observations thus hydrographs with larger gaps are routinely excluded from further analysis despite the loss of coverage and representativity of an initially large data set missing values can be filled in with different imputation methods yet the challenge is to assess the imputation performance of automated methods assessment of such methods tends to be carried out on randomly introduced missing values however large gwl data sets are commonly dominated by more complex patterns of missing values with longer contiguous gaps this study presents a new artificial gap introduction approach tgp typical gap patterns that improves our understanding of automated imputation performance by mimicking typical gap patterns found in regional scale groundwater hydrographs imputation performance of machine learning algorithm missforest and imputepca is then compared with commonly applied linear interpolation to prepare a gapless daily gwl data set for the baltic states estonia latvia lithuania we observed that imputation performance varies among different gap patterns and performance for all imputation algorithms declined when infilling previously unseen extremes and hydrographs influenced by groundwater abstraction further missforest algorithm substantially outperformed other methods when infilling contiguous gaps up to 2 5 years while linear interpolation performs similarly for short random gaps the tgp approach can be of use to assess the complexity of missing observation patterns in a data set and its value lies in assessing the performance of gap filling methods in a more realistic way thus the approach aids the appropriate selection of imputation methods a task not limited to groundwater level time series alone the study further provides insights into region specific data peculiarities that can assist groundwater analysis and modelling keywords time series missing values gap filling the baltic states droughts abstraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction assessment of groundwater resources at the regional scale is essential to sustainably manage transboundary aquifers and secure water supply kitterød et al 2022 wunsch et al 2021 the eu water framework directive requires member states to ensure good quantitative status of groundwater bodies by timely detection of negative trends posing a risk for resource depletion and deterioration of groundwater dependent ecosystems wfd 2000 groundwater level time series or hydrographs are fundamental to evaluate the dynamics of a groundwater system zaadnoordijk et al 2019 often the groundwater level data sets compiled at the regional scales are patchy and spatially unevenly distributed barthel et al 2021 groundwater hydrographs rarely have equal observation periods and frequencies and missing values are ubiquitous asgharinia and petroselli 2020 peterson et al 2017 the commonly required observation regularity is daily or weekly data e g haaf et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 therefore direct application of groundwater level time series in the further analysis is often hindered by the presence of gaps despite the omnipresent gaps and their negative impact on further usage of time series there are no standardized methods for the estimation of missing groundwater heads dwivedi et al 2022 also regional scale data sets are generally too large to infill gaps manually and individually therefore it is more common to apply one automated method to all time series the simplest approach is to remove any time series containing missing values e g nygren et al 2020 or those above a defined threshold e g heudorfer et al 2019 this approach is often justified by convenience e g to fulfil the requirement of statistical software packages that do not support missing values dax and zilberbrand 2017 emmanuel et al 2021 still removing all time series with missing values including gaps created during the correction process may lead to a significant reduction of initially large groundwater level data sets retike et al 2022 report that strict application of such an approach would lead to eightfold reduction of number of available time series from 612 to 76 groundwater hydrographs while haaf and barthel 2018 had to remove almost 90 of data from 4002 to 512 groundwater hydrographs wendt et al 2020 removed all time series having more than 6 months long gaps and it reduced the initial data set from 660 to 170 hydrographs to resolve this imputation methods are used a common technique in handling missing observations in a time series is summary statistic imputation that uses a single value such as mean mode or median obtained from the available observations to infill the missing values however this risks creating biases by introducing too many similar values pratama et al 2016 nevertheless summary statistic imputation is routinely used to treat large databases because of its simplicity e g asgharinia and petroselli 2020 even more common is linear interpolation for infilling relatively short gaps in groundwater level time series the average length of linearly interpolated gaps in groundwater hydrographs by lehr and lischeid 2020 is 24 3 days the maximum being 88 days likewise wunsch et al 2021 interpolate up to one month short sequences of missing data linearly sorensen et al 2021 use linear interpolation to infill equal to or less than 3 months long breaks given the slow response typically observed within the aquifers in drylands while wendt et al 2020 apply linear interpolation to fill less than 6 months long data gaps to sum up simple imputation methods like summary statistic imputation and linear interpolation from the last observation to the next remain attractive to fill relatively short gaps in groundwater hydrographs the interest in using machine learning techniques to infill missing groundwater levels has increased due to their ability to deal with complex data sets dax and zilberbrand 2017 dwivedi et al 2022 khedri et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 vu et al 2021 according to retike et al 2022 various gap patterns can be observed in national groundwater level databases such as short gaps around extremes due to well completion problems or longer contiguous gaps arising from malfunction or misplacement of automatic level loggers and due to changes in monitoring programmes for instance dwivedi et al 2022 observe that it is relatively simple to accurately impute gaps in groundwater hydrographs that are introduced at random but it is more challenging to infill contiguous gaps especially around extremes deep learning techniques have been applied to impute as long as 47 years long gaps in groundwater hydrographs using piezometers as predictors that share the same hydrogeological context and characteristics with varying accuracy rmse 0 07 m to 1 08 m vu et al 2021 oikonomou et al 2018 emphasize that infilling missing values in groundwater hydrographs become an extremely difficult task when observations have low temporal and spatial frequency and represent highly dynamic groundwater systems in such cases most conventional data imputation methods are expected to fail approaches exist that reconstruct groundwater levels using observations from nearby wells dwivedi et al 2022 or are supported with different types of auxiliary data such as earth observation data e g evans et al 2020 or physiographic controls haaf et al 2022 more advanced methods like missforest and imputepca may be more promising and have hardly been tested on groundwater level data sets the non parametric and iterative missforest method stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 is based on a random forest algorithm breiman 2001 and designed for imputation of missing values by using the entire data set instead of imputation of one time series at a time the approach has gained attention in several research fields including hydrology arriagada et al 2021 sidibe et al 2018 and hydrogeology naranjo fernández et al 2020 among the major advantages of the missforest method are automatic and unsupervised missing data imputations that do not require assumptions about data distribution nor need tuning parameters further the method is suitable for multivariate data sets with lots of missing data stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 multiple authors report that missforest outperforms some well known imputation methods such as mean nearest neighbour linear regression and parametric methods alsaber et al 2021 arriagada et al 2021 stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 waljee et al 2013 the computational and thus time demand of the missforest however is large feng et al 2014 tang and ishwaran 2017 another multiple imputation method is imputepca josse and husson 2016 initially designed to impute missing data to perform principal components methods on incomplete data sets the imputepca has been used in meteorology benahmed and houichi 2018 but so far has not been applied in hydrogeology the performance of imputation algorithms can be assessed by introducing artificial missing values and then comparing the results of imputed values versus the original measurements several approaches exist how to choose lengths and distribution for artificial gaps in time series garciarena and santana 2017 junninen et al 2004 often gaps are introduced at random with certain missing data percentages that can vary from 10 up to 90 of missingness in the data set dwivedi et al 2022 stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 yadav and roychoudhury 2018 for instance arriagada et al 2021 set thresholds that somewhat mimic the distribution of missing values in the raw data set afterwards the modelled values are compared to the original observations using various metrics e g root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse brakkee et al 2022 koch et al 2019 moriasi et al 2015 tao et al 2022 wang et al 2018 wunsch et al 2022 to understand how imputation methods perform with more erratic and longer gaps we present a new approach that introduces gaps that mimic typical gap patterns tgp found in regional scale data sets then we compare the performance of three data imputation methods missforest imputepca and linear interpolation through the evaluation of artificially introduced gaps with the proposed tgp and commonly applied random gap patterns rgp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania are located in north eastern europe the region is characterized by a humid temperate climate affected by the baltic sea to the west and the eurasian landmass to the east according to the köppen geiger classification areas closer to the baltic sea are attributed to the temperate oceanic climate cfb while the areas inland experience a warm summer humid continental climate dfb kottek et al 2006 the median annual average temperature ranges from 5 3 to 8 6 c precipitation from 566 to 770 mm year 1991 2020 e obs data set cornes et al 2018 the elevation varies from slightly below the sea level up to 318 m in the uplands the land surface topography is defined to a large extent by the repeated advances of the quaternary ice sheets and their meltwater streams and lakes kalm et al 2011 zelčs et al 2011 the region is characterized by distinct seasonality and negative temperatures with snow accumulation in the cold season during the springtime the first groundwater recharge maximum is driven by the snowmelt water infiltration while in the period from september to december the second recharge maximum results from increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration babre et al 2022 generally groundwater recharge takes place in the upland areas and discharges towards the baltic sea virbulis et al 2013 the baltic states are situated on the multi layered sedimentary baltic artesian basin bab with the thickness of sedimentary cover ranging from about 200 m in the north up to 6000 m in the south the bab comprises layers of clastic carbonatic and in places evaporite sedimentary rocks gently dipping from northeast to southwest the bab holds vast amounts of groundwater with distinct chemical composition the main aquifer systems used for water supply are formed of weakly cemented terrigenous and carbonate sedimentary rocks that fill the whole bab overlain by quaternary deposits mostly glacial glaciolacustrine glaciofluvial and marine sediments the aquifers are mostly confined while unconfined aquifers are found in quaternary sediments a comprehensive overview of the hydrogeological setting and groundwater quality in the study region can be found in kitterød et al 2022 2 2 data and overall workflow the workflow of this study see fig 1 was driven by the motivation to create gapless daily groundwater level time series for future research needs namely the identification of features controlling groundwater dynamics in the baltic states and groundwater responses rechange groundwater surface water interaction at the event scale e g using indices by heudorfer et al 2019 thus an effort was made to save as many wells as possible and to retain good spatial coverage the raw groundwater level data were requested from the national managing authorities the estonian environment agency latvian environment geology and meteorology centre and lithuanian geological survey groundwater level measurements from 465 wells with at least a single full month of daily observations were available for the period 2005 2021 the measurement frequency of the three data sets varied from daily lithuania to sub daily latvia estonia where the latter was downsampled to daily frequency combining the needs for adequate imputation performance assessment and future research the final workflow contains following steps 1 pretreatment of daily groundwater hydrographs step 1 in fig 1 was carried out according to retike et al 2022 approach by visually screening for errors and applying necessary corrections pretreatment was applied to all 465 groundwater level time series out of total 2 66 million level measurements 5 33 were deleted and 15 97 modified wells having anthropogenic influence e g trends due to groundwater abstraction as well as extreme drought episodes were retained in the data set retike et al 2022 2 selection of groundwater hydrographs according to the following constraints a temporal constraints identification of a period when most daily groundwater hydrographs are available for all three baltic states estonia latvia lithuania b missingness and spatial constraints this step involves identification of the maximum acceptable fraction of missing values in groundwater hydrographs that still can produce appropriate modelling results in combination with balancing the need for good spatial coverage of the wells 3 the artificial gaps step 3 in fig 1 were introduced as missing values at random random gap patterns rgp and as typical gap patterns tgp 4 artificial gaps were infilled step 4 in fig 1 using missforest imputepca and linear interpolation methods in 12 calculation setups summarized in table 1 5 imputation outcomes were assessed using nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and nrmse normalized root mean square error metrics step 5 in fig 1 by evaluating relationships between the performance of applied models 2 3 2 3 preparation of artificial gaps we clustered missing values in time series to identify the main gap patterns and their characteristics such as length of consecutive gaps or spatial location of gaps e g at the beginning end or middle which could be further used to introduce artificial gaps these groups mimic missing value patterns found in a particular data set these groups further called typical gap patterns tgp were identified in two steps firstly groundwater hydrographs were transformed into a binary series by coding missing values as 0 and non missing values as 1 then on the binary series tgp were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis hca with a binary distance measure the agnes function from r package cluster version 2 1 2 was used to carry out hca with ward linkage maechler et al 2021 murtagh and legendre 2014 ward 1963 each cluster consisted of a number of hydrographs and if more than half of hydrographs had missing values in the same day the whole day was treated as a missing value in a particular tgp random gap patterns were created from the data set with missingness rates of 10 20 30 40 and 50 using simple random sampling 2 4 imputation methods and procedure 2 4 1 the missforest algorithm the missforest algorithm stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 is based on a random forest rf algorithm where many decision trees are grown and averaged breiman 2001 simply speaking the algorithm uses donor hydrographs from the entire data set for target hydrograph imputation based on correlation of the non missing parts between target and donors then the gap in the target hydrograph is imputed through random forest regression based on all donor hydrographs initially missforest imputes all missing values with the target hydrographs mean value and then goes through all hydrographs with missing values starting from the one with the least gaps then a rf is built to predict the missing values each succeeding iteration builds a better model as previously imputed values are used as predictors for the next iteration the imputation procedure is repeated several times until a stop criterion or the pre defined number of iterations is met in this study the missforest was implemented using r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 and the missforest package version 1 5 stekhoven 2013 which permits to define parameters that are related to rf such as ntree number of trees to grow in each forest with 100 as a default number and mtry the number of variables randomly selected at each node to set up the split with the square of the number of variables as a default and more specific missforest parameters like maxiter maximum number of iterations to be performed if stopping criteria is not yet met with a default value of 10 we tested multiple combinations of ntree 10 and 100 and maxiter 1 and 10 see table 1 to account for linear trends and seasons new variables in addition to hydrographs were added c f evans et al 2020 day of the year month and unix time according to gwl observation date the missforest imputation experiments were run on a different number of cpu cores by parallelizing on variables while preserving comparable computation times 2 4 2 the imputepca algorithm the imputepca algorithm is a statistical imputation method that imputes missing values by iteratively performing principal component analysis pca on the data set in this study variables are daily groundwater level time series including the gaps the algorithm initially imputes missing observations with a mean value then pca is carried out that finds the best approximation of the original hydrographs to reduce the initial number of dimensions which explain most of the variability within the data set next a new prediction of the missing value is performed using the new dimensions and pca analysis is run again these steps are repeated until convergence i e when the difference between two successive iterations is below a defined threshold or at a predefined number of iterations before imputation the number of pca dimensions must be estimated josse and husson 2016 here the missmda r package was used to perform the imputepca and 3 principal components were chosen for imputation based on the estim ncppca output the same additional variables day of the year month and unix time were added as in missforest setup section 2 4 1 2 4 3 linear interpolation a commonly used linear interpolation method was applied to infill gaps in groundwater level times series linear interpolation imputed missing values by generating a straight line between two adjacent observations while missing values at the beginning or the end of a particular hydrograph were imputed by extrapolation of a constant value according to the first last observation 2 4 4 imputation procedure each cluster representing tgp was used to introduce gaps in the original groundwater hydrographs then missing values were imputed according to selected imputation methods the missforest and imputepca methods were applied for each groundwater hydrograph and each cluster separately thus resulting in a relatively large number of imputations linear interpolation however was performed for each cluster for all hydrographs at once the introduction of tgp gaps was carried out for all hydrographs except for the time series on which the gap pattern was created see section 2 2 because these time series already had gaps in the same locations and could not be used to evaluate imputation performance moreover groundwater hydrographs were excluded with more than 50 of missing values within the represented period of a particular cluster tgp to minimize the impacts of using too small data sets 2 5 model performance metrics the performance of data imputation methods was evaluated by comparing the filled hydrographs with the observed data this means that imputation was only evaluated for time series sections values that originally did not contain gaps at the locations that were imputed for evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used metrics were calculated using the hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2020 package in r 3 results 3 1 selected groundwater level time series the number of active groundwater level monitoring stations in the study area varied substantially between countries in lithuania automatic level loggers were deployed already in 2005 arustiene 2011 while in latvia retike et al 2022 and estonia the first automatic daily observations can be dated back to 2010 2011 fig 2 the number of available daily hydrographs for lithuania remained relatively constant through the last two decades if compared to latvia and estonia where the changes were more dynamic fig 2 the peaks can be explained by the deployment of new automatic level loggers while the sudden drops in observations most probably were due to various errors mainly logger malfunction and consequent data pretreatment as well the exclusion of wells from monitoring programmes retike et al 2022 it should be highlighted that abrupt drops at the end of the represented period see grey shading in fig 2 are associated with data gathering processes for this study and do not reflect the actual changes in the monitoring programmes we selected the period when daily hydrographs were available for all three countries simultaneously in a reasonable amount the selected period spanned from 1st january 2011 to 31st may 2019 covering 3073 days 8 4 years then the threshold of a minimum of 5 5 years of non missing values was set for the selected period that resulted in 283 hydrographs out of the initial 465 time series this criterion implies that up to 34 5 of the total length of time series were allowed to have missing values that could be either a continuous gap or a sum of several smaller gaps within the selected hydrographs consecutive lengths of missing values varied a lot most hydrographs contained consecutive missing values with the maximum length up to about 100 days while a significant part 20 of hydrographs had maximum consecutive missing values of more than 1 year length figure s1 in supplements however the average lengths of consecutive gaps within groundwater hydrographs were 55 2 days and a median was 27 8 days only 29 of the selected daily hydrographs had no missing values 3 2 introduction of artificial gaps 3 2 1 typical gap patterns tgp eleven distinct groups of gaps in groundwater hydrographs were identified through cluster analysis of the binary missing value series in the data set fig 3 a then the clustering results were generalized into tgp to be used for the simulation of artificial gaps in time series fig 3b after the generalization process cluster 1 10 each formed by 9 to 38 hydrographs see fig 3a had gaps while cluster 11 was characterized as gapless more detailed characteristics of each tgp can be found in the supplementary material table s1 3 2 2 random gap patterns rgp the maximum cumulative length of gaps in the final data set 283 hydrographs reached 1033 days or 33 6 of the total selected period while on average hydrographs typically contained 14 1 of missing values median value 11 29 therefore rgp gaps were introduced only to the 109 hydrographs that form the gapless cluster 11 fig 3 using five thresholds of missingness 10 20 30 40 and 50 based on the characteristics of the data set 3 3 imputation performance assessment 3 3 1 overall imputation performance in general the imputation of rgp performed better than the imputation of tgp fig 4 metrics showed similarly high performance for both linear interpolation and missforest algorithms when infilling rgp median nrmse 0 07 and 0 08 respectively median nse 0 99 for both in contrast the performance of the imputepca algorithm was less accurate and more dispersed median nrmse 0 56 nse 0 69 the imputation of tgp was more challenging for all imputation algorithms and showed lower metric scores the linear interpolation generally failed to impute missing values effectively median nrmse 1 14 nse 0 31 and its performance sharply declined if compared to infilling rgp on the contrary the imputepca algorithm demonstrated better performance compared to linear interpolation on tgp infilling median nrmse 0 85 nse 0 27 on average the missforest algorithm outperformed the linear interpolation and imputepca algorithms and regarding tgp showed the most satisfactory infilling results median nrmse 0 61 nse 0 63 however a proportion of hydrographs infilled by all algorithms including missforest showed extremely poor performance when imputing tgp reaching as low nse values as 1770 170 and 14 5 and as high nrmse as 3 9 13 1 and 41 9 for imputepca missforest and linear interpolation respectively 3 3 2 impact of individual gaps the imputation performance of models on infilling tgp is relatively consistent fig 5 overall the missforest algorithm outperformed imputepca and linear interpolation methods except for cluster 2 where missforest and linear interpolation achieved similarly high imputation accuracy with median nrmse below 0 28 and nse above 0 92 in cluster 2 there was less than 4 59 of missingness and the gaps were short 7 83 days on average and thus more like the results of rgp it was observed that all methods performed poorly on infilling relatively long continuous gaps 2 2 5 years located at the beginning of the hydrographs for instance in cluster 1 and 9 the missforest and imputepca shows one of their worst results median nrmse greater than 0 99 for imputepca and greater than 0 71 for missforest median nse for imputepca less than 0 02 and missforest less than 0 49 the same low performance can be seen with linear interpolation where gaps at the beginning or the end clusters 1 6 and 9 are imputed with a constant first or last value in the hydrograph in comparison the accuracy of infilling similarly long contiguous gaps 2 years not located at the ends of hydrographs cluster 3 was higher for missforest and imputepca methods median nrmse for missforest 0 58 for imputepca 0 74 median nse for missforest 0 66 for imputepca 0 45 with significantly lower scores for linear interpolation nse 0 05 nrmse 1 03 to sum up the missforest algorithm performed well at infilling missing values of various complexity short gaps continuous gaps and continuous gaps located in both ends of the time series according to metrics the imputepca often performed better than the linear interpolation e g in infilling continuous gaps but the variability of results was similarly high for both methods interestingly that imputepca performed substantially worse than linear interpolation in an apparently easy task such as infilling short gaps in cluster 2 3 3 3 effect of missforest parameter setups the four different parameter setups of missforest imputation we tested significantly affected the computational times see table 1 while the impacts on the imputation performance were negligible fig 6 for example tgp imputation of the computationally most demanding parameter setup maxiter 10 ntree 100 the default settings of missforest showed slightly improved performance compared to the weakest parameter setup maxiter 1 ntree 10 median nse 0 63 and 0 56 median nrmse 0 63 and 0 67 however the spent computational time differs 37 fold table 1 reducing ntree from 100 to 10 decreased the required computational time 7 to 9 fold while imputation performances are nearly the same median nse decrease 0 06 and 0 003 median nrmse rise 0 05 and 0 02 for tgp and rgp respectively similar results were observed when the default maxiter was reduced from 10 to 1 the computational time decreased by 5 to 6 fold while the impacts on the model performance were negligible median nse decreased by 0 01 and nrmse increased by 0 01 when imputing tgp but almost no changes in performance were observed when imputing rgp 3 4 imputation time analysis for linear interpolation imputation was performed for all hydrographs at once resulting in 10 iterations to impute all tgp one for each tgp and five iterations to impute the five rgp variants the missforest and imputepca methods required a single calculation for each tgp hydrograph pair in a way that artificial missing values were introduced only on the selected hydrograph as a result 2384 unique tgp hydrograph combinations were individually processed and imputed rgp imputation for the two methods was performed in the same manner but only on 109 hydrographs that form cluster 11 resulting in 545 unique rgp hydrograph combinations that were imputed for each model experiment table 1 the missforest imputation experiments were performed by using parallel processing natively implemented in the doparallel package parallelizing on variables imputepca experiments were parallelized by each tgp 10 steps or by each rgp instance 5 steps all imputations were performed on a high performance computing server equipped with intel xeon gold 5220r cpu imputation experiments were performed on a different number of cpus therefore computation times provided in table 1 represent cpu time and not the actual time i e the longest calculation with missforest using parameters maxiter 10 and ntree 100 for tgp imputation 2384 individual imputations took 392 47 cpu days but because of running on 48 parallel cpus the actual spent time was only 8 18 days that translates to 5 min per single imputation out of three imputation algorithms and tested experiments table 1 linear interpolation was the most rapid 10 to 22 s followed by imputepca 2 3 h for rgp imputation and 92 1 h for tgp imputation and the missforest algorithm which had a wide range of computation times depending on the experimental setups starting from 11 3 h for rgp imputation using simple model parameters up to 392 47 days for tgp imputation using default model parameters 4 discussion despite the numerous techniques present on how to handle missing values junninen et al 2004 yadav and roychoudhury 2018 researchers tend to assess imputation performance by introducing artificial gaps at random dwivedi et al 2022 gill et al 2007 stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 as it is straightforward fast and does not demand evaluation of the missingness patterns in the data set however our data set confirms the observation made in previous studies that missingness in time series data sets is dominated by salient gap patterns with larger gaps instead of random short gaps dwivedi et al 2022 oikonomou et al 2018 retike et al 2022 from 11 tgp characteristic for the baltic groundwater level data set only one could be attributed to the random like gaps cluster 2 with 18 on average 7 8 days long gaps the present study also confirms that random like gap patterns require less complex imputation methods to fill accordingly the imputation of hydrographs from cluster 2 achieved similarly good performance with linear interpolation and the missforest method fig 5 it is worth to highlight that groundwater level changes are often slow and consecutive changes between days can be small thus it is easy to fill short gaps using the linear interpolation dwivedi et al 2022 reported that even a simple interpolation method could accurately impute up to 90 of missing data in a two year long period if gaps are at random whereas the imputation of continuous gaps is much more challenging this is in line with our findings as the linear interpolation method failed to impute the rest of the tgp adequately in conclusion assessing imputation methods based on tgp improves our understanding of imputation method performance however model performance for tgp is not solely related to gap length fig 7 a shows a hydrograph with a long continuous gap 2 5 years located at the challenging position the beginning of the hydrograph and still showing good imputation performance while another hydrograph with a relatively shorter gap 126 days located in the middle of the hydrograph showed lower performance see fig 7b this could be due to the missingness of adequate i e characteristic to the hydrograph training data in a particular period since data driven models learn the relationships solely from the input data gill et al 2007 however at times the performance of models was unexpectedly poor even when infilling previously seen anomalies such as in fig 7b and the true reason behind inaccurate infilling remains unclear it should be remembered that the severity of gaps is a combination of how much data is missing the mechanisms of missingness and the patterns of missing values emmanuel et al 2021 kang 2013 not only the gap length itself when investigating method performance in individual time series methods generally fail around gaps that contain extremes as previously seen by e g dwivedi et al 2022 fig 8 illustrates examples from cluster 3 which contains a single continuous gap of 2 years from early 2017 to late 2018 the extremes are associated with a period of exceptionally severe drought episodes in europe hänsel et al 2022 moravec et al 2021 rakovec et al 2022 causing extreme groundwater droughts spanning to regional levels brakkee et al 2022 wunsch et al 2022 while the performance of missforest and imputepca was still satisfactory near peaks fig 8a the performance of models declined in case of more severe often previously unobserved extremes fig 8b probably as a result of untypical groundwater levels compared to the rest of the data set dwivedi et al 2022 therefore we advise taking caution when imputing periods of extremes independently of the imputation method in this study the data set used for imputation did not include pre selection constraints regarding anthropogenic influence on groundwater levels however intensive and continuous groundwater abstraction can cause deviations from expected groundwater level patterns affecting time series behaviour such as trends or shifts brakkee et al 2022 sorensen et al 2021 the groundwater hydrograph in fig 9 is located in the vicinity of liepāja latvia historically known to be affected by groundwater over abstraction bikše and retike 2018 pulido velazquez et al 2022 and illustrates the imputation performance in the presence of trends it can be observed that linear interpolation can occasionally outperform more advanced imputation techniques and accurately impute longer gaps maximum being 1 year in the hydrograph section with a rather stable trend fig 9a at the same time all three methods failed to handle shorter tgp at the end of the same hydrograph fig 9b probably due to sudden changes in the time series pattern dwivedi et al 2022 the evaluation of abstraction effects on time series is often limited by the absence of actual water usage data wendt et al 2020 including unregistered abstractions arriagada et al 2021 our study shows that poor imputation performance can be spatially linked to some documented cases of anthropogenically altered groundwater levels in baltic states kitterød et al 2022 klimas et al 2018 fig 10 most negative nse values are found near north eastern estonia where extensive oil shale mining has significantly changed the groundwater levels terasmaa et al 2020 poor model performance can be observed for hydrographs near all three capital cities of the baltic states tallinn riga and vilnius where groundwater is used as water supply kitterød et al 2022 klimas et al 2018 marandi and karro 2008 vallner and porman 2016 5 conclusions the present study demonstrates a new typical gap pattern tgp approach for assessing the performance of automated imputation methods considering the complexity of gap patterns in a data set thus aiding the selection of the most appropriate imputation method most studies evaluating the infilling performance of various methods use random gaps however gaps found in groundwater level time series occur rarely at random therefore an approach mimicking tgp found in daily groundwater hydrographs was developed this approach was used to introduce artificial gaps and perform a more realistic in depth evaluation of imputation method performance on patchy groundwater level data sets further three data imputation methods missforest imputepca and linear interpolation were compared to infill introduced tgp and commonly applied random gaps on a set of regional scale groundwater hydrographs of the baltic states overall the missforest algorithm significantly outperformed both linear interpolation and imputepca with tgp when infilling contiguous gaps up to 2 5 years often located near extremes and even at the beginning or end of the time series however with short random gaps 7 8 days on average the linear interpolation had as high imputation skill as missforest the missforest default setup was the most time demanding and only slightly improved the performance thus could be recommended for single imputation needs however for tgp or similar multiple imputation approaches weaker parameter setups can be justified we identified that in some cases low infilling performance arose due to previously unseen extremes such as the severe drought episode observed across europe in 2018 also poor imputation performance could be attributed to known locations of intensive groundwater abstractions like the capital cities of the baltic states tallinn riga and vilnius the proposed tgp approach affords imputation performance assessments higher granularity by systematically considering complex gap patterns and can be useful for large time series data sets beyond groundwater levels credit authorship contribution statement

2045,large groundwater level gwl data sets are often patchy with hydrographs containing continuous gaps and irregular measurement frequencies however most statistical time series analyses require regular observations thus hydrographs with larger gaps are routinely excluded from further analysis despite the loss of coverage and representativity of an initially large data set missing values can be filled in with different imputation methods yet the challenge is to assess the imputation performance of automated methods assessment of such methods tends to be carried out on randomly introduced missing values however large gwl data sets are commonly dominated by more complex patterns of missing values with longer contiguous gaps this study presents a new artificial gap introduction approach tgp typical gap patterns that improves our understanding of automated imputation performance by mimicking typical gap patterns found in regional scale groundwater hydrographs imputation performance of machine learning algorithm missforest and imputepca is then compared with commonly applied linear interpolation to prepare a gapless daily gwl data set for the baltic states estonia latvia lithuania we observed that imputation performance varies among different gap patterns and performance for all imputation algorithms declined when infilling previously unseen extremes and hydrographs influenced by groundwater abstraction further missforest algorithm substantially outperformed other methods when infilling contiguous gaps up to 2 5 years while linear interpolation performs similarly for short random gaps the tgp approach can be of use to assess the complexity of missing observation patterns in a data set and its value lies in assessing the performance of gap filling methods in a more realistic way thus the approach aids the appropriate selection of imputation methods a task not limited to groundwater level time series alone the study further provides insights into region specific data peculiarities that can assist groundwater analysis and modelling keywords time series missing values gap filling the baltic states droughts abstraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction assessment of groundwater resources at the regional scale is essential to sustainably manage transboundary aquifers and secure water supply kitterød et al 2022 wunsch et al 2021 the eu water framework directive requires member states to ensure good quantitative status of groundwater bodies by timely detection of negative trends posing a risk for resource depletion and deterioration of groundwater dependent ecosystems wfd 2000 groundwater level time series or hydrographs are fundamental to evaluate the dynamics of a groundwater system zaadnoordijk et al 2019 often the groundwater level data sets compiled at the regional scales are patchy and spatially unevenly distributed barthel et al 2021 groundwater hydrographs rarely have equal observation periods and frequencies and missing values are ubiquitous asgharinia and petroselli 2020 peterson et al 2017 the commonly required observation regularity is daily or weekly data e g haaf et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 therefore direct application of groundwater level time series in the further analysis is often hindered by the presence of gaps despite the omnipresent gaps and their negative impact on further usage of time series there are no standardized methods for the estimation of missing groundwater heads dwivedi et al 2022 also regional scale data sets are generally too large to infill gaps manually and individually therefore it is more common to apply one automated method to all time series the simplest approach is to remove any time series containing missing values e g nygren et al 2020 or those above a defined threshold e g heudorfer et al 2019 this approach is often justified by convenience e g to fulfil the requirement of statistical software packages that do not support missing values dax and zilberbrand 2017 emmanuel et al 2021 still removing all time series with missing values including gaps created during the correction process may lead to a significant reduction of initially large groundwater level data sets retike et al 2022 report that strict application of such an approach would lead to eightfold reduction of number of available time series from 612 to 76 groundwater hydrographs while haaf and barthel 2018 had to remove almost 90 of data from 4002 to 512 groundwater hydrographs wendt et al 2020 removed all time series having more than 6 months long gaps and it reduced the initial data set from 660 to 170 hydrographs to resolve this imputation methods are used a common technique in handling missing observations in a time series is summary statistic imputation that uses a single value such as mean mode or median obtained from the available observations to infill the missing values however this risks creating biases by introducing too many similar values pratama et al 2016 nevertheless summary statistic imputation is routinely used to treat large databases because of its simplicity e g asgharinia and petroselli 2020 even more common is linear interpolation for infilling relatively short gaps in groundwater level time series the average length of linearly interpolated gaps in groundwater hydrographs by lehr and lischeid 2020 is 24 3 days the maximum being 88 days likewise wunsch et al 2021 interpolate up to one month short sequences of missing data linearly sorensen et al 2021 use linear interpolation to infill equal to or less than 3 months long breaks given the slow response typically observed within the aquifers in drylands while wendt et al 2020 apply linear interpolation to fill less than 6 months long data gaps to sum up simple imputation methods like summary statistic imputation and linear interpolation from the last observation to the next remain attractive to fill relatively short gaps in groundwater hydrographs the interest in using machine learning techniques to infill missing groundwater levels has increased due to their ability to deal with complex data sets dax and zilberbrand 2017 dwivedi et al 2022 khedri et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 vu et al 2021 according to retike et al 2022 various gap patterns can be observed in national groundwater level databases such as short gaps around extremes due to well completion problems or longer contiguous gaps arising from malfunction or misplacement of automatic level loggers and due to changes in monitoring programmes for instance dwivedi et al 2022 observe that it is relatively simple to accurately impute gaps in groundwater hydrographs that are introduced at random but it is more challenging to infill contiguous gaps especially around extremes deep learning techniques have been applied to impute as long as 47 years long gaps in groundwater hydrographs using piezometers as predictors that share the same hydrogeological context and characteristics with varying accuracy rmse 0 07 m to 1 08 m vu et al 2021 oikonomou et al 2018 emphasize that infilling missing values in groundwater hydrographs become an extremely difficult task when observations have low temporal and spatial frequency and represent highly dynamic groundwater systems in such cases most conventional data imputation methods are expected to fail approaches exist that reconstruct groundwater levels using observations from nearby wells dwivedi et al 2022 or are supported with different types of auxiliary data such as earth observation data e g evans et al 2020 or physiographic controls haaf et al 2022 more advanced methods like missforest and imputepca may be more promising and have hardly been tested on groundwater level data sets the non parametric and iterative missforest method stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 is based on a random forest algorithm breiman 2001 and designed for imputation of missing values by using the entire data set instead of imputation of one time series at a time the approach has gained attention in several research fields including hydrology arriagada et al 2021 sidibe et al 2018 and hydrogeology naranjo fernández et al 2020 among the major advantages of the missforest method are automatic and unsupervised missing data imputations that do not require assumptions about data distribution nor need tuning parameters further the method is suitable for multivariate data sets with lots of missing data stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 multiple authors report that missforest outperforms some well known imputation methods such as mean nearest neighbour linear regression and parametric methods alsaber et al 2021 arriagada et al 2021 stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 waljee et al 2013 the computational and thus time demand of the missforest however is large feng et al 2014 tang and ishwaran 2017 another multiple imputation method is imputepca josse and husson 2016 initially designed to impute missing data to perform principal components methods on incomplete data sets the imputepca has been used in meteorology benahmed and houichi 2018 but so far has not been applied in hydrogeology the performance of imputation algorithms can be assessed by introducing artificial missing values and then comparing the results of imputed values versus the original measurements several approaches exist how to choose lengths and distribution for artificial gaps in time series garciarena and santana 2017 junninen et al 2004 often gaps are introduced at random with certain missing data percentages that can vary from 10 up to 90 of missingness in the data set dwivedi et al 2022 stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 yadav and roychoudhury 2018 for instance arriagada et al 2021 set thresholds that somewhat mimic the distribution of missing values in the raw data set afterwards the modelled values are compared to the original observations using various metrics e g root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse brakkee et al 2022 koch et al 2019 moriasi et al 2015 tao et al 2022 wang et al 2018 wunsch et al 2022 to understand how imputation methods perform with more erratic and longer gaps we present a new approach that introduces gaps that mimic typical gap patterns tgp found in regional scale data sets then we compare the performance of three data imputation methods missforest imputepca and linear interpolation through the evaluation of artificially introduced gaps with the proposed tgp and commonly applied random gap patterns rgp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania are located in north eastern europe the region is characterized by a humid temperate climate affected by the baltic sea to the west and the eurasian landmass to the east according to the köppen geiger classification areas closer to the baltic sea are attributed to the temperate oceanic climate cfb while the areas inland experience a warm summer humid continental climate dfb kottek et al 2006 the median annual average temperature ranges from 5 3 to 8 6 c precipitation from 566 to 770 mm year 1991 2020 e obs data set cornes et al 2018 the elevation varies from slightly below the sea level up to 318 m in the uplands the land surface topography is defined to a large extent by the repeated advances of the quaternary ice sheets and their meltwater streams and lakes kalm et al 2011 zelčs et al 2011 the region is characterized by distinct seasonality and negative temperatures with snow accumulation in the cold season during the springtime the first groundwater recharge maximum is driven by the snowmelt water infiltration while in the period from september to december the second recharge maximum results from increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration babre et al 2022 generally groundwater recharge takes place in the upland areas and discharges towards the baltic sea virbulis et al 2013 the baltic states are situated on the multi layered sedimentary baltic artesian basin bab with the thickness of sedimentary cover ranging from about 200 m in the north up to 6000 m in the south the bab comprises layers of clastic carbonatic and in places evaporite sedimentary rocks gently dipping from northeast to southwest the bab holds vast amounts of groundwater with distinct chemical composition the main aquifer systems used for water supply are formed of weakly cemented terrigenous and carbonate sedimentary rocks that fill the whole bab overlain by quaternary deposits mostly glacial glaciolacustrine glaciofluvial and marine sediments the aquifers are mostly confined while unconfined aquifers are found in quaternary sediments a comprehensive overview of the hydrogeological setting and groundwater quality in the study region can be found in kitterød et al 2022 2 2 data and overall workflow the workflow of this study see fig 1 was driven by the motivation to create gapless daily groundwater level time series for future research needs namely the identification of features controlling groundwater dynamics in the baltic states and groundwater responses rechange groundwater surface water interaction at the event scale e g using indices by heudorfer et al 2019 thus an effort was made to save as many wells as possible and to retain good spatial coverage the raw groundwater level data were requested from the national managing authorities the estonian environment agency latvian environment geology and meteorology centre and lithuanian geological survey groundwater level measurements from 465 wells with at least a single full month of daily observations were available for the period 2005 2021 the measurement frequency of the three data sets varied from daily lithuania to sub daily latvia estonia where the latter was downsampled to daily frequency combining the needs for adequate imputation performance assessment and future research the final workflow contains following steps 1 pretreatment of daily groundwater hydrographs step 1 in fig 1 was carried out according to retike et al 2022 approach by visually screening for errors and applying necessary corrections pretreatment was applied to all 465 groundwater level time series out of total 2 66 million level measurements 5 33 were deleted and 15 97 modified wells having anthropogenic influence e g trends due to groundwater abstraction as well as extreme drought episodes were retained in the data set retike et al 2022 2 selection of groundwater hydrographs according to the following constraints a temporal constraints identification of a period when most daily groundwater hydrographs are available for all three baltic states estonia latvia lithuania b missingness and spatial constraints this step involves identification of the maximum acceptable fraction of missing values in groundwater hydrographs that still can produce appropriate modelling results in combination with balancing the need for good spatial coverage of the wells 3 the artificial gaps step 3 in fig 1 were introduced as missing values at random random gap patterns rgp and as typical gap patterns tgp 4 artificial gaps were infilled step 4 in fig 1 using missforest imputepca and linear interpolation methods in 12 calculation setups summarized in table 1 5 imputation outcomes were assessed using nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and nrmse normalized root mean square error metrics step 5 in fig 1 by evaluating relationships between the performance of applied models 2 3 2 3 preparation of artificial gaps we clustered missing values in time series to identify the main gap patterns and their characteristics such as length of consecutive gaps or spatial location of gaps e g at the beginning end or middle which could be further used to introduce artificial gaps these groups mimic missing value patterns found in a particular data set these groups further called typical gap patterns tgp were identified in two steps firstly groundwater hydrographs were transformed into a binary series by coding missing values as 0 and non missing values as 1 then on the binary series tgp were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis hca with a binary distance measure the agnes function from r package cluster version 2 1 2 was used to carry out hca with ward linkage maechler et al 2021 murtagh and legendre 2014 ward 1963 each cluster consisted of a number of hydrographs and if more than half of hydrographs had missing values in the same day the whole day was treated as a missing value in a particular tgp random gap patterns were created from the data set with missingness rates of 10 20 30 40 and 50 using simple random sampling 2 4 imputation methods and procedure 2 4 1 the missforest algorithm the missforest algorithm stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 is based on a random forest rf algorithm where many decision trees are grown and averaged breiman 2001 simply speaking the algorithm uses donor hydrographs from the entire data set for target hydrograph imputation based on correlation of the non missing parts between target and donors then the gap in the target hydrograph is imputed through random forest regression based on all donor hydrographs initially missforest imputes all missing values with the target hydrographs mean value and then goes through all hydrographs with missing values starting from the one with the least gaps then a rf is built to predict the missing values each succeeding iteration builds a better model as previously imputed values are used as predictors for the next iteration the imputation procedure is repeated several times until a stop criterion or the pre defined number of iterations is met in this study the missforest was implemented using r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 and the missforest package version 1 5 stekhoven 2013 which permits to define parameters that are related to rf such as ntree number of trees to grow in each forest with 100 as a default number and mtry the number of variables randomly selected at each node to set up the split with the square of the number of variables as a default and more specific missforest parameters like maxiter maximum number of iterations to be performed if stopping criteria is not yet met with a default value of 10 we tested multiple combinations of ntree 10 and 100 and maxiter 1 and 10 see table 1 to account for linear trends and seasons new variables in addition to hydrographs were added c f evans et al 2020 day of the year month and unix time according to gwl observation date the missforest imputation experiments were run on a different number of cpu cores by parallelizing on variables while preserving comparable computation times 2 4 2 the imputepca algorithm the imputepca algorithm is a statistical imputation method that imputes missing values by iteratively performing principal component analysis pca on the data set in this study variables are daily groundwater level time series including the gaps the algorithm initially imputes missing observations with a mean value then pca is carried out that finds the best approximation of the original hydrographs to reduce the initial number of dimensions which explain most of the variability within the data set next a new prediction of the missing value is performed using the new dimensions and pca analysis is run again these steps are repeated until convergence i e when the difference between two successive iterations is below a defined threshold or at a predefined number of iterations before imputation the number of pca dimensions must be estimated josse and husson 2016 here the missmda r package was used to perform the imputepca and 3 principal components were chosen for imputation based on the estim ncppca output the same additional variables day of the year month and unix time were added as in missforest setup section 2 4 1 2 4 3 linear interpolation a commonly used linear interpolation method was applied to infill gaps in groundwater level times series linear interpolation imputed missing values by generating a straight line between two adjacent observations while missing values at the beginning or the end of a particular hydrograph were imputed by extrapolation of a constant value according to the first last observation 2 4 4 imputation procedure each cluster representing tgp was used to introduce gaps in the original groundwater hydrographs then missing values were imputed according to selected imputation methods the missforest and imputepca methods were applied for each groundwater hydrograph and each cluster separately thus resulting in a relatively large number of imputations linear interpolation however was performed for each cluster for all hydrographs at once the introduction of tgp gaps was carried out for all hydrographs except for the time series on which the gap pattern was created see section 2 2 because these time series already had gaps in the same locations and could not be used to evaluate imputation performance moreover groundwater hydrographs were excluded with more than 50 of missing values within the represented period of a particular cluster tgp to minimize the impacts of using too small data sets 2 5 model performance metrics the performance of data imputation methods was evaluated by comparing the filled hydrographs with the observed data this means that imputation was only evaluated for time series sections values that originally did not contain gaps at the locations that were imputed for evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used metrics were calculated using the hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2020 package in r 3 results 3 1 selected groundwater level time series the number of active groundwater level monitoring stations in the study area varied substantially between countries in lithuania automatic level loggers were deployed already in 2005 arustiene 2011 while in latvia retike et al 2022 and estonia the first automatic daily observations can be dated back to 2010 2011 fig 2 the number of available daily hydrographs for lithuania remained relatively constant through the last two decades if compared to latvia and estonia where the changes were more dynamic fig 2 the peaks can be explained by the deployment of new automatic level loggers while the sudden drops in observations most probably were due to various errors mainly logger malfunction and consequent data pretreatment as well the exclusion of wells from monitoring programmes retike et al 2022 it should be highlighted that abrupt drops at the end of the represented period see grey shading in fig 2 are associated with data gathering processes for this study and do not reflect the actual changes in the monitoring programmes we selected the period when daily hydrographs were available for all three countries simultaneously in a reasonable amount the selected period spanned from 1st january 2011 to 31st may 2019 covering 3073 days 8 4 years then the threshold of a minimum of 5 5 years of non missing values was set for the selected period that resulted in 283 hydrographs out of the initial 465 time series this criterion implies that up to 34 5 of the total length of time series were allowed to have missing values that could be either a continuous gap or a sum of several smaller gaps within the selected hydrographs consecutive lengths of missing values varied a lot most hydrographs contained consecutive missing values with the maximum length up to about 100 days while a significant part 20 of hydrographs had maximum consecutive missing values of more than 1 year length figure s1 in supplements however the average lengths of consecutive gaps within groundwater hydrographs were 55 2 days and a median was 27 8 days only 29 of the selected daily hydrographs had no missing values 3 2 introduction of artificial gaps 3 2 1 typical gap patterns tgp eleven distinct groups of gaps in groundwater hydrographs were identified through cluster analysis of the binary missing value series in the data set fig 3 a then the clustering results were generalized into tgp to be used for the simulation of artificial gaps in time series fig 3b after the generalization process cluster 1 10 each formed by 9 to 38 hydrographs see fig 3a had gaps while cluster 11 was characterized as gapless more detailed characteristics of each tgp can be found in the supplementary material table s1 3 2 2 random gap patterns rgp the maximum cumulative length of gaps in the final data set 283 hydrographs reached 1033 days or 33 6 of the total selected period while on average hydrographs typically contained 14 1 of missing values median value 11 29 therefore rgp gaps were introduced only to the 109 hydrographs that form the gapless cluster 11 fig 3 using five thresholds of missingness 10 20 30 40 and 50 based on the characteristics of the data set 3 3 imputation performance assessment 3 3 1 overall imputation performance in general the imputation of rgp performed better than the imputation of tgp fig 4 metrics showed similarly high performance for both linear interpolation and missforest algorithms when infilling rgp median nrmse 0 07 and 0 08 respectively median nse 0 99 for both in contrast the performance of the imputepca algorithm was less accurate and more dispersed median nrmse 0 56 nse 0 69 the imputation of tgp was more challenging for all imputation algorithms and showed lower metric scores the linear interpolation generally failed to impute missing values effectively median nrmse 1 14 nse 0 31 and its performance sharply declined if compared to infilling rgp on the contrary the imputepca algorithm demonstrated better performance compared to linear interpolation on tgp infilling median nrmse 0 85 nse 0 27 on average the missforest algorithm outperformed the linear interpolation and imputepca algorithms and regarding tgp showed the most satisfactory infilling results median nrmse 0 61 nse 0 63 however a proportion of hydrographs infilled by all algorithms including missforest showed extremely poor performance when imputing tgp reaching as low nse values as 1770 170 and 14 5 and as high nrmse as 3 9 13 1 and 41 9 for imputepca missforest and linear interpolation respectively 3 3 2 impact of individual gaps the imputation performance of models on infilling tgp is relatively consistent fig 5 overall the missforest algorithm outperformed imputepca and linear interpolation methods except for cluster 2 where missforest and linear interpolation achieved similarly high imputation accuracy with median nrmse below 0 28 and nse above 0 92 in cluster 2 there was less than 4 59 of missingness and the gaps were short 7 83 days on average and thus more like the results of rgp it was observed that all methods performed poorly on infilling relatively long continuous gaps 2 2 5 years located at the beginning of the hydrographs for instance in cluster 1 and 9 the missforest and imputepca shows one of their worst results median nrmse greater than 0 99 for imputepca and greater than 0 71 for missforest median nse for imputepca less than 0 02 and missforest less than 0 49 the same low performance can be seen with linear interpolation where gaps at the beginning or the end clusters 1 6 and 9 are imputed with a constant first or last value in the hydrograph in comparison the accuracy of infilling similarly long contiguous gaps 2 years not located at the ends of hydrographs cluster 3 was higher for missforest and imputepca methods median nrmse for missforest 0 58 for imputepca 0 74 median nse for missforest 0 66 for imputepca 0 45 with significantly lower scores for linear interpolation nse 0 05 nrmse 1 03 to sum up the missforest algorithm performed well at infilling missing values of various complexity short gaps continuous gaps and continuous gaps located in both ends of the time series according to metrics the imputepca often performed better than the linear interpolation e g in infilling continuous gaps but the variability of results was similarly high for both methods interestingly that imputepca performed substantially worse than linear interpolation in an apparently easy task such as infilling short gaps in cluster 2 3 3 3 effect of missforest parameter setups the four different parameter setups of missforest imputation we tested significantly affected the computational times see table 1 while the impacts on the imputation performance were negligible fig 6 for example tgp imputation of the computationally most demanding parameter setup maxiter 10 ntree 100 the default settings of missforest showed slightly improved performance compared to the weakest parameter setup maxiter 1 ntree 10 median nse 0 63 and 0 56 median nrmse 0 63 and 0 67 however the spent computational time differs 37 fold table 1 reducing ntree from 100 to 10 decreased the required computational time 7 to 9 fold while imputation performances are nearly the same median nse decrease 0 06 and 0 003 median nrmse rise 0 05 and 0 02 for tgp and rgp respectively similar results were observed when the default maxiter was reduced from 10 to 1 the computational time decreased by 5 to 6 fold while the impacts on the model performance were negligible median nse decreased by 0 01 and nrmse increased by 0 01 when imputing tgp but almost no changes in performance were observed when imputing rgp 3 4 imputation time analysis for linear interpolation imputation was performed for all hydrographs at once resulting in 10 iterations to impute all tgp one for each tgp and five iterations to impute the five rgp variants the missforest and imputepca methods required a single calculation for each tgp hydrograph pair in a way that artificial missing values were introduced only on the selected hydrograph as a result 2384 unique tgp hydrograph combinations were individually processed and imputed rgp imputation for the two methods was performed in the same manner but only on 109 hydrographs that form cluster 11 resulting in 545 unique rgp hydrograph combinations that were imputed for each model experiment table 1 the missforest imputation experiments were performed by using parallel processing natively implemented in the doparallel package parallelizing on variables imputepca experiments were parallelized by each tgp 10 steps or by each rgp instance 5 steps all imputations were performed on a high performance computing server equipped with intel xeon gold 5220r cpu imputation experiments were performed on a different number of cpus therefore computation times provided in table 1 represent cpu time and not the actual time i e the longest calculation with missforest using parameters maxiter 10 and ntree 100 for tgp imputation 2384 individual imputations took 392 47 cpu days but because of running on 48 parallel cpus the actual spent time was only 8 18 days that translates to 5 min per single imputation out of three imputation algorithms and tested experiments table 1 linear interpolation was the most rapid 10 to 22 s followed by imputepca 2 3 h for rgp imputation and 92 1 h for tgp imputation and the missforest algorithm which had a wide range of computation times depending on the experimental setups starting from 11 3 h for rgp imputation using simple model parameters up to 392 47 days for tgp imputation using default model parameters 4 discussion despite the numerous techniques present on how to handle missing values junninen et al 2004 yadav and roychoudhury 2018 researchers tend to assess imputation performance by introducing artificial gaps at random dwivedi et al 2022 gill et al 2007 stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 as it is straightforward fast and does not demand evaluation of the missingness patterns in the data set however our data set confirms the observation made in previous studies that missingness in time series data sets is dominated by salient gap patterns with larger gaps instead of random short gaps dwivedi et al 2022 oikonomou et al 2018 retike et al 2022 from 11 tgp characteristic for the baltic groundwater level data set only one could be attributed to the random like gaps cluster 2 with 18 on average 7 8 days long gaps the present study also confirms that random like gap patterns require less complex imputation methods to fill accordingly the imputation of hydrographs from cluster 2 achieved similarly good performance with linear interpolation and the missforest method fig 5 it is worth to highlight that groundwater level changes are often slow and consecutive changes between days can be small thus it is easy to fill short gaps using the linear interpolation dwivedi et al 2022 reported that even a simple interpolation method could accurately impute up to 90 of missing data in a two year long period if gaps are at random whereas the imputation of continuous gaps is much more challenging this is in line with our findings as the linear interpolation method failed to impute the rest of the tgp adequately in conclusion assessing imputation methods based on tgp improves our understanding of imputation method performance however model performance for tgp is not solely related to gap length fig 7 a shows a hydrograph with a long continuous gap 2 5 years located at the challenging position the beginning of the hydrograph and still showing good imputation performance while another hydrograph with a relatively shorter gap 126 days located in the middle of the hydrograph showed lower performance see fig 7b this could be due to the missingness of adequate i e characteristic to the hydrograph training data in a particular period since data driven models learn the relationships solely from the input data gill et al 2007 however at times the performance of models was unexpectedly poor even when infilling previously seen anomalies such as in fig 7b and the true reason behind inaccurate infilling remains unclear it should be remembered that the severity of gaps is a combination of how much data is missing the mechanisms of missingness and the patterns of missing values emmanuel et al 2021 kang 2013 not only the gap length itself when investigating method performance in individual time series methods generally fail around gaps that contain extremes as previously seen by e g dwivedi et al 2022 fig 8 illustrates examples from cluster 3 which contains a single continuous gap of 2 years from early 2017 to late 2018 the extremes are associated with a period of exceptionally severe drought episodes in europe hänsel et al 2022 moravec et al 2021 rakovec et al 2022 causing extreme groundwater droughts spanning to regional levels brakkee et al 2022 wunsch et al 2022 while the performance of missforest and imputepca was still satisfactory near peaks fig 8a the performance of models declined in case of more severe often previously unobserved extremes fig 8b probably as a result of untypical groundwater levels compared to the rest of the data set dwivedi et al 2022 therefore we advise taking caution when imputing periods of extremes independently of the imputation method in this study the data set used for imputation did not include pre selection constraints regarding anthropogenic influence on groundwater levels however intensive and continuous groundwater abstraction can cause deviations from expected groundwater level patterns affecting time series behaviour such as trends or shifts brakkee et al 2022 sorensen et al 2021 the groundwater hydrograph in fig 9 is located in the vicinity of liepāja latvia historically known to be affected by groundwater over abstraction bikše and retike 2018 pulido velazquez et al 2022 and illustrates the imputation performance in the presence of trends it can be observed that linear interpolation can occasionally outperform more advanced imputation techniques and accurately impute longer gaps maximum being 1 year in the hydrograph section with a rather stable trend fig 9a at the same time all three methods failed to handle shorter tgp at the end of the same hydrograph fig 9b probably due to sudden changes in the time series pattern dwivedi et al 2022 the evaluation of abstraction effects on time series is often limited by the absence of actual water usage data wendt et al 2020 including unregistered abstractions arriagada et al 2021 our study shows that poor imputation performance can be spatially linked to some documented cases of anthropogenically altered groundwater levels in baltic states kitterød et al 2022 klimas et al 2018 fig 10 most negative nse values are found near north eastern estonia where extensive oil shale mining has significantly changed the groundwater levels terasmaa et al 2020 poor model performance can be observed for hydrographs near all three capital cities of the baltic states tallinn riga and vilnius where groundwater is used as water supply kitterød et al 2022 klimas et al 2018 marandi and karro 2008 vallner and porman 2016 5 conclusions the present study demonstrates a new typical gap pattern tgp approach for assessing the performance of automated imputation methods considering the complexity of gap patterns in a data set thus aiding the selection of the most appropriate imputation method most studies evaluating the infilling performance of various methods use random gaps however gaps found in groundwater level time series occur rarely at random therefore an approach mimicking tgp found in daily groundwater hydrographs was developed this approach was used to introduce artificial gaps and perform a more realistic in depth evaluation of imputation method performance on patchy groundwater level data sets further three data imputation methods missforest imputepca and linear interpolation were compared to infill introduced tgp and commonly applied random gaps on a set of regional scale groundwater hydrographs of the baltic states overall the missforest algorithm significantly outperformed both linear interpolation and imputepca with tgp when infilling contiguous gaps up to 2 5 years often located near extremes and even at the beginning or end of the time series however with short random gaps 7 8 days on average the linear interpolation had as high imputation skill as missforest the missforest default setup was the most time demanding and only slightly improved the performance thus could be recommended for single imputation needs however for tgp or similar multiple imputation approaches weaker parameter setups can be justified we identified that in some cases low infilling performance arose due to previously unseen extremes such as the severe drought episode observed across europe in 2018 also poor imputation performance could be attributed to known locations of intensive groundwater abstractions like the capital cities of the baltic states tallinn riga and vilnius the proposed tgp approach affords imputation performance assessments higher granularity by systematically considering complex gap patterns and can be useful for large time series data sets beyond groundwater levels credit authorship contribution statement

2046,river health assessment rha is a robust methodology for ascertaining the health of riverine ecosystems and offering solutions for river conservation and management currently rha studies have been conducted mainly in mountainous and urban areas while investigations across mountain to urban transitions remain scarce and insufficient attention has been paid to rha under uncertain environments to systematically investigate the rha across mountain to urban transitions this study proposed pythagorean fuzzy cloud pfc via integrating the cloud model and pythagorean fuzzy sets topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution was expanded to the pfc environment to developed a novel pfc topsis model the hybrid framework was then created to handle rha with uncertainty and the pi river in china served as a case study results showed that the developed models broadened the capabilities of current techniques and offered a more efficient way for dealing with rha with uncertainty in pi river the health status showed considerable spatial heterogeneity upper reaches were markedly healthier than the lower reaches evaluation indicators were at unsatisfactory health levels with only 68 75 and 18 75 healthy attainment rates in the upper and lower reaches of pi river respectively meanwhile 68 75 of the sampling sites were subhealthy and 31 25 were unhealthy our research emphasizes that urban development agricultural practices and dam construction have affected river health in some areas and appropriate measures are needed to reduce their impacts in pi river

components of freshwater resources are inextricably linked to the natural environment human health and socioeconomic growth chen et al 2013 the united nations sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 is clean water and sanitation which strives to manage water resources wastewater and ecosystems in a sustainable manner roy and pramanick 2019 liu et al 2020 sdg 6 provides wider prospects for a broad focus on the conservation and restoration of rivers around the world zhu et al 2022 zhang and li 2020 ensuring river ecosystem health is essential for achieving sdg 6 chen et al 2015 singh and saxena 2018 the concept of river health was a topic of debate among researchers for many years with numerous descriptions and definitions put forth harmsworth et al 2011 deng et al 2015 when it comes to defining river health karr 1999 made a compelling argument for incorporating both human values and ecological integrity into the definition boulton 1999 extended the concept of river health by constructing an integrated framework incorporating ecological integrity and resilience goods and services as zhang et al 2021 suggest a healthy river is an ecosystem that can supply the demands of creatures involved and recover from natural disruptions similar to human health river health should include multiple dimensions and elements that depict each dimension river health assessment rha can be an effective means for recovering the health of river ecosystem offering a thorough diagnosis of river status at regional and global scales some countries such as the united states secchi and mcdonald 2019 canada monk et al 2018 australia grizzetti et al 2019 united kingdom boon et al 2020 new zealand clapcott et al 2020 south africa dalu and froneman 2016 and china xie et al 2020 have established rha related evaluation systems and criterions that make important contributions to sustainable river management rha may be regarded as the multi attribute decision making madm incorporating various key components such as aquatic life hydrology water quality and social functions zhang et al 2022a river ecosystem are complex ecosystems that possess both social service function and ecosystem integrity river health depends on the social and natural functions in river and various key components of river ecosystem health are also uncertain and volatile harrison et al 2008 various methods for assessing river health have been developed by the model attributes and river inherent characteristics previous research had employed a variety of methods including artificial neural network zhang et al 2018a fuzzy sets deng et al 2015 bayesian model marzin et al 2014 matter element model shan et al 2021 gray system theory wang et al 2019 set pair analysis wan et al 2021 projection pursuit zhang et al 2018b and topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution zhang et al 2022a these techniques proved to be efficient in evaluating the health of river ecosystems and contributed to numerous achievements however decision makers often face variable and uncertain environments when conducting rha generally the methods outlined previously are constrained to deterministic settings and uncertainties are either oversimplified or disregarded rha is inevitably uncertain due to the missing data different analysis methods and variable environments zhang et al 2021 this inherent uncertainty in rha makes the assessment process complex and leads to fuzzy and random outcomes deng et al 2015 fuzzy set theory effectively deals with fuzzy decision objects and their associated fuzzy concepts li and du 2007 madm with randomness can be handled appropriately using the cloud model yang et al 2020 topsis approach uses similarity to the ideal solution to effectively evaluate alternatives and is a powerful and widely used mcdm wan et al 2021 hence the combination of fuzzy sets topsis and cloud models can offer an effective approach for rha with randomness and fuzziness previous rha studies have yielded promising results in sustainable river management at regional and global scales nevertheless current approaches are constrained by deterministic environments and inputs and do not effectively address the rha under uncertain environments it is critical to build more effective models to reduce river health risks due to uncertainties furthermore current rha studies are executed mainly in mountainous and urban areas while rha across mountain to urban transitions are scarce to systematically investigate the rha across mountain to urban transitions this study proposed pythagorean fuzzy cloud pfc via integrating the cloud model and pythagorean fuzzy sets we extended the topsis method to the pfc environment and developed a new pfc topsis model the hybrid decision making framework was then created to handle rha with uncertainty this study differed from previous research on rha which focused mainly on mountainous and urban areas as it investigated rha across mountain to urban transitions the pi river in china served as a case study to explore the causes and driving mechanisms of river health in this study the major objectives are to i propose the pfc algorithm under uncertain environment ii develop a new pfc topsis approach to efficiently measure the riverine ecosystem health with uncertainty iii explore the geographic patterns and underlying drivers for river health across mountain to urban transitions and iv executed ecological restoration based on research results and the unique geographical features of pi river 2 study area and data 2 1 study area pi river flows through the upper reaches of huai river basin in china fig 1 the total length of pi river is about 253 km with a basin area of 5 569 4 km2 the southern part of pi river basin is located in the dabie mountains and the northern part is hills and depressions the percentages of mountainous hilly and depressions areas in the pi river basin are 72 17 and 11 respectively xu et al 2021a pi river basin is situated in the subtropical monsoon climate zone with abundant rainfall and mild climate the annual average temperature is 14 8 c yearly evaporation is 1 400 mm and yearly precipitation is 1 334 mm huang et al 2022 the upper reaches of pi river originate in the dabie mountains and consist of the east pi river and west pi river there are a length of 103 km in the east pi river and a watershed area of 2 697 km2 there are three large reservoirs in the east pi river namely mozitan bailianya and foziling reservoirs there are a length of 68 km in the west pi river and a watershed area of 1585 km2 the xianghongdian reservoir is built on the west pi river with a surface area of 1400 km2 and a total capacity of 2 632 billion m3 lu et al 2022 the east and west pi rivers merge into the lower reachers of pi river and eventually flow into the huai river the four reservoirs built in the upstream region have made important contributions to the basin in terms of agricultural irrigation hydroelectric power generation urban flood management and water supply additionally pi river basin has rich sand and gravel resources large scale sand mining activities occurred in the lower reaches of pi river since the 1990 s yang et al 2012 although the reservoir construction river sand mining and urban development generated considerable economic benefits they also caused serious damage to the ecological environment in the pi river basin forests and grasslands are mainly distributed in the upstream region fig 2 there is a concentration of croplands and urban built up areas in the downstream region which are more affected by anthropogenic activities pi river basin harbors an intricate ecological system arising from the unique geographical peculiarities and human disturbances investigating the health level of pi river can provide a guide for ecosystem protection of rivers that crosses mountain to urban transitions according to the geographical features ecological functions compatibility of sampling equipment and traffic accessibility sixteen sampling sites were established to determine the health levels of pi river fig 1 there were eight sampling sites s1 s8 in the upper reaches of pi river which were in the east pi river s1 s4 and the west pi river s5 s8 eight sampling sites s9 s16 were in the downstream region with 2 sampling sites s10 and s11 distributed in the urban area 2 2 indicator system to conduct a thorough examination of river health across mountain to urban transitions it was essential to pinpoint the key components of river ecosystem health and evaluate potential indicators for each component the selection of these evaluation indicators was informed by consulting with experts and reviewing previous studies yang and wang 2020 zhang et al 2021 2022a table 1 illustrates the evaluation indicator system of pi river that was constructed in this study to ensure sampling safety and convenience in study area we conducted field sampling of aquatic life during the flood season august to october 2021 hydrometeorological data was gathered between 2010 and 2020 while remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020 were acquired water samples in each sampling site were collected from the 1 m 0 5 m and surface water layers with sample totaling 50 l zhang et al 2022b samples collected were then filtered via a 25 µm filter screen to obtain 100 ml water samples we used 4 formaldehyde to fix the copepoda and cladocera and 1 5 lugol s solution to fix the rotifera and protozoa it was retrieved 30 ml supernatants following 48 h of sedimentation and stored at 4 c until used microscopy was used to identify the phytoplankton and zooplankton samples in the laboratory multiple river segments were sampled using seine nets and ichthyologists identified the fish samples based on their species age weight sex and length pont et al 2007 experienced observers used binoculars to survey waterbirds within visual range and record their numbers species and behaviors calculation procedures and evaluation standards of the indicator system constructed in this study were carefully explained in the river health assessment guidelines in china https leap unep org countries cn national legislation technical guideline river and lake health assessment 3 methods to minimize the effects of sampling methods and environmental factors on the precision of monitoring data the wavelet noise reduction technique was employed in current research to denoise the initial data this approach was used to minimize the random effects on the data and enhance its accuracy zhang et al 2022a as shown in fig 3 the reverse cloud generator and pythagorean fuzzy sets pfs utilized the pre processed sample data as inputs 2000 random cloud droplets were generated using the monte carlo algorithm to derive the cloud digital characteristics cdc in indicator samples and river health grades meanwhile the pythagorean fuzzy numbers pfn were obtained by taking into account the membership degree non membership degree and indeterminacy degree of both the samples and health grades the coupling of above pfn and cdc resulted in the creation of a novel pythagorean fuzzy cloud pfc we used the minimum deviation principle to calculate the combined weights for each evaluation indicator the integrated pythagorean fuzzy cloud ipfc for criteria and target levels was then obtained by bringing the pfc and its corresponding weights into the developed pfc integration algorithm a novel pfc topsis model was developed by extending topsis model to the pfc environment finally we obtained the comprehensive index ci of river health and determined river health status by ranking ci in view of this the river health across mountain to urban transitions was identified with full consideration of uncertainties ecological restoration and sustainable management for the pi river were carried out based on this study 3 1 cloud model supposing u is the universe set of sample data x x 1 x 2 x n and t is a qualitative concept in u x u is a random realization of t it satisfies x ñ e x e n 2 e n ñ e n h e 2 f x denotes the certainty degree that subordinates to the t and takes values in the range 0 f x 1 du et al 2020 it was expressed as follows 1 f x exp x e x 2 2 e n 2 where x is the sample data f x denotes the certainty degree e x and e n 2 are the expectation and variance of sample data x the normal cloud is defined as the probability distribution of the variable within u and a cloud droplet is expressed by x f x the cloud model utilizes its cdc denoted as e x e n h e to transform quantitative sample data into qualitative evaluation li et al 2020 e x presents the expectation distribution of cloud droplets reflecting the overall status of river health score liu et al 2023 e n measures the level of dispersion among cloud droplets which reflects the degree of uncertainty in rha h e is usually used to convey the uncertainty of e n ren et al 2018 so e x reflects the health level of pi river the higher its value the healthier the river is e n and h e reveal the randomness of river health and their larger values imply large uncertainty in the sample data the normal cloud model consisting of 2000 cloud droplets is shown in supplementary materials in this study the health status of pi river were classified into five grades and the corresponding health scores and cdc e x e n h e values were exhibited in table 2 the specific formula for cdc was shown below 2 e x u min u

dispersion coefficient for cloud droplets and this study set k as 0 1 ruan et al 2021 pre processed sample data x x 1 x 2 x n were fed into reverse cloud generator to compute the cdc values zhang et al 2022b specific procedure was as follows 3 e x 1 n i 1 n x i e n π 2 1 n i 1 n x i e x h e s 2 e n 2 i 1 2 n where x i denotes the health score of the i th evaluation sample s 2 1 n 1 i 1 n x i e x 2 3 2 pythagorean fuzzy sets pythagorean fuzzy sets pfs was designed by yager 2014 as an extension of conventional fuzzy sets to better address uncertainty issues supposing that the sample data for river health is x x 1 x 2 x n the pfs is denoted as follows 4 p x p μ x v x where p represents the pfs v x and μ x symbolize the non membership degree and membership degree v x and μ x satisfy 0 v x 1 0 μ x 1 and μ x 2 v x 2 1 π x denotes the indeterminacy degree that subordinates to p which can be calculated by 1 μ x 2 v x 2 the pythagorean fuzzy number pfn can be characterized as an ordered number pair μ x v x lin et al 2018 fig 4 depicts the three dimensional view of the pfn in this study each sample data x i in x x 1 x 2 x n was used to calculate its corresponding membership degree μ x i and non membership degree v x i the membership degree μ x and non membership degree v x of river health grades and indicator samples were then obtained according to eq 5 5 μ x i 1 n μ x i x i i 1 n x i v x i 1 n v x i x i i 1 n x i i 1 2 n where x i represents the health score of the i th evaluation sample and v x i and μ x i are the corresponding non membership degree and membership degree of x i and v x and μ x are the non membership degree and membership degree of river health grades and indicator samples specifically the larger μ x and smaller v x indicate that the evaluation sample is less fuzzy zhang et al 2022a 3 3 indicator weights to reduce the bias caused by the weights a combined weighting method was utilized in this study this method could combine the advantages of the information entropy ie and analytical hierarchy process ahp to obtain the combined weights liu et al 2019 supposing that the weights of evaluation samples determined by ahp are g g 1 g 2 g n weights generated by ie are h h 1 h 2 h n and the combined weights are w w 1 w 2 w n weight vectors were unitized as follows 6 g i g i g 1 2 g 2 2 g n 2 h i h i h 1 2 h 2 2 h n 2 w i w i w 1 2 w 2 2 w n 2 i 1 2 n this study obtained the weight vector w i using zhang and wang 2021 s research methodology and the specific formula was as follows 7 w i g i 2 h i 2 2 i 1 2 n the w i was then normalized to generate the combined weight w i with the following equation 8 w i w i i 1 n w i i 1 2 n the weights of evaluation indicators at pi river were shown in supplementary materials 3 4 integrated pythagorean fuzzy cloud in this study e x in the cloud model was expressed as pythagorean fuzzy number e x μ e x v e x and thus the definition of pythagorean fuzzy cloud was derived as c e x μ e x v e x e n h e the certainty degree of pfc was determined using the eq 9 9 f p x φ exp x e x 2 2 e n 2 where f p x denotes the certainty degree of pfc e x and e n 2 ane the expectation and variance of sample data x φ μ e x 1 v e x 2 is the pfc adjustment coefficient associated with the membership degree μ e x and non membership degree v e x the cloud diagram of pfc with 2000 cloud droplets was shown in fig 5 cloud diagrams of health grades were shown in supplementary materials assuming the arbitrary pfc is c i e xi μ e xi v e xi e ni h ei i 1 2 n and the corresponding cloud and weight vectors of the pfc are c c 1 c 2 c n and w w 1 w 2 w n respectively the following formulas were used to create the integrated pythagorean fuzzy cloud ipfc zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2022a 10 i p f c

topsis model assuming the arbitrary ipfc is i c i i e xi μ i e xi v i e xi i e ni i h ei i 1 2 n a novel pfc topsis model was developed by expanding topsis to the pfc environment using the topsis

value indicates a better health situation 4 results 4 1 pfc of evaluation indicators fig 6 illustrates the pfc of evaluation indicators e x describes the expected distribution of cloud droplets reflects the corresponding level of health score the river health level increases proportionally with the increase in e x value the general scores of evaluation indicators were west pi river east pi river lower reaches of pi river fig 6 the indicators c5 c9 c6 c11 and c10 exhibited low values for e x indicating poor health condition the fuzziness of river health increases as the membership degree μ decreases and the non membership degree v increases low μ and high v appeared in indicators c5 c9 c6 c11 and c10 meaning a large fuzziness the dispersion of cloud droplets indicated by e n is indicative of the randomness of representative cloud droplets e x the randomness in e x increases proportionally with the increase in e n value h e is usually used to convey the uncertainty of e n demonstrating the dispersion among cloud droplets the lower reaches of pi river had higher e n than the east and west pi rivers meaning that their indicator scores were more changeable and prone to considerable uncertainty 4 2 ipfc of criteria and target levels the e x values in criteria levels are as follows social services physical habitat water quantity and quality aquatic life fig 7 low e x values were found in aquatic life as well as water quantity and quality indicating poor health level existed the changes of the non membership and membership degrees were μ c μ b μ a μ d and v d v a v b v c meaning that the fuzziness were ranked as aquatic life water quantity and quality physical habitat social services furthermore the h e and e n in the lower reaches of pi river were visibly higher than the east and west pi rivers which implied that the criteria levels were prone to greater uncertainty in the downstream region similarly the lower reaches of pi river exhibited the greatest randomness in water quantity and quality fig 7b the lowest randomness occurred in social services in west pi river fig 7d this indicated that their cloud droplets had the largest and smallest dispersions respectively our study used the weighted integration of four criteria levels to gain the ipfc of target level fig 7e the health scores of the east and west pi rivers were higher than the lower reaches of pi river additionally a greater fuzziness and randomness existed in the lower reaches of pi river compared to the east and west pi rivers in general the health scores in criteria and target levels especially for aquatic life were unsatisfactory in terms of data stability and health scores the non ecological performance in pi river outperformed its ecosystem integrity 4 3 health condition of indicator criteria and target levels 4 3 1 health condition of indicator level health levels of indicators were determined in the east pi river with due consideration of the fuzziness and randomness in rha four indicators c2 c3 c16 and c7 belonged to the excellent level seven indicators c14 c8 c1 c15 c4 c12 and c13 were in healthy level c6 was in subhealthy level two indicators c11 and c9 were in unhealthy level and two indicators c10 and c5 were in sick level fig 8 a the ci values for c5 c10 c9 c11 and c6 were all lower than the health level of 0 413 suggesting that these indicators were in poor health in west pi river five indicators c14 c8 c1 c16 and c13 were excellent six indicators c2 c7 c12 c3 c4 and c15 were healthy c6 was subhealthy c11 was unhealthy and three indicators c5 c9 and c10 were sick fig 8b similar to the east pi river the west pi river had eleven indicators at healthy or excellent levels but still had five indicators with unsatisfactory health status a marked decline in the health levels of indicators was observed in the downstream region in comparison with the east and west pi rivers as shown in fig 8c three indicators c13 c14 and c16 were healthy eight indicators c1 c2 c3 c4 c7 c8 c12 and c15 were subhealthy two indicators c11 and c6 were unhealthy three indicators c5 c9 and c10 were sick and excellent indicators did not appear in general the evaluation indicators suggested that the health levels in the east and west pi rivers were relatively good with the exception of indicators c5 c9 c6 c11 and c10 in the downstream region only three indicators were healthy while the health condition of the remaining indicators were unsatisfactory as measured by evaluation indicators the healthy attainment rates was 68 75 in the upper reaches of pi river while the lower reaches was 18 75 4 3 2 health condition of criteria and target levels the east pi river had the following ci values social services 0 787 physical habitat 0 739 water quantity and quality 0 665 aquatic life 0 294 as shown in fig 9 a social services water quantity and quality and physical habitat were healthy however the condition of aquatic life was deemed to be unhealthy ci values decreased in the following order in the west pi river social services 0 896 physical habitat 0 795 water quantity and quality 0 606 aquatic life 0 280 fig 9b similar to the east pi river social services water quantity and quality and physical habitat were healthy in the west pi river however aquatic life remained unhealthy the ci values in the downstream region were social services 0 720 physical habitat 0 491 water quantity and quality 0 301 aquatic life 0 265 fig 9c water quantity and quality as well as physical habitat had a strong declining trend compared with the east and west pi rivers physical habitat declined from healthy to subhealthy in the downstream region there was a reduction from healthy to unhealthy in water quantity and quality the ci values in the target level were healthy 0 618 west pi river 0 602 east pi river 0 599 lower reaches of pi river 0 412 subhealthy 0 392 fig 9d a subhealthy level was observed in both the upper and lower reaches of pi river during the study period in general marked variances in health status were found in the social services aquatic life water quantity and quality and physical habitat social services and aquatic life had the best and poorest health condition respectively there was a better health status in non ecological performance than ecosystem integrity currently pi river was identified as subhealthy by integrating health status in four criteria levels 4 4 health condition of sampling sites sixteen sampling sites were selected to discover the health condition of pi river fig 10 displays the ipfc of each sampling site low e x values appeared in s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 implying poor health scores existed in these sampling sites meanwhile s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 showed low μ and high v suggesting that there large fuzziness eight sampling sites s9 s16 had high e n and h e values meaning that their e x had large uncertainties and the corresponding cloud droplets were more dispersed the above characteristics reflected that higher data instabilities and lower health scores occurred in the downstream region in comparison to the sampling sites at the east and west pi rivers fig 11 illustrates the spatial distribution of health condition at the 16 sampling sites five sampling sites s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 were unhealthy eleven sampling sites s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s12 and s13 were subhealthy the poorest health condition existed in sampling sites in the lower reaches of pi river overall the health status exhibited substantial geographical variability in pi river among all the sampling sites 31 25 five sampling sites were at an unhealthy level while the remaining 68 75 eleven sampling sites were at a subhealthy level 5 discussion 5 1 physical habitat in pi river the structural and morphological status was examined by physical habitat which encompassed four key factors river connectivity c1 riparian naturalness c2 land development c3 and natural wetland c4 table 1 the east and west pi rivers are located in mountainous areas and less disturbed by humans without large industrial enterprises xu et al 2021a huang et al 2022 in the east pi river it was discovered that c1 and c4 were healthy and c2 and c3 were excellent fig 8a in west pi river c1 was excellent and c2 c3 and c4 were healthy fig 8b the lower reaches of pi river have undergone considerable ecological changes over the last four decades due to rapid urbanization and large scale agricultural development lu et al 2022 human activities such as massive tree felling extensive wasteland reclamation and large scale river sand mining were carried out in the lower reaches of pi river the above mentioned unreasonable human activities increased soil erosion and caused an imbalanced ecosystem to some extent zhang et al 2011 meanwhile the operation of reservoirs in the upper reaches ensured urban water supply and provided irrigation water for the agricultural production in the lower reaches li et al 2021 in recent years extensive efforts were made to restore riparian areas and construct multiple rubber dams in the downstream region with the aim of managing and reducing urban flood inundation although the urban development agricultural production and water conservancy projects generated considerable economic benefits they also caused serious damage to the river ecosystem in the downstream region the ecological damage produced by irrational development patterns left the physical habitat still in a subhealthy level in the lower reaches of pi river overall health condition of physical habitat exhibited substantial spatial differences in pi river due to urban development agricultural production and water conservancy projects physical habitat was healthy in the east and west pi rivers whereas was subhealthy in the lower reaches feasible measures to enhance the physical habitat in pi river include mainly sustainable planning of urban construction and agricultural activities and optimization of water conservancy projects 5 2 water quantity and quality the evaluation of ecological resilience in pi river focused on both the quantity and quality of its water resources specifically this assessment encompassed various factors such as ecological flow satisfaction c5 water quantity mutation c6 water quality condition c7 and substrate contamination c8 table 1 the regulatory roles of upstream reservoirs are to i store water to ensure urban flood protection during the flood season and ii release water to maintain water supply agricultural production and ecological needs of pi river basin during the non flood season lu et al 2021 reservoir storages seriously affected the water quantity of pi river causing low health level in c5 and c6 fig 8 the east and west pi rivers had fewer human activities and better water quality generating healthy c7 and c8 due to the impacts of urban sewage discharge and agricultural pollution c7 and c8 in the lower pi river were subhealthy collectively water quantity and quality were healthy in the east and west pi rivers and unhealthy in the downstream region fig 9 reservoir construction had a greater influence on water quantity resulting in worse health scores for c5 and c6 the lower reaches of pi river were heavily influenced by urban sewage discharge and agricultural surface pollution with subhealthy c7 and c8 water quantity and quality conditions in the lower reaches were markedly worse compared with the upper reaches there are several potential improvements to the quantity and quality of water resources in pi river including the following i optimizing the sewage network and boosting the urban sewage treatment capacity ii strengthening the treatment of agricultural pollution and iii increasing the ecological flow to guarantee the water mobility and self purification capacity 5 3 aquatic life the biological diversity in pi river was appraised by aquatic life which encompassed four key factors phytoplankton c9 zooplankton c10 fish c11 and waterbird c12 table 1 aquatic life surveys were performed from august to october 2021 in this study the surveys revealed 153 species in eight phyla of phytoplankton in the pi river the algal phyla contained 17 species cyanobacteria 11 11 of the total 2 species chrysophyte 1 31 of the total 1 species xanthophyta 0 65 of the total 56 species bacillariophyta 36 60 of the total 13 species euglenophyta 8 50 of the total 55 species chlorophyta 35 95 of the total 3 species cryptophyta 1 96 of the total and 6 species dinophyta 3 92 of the total furthermore 71 species in four categories of zooplankton were identified in the pi river the zooplankton included 17 species protozoa 23 94 of the total 45 species rotifer 63 38 of the total 5 species cladocera 7 04 of the total and 4 species copepods 5 64 of the total in general the biomass and density of phytoplankton and zooplankton were higher downstream than upstream c9 and c10 were unhealthy and sick in pi river fig 8 during our field survey we found only 47 species of fish in the pi river in recent decades large scale dam construction and river sand mining led to serious degradation of fish stocks in the pi river wan et al 2017 due to the unique geographical position native fish were small and slow growing zhang et al 2017b found that the green sunfish have become invasive species in the pi river and posed a greater threat to native fish thus the fish was currently at an unhealthy level numerous waterbirds thrived in pi river basin due to the abundant habitats and favorable living condition offered by its wetlands in the east and west pi rivers waterbirds with abundant numbers and species were healthy during the evaluation period fig 8 in general aquatic life was unhealthy in pi river fig 9 c9 c10 and c11 did not reach healthy levels except c12 in the east and west pi rivers urban development dam construction river sand mining and invasive alien species posed a serious threat to aquatic life improving aquatic life in the pi river may require increasing ecological flows and suppressing invasive fish 5 4 social services a river is a complete ecosystem that provides social services for human life and production liu et al 2022 the social services in pi river were measured using four key factors flood protection c13 water supply c14 water resources development c15 and public satisfaction c16 at present both the downstream rubber dams and upstream reservoirs satisfied the needs of urban flood control xu et al 2021a in 2020 substantial improvements to embankments were also implemented on a large scale thus urban flood protection was compliant in pi river and c13 was healthy in addition the upstream reservoirs provided an adequate and high quality water supply for the downstream urban area huang et al 2022 therefore c14 was excellent and healthy urban construction has intensified the water resources development resulting in c15 transformed from healthy to subhealthy fig 8 to evaluate the degree of public satisfaction with the pi river watershed a total of 200 questionnaires were created and disseminated in this study zhang et al 2022a according to the poll the pi river basin was found to have a high level of public satisfaction and c16 has a satisfactory health condition in general the social services in pi river were in good condition fig 9 regional sustainable development depends on several key components such as water resource utilization water supply and flood prevention in the future a viable approach to enhancing the functions of social services would be the judicious exploitation of water resources in the downstream region 5 5 spatial distribution of river health fig 11 illustrates the spatial distribution of health condition at the 16 sampling sites the sampling sites in the east pi river s1 s2 s3 and s4 and the west pi river s5 s6 s7 and s8 were both at subhealthy levels considering the uncertainty during river health assessment process the east and west pi rivers were subhealthy fig 9d this was mainly due to the dam constructions in upper reaches damaged aquatic life and ecological flows markedly reducing the health status of river ecosystem three sampling sites s9 s12 and s13 in the lower reaches were subhealthy while five other sites s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 were determined to be in an unhealthy state furthermore s10 and s11 were in urban river sections and their aquatic life and physical habitat were greatly disturbed by urban development and sewage discharge s10 and s11 with the greatest fuzziness and randomness had the worst health levels s14 s15 and s16 were situated at the lowest reaches of pi river the following factors contributed to the regional heterogeneity in their health levels i domestic and agricultural pollution caused by urban development and large scale agricultural activities was accumulated here ii sediment from upstream was deposited and large scale sand mining was carried out in the areas around s14 s15 and s16 accordingly s14 s15 and s16 were unhealthy there were no excellent healthy and sick sampling sites in the pi river in the 16 sampling sites 11 was subhealthy accounting for 68 75 of the total and five were unhealthy representing 31 25 of the total meanwhile the health status of pi river showed considerable spatial heterogeneity the east and west pi rivers located in the upper reaches were remarkably healthier than the lower reaches due to the multiple impacts of dam construction urban development and agricultural activities the pi river was at a subhealthy level several measures must be taken to improve ecological flow control domestic and agricultural pollution and manage river sand mining to improve the health status of pi river 5 6 methodological advantages comparative studies were performed to determine the effectiveness of pfc topsis model for river health assessment fig 12 displays the comparative analysis of calculation results from topsis xu et al 2021b pythagorean fuzzy sets based on topsis pft lin et al 2018 normal cloud nc ruan et al 2021 integrated intuitionistic fuzzy cloud iifc zhang et al 2022a and pfc topsis models the calculation results of topsis model indicated that the transition from subhealthy to healthy occurred in s1 s5 and s6 and s14 was from unhealthy to subhealthy in comparion with pfc topsis model sampling sites s1 s5 and s14 showed a healthier level using the pft model health status in s1 and s5 were enhanced utilizing the nc model only the health status of s14 was improved with iifc the similarity between pfc topsis and topsis was 75 between pfc topsis and pft was 81 25 between pfc topsis and nc was 87 5 between pfc topsis and iifc was 93 75 the scope of decision may extend beyond the capabilities of models resulting in some bias in the outputs yao et al 2021 the results are overly optimistic since the topsis model fails to adequately incorporate the uncertainty from the data and decision making process zhang et al 2021 only fuzziness was examined in the pft model which will generate better health levels than the actual condition at sampling sites with significant randomness zhang et al 2022b although the nc technique contains the randomness of cloud model it does not involve fuzziness lu et al 2017 this will lead to biased results in sampling sites with greater fuzziness both the fuzziness and randomness were considered in iifc and pfc topsis models and the evaluation results are really close sampling site s14 was situated within the downstream section of the pi river and field surveys found that the health condition of its surrounding area was not satisfactory the pfc topsis model demonstrated superior capacity for handling rha with uncertainty than the iifc model and the results obtained were more consistent with the actual situation of pi river overall the results of rha might be overly positive without considering the randomness and fuzziness in fact there were inevitably uncertainty in rha due to the distraction from data sampling method and external environment a bias will existed in findings when these interference was not considered the pfc topsis developed in this study can overcome the limitations and broaden the capabilities in current techniques and offer a promising way to investigate rha with uncertainty 6 conclusion to systematically investigate the rha across mountain to urban transitions this study proposed a pfc algorithm by integrating the cloud model and pythagorean fuzzy sets a novel pfc topsis model was created by extending topsis to the pfc environment the hybrid framework was then developed to handle rha with uncertainty and the pi river in china served as a case study the main conclusions were as follows 1 the developed pfc topsis model could broaden the capabilities of current techniques and provide a more efficient way for dealing with rha with uncertainty 2 health condition of evaluation indicators was unsatisfactory with only 68 75 and 18 75 healthy attainment rates in the upper and lower reaches of pi river respectively 3 there were no excellent healthy and sick sampling sites in pi river among all the sampling sites 31 25 were unhealthy while the remaining 68 75 were subhealthy 4 the health status of pi river showed considerable spatial heterogeneity the east and west pi rivers located in the upper reaches were markedly healthier than the lower reaches due to the multiple impacts of dam construction urban development and agricultural activities the pi river was still subhealthy credit authorship contribution statement zhengxian zhang methodology software visualization writing original draft writing review editing yun

2046,river health assessment rha is a robust methodology for ascertaining the health of riverine ecosystems and offering solutions for river conservation and management currently rha studies have been conducted mainly in mountainous and urban areas while investigations across mountain to urban transitions remain scarce and insufficient attention has been paid to rha under uncertain environments to systematically investigate the rha across mountain to urban transitions this study proposed pythagorean fuzzy cloud pfc via integrating the cloud model and pythagorean fuzzy sets topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution was expanded to the pfc environment to developed a novel pfc topsis model the hybrid framework was then created to handle rha with uncertainty and the pi river in china served as a case study results showed that the developed models broadened the capabilities of current techniques and offered a more efficient way for dealing with rha with uncertainty in pi river the health status showed considerable spatial heterogeneity upper reaches were markedly healthier than the lower reaches evaluation indicators were at unsatisfactory health levels with only 68 75 and 18 75 healthy attainment rates in the upper and lower reaches of pi river respectively meanwhile 68 75 of the sampling sites were subhealthy and 31 25 were unhealthy our research emphasizes that urban development agricultural practices and dam construction have affected river health in some areas and appropriate measures are needed to reduce their impacts in pi river keywords ecological restoration river health pythagorean fuzzy sets cloud model pythagorean fuzzy cloud data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers important components of freshwater resources are inextricably linked to the natural environment human health and socioeconomic growth chen et al 2013 the united nations sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 is

focus on the conservation and restoration of rivers around the world zhu et al 2022 zhang and li 2020 ensuring river ecosystem health is essential for achieving sdg 6 chen et al 2015 singh and saxena 2018 the concept of river health was a topic of debate among researchers for many years with numerous descriptions and definitions put forth harmsworth et al 2011 deng et al 2015 when it comes to defining river health karr 1999 made a compelling argument for incorporating both human values and ecological integrity into the definition boulton 1999 extended the concept of river health by constructing an integrated framework incorporating ecological integrity and resilience goods and services as zhang et al 2021 suggest a healthy river is an ecosystem that can supply the demands of creatures involved and recover from natural disruptions similar to human health river health should include multiple dimensions and elements that depict each dimension river health assessment rha can be an effective means for recovering the health of river ecosystem offering a thorough diagnosis of river status at regional and global scales some countries such as the united states secchi and mcdonald 2019 canada monk et al 2018 australia grizzetti et al 2019 united kingdom boon et al 2020 new zealand clapcott et al 2020 south africa dalu and froneman 2016 and china xie et al 2020 have established rha related evaluation systems and criterions that make important contributions to sustainable river management rha may be regarded as the multi attribute decision making madm incorporating various key components such as aquatic life hydrology water quality and social functions zhang et al 2022a river ecosystem are complex ecosystems that possess both social service function and ecosystem integrity river health depends on the social and natural functions in river and various key components of river ecosystem health are also uncertain and volatile harrison et al 2008 various methods for assessing river health have been developed by the model attributes and river inherent characteristics previous research had employed a variety of methods including artificial neural network zhang et al 2018a fuzzy sets deng et al 2015 bayesian model marzin et al 2014 matter element model shan et al 2021 gray system theory wang et al 2019 set pair analysis wan et al 2021 projection pursuit zhang et al 2018b and topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution zhang et al 2022a these techniques proved to be efficient in evaluating the health of river ecosystems and contributed to numerous achievements however decision makers often face variable and uncertain environments when conducting rha generally the methods outlined previously are constrained to deterministic settings and uncertainties are either oversimplified or disregarded rha is inevitably uncertain due to the missing data different analysis methods and variable environments zhang et al 2021 this inherent uncertainty in rha makes the assessment process complex and leads to fuzzy and random outcomes deng et al 2015 fuzzy set theory effectively deals with fuzzy decision objects and their associated fuzzy concepts li and du 2007 madm with randomness can be handled appropriately using the cloud model yang et al 2020 topsis approach uses similarity to the ideal solution to effectively evaluate alternatives and is a powerful and widely used mcdm wan et al 2021 hence the combination of fuzzy sets topsis and cloud models can offer an effective approach for rha with randomness and fuzziness previous rha studies have yielded promising results in sustainable river management at regional and global scales nevertheless current approaches are constrained by deterministic environments and inputs and do not effectively address the rha under uncertain environments it is critical to build more effective models to reduce river health risks due to uncertainties furthermore current rha studies are executed mainly in mountainous and urban areas while rha across mountain to urban transitions are scarce to systematically investigate the rha across mountain to urban transitions this study proposed pythagorean fuzzy cloud pfc via integrating the cloud model and pythagorean fuzzy sets we extended the topsis method to the pfc environment and developed a new pfc topsis model the hybrid decision making framework was then created to handle rha with uncertainty this study differed from previous research on rha which focused mainly on mountainous and urban areas as it investigated rha across mountain to urban transitions the pi river in china served as a case study to explore the causes and driving mechanisms of river health in this study the major objectives are to i propose the pfc algorithm under uncertain environment ii develop a new pfc topsis approach to efficiently measure the riverine ecosystem health with uncertainty iii explore the geographic patterns and underlying drivers for river health across mountain to urban transitions and iv executed ecological restoration based on research results and the unique geographical features of pi river 2 study area and data 2 1 study area pi river flows through the upper reaches of huai river basin in china fig 1 the total length of pi river is about 253 km with a basin area of 5 569 4 km2 the southern part of pi river basin is located in the dabie mountains and the northern part is hills and depressions the percentages of mountainous hilly and depressions areas in the pi river basin are 72 17 and 11 respectively xu et al 2021a pi river basin is situated in the subtropical monsoon climate zone with abundant rainfall and mild climate the annual average temperature is 14 8 c yearly evaporation is 1 400 mm and yearly precipitation is 1 334 mm huang et al 2022 the upper reaches of pi river originate in the dabie mountains and consist of the east pi river and west pi river there are a length of 103 km in the east pi river and a watershed area of 2 697 km2 there are three large reservoirs in the east pi river namely mozitan bailianya and foziling reservoirs there are a length of 68 km in the west pi river and a watershed area of 1585 km2 the xianghongdian reservoir is built on the west pi river with a surface area of 1400 km2 and a total capacity of 2 632 billion m3 lu et al 2022 the east and west pi rivers merge into the lower reachers of pi river and eventually flow into the huai river the four reservoirs built in the upstream region have made important contributions to the basin in terms of agricultural irrigation hydroelectric power generation urban flood management and water supply additionally pi river basin has rich sand and gravel resources large scale sand mining activities occurred in the lower reaches of pi river since the 1990 s yang et al 2012 although the reservoir construction river sand mining and urban development generated considerable economic benefits they also caused serious damage to the ecological environment in the pi river basin forests and grasslands are mainly distributed in the upstream region fig 2 there is a concentration of croplands and urban built up areas in the downstream region which are more affected by anthropogenic activities pi river basin harbors an intricate ecological system arising from the unique geographical peculiarities and human disturbances investigating the health level of pi river can provide a guide for ecosystem protection of rivers that crosses mountain to urban transitions according to the geographical features ecological functions compatibility of sampling equipment and traffic accessibility sixteen sampling sites were established to determine the health levels of pi river fig 1 there were eight sampling sites s1 s8 in the upper reaches of pi river which were in the east pi river s1 s4 and the west pi river s5 s8 eight sampling sites s9 s16 were in the downstream region with 2 sampling sites s10 and s11 distributed in the urban area 2 2 indicator system to conduct a thorough examination of river health across mountain to urban transitions it was essential to pinpoint the key components of river ecosystem health and evaluate potential indicators for each component the selection of these evaluation indicators was informed by consulting with experts and reviewing previous studies yang and wang 2020 zhang et al 2021 2022a table 1 illustrates the evaluation indicator system of pi river that was constructed in this study to ensure sampling safety and convenience in study area we conducted field sampling of aquatic life during the flood season august to october 2021 hydrometeorological data was gathered between 2010 and 2020 while remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020 were acquired water samples in each sampling site were collected from the 1 m 0 5 m and surface water layers with sample totaling 50 l zhang et al 2022b samples collected were then filtered via a 25 µm filter screen to obtain 100 ml water samples we used 4 formaldehyde to fix the copepoda and cladocera and 1 5 lugol s solution to fix the rotifera and protozoa it was retrieved 30 ml supernatants following 48 h of sedimentation and stored at 4 c until used microscopy was used to identify the phytoplankton and zooplankton samples in the laboratory multiple river segments were sampled using seine nets and ichthyologists identified the fish samples based on their species age weight sex and length pont et al 2007 experienced observers used binoculars to survey waterbirds within visual range and record their numbers species and behaviors calculation procedures and evaluation standards of the indicator system constructed in this study were carefully explained in the river health assessment guidelines in china https leap unep org countries cn national legislation technical guideline river and lake health assessment 3 methods to minimize the effects of sampling methods and environmental factors on the precision of monitoring data the wavelet noise reduction technique was employed in current research to denoise the initial data this approach was used to minimize the random effects on the data and enhance its accuracy zhang et al 2022a as shown in fig 3 the reverse cloud generator and pythagorean fuzzy sets pfs utilized the pre processed sample data as inputs 2000 random cloud droplets were generated using the monte carlo algorithm to derive the cloud digital characteristics cdc in indicator samples and river health grades meanwhile the pythagorean fuzzy numbers pfn were obtained by taking into account the membership degree non membership degree and indeterminacy degree of both the samples and health grades the coupling of above pfn and cdc resulted in the creation of a novel pythagorean fuzzy cloud pfc we used the minimum deviation principle to calculate the combined weights for each evaluation indicator the integrated pythagorean fuzzy cloud ipfc for criteria and target levels was then obtained by bringing the pfc and its corresponding weights into the developed pfc integration algorithm a novel pfc topsis model was developed by extending topsis model to the pfc environment finally we obtained the comprehensive index ci of river health and determined river health status by ranking ci in view of this the river health across mountain to urban transitions was identified with full consideration of uncertainties ecological restoration and sustainable management for the pi river were carried out based on this study 3 1 cloud model supposing u is the universe set of sample data x x 1 x 2 x n and t is a qualitative concept in u x u is a random realization of t it satisfies x ñ e x e n 2 e n ñ e n h e 2 f x denotes the certainty degree that subordinates to the t and takes values in the range 0 f x 1 du et al 2020 it was expressed as follows 1 f x exp x e x 2 2 e n 2 where x is the sample data f x denotes the certainty degree e x and e n 2 are the expectation and variance of sample data x the normal cloud is defined as the probability distribution of the variable within u and a cloud droplet is expressed by x f x the cloud model utilizes its cdc denoted as e x e n h e to transform quantitative sample data into qualitative evaluation li et al 2020 e x presents the expectation distribution of cloud droplets reflecting the overall status of river health score liu et al 2023 e n measures the level of dispersion among cloud droplets which reflects the degree of uncertainty in rha h e is usually used to convey the uncertainty of e n ren et al 2018 so e x reflects the health level of pi river the higher its value the healthier the river is e n and h e reveal the randomness of river health and their larger values imply large uncertainty in the sample data the normal cloud model consisting of 2000 cloud droplets is shown in supplementary materials in this study the health status of pi river were classified into five grades and the corresponding health scores and cdc e x e n h e values were exhibited in table 2 the specific formula for cdc was shown below 2 e x u min u

dispersion coefficient for cloud droplets and this study set k as 0 1 ruan et al 2021 pre processed sample data x x 1 x 2 x n were fed into reverse cloud generator to compute the cdc values zhang et al 2022b specific procedure was as follows 3 e x 1 n i 1 n x i e n π 2 1 n i 1 n x i e x h e s 2 e n 2 i 1 2 n where x i denotes the health score of the i th evaluation sample s 2 1 n 1 i 1 n x i e x 2 3 2 pythagorean fuzzy sets pythagorean fuzzy sets pfs was designed by yager 2014 as an extension of conventional fuzzy sets to better address uncertainty issues supposing that the sample data for river health is x x 1 x 2 x n the pfs is denoted as follows 4 p x p μ x v x where p represents the pfs v x and μ x symbolize the non membership degree and membership degree v x and μ x satisfy 0 v x 1 0 μ x 1 and μ x 2 v x 2 1 π x denotes the indeterminacy degree that subordinates to p which can be calculated by 1 μ x 2 v x 2 the pythagorean fuzzy number pfn can be characterized as an ordered number pair μ x v x lin et al 2018 fig 4 depicts the three dimensional view of the pfn in this study each sample data x i in x x 1 x 2 x n was used to calculate its corresponding membership degree μ x i and non membership degree v x i the membership degree μ x and non membership degree v x of river health grades and indicator samples were then obtained according to eq 5 5 μ x i 1 n μ x i x i i 1 n x i v x i 1 n v x i x i i 1 n x i i 1 2 n where x i represents the health score of the i th evaluation sample and v x i and μ x i are the corresponding non membership degree and membership degree of x i and v x and μ x are the non membership degree and membership degree of river health grades and indicator samples specifically the larger μ x and smaller v x indicate that the evaluation sample is less fuzzy zhang et al 2022a 3 3 indicator weights to reduce the bias caused by the weights a combined weighting method was utilized in this study this method could combine the advantages of the information entropy ie and analytical hierarchy process ahp to obtain the combined weights liu et al 2019 supposing that the weights of evaluation samples determined by ahp are g g 1 g 2 g n weights generated by ie are h h 1 h 2 h n and the combined weights are w w 1 w 2 w n weight vectors were unitized as follows 6 g i g i g 1 2 g 2 2 g n 2 h i h i h 1 2 h 2 2 h n 2 w i w i w 1 2 w 2 2 w n 2 i 1 2 n this study obtained the weight vector w i using zhang and wang 2021 s research methodology and the specific formula was as follows 7 w i g i 2 h i 2 2 i 1 2 n the w i was then normalized to generate the combined weight w i with the following equation 8 w i w i i 1 n w i i 1 2 n the weights of evaluation indicators at pi river were shown in supplementary materials 3 4 integrated pythagorean fuzzy cloud in this study e x in the cloud model was expressed as pythagorean fuzzy number e x μ e x v e x and thus the definition of pythagorean fuzzy cloud was derived as c e x μ e x v e

sample data x φ μ e x 1 v e x 2 is the pfc adjustment coefficient associated with the membership degree μ e x and non membership degree v e x the cloud diagram of pfc with 2000 cloud droplets was shown in fig 5 cloud diagrams of health grades were shown in supplementary materials assuming the arbitrary pfc is c i e xi μ e xi v e xi e ni h ei i 1 2 n and the corresponding cloud and weight vectors of the pfc are c c 1 c 2 c n and w w 1 w 2 w n respectively the following formulas were used to create the integrated pythagorean fuzzy cloud ipfc zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2022a 10 i p f c

reflects the corresponding level of health score the river health level increases proportionally with the increase in e x value the general scores of evaluation indicators were west pi river east pi river lower reaches of pi river fig 6 the indicators c5 c9 c6 c11 and c10 exhibited low values for e x indicating poor health condition the fuzziness of river health increases as the membership degree μ decreases and the non membership degree v increases low μ and high v appeared in indicators c5 c9 c6 c11 and c10 meaning a large fuzziness the dispersion of cloud droplets indicated by e n is indicative of the randomness of representative cloud droplets e x the randomness in e x increases proportionally with the increase in e n value h e is usually used to convey the uncertainty of e n demonstrating the dispersion among cloud droplets the lower reaches of pi river had higher e n than the east and west pi rivers meaning that their indicator scores were more changeable and prone to considerable uncertainty 4 2 ipfc of criteria and target levels the e x values in criteria levels are as follows social services physical habitat water quantity and quality aquatic life fig 7 low e x values were found in aquatic life as well as water quantity and quality indicating poor health level existed the changes of the non membership and membership degrees were μ c μ b μ a μ d and v d v a v b v c meaning that the fuzziness were ranked as aquatic life water quantity and quality physical habitat social services furthermore the h e and e n in the lower reaches of pi river were visibly higher than the east and west pi rivers which implied that the criteria levels were prone to greater uncertainty in the downstream region similarly the lower reaches of pi river exhibited the greatest randomness in water quantity and quality fig 7b the lowest randomness occurred in social services in west pi river fig 7d this indicated that their cloud droplets had the largest and smallest dispersions respectively our study used the weighted integration of four criteria levels to gain the ipfc of target level fig 7e the health scores of the east and west pi rivers were higher than the lower reaches of pi river additionally a greater fuzziness and randomness existed in the lower reaches of pi river compared to the east and west pi rivers in general the health scores in criteria and target levels especially for aquatic life were unsatisfactory in terms of data stability and health scores the non ecological performance in pi river outperformed its ecosystem integrity 4 3 health condition of indicator criteria and target levels 4 3 1 health condition of indicator level health levels of indicators were determined in the east pi river with due consideration of the fuzziness and randomness in rha four indicators c2 c3 c16 and c7 belonged to the excellent level seven indicators c14 c8 c1 c15 c4 c12 and c13 were in healthy level c6 was in subhealthy level two indicators c11 and c9 were in unhealthy level and two indicators c10 and c5 were in sick level fig 8 a the ci values for c5 c10 c9 c11 and c6 were all lower than the health level of 0 413 suggesting that these indicators were in poor health in west pi river five indicators c14 c8 c1 c16 and c13 were excellent six indicators c2 c7 c12 c3 c4 and c15 were healthy c6 was subhealthy c11 was unhealthy and three indicators c5 c9 and c10 were sick fig 8b similar to the east pi river the west pi river had eleven indicators at healthy or excellent levels but still had five indicators with unsatisfactory health status a marked decline in the health levels of indicators was observed in the downstream region in comparison with the east and west pi rivers as shown in fig 8c three indicators c13 c14 and c16 were healthy eight indicators c1 c2 c3 c4 c7 c8 c12 and c15 were subhealthy two indicators c11 and c6 were unhealthy three indicators c5 c9 and c10 were sick and excellent indicators did not appear in general the evaluation indicators suggested that the health levels in the east and west pi rivers were relatively good with the exception of indicators c5 c9 c6 c11 and c10 in the downstream region only three indicators were healthy while the health condition of the remaining indicators were unsatisfactory as measured by evaluation indicators the healthy attainment rates was 68 75 in the upper reaches of pi river while the lower reaches was 18 75 4 3 2 health condition of criteria and target levels the east pi river had the following ci values social services 0 787 physical habitat 0 739 water quantity and quality 0 665 aquatic life 0 294 as shown in fig 9 a social services water quantity and quality and physical habitat were healthy however the condition of aquatic life was deemed to be unhealthy ci values decreased in the following order in the west pi river social services 0 896 physical habitat 0 795 water quantity and quality 0 606 aquatic life 0 280 fig 9b similar to the east pi river social services water quantity and quality and physical habitat were healthy in the west pi river however aquatic life remained unhealthy the ci values in the downstream region were social services 0 720 physical habitat 0 491 water quantity and quality 0 301 aquatic life 0 265 fig 9c water quantity and quality as well as physical habitat had a strong declining trend compared with the east and west pi rivers physical habitat declined from healthy to subhealthy in the downstream region there was a reduction from healthy to unhealthy in water quantity and quality the ci values in the target level were healthy 0 618 west pi river 0 602 east pi river 0 599 lower reaches of pi river 0 412 subhealthy 0 392 fig 9d a subhealthy level was observed in both the upper and lower reaches of pi river during the study period in general marked variances in health status were found in the social services aquatic life water quantity and quality and physical habitat social services and aquatic life had the best and poorest health condition respectively there was a better health status in non ecological performance than ecosystem integrity currently pi river was identified as subhealthy by integrating health status in four criteria levels 4 4 health condition of sampling sites sixteen sampling sites were selected to discover the health condition of pi river fig 10 displays the ipfc of each sampling site low e x values appeared in s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 implying poor health scores existed in these sampling sites meanwhile s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 showed low μ and high v suggesting that there large fuzziness eight sampling sites s9 s16 had high e n and h e values meaning that their e x had large uncertainties and the corresponding cloud droplets were more dispersed the above characteristics reflected that higher data instabilities and lower health scores occurred in the downstream region in comparison to the sampling sites at the east and west pi rivers fig 11 illustrates the spatial distribution of health condition at the 16 sampling sites five sampling sites s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 were unhealthy eleven sampling sites s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s12 and s13 were subhealthy the poorest health condition existed in sampling sites in the lower reaches of pi river overall the health status exhibited substantial geographical variability in pi river among all the sampling sites 31 25 five sampling sites were at an unhealthy level while the remaining 68 75 eleven sampling sites were at a subhealthy level 5 discussion 5 1 physical habitat in pi river the structural and morphological status was examined by physical habitat which encompassed four key factors river connectivity c1 riparian naturalness c2 land development c3 and natural wetland c4 table 1 the east and west pi rivers are located in mountainous areas and less disturbed by humans without large industrial enterprises xu et al 2021a huang et al 2022 in the east pi river it was discovered that c1 and c4 were healthy and c2 and c3 were excellent fig 8a in west pi river c1 was excellent and c2 c3 and c4 were healthy fig 8b the lower reaches of pi river have undergone considerable ecological changes over the last four decades due to rapid urbanization and large scale agricultural development lu et al 2022 human activities such as massive tree felling extensive wasteland reclamation and large scale river sand mining were carried out in the lower reaches of pi river the above mentioned unreasonable human activities increased soil erosion and caused an imbalanced ecosystem to some extent zhang et al 2011 meanwhile the operation of reservoirs in the upper reaches ensured urban water supply and provided irrigation water for the agricultural production in the lower reaches li et al 2021 in recent years extensive efforts were made to restore riparian areas and construct multiple rubber dams in the downstream region with the aim of managing and reducing urban flood inundation although the urban development agricultural production and water conservancy projects generated considerable economic benefits they also caused serious damage to the river ecosystem in the downstream region the ecological damage produced by irrational development patterns left the physical habitat still in a subhealthy level in the lower reaches of pi river overall health condition of physical habitat exhibited substantial spatial differences in pi river due to urban development agricultural production and water conservancy projects physical habitat was healthy in the east and west pi rivers whereas was subhealthy in the lower reaches feasible measures to enhance the physical habitat in pi river include mainly sustainable planning of urban construction and agricultural activities and optimization of water conservancy projects 5 2 water quantity and quality the evaluation of ecological resilience in pi river focused on both the quantity and quality of its water resources specifically this assessment encompassed various factors such as ecological flow satisfaction c5 water quantity mutation c6 water quality condition c7 and substrate contamination c8 table 1 the regulatory roles of upstream reservoirs are to i store water to ensure urban flood protection during the flood season and ii release water to maintain water supply agricultural production and ecological needs of pi river basin during the non flood season lu et al 2021 reservoir storages seriously affected the water quantity of pi river causing low health level in c5 and c6 fig 8 the east and west pi rivers had fewer human activities and better water quality generating healthy c7 and c8 due to the impacts of urban sewage discharge and agricultural pollution c7 and c8 in the lower pi river were subhealthy collectively water quantity and quality were healthy in the east and west pi rivers and unhealthy in the downstream region fig 9 reservoir construction had a greater influence on water quantity resulting in worse health scores for c5 and c6 the lower reaches of pi river were heavily influenced by urban sewage discharge and agricultural surface pollution with subhealthy c7 and c8 water quantity and quality conditions in the lower reaches were markedly worse compared with the upper reaches there are several potential improvements to the quantity and quality of water resources in pi river including the following i optimizing the sewage network and boosting the urban sewage treatment capacity ii strengthening the treatment of agricultural pollution and iii increasing the ecological flow to guarantee the water mobility and self purification capacity 5 3 aquatic life the biological diversity in pi river was appraised by aquatic life which encompassed four key factors phytoplankton c9 zooplankton c10 fish c11 and waterbird c12 table 1 aquatic life surveys were performed from august to october 2021 in this study the surveys revealed 153 species in eight phyla of phytoplankton in the pi river the algal phyla contained 17 species cyanobacteria 11 11 of the total 2 species chrysophyte 1 31 of the total 1 species xanthophyta 0 65 of the total 56 species bacillariophyta 36 60 of the total 13 species euglenophyta 8 50 of the total 55 species chlorophyta 35 95 of the total 3 species cryptophyta 1 96 of the total and 6 species dinophyta 3 92 of the total furthermore 71 species in four categories of zooplankton were identified in the pi river the zooplankton included 17 species protozoa 23 94 of the total 45 species rotifer 63 38 of the total 5 species cladocera 7 04 of the total and 4 species copepods 5 64 of the total in general the biomass and density of phytoplankton and zooplankton were higher downstream than upstream c9 and c10 were unhealthy and sick in pi river fig 8 during our field survey we found only 47 species of fish in the pi river in recent decades large scale dam construction and river sand mining led to serious degradation of fish stocks in the pi river wan et al 2017 due to the unique geographical position native fish were small and slow growing zhang et al 2017b found that the green sunfish have become invasive species in the pi river and posed a greater threat to native fish thus the fish was currently at an unhealthy level numerous waterbirds thrived in pi river basin due to the abundant habitats and favorable living condition offered by its wetlands in the east and west pi rivers waterbirds with abundant numbers and species were healthy during the evaluation period fig 8 in general aquatic life was unhealthy in pi river fig 9 c9 c10 and c11 did not reach healthy levels except c12 in the east and west pi rivers urban development dam construction river sand mining and invasive alien species posed a serious threat to aquatic life improving aquatic life in the pi river may require increasing ecological flows and suppressing invasive fish 5 4 social services a river is a complete ecosystem that provides social services for human life and production liu et al 2022 the social services in pi river were measured using four key factors flood protection c13 water supply c14 water resources development c15 and public satisfaction c16 at present both the downstream rubber dams and upstream reservoirs satisfied the needs of urban flood control xu et al 2021a in 2020 substantial improvements to embankments were also implemented on a large scale thus urban flood protection was compliant in pi river and c13 was healthy in addition the upstream reservoirs provided an adequate and high quality water supply for the downstream urban area huang et al 2022 therefore c14 was excellent and healthy urban construction has intensified the water resources development resulting in c15 transformed from healthy to subhealthy fig 8 to evaluate the degree of public satisfaction with the pi river watershed a total of 200 questionnaires were created and disseminated in this study zhang et al 2022a according to the poll the pi river basin was found to have a high level of public satisfaction and c16 has a satisfactory health condition in general the social services in pi river were in good condition fig 9 regional sustainable development depends on several key components such as water resource utilization water supply and flood prevention in the future a viable approach to enhancing the functions of social services would be the judicious exploitation of water resources in the downstream region 5 5 spatial distribution of river health fig 11 illustrates the spatial distribution of health condition at the 16 sampling sites the sampling sites in the east pi river s1 s2 s3 and s4 and the west pi river s5 s6 s7 and s8 were both at subhealthy levels considering the uncertainty during river health assessment process the east and west pi rivers were subhealthy fig 9d this was mainly due to the dam constructions in upper reaches damaged aquatic life and ecological flows markedly reducing the health status of river ecosystem three sampling sites s9 s12 and s13 in the lower reaches were subhealthy while five other sites s10 s11 s14 s15 and s16 were determined to be in an unhealthy state furthermore s10 and s11 were in urban river sections and their aquatic life and physical habitat were greatly disturbed by urban development and sewage discharge s10 and s11 with the greatest fuzziness and randomness had the worst health levels s14 s15 and s16 were situated at the lowest reaches of pi river the following factors contributed to the regional heterogeneity in their health levels i domestic and agricultural pollution caused by urban development and large scale agricultural activities was accumulated here ii sediment from upstream was deposited and large scale sand mining was carried out in the areas around s14 s15 and s16 accordingly s14 s15 and s16 were unhealthy there were no excellent healthy and sick sampling sites in the pi river in the 16 sampling sites 11 was subhealthy accounting for 68 75 of the total and five were unhealthy representing 31 25 of the total meanwhile the health status of pi river showed considerable spatial heterogeneity the east and west pi rivers located in the upper reaches were remarkably healthier than the lower reaches due to the multiple impacts of dam construction urban development and agricultural activities the pi river was at a subhealthy level several measures must be taken to improve ecological flow control domestic and agricultural pollution and manage river sand mining to improve the health status of pi river 5 6 methodological advantages comparative studies were performed to determine the effectiveness of pfc topsis model for river health assessment fig 12 displays the comparative analysis of calculation results from topsis xu et al 2021b pythagorean fuzzy sets based on topsis pft lin et al 2018 normal cloud nc ruan et al 2021 integrated intuitionistic fuzzy cloud iifc zhang et al 2022a and pfc topsis models the calculation results of topsis model indicated that the transition from subhealthy to healthy occurred in s1 s5 and s6 and s14 was from unhealthy to subhealthy in comparion with pfc topsis model sampling sites s1 s5 and s14 showed a healthier level using the pft model health status in s1 and s5 were enhanced utilizing the nc model only the health status of s14 was improved with iifc the similarity between pfc topsis and topsis was 75 between pfc topsis and pft was 81 25 between pfc topsis and nc was 87 5 between pfc topsis and iifc was 93 75 the scope of decision may extend beyond the capabilities of models resulting in some bias in the outputs yao et al 2021 the results are overly optimistic since the topsis model fails to adequately incorporate the uncertainty from the data and decision making process zhang et al 2021 only fuzziness was examined in the pft model which will generate better health levels than the actual condition at sampling sites with significant randomness zhang et al 2022b although the nc technique contains the randomness of cloud model it does not involve fuzziness lu et al 2017 this will lead to biased results in sampling sites with greater fuzziness both the fuzziness and randomness were considered in iifc and pfc topsis models and the evaluation results are really close sampling site s14 was situated within the downstream section of the pi river and field surveys found that the health condition of its surrounding area was not satisfactory the pfc topsis model demonstrated superior capacity for handling rha with uncertainty than the iifc model and the results obtained were more consistent with the actual situation of pi river overall the results of rha might be overly positive without considering the randomness and fuzziness in fact there were inevitably uncertainty in rha due to the distraction from data sampling method and external environment a bias will existed in findings when these interference was not considered the pfc topsis developed in this study can overcome the limitations and broaden the capabilities in current techniques and offer a promising way to investigate rha with uncertainty 6 conclusion to systematically investigate the rha across mountain to urban transitions this study proposed a pfc algorithm by integrating the cloud model and pythagorean fuzzy sets a novel pfc topsis model was created by extending topsis to the pfc environment the hybrid framework was then developed to handle rha with uncertainty and the pi river in china served as a case study the main conclusions were as follows 1 the developed pfc topsis model could broaden the capabilities of current techniques and provide a more efficient way for dealing with rha with uncertainty 2 health condition of evaluation indicators was unsatisfactory with only 68 75 and 18 75 healthy attainment rates in the upper and lower reaches of pi river respectively 3 there were no excellent healthy and sick sampling sites in pi river among all the sampling sites 31 25 were unhealthy while the remaining 68 75 were subhealthy 4 the health status of pi river showed considerable spatial heterogeneity the east and west pi rivers located in the upper reaches were markedly healthier than the lower reaches due to the multiple impacts of dam construction urban development and agricultural activities the pi river was still subhealthy credit authorship contribution statement zhengxian zhang methodology software visualization writing original draft writing review editing yun

2047,the need for resilient stormwater infrastructure is increasingly critical as urbanization and climate change continue to threaten water resources engineers and practitioners require reliable methodologies to estimate rainfall runoff responses to adequately size and design sewer pipes and inlets flood controls and stormwater control measures scms the national resource conservation service technical release 55 often referred to as curve number cn method simple and rational methods are methodologies commonly implemented for such designs by regulatory agencies due to the limited inputs needed to estimate runoff however uncertainty is present in each model since they simplify actual hydrological processes in this study 13 urban and two forested watersheds were monitored and their observed hydrologic responses were compared to modeled hydrologic responses utilizing the aforementioned methods significant differences in observed normalized runoff volumes i e runoff coefficients and normalized peak flow rates were found between watersheds with similar watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns demonstrating the meticulous model inputs required to differentiate hydrologic responses between similar watersheds a suite of alternative predictive models informed by feature selection algorithms were formulated and compared to the performance of standard methods results suggested that composite cn methods were the best predictors of event runoff volume across all watersheds nash sutcliffe nse and kling gupta efficiencies kge of 0 74 and 0 52 respectively but were outperformed by the simple method for watersheds with more than 45 impervious cover nse and kge scores of 0 85 and 0 76 respectively however composite cn methods underestimated runoff volume from every watershed a limitation that was intended to be addressed through the creation of the distributed cn method in the distributed approach runoff volume estimations were improved compared to the composite cn approach only when directly connected impervious area in the watershed was extremely high or extremely low the multi linear regression runoff volume model created herein did not outperform traditional runoff models except when rainfall depth was less than 12 5 mm i e the storms for which traditional runoff volume estimation methods performed the worst uncertainty in modeled peak flow rate was substantially greater than for runoff volume nse and kge scores between 0 48 0 55 and 0 39 0 67 respectively across all methodologies there is a continued need to develop more dependable estimates of peak flow which are critical to the design of pipes flood routing and hydrograph prediction overall these results suggest one model is not optimal in all scenarios municipalities regulatory agencies and stormwater engineers should consider the adoption of multiple methodologies and use guidance from the results herein to provide recommendations as to when each

precipitation patterns are continually affected by climate change nile et al 2019 tirpak et al 2021a yilmaz 2015 as a result cities may be forced to re design drainage systems or implement retrofits to existing infrastructure to accommodate current and future conditions low impact development lid which includes the implementation of green infrastructure and stormwater control measures scms is a method increasingly adopted by municipalities to mitigate the detrimental impacts of urban stormwater bell et al 2020 because hydrology has been labeled a critical driver of aquatic ecosystem health booth et al 2002 wenger et al 2009 research often suggests stormwater management is best achieved through hydrologic mitigation as opposed to nutrient cycling pollutant abatement or temperature mitigation alone chang 2010 fletcher et al 2015 marsalek and chocat 2002 paraszczuk 2021 simpson and winston 2022b estimates of hydrologic responses are often derived from the national resources conservation service nrcs technical release 55 method hereafter referred to as curve number cn method nrcs 1986 the simple method schueler 1987 or the rational method mulvaney 1851 these equations are widely accepted and used in engineering practice in the united states and beyond due in part to the limited inputs needed to estimate runoff these equations are fundamental to the design of urban drainage infrastructure e g sewer pipe sizing inlet spacing flood control systems and sizing of scms and applicability of stormwater models that may be used to establish management regulations such as

development added cost marginal improvements in scm hydrologic or water quality function knight et al 2013 winston 2015 and water stress for vegetated scms tu et al 2020 one method to ensure urban drainage infrastructure is sized properly to achieve long term function and return on investment is by improving hydrologic models which underpin their design the cn method was developed in 1954 by the soil conservation service now nrcs and revised extensively in 1975 usda and scs 1975 and 1986 nrcs 1986 this method predicts runoff depth ynrcs as a function of precipitation depth p maximum potential retention s and initial abstraction ia as shown in equation 1 1 y nrcs p i a 2 p i a s runoff depth is calculated under the condition p ia such that the numerator is greater than zero when p is less than ia ynrcs is equal to zero ia and s are both empirically derived equation 2 equation 3 cns were also empirically derived and can be obtained from tables in nrcs 1986 as a function of land

most widely used predictive equation for runoff volume because of its ease of use and it has federal and other authoritative bodies support i e users of this methodology receive a degree of protection in legal cases where this method did not perform accurately eli and lamont 2010 despite this the cn method has numerous limitations eli and lamont 2010 hawkins et al 2009 the cn of a watershed changes as a function of rainfall depth and rainfall distribution especially since the method does not account for infiltration during low intensity storms eli and lamont 2010 typically experimentally calibrated cns decline with increasing storm depth as such tabulated cns in nrcs 1986 were determined from horizontal asymptotes of the runoff rainfall relationship i e at large rainfall depths thereby limiting the applicability of this methodology in smaller more frequent events hawkins 1993 lastly it is imprudent to assume the ratio between ia and s 0 2 often referred to as λ is constant and applicable for all types of lulcs and storms cazier and hawkins 1984 chen 1976 jiang 2001 performed a comprehensive study optimizing the λ value and found that λ 0 05 corresponded better to empirical data from urban and forested watersheds however randusová et al 2015 found the cn to be better fit with empirical data from watersheds predominately covered by forests using λ 0 20 thus using λ 0 05 has become more common in recent years for urban watersheds in academic settings the simple method developed by schueler 1987 is utilized to model runoff volume from a watershed as a function of imperviousness watershed area and rainfall depth a predicted runoff coefficient csm is related to the fraction of impervious area in the watershed equation 4 4 c sm 0 05 0 9 i the simple method was developed for annual runoff volume and load prediction schueler 1987 and is used for national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits in the state of ohio oepa 2018 where this research took place the simplicity of this method makes it popular however various watershed and rainfall characteristics are ignored such as lulc watershed slope disconnected impervious surfaces underlying soil type antecedent dry period adp and rainfall intensity additionally the simple method assumes a constant csm throughout a storm and from storm to storm the rational method was developed by mulvaney 1851 and is the most widely used methodology to predict runoff peak flow rate it is an empirical relationship between peak flow qrat and rainfall intensity irat with the rainfall duration equal to the time of concentration tc of a watershed utilizing a constant runoff coefficient crat and watershed area a equation 5 5 q rat c rat i rat a restrictions regarding use of this methodology are implemented for maximum watershed size and vary greatly between jurisdictions the method has remained unchanged since its creation despite increased knowledge of rainfall runoff processes chin 2019 for example the rational method has various underlying assumptions which are often overlooked in engineering design including 1 no spatial or temporal variation in rainfall intensity during the tc 2 runoff coefficients remain constant throughout a storm and from storm to storm 3 the entire watershed contributes to runoff and 4 the contributing watershed area is uniform butler and davis 2011 wang and wang 2018 furthermore chin 2019 also noted rational runoff coefficients vary with geographic setting time of concentration and soil infiltration rate peak flow rates are usually underestimated due to the constant rainfall assumption and rational runoff coefficients can be greater than one recent research has focused on amending widely accepted runoff estimation methodologies wang and wang 2018 zeng et al 2017 however repeated studies with consistent results for new modified methodologies are required to be accepted by design engineers and regulatory agencies further few studies compare field results to multiple predictive methodologies to recommend specific scenarios where one model may be most applicable thus in this study rainfall runoff hydrology data from 13 urban and two forested watersheds were collected to compare against multiple existing methods e g cn rational and simple and newly created hydrologic models the objectives of this work were to 1 compare field monitored hydrologic responses between watersheds to understand the effects of watershed characteristics on runoff volume and peak flow 2 identify watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns hereafter these are referred to as attributes which influence predictive performance of hydrologic models using a feature selection algorithm boruta s algorithm to develop alternative predictive models and 3 compare field monitored runoff volume and peak flow rate to predictions from the cn method simple method rational method and models created herein assessing their applicability under current climate decades after they were originally developed excluding the models created herein results and conclusions from this work can aid the design of drainage systems and scms by characterizing the advantages and drawbacks of each methodology compared to another improve hydrologic monitoring of scms when scms receive run on via sheet flow and increase accuracy of pollutant load removal estimations 2 methods 2 1 watershed descriptions rainfall and resulting runoff hydrology were monitored from 13 urban watersheds in the dayton ohio usa metro area and two forested

highlander were in xenia ohio monitoring in springboro and xenia commenced in march 2020 and ceased in june 2021 monitoring of the forested watersheds bd north bd south took place from may 2020 through may 2021 all monitoring efforts were decommissioned in the winter december march to avoid freezing conditions that could damage monitoring equipment all watershed outfalls discharged untreated stormwater i e scms were not present in any of the monitored watersheds 2 2 data collection a 0 25 mm tipping bucket rain gauge davis instruments hayward california was installed near each watershed outfall in a location free from overhead obstructions each rain gauge recorded data at 1 minute intervals to a hobo pendant logger onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts manual rain gauges were also deployed and used to verify tipping bucket gauge readings storm events were separated by a minimum 6 hour dry period and a minimum rainfall depth of 2 54 mm teledyne isco 750 area velocity meters avms teledyne isco lincoln nebraska were mounted to each storm sewer outfall in the case of urban watersheds or culverts in the forested watersheds runoff velocity was measured via the doppler effect with ultrasonic waves emitted from the avm bouncing off particles or bubbles in the flow flow depth was measured via an onboard pressure transducer one springboro xenia or two kettering minute interval velocity and level data were transmitted to an isco 6712 autosampler where flow rates were calculated using equations based on the cross sectional geometry of the pipe and integrated with time to determine flow volume because the isco 6712 autosamplers lack several inputs needed to accurately quantify flow in elliptical or arched pipes e g radii of the top arch bottom arch center arch the methods created by perez et al 2015 were used to establish a relationship between depth of flow and hydraulic radius for the elliptical pipe draining the mound watershed all other urban pipes were circular thus data collected from the autosampler could be used to determine flow rate and volume using predetermined cross sectional area relationships rectangular weirs were constructed immediately downstream of the avms in the forested watersheds the avms measured the depth of runoff over the weir at one minute intervals simpson and winston 2022a determined that avms may yield erroneous readings when runoff velocities were below 0 08 m s or when runoff was particularly clear i e low turbidity because this was a common occurrence in only the forested watersheds flow rates were determined using a standard broad crested weir equation 2 3 data analysis all data were analyzed in r statistical software r core team 2021 2 3 1 hydrologic parameter calculation and statistical testing runoff depth yobs was calculated as the quotient of observed stormwater volume vobs and watershed area on a storm by storm basis further a volumetric runoff coefficient cv was calculated for each storm event as the quotient of yobs and rainfall depth an overall runoff coefficient cv sum was calculated for each watershed by dividing the sum of yobs by the sum of rainfall depth over the duration of the monitoring period runoff volumes and peak flow rates defined as the single greatest flow rate during each event from all monitored storms in each watershed were determined to be non normally distributed using the shapiro wilk test differences in cv and normalized peak flow rates between watersheds were assessed using the kruskal wallis test a nonparametric analysis of variance anova the dunn s test a pairwise multiple comparison post hoc test was used to determine which hydrologic response variables significantly varied by watershed a criterion of 95 confidence α 0 05 was utilized to determine statistical significance additionally hydrologic observations from different watersheds were compared with percent differences equation 6 6 difference obs 1 obs 2 obs 1 obs 2 0 5 100 2 3 2 boruta s algorithm feature selection to identify important attributes which influence response variables i e stormwater volume and peak flow rate was performed using the boruta package in r kursa and rudnicki 2010 this method is a wrapper i e uses a subset of features and trains a model using them around the random forest classification algorithm liaw and wiener 2002 and ranks the importance of both categorical and continuous attributes in the boruta algorithm a z score for each attribute is calculated as the ratio of the average loss of accuracy of classification caused by the random permutation of attribute values between each attribute to its standard deviation despite non normally distributed response variables boruta s algorithm is appropriate because z scores consider the fluctuations of the mean accuracy loss among unbiased weak classifiers kursa and rudnicki 2010 to determine importance the z score of each attribute was compared to the minimum mean and maximum z score of shadow features for each attribute iterative shadow copies were created by shuffling original values attributes with a significantly lower importance were consecutively dropped and after each iteration shadow copies were recreated an attribute was dropped if the z score for that attribute was less than the maximum z score among all shadow attributes the algorithm stops when only important attributes remain or when the set number of runs is reached default is 100 runs in the latter case attributes that have not been dropped or confirmed important are labelled as tentative methods exist to potentially eliminate tentative cases but no tentative cases were observed in the analysis performed herein watershed area lulc imperviousness directly connected impervious area dcia slope rainfall depth rainfall duration peak 5 minute rainfall intensity average rainfall intensity adp flow duration underground sewer length time to peak flow rate and season of the storm were attributes included in the boruta analysis due to the design of the algorithm all storm events with an na value for any attribute or response variable i e all storms in the main watershed where sewer data were invalid table 1 or the first storm of the monitoring season where adp could not be calculated were removed from the boruta analysis so the algorithm would run properly underground sewer length was normalized by watershed area to calculate sewer density since sewer length is a function of watershed size and watershed area was used as a separate attribute in the analysis 2 3 3 multi linear regression multi linear regression mlr analyses were performed using important attributes determined with boruta s algorithm as independent variables to predict runoff volume and peak flow responses a cube root transformation was performed on both runoff volume and peak flow rate to account for mlr model assumptions i e linearity equal variance of residuals and to avoid non finite responses of transformed variables which would be the case in logarithmic transformations when runoff volume and peak flow rate were zero various combinations of important attributes were explored in mlr analyses to determine which equation s provided the highest coefficient of determination r2 while utilizing easy to obtain attributes 2 3 4 comparing modeled versus observed hydrologic parameters monitored hydrologic responses were compared to predictions derived from the cn method the simple method the rational method and the mlr models created herein the cn of each watershed was calculated under a variety of potential weighting methods a first composite cn cn c1 was calculated by assigning cns from the dominant lulc and weighting by area in each hsg table s1 supplementary material i e using the same methodology presented in nrcs 1986 a second composite cn cn c2 was calculated by utilizing a cn of 98 for impervious areas and separately area weighting the type of pervious cover by hsg table s2 supplementary material for both cn c1 and cn c2 runoff depths ycn c1 and ycn c2 were calculated utilizing equation 1 lastly a distributed cn approach cn d was calculated wherein specific cns were used for each individual sub watershed table s2 runoff depths were calculated for each sub basin using equation 1 and were area weighted to obtain a runoff depth for the entire watershed ycn d in all cn methodologies λ was assumed to equal 0 2 and hsg was determined from web soil survey nrcs 2022 for all soils nrcs 2022 provided hsg classifications however some soils were classified as c d when this occurred the soil was classified as hsg d watershed areas were multiplied by ycn c1 ycn c2 and ycn d to obtain estimated runoff volumes for each scenario vcn c1 vcn c2 and vcn d respectively curve number adjustments utilizing soil amc were also considered for only the cn methodology that fit vobs best table s1 soils were considered dry amc i if less than 12 7 or 35 6 mm of rain occurred in the previous 5 day period during the dormant september april or growing may august seasons in ohio respectively soils were considered wet amc iii if more than 27 9 or 53 3 mm of rain occurred in the previous 5 day period in the dormant or growing season respectively otherwise soils were classified as amc ii conversions from amc ii to amc i or iii were computed via linear interpolation ward and trimble 2003 runoff volumes tabulated via amc adjusted cns were documented as vx amc where x is either cn c1 cn c2 or cn d runoff volume was also estimated with the simple method where csm was calculated based on the imperviousness fraction of an urban watershed schueler 1987 runoff volume vsm was calculated by multiplying csm with watershed area and precipitation depth vcn c1 vcn c2 vcn d vx amc vsm and predicted volume from the mlr analysis vmlr were compared to vobs goodness of fit for these comparisons was assessed with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 equation 7 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 equation 8 scores as well as the percentage of bias pbias equation 9 additionally model performance was assessed visually with scatter plots as recommended by jain and sudheer 2008 7 nse 1 t 1 n x s t x 0 t 2 t 1 n x 0 t μ 0 2 8 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 9 pbias i 1 n o p i 1 n o 100 it is generally accepted that negative nse scores are indicative of poor model performance i e the mean of the respective dataset is a better measure than model predictions while an nse value 0 indicates the model performed as well as the mean a positive nse value indicates that the model performed better than the mean knoben et al 2019 the kge is an improved version of nse wherein correlation r variability bias α and mean bias β are decomposed into constitutive components kge scores greater than 0 41 indicate improved model performance compared to the mean of the data set knoben et al 2019 pbias is the average tendency for a model to over or under predict an observation moriasi et al 2007 the optimal value for pbias is zero with positive and negative values corresponding to over and under predictions respectively field monitored peak flow rates qobs were compared to those calculated from the rational method qrat and the mlr analyses qmlr using nse kge pbias and scatter plots ranges of allowable crat values are provided for each lulc thus estimated peak flow rates for each storm were calculated under a variety of scenarios 1 using the minimum crat value 2 using the mean crat value and 3 using the maximum crat value presented in lindeburg 2011 appendix 20 a the rainfall intensity over the median time of concentration itc for each watershed was used for irat in rational method calculations there are several methods to estimate tc but many require several inputs which are difficult to obtain for urban watersheds with underground sewer infrastructure e g channel length and slope these parameters prohibit the use of commonly used tc estimations such as the kirpach equation kerby hathaway equation nrcs velocity method etc in urban watersheds thus as applied in other urban settings e g fang et al 2008 mccuen et al 1984 simas 1996 empirical estimates of tc were utilized in this study where tc is determined as 1 67 times the lag time lag time was defined as time to peak i e time between the onset of runoff and peak flow rate minus half of the rainfall measurement interval simas 1996 because peak flow rates are primarily used to design drainage systems and or scms data were also parsed such that only storms of greater depth than the one year recurrence interval for the duration greater than or equal to the median tc of the respective watershed were considered in an additional analysis storm depths equivalent to the one year median tc duration were found at the dayton mcd 33 2067 station using precipitation frequency tables generated by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2021 2 3 5 optimizing hydrologic predictions chen 1976 was among the first to suggest the assumption that the λ value i e ratio of ia to s in the cn methodology possessed error hawkins et al 2009 recommended a methodology to find the optimal value of s briefly this methodology uses a least squares fit between observed paired rainfall and runoff volume data the optimal λ was determined for only the best fit cn approach for each watershed as the value which minimized the objective function fcn x defined as 10 min f cn x min v x v obs 2 similarly for peak flow rate the optimal crat for each watershed was determined as the crat which minimized the objective function frat defined as 11 min f rat min q rat q obs 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitored storm events between 46 and 76 storm events above the qualifying storm event depth 2 54 mm were monitored from each watershed storm depth ranged from 2 8 to 90 7 mm storm characteristics including median depth median peak 5 minute intensity median average intensity median adp and median itc from all watersheds are presented in table 2 the number of monitored events between 2 54 and 12 5 mm are also shown as the cn method is less reliable for storms smaller than 12 5 mm nrcs 1986 at least 50 of storms were less than this threshold in all watersheds thus numerous instances existed where the cn method could result in large uncertainty fassman beck et al 2016 also noted more than half the storms below this threshold when aggregating paired rainfall runoff hydrology data from 21 living roof across varying climatic conditions globally exhibiting limitations of the cn method in other regions rainfall depth peak 5 minute rainfall intensity average rainfall intensity and adp did not vary significantly p 0 05 between watersheds 3 2 runoff coefficients and runoff volume 3 2 1 field monitored results kuichling 1889 discovered that the fraction of rainfall discharged as runoff i e runoff coefficient is nearly equivalent to the impervious coverage in a watershed results herein do not align with kuichling 1889 table 3 as the median cv from each urban watershed was 9 61 different equation 6 always lesser than the impervious percentage of the respective watershed the only watersheds where the percent difference was less than 20 were gateway madison wilmington main and farr hill excluding farr hill these were the only watersheds with impervious coverage greater than 50 of the total area and of which more than 90 of it was dcia thus an adjustment to the impervious fraction is needed to properly estimate cv such as that taken in the simple method schueler 1987 to make estimations of cv based solely on imperviousness more accurate however since watershed imperviousness was more often similar in magnitude to the 90th percentile cv table 3 the adjustment to imperviousness in the simple method to estimate a runoff coefficient may not be accurate when a watershed is less than roughly 50 impervious and or contains a considerable amount of unconnected impervious area uia cv values were observed to vary significantly p 0 001 in all cases between watersheds representing the same lulc watersheds in the commercial sfr and ldr lulc classifications had extremely similar imperviousness ldr ranged from 18 to 20 impervious sfr ranged from 38 to 45 impervious and commercial ranged from 78 to 81 impervious table 1 despite these similarities and no significant differences in rainfall characteristics runoff coefficients significantly varied suggesting runoff volume responses may not be accurately captured by the cn and simple methods or these significant differences may not be substantially different cv sum values in the literature ranged from 0 51 to 0 9 for parking lot passeport and hunt 2009 rushton 2001 were 0 4 and 0 61 for commercial ackerman and schiff 2003 charbeneau and barrett 1998 and ranged from 0 19 to 0 38 for sfr hood et al 2007 page et al 2015 smith et al 2020 lulcs further displaying variability alongside table 3 between watersheds representing the same lulc significant differences in cv values likely occurred in the light industrial lulc because of the substantial differences in impervious coverage at gateway and s tech table 1 median cv values in the commercial lulc were not significantly different between the main and wilmington watersheds yet both watersheds were significantly greater than municipal median cv values in the sfr lulc were significantly lower at the colorado and aragon watersheds compared to the acorn watershed cv values were significantly greater at null than highlander both representing the ldr lulc despite similar rainfall characteristics and imperviousness from watersheds of the same lulc significant differences in cv values could have resulted from the urban karst phenomenon where the volume of stormwater leaked from a sewer is assumed to be greater in systems with larger diameters e g colorado sfr lulc municipal commercial lulc this is because larger sewers have less structural stability and are subjected to longitudinal cracks and fractures davies et al 2001 o reilly et al 1989 other potential explanations include hsg of pervious areas soil compaction pitt et al 2008 curbed versus uncurbed roadways simpson et al 2020 tree canopy coverage selbig et al 2022 and other factors included in the feature selection analysis such as watershed slope dcia sewer density etc results of feature selection in relation to vobs using boruta s algorithm are presented in fig 2 rainfall depth and watershed area were overwhelmingly the most important attributes to vobs important attributes that had a positive relationship with vobs included rainfall depth watershed area flow duration imperviousness rain duration sewer density time to peak flow rate and dcia attributes that had an inverse relationship with vobs were watershed slope peak 5 minute rainfall intensity and average rainfall intensity adp and season were dropped from the algorithm and not considered important to vobs rainfall intensity was indirectly related to vobs as more intense events were typically shorter in duration and had lower depths rainfall depth was a substantially more important attribute to runoff volume than both peak 5 minute and average rain intensity fig 2 the indirect relationship between slope and vobs occurred because the watershed with the smallest slope colorado 0 5 had a watershed area i e the second most important attribute to vobs eight 75 fold greater than all other watershed areas furthermore the watersheds with the greatest slopes i e bd north bd south and null table 1 were 80 100 pervious and had substantially higher infiltration capacities than the more developed watersheds this unusual relationship may further be explained by a low number of monitored watersheds n 15 in a relatively flat region govers 1991 noted a directly proportional relationship between slope and runoff volume in soil plots and found slope to be a more critical attribute in larger drainage areas additionally meierdiercks et al 2017 identified a positive relationship between slope and runoff volume in urban watersheds ranging from 8 to 31 impervious cover if the two forested watersheds i e bd north and bd south and colorado i e the watershed with the largest area were removed from the dataset re running boruta s algorithm yielded slope as a much less important attribute with a positive relationship to volume these results suggest slope may be a more important attribute in urban watersheds than the forested watersheds where complete infiltration or abstraction of rainfall was far more likely to occur simpson and winston 2022b rainfall depth and watershed area were the most important attributes to vobs fig 2 in conjunction with these two attributes the cn method utilizes lulc to estimate the magnitude of the cn while the simple method utilizes imperviousness to estimate csm lulc and imperviousness were the fourth and sixth most important attributes to vobs respectively fig 2 in a meta analysis of runoff quality data from 170 urban watersheds simpson et al 2022 noted a correlation between lulc and imperviousness with imperviousness decreasing from the road lulc followed by commercial industrial mfr and sfr lulcs however every lulc comparison in simpson et al 2022 had overlapping ranges of imperviousness confirming results in brabec 2009 these overlaps highlight the potential uncertainty in runoff volumes estimated by the cn and simple methods given the many interacting factors which affect runoff generation in urban areas thus adjustments to existing models or the creation of new models may be necessary to produce more accurate estimations of runoff volume 3 2 2 comparing runoff volume to predictive equations because significant differences in cv were observed between watersheds with similar attributes and many attributes were important to vobs that are not included in the simple and cn methods various mlr models were developed with the goal of better improving runoff volume predictions table 4 though 12 attributes were deemed important utilizing boruta s algorithm fig 2 mlr analyses revealed minimal improvements in model accuracy determined by r2 values after three or four attributes were included in the model for example although sohn et al 2020 found dcia to be a more important predictor of runoff depth than impervious area dcia did not improve predictive capacity herein after imperviousness was incorporated into the model equation v mlr 7 had the best model fit but it included flow duration as a predictor variable a variable that is impossible to estimate therefore equation v mlr 6 was chosen as the optimal predictive equation because of suitable model fit e g r2 and residual standard error while relying on easily obtainable inputs in mlr predictive equations attributes that interact with one another are denoted with a multiplication symbol between terms the explicit v mlr 6 equation and parameter constants as well as data repositories and code are provided in simpson 2023 nse kge and pbias scores were tabulated for comparisons between vcn c1 vcn c2 vcn d vsm and vv mlr 6 to vobs the vcn c1 and vv mlr 6 the model created herein models were best fit to vobs nse 0 74 kge 0 52 and nse 0 7 kge 0 64 respectively across all watersheds and storms fig 3 model vcn c2 nse 0 74 kge 0 51 performed nearly as well as vcn c1 these three models performed substantially better than the vcn d and vsm models however when only storms less than 12 5 mm were considered i e the threshold for cn reliability nrcs 1986 nse and kge scores for model vcn c1 were substantially lower 0 29 and 0 53 respectively figure s1 supplementary material this result occurred because 61 of the storms less than 12 5 mm did not satisfy the condition p ia i e no predicted runoff yet 91 of the storms produced runoff demonstrating substantial error in ia estimates this error results from cns that were tabularly set based on their horizontal asymptotes with increasing rainfall depth refer to limitations in the introduction nse and kge scores also dramatically decreased for all other models except vv mlr 6 when considering only storms less than 12 5 mm when evaluating storms greater than 12 5 mm vcn c1 slightly outperformed vcn c2 and vv mlr 6 and were substantially better fit to measured data than vcn d and vsm figure s2 supplementary material in this case vcn c1 only 9 of the events did not satisfy the p ia condition eight occurrences from bd north 0 impervious seven from bd south 0 2 impervious five from colorado 38 impervious and 13 from highlander 18 impervious the vcn c1 vcn 2 and vv mlr 6 models had the highest overall nse and kge scores fig 3 though examples of the cn c1 methodology are provided in nrcs 1986 this methodology is typically not recommended in academic literature moglen 2000 ormsbee et al 2020 schoener 2018 because an average imperviousness for a given lulc is assumed for example the cn tables in nrcs 1986 suggest an industrial watershed has 72 impervious cover or a residential watershed with ¼ acre 0 1 ha lots is 38 impervious some real world developments may deviate from these central estimates of imperviousness herein negligible differences were observed between the two composite cn methodologies fig 3 this result occurred because all monitored watersheds were representative of a single dominant lulc where the range of cns within a watershed varied minimally findings from grove et al 1998 and mccuen 2004 suggest area weighting for small variations in the cn i e those less than less than 5 will not hinder the accuracy of the composite cn methodology because vcn c1 was best fit to vobs amc corrections were only applied to this methodology vcn c1 amc fig 3 despite the overall best model performance the composite cn methodologies exclusively underpredicted runoff volume fig 3 pbias scores a finding which is corroborated by grove et al 1998 and ormsbee et al 2020 the composite cn methodology underestimates runoff volume because a simple weighted average of pervious and impervious areas within a watershed does not accurately depict the behavior of the entire watershed that is pervious area will generate disproportionally less runoff than impervious areas under the same rainfall this issue may be further exacerbated by difficulty modeling runoff from pervious areas appels et al 2016 to address underprediction of runoff volume in the composite cn method the cn d approach has been adopted in academic literature and has yielded more accurate runoff volume estimations grove et al 1998 jena et al 2012 niharika et al 2020 however the composite cn c1 methodology is still often considered the standard by practicing engineers since this methodology is outlined in nrcs 1986 and other governmental documents ormsbee et al 2020 additionally it outperformed the distributed approach herein when all watersheds were grouped together fig 3 it is important to consider the number of watersheds and magnitude by which each model outperformed others for example although the combined nse and kge scores for the vcn d were substantially less than both composite cn approaches this model had greater nse and kge scores for more than half of the watersheds than the composite cn models additionally the vv mlr 6 and vsm models had nse and kge scores greater than the composited cn models for roughly half of the watersheds it is likely the poor model performance at a few select watersheds in the vv mlr 6 vcn d and vsm models substantially hindered the overall nse and kge scores fig 3 furthermore an estimate from one or a select few storms that possess notable error can substantially hinder model statistics thus visual assessment of model fit should be used to complement statistical scores fig 4 it is equally important to consider the magnitude of nse and kge scores from each watershed moriasi et al 2007 categorized the following classifications for nse scores unsatisfactory nse 0 5 satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 good 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good 0 75 nse 1 the vcn c1 model had the most watersheds with nse scores classified satisfactory or better n 10 followed by vv vmlr 6 vcn c2 and vd n 9 vsm n 8 and vcn c1 amc n 6 none of these tallies include the forested watersheds since vsm is applicable to only urban watersheds nse scores for the vcn c1 model were unsatisfactory at madison farr hill highlander bd north and bd south according to moriasi et al 2007 generally nse scores were lower for watersheds with less imperviousness i e forested ldr and sfr lulcs due to the complexities in predicting runoff from pervious areas and or runoff threshold i e rainfall depth at which incipient runoff is generated binley et al 1991 this is apparent in fig 4 where scatter points deviate further from the 1 1 line in more pervious watersheds vcn c1 had nse scores less than 0 and 0 49 at bd north and bd south respectively because only 21 of the events satisfied the p ia condition in both watersheds yet 25 and 32 of the observed events produced runoff respectively low nse and kge scores may have been observed at highlander due to the presence of an agricultural field 4 5 ha approximately 38 of watershed area fig 1 which may have led to underpredictions of runoff volumes pbias 36 resulting from limitations present in the composite cn method acorn aragon and colorado consisted of primarily 0 1 ha lots which is a distinct subcategory of the residential lulc in nrcs 1986 this category assumes an impervious percentage of 38 which only corresponds with the colorado watershed table 1 both aragon and acorn had higher imperviousness 45 table 1 possibly explaining why vcn c1 more severely underestimated runoff volume at acorn and aragon pbias 34 and 16 respectively compared to model vcn c2 pbias 23 and 3 2 respectively these results reiterate why the cn c2 methodology is increasingly implemented as opposed to cn c1 in academic literature especially when multiple lulcs are present in a single watershed the distributed cn approach was a better fit to vobs at gateway madison wilmington farr hill main mound s tech bd north and bd south compared to the composite cn approaches figs 3 and 4 that is the distributed method was a more suitable model than the composite method when dcia was extreme table 1 when the impervious area was mixed between dcia and uia vcn d overestimated runoff since runoff from uias could infiltrate into native soils before reaching the storm sewer system methodologies to account for uia exist as shown in schoener 2018 who found the proportion of dcia versus uia to be a critically important attribute in runoff prediction for smaller events however this adjustment is only applicable to composite cn approaches dcia uia can be impractical for practicing engineers to incorporate in drainage analyses due to challenges in accurately quantifying this metric schoener 2018 in future literature researchers should seek a methodology to segregate dcia and uia in the distributed cn approach modifications to the cn methodology to account for amc were established in ward and trimble 2003 however adjusting cn c1 the cn that produced the overall best model fits herein for amc never improved model predictions i e in terms of kge scores for watersheds evaluated herein this was also true for nse scores in all watersheds except mound and bd north fig 3 additionally accounting for amc corrections further exacerbated instances where p ia and modeled runoff volume was zero fig 4 this methodology often adjusted the magnitude of cn c1 substantially table s1 causing large differences in modeled runoff volume predictions this is apparent because the vcn c1 amc model more severely underestimated runoff volume in every watershed except colorado and highlander than this model without amc corrections figs 3 and 4 bondelid et al 1982 and hawkins 1975 found slight variations in cns yield disproportionally larger variations in estimated runoff thus amc corrections may yield improved estimates if cns were altered more modestly it should be noted adp was dropped in boruta s algorithm fig 2 this result is logical for highly impervious urban watersheds where the dominant surface coverage is not soil as adp and other rainfall characteristics and soil amc are clearly related abraham et al 2021 ziadat and taimeh 2013 nse and kge scores also generally decreased for the forested watersheds when amcs were applied fig 3 which may corroborate that cns were adjusted too drastically or suggest that large quantities of interception by tree coverage were not accurately depicted by the cn model runoff volumes from all cn methodologies composited distributed amc assumed that λ 0 2 because numerous instances of the condition p ia were not met during events with observed runoff it stands to reason this assumption is erroneous optimal λ values established through the minimum objective function equation 10 for each watershed for vcn c1 do not support this assumption table 5 the range of optimal values when considering each watershed independently ranged from λ 0 gateway madison farr hill main to λ 0 32 highlander table 5 generally the more impervious a watershed the more λ decreased the one exception was at the municipal watershed λ 0 17 which may be reflective of substantial volume losses due to urban karst see section 3 2 1 other studies also confirm error in λ and generally report a lower optimal value than the λ 0 2 value presented in nrcs 1986 cazier and hawkins 1984 suggested an average value of 0 0006 while hawkins and khojeini 2000 recommended values between 0 and 0 0966 these results also suggest this ratio is not constant for different watersheds jiang 2001 performed a comprehensive investigation of the ratio between ia and s in which the author utilized data from 307 watersheds spanning over 28 000 storm events briefly jiang 2001 discovered λ varies based on watershed and rainfall characteristics however 90 of the λ values were less than the 0 2 ratio leading to the conclusion of an optimal value of λ equal to 0 05 results herein confirm a lower optimal λ as the median across all watersheds was λ 0 12 however values of λ that were below or above the first and third quartiles i e 0 01 and 0 17 respectively might provide evidence for error in cns from nrcs 1986 furthermore the wide range of λ values suggest a single λ value likely will be a source of error in cn method estimations of runoff volume ormsbee et al 2020 cautioned that a new λ value cannot simply be implemented into equation 3 hawkins et al 2009 developed a cn adjustment if the new λ value was 0 05 however future work should consider cn adjustments for a range of λ values based on statistical scores from predictions across all watersheds the simple method performed unsatisfactory i e nse and kge scores of 0 02 and 0 04 respectively fig 3 for the most highly impervious watersheds gateway madison municipal wilmington farr hill main mound and s tech runoff volume responses were well fit to vobs many of the watersheds had greater nse and kge scores than vcn c1 fig 3 including only watersheds greater than 45 impervious the vsm model had nse and kge scores of 0 85 and 0 76 respectively pbias 11 5 this is also evident in fig 4 where the gray colored scatter points in highly impervious watersheds fit much tighter around the 1 1 line than other colored scatter points these results suggest that vsm is more reliable than vcn c1 when a watershed is more than 45 impervious of these watersheds all of the nse scores were considered good and 63 of them would be considered very good model agreement moriasi et al 2007 model vv mlr 6 fit the observed data well for the majority of watersheds however runoff from several events was substantially overpredicted at mound and highlander figs 3 and 4 this could be due to the presence of two small gravel parking lots 0 27 ha or 14 of watershed area that was included as impervious area in the mound watershed and the agricultural field in highlander as previously discussed fig 1 increased rainfall depth may be needed to generate runoff in these small sub basins than predicted in the vv mlr 6 model cross validation of the vv mlr 6 model with data outside this study would be needed to confirm this model as a generally suitable methodology for runoff volume prediction further the vv mlr 6 model would need to be limited to the attributes considered in this study overall the vcn c1 model provided the best predictions of vobs but underestimated runoff volume produced from most storm events fig 4 leading to a negative pbias score in each watershed fig 3 this methodology is suitable for design of urban drainage systems but is less accurate for watersheds representative of pre development conditions ldr and sfr lulcs i e accuracy decreases with decreasing imperviousness the vcn d model addressed many of the concerns of the composited approach however it only outperformed the composite method when dcia was extremely low or high cn methodologies have been used to estimate volume where measurement of inflow to an scm is difficult or impossible to perform braswell et al 2018 li et al 2009 passeport et al 2009 tirpak et al 2020 2021b winston et al 2016b 2018 results herein suggest this would not yield accurate scm volume reduction or pollutant load reduction quantification for a large proportion of storms as all cn methodologies were inaccurate for storms less than 12 5 mm i e the majority of observed storm events the simple method which is used in ohio s npdes permits produced the most reliable predictions when the watershed was more than 45 impervious when watersheds were more than 45 impervious the simple method outperformed all other models figs 3 and 4 however it was also inaccurate for storms less than 12 5 mm figure s1 good model results from the cn and simple methods potentially suggest many of the significant differences observed in cv values between watersheds with similar attributes section 3 2 1 were not substantial the only model that was somewhat useful for small storms was vv mlr 6 in this case most watersheds had positive nse and kge scores but only three watersheds had nse scores classified as satisfactory 3 3 peak flow rate 3 3 1 field monitored results peak flow rates were normalized by watershed area to allow comparison between watersheds of different sizes table 6 normalizing by watershed area is a standard practice in the literature boening ulman et al 2022 boggs and sun 2011 ogden and dawdy 2003 and was justified herein since area was the second most important attribute for prediction of qobs fig 5 peak flows were not normalized by area for boruta s analysis madison wilmington and gateway produced the largest median qobs these watersheds were some of the most impervious had among the highest dcia and had higher sewer densities all of which were important and directly related attributes to qobs in boruta s algorithm fig 5 median qobs was the lowest at highlander among urban watersheds this watershed had the lowest imperviousness mild slopes and second lowest sewer density table 1 similar to results for runoff coefficients watersheds within the same lulc had significant variability p 0 002 in all cases in qobs this implies factors beyond lulc may need to be considered when determining a crat for the rational method median qobs were not significantly different from two commercial lulc watersheds main and municipal 12 1 and 9 19 l s ha respectively but the qobs at wilmington 20 l s ha was significantly greater than main and municipal since qobs was normalized by watershed area and rainfall characteristics were not different across any watershed slope likely resulted in the larger qobs at wilmington watershed slope at wilmington was 3 4 and 1 9 times greater than slope at municipal and main respectively table 1 wilmington also had a much larger sewer density 282 m ha than municipal 211 m ha median qobs was significantly greater at gateway 18 2 l s ha than s tech 8 44 l s ha both of which represented the light industrial lulc though gateway had a lower slope than s tech it was 23 more impervious and had a denser sewer network 121 m ha table 1 median qobs were not significantly different between acorn 4 63 l s ha and aragon 6 09 l s ha the median qobs was slightly larger at aragon likely due to its sewer density which was greater than other sfr lulc watersheds acorn and aragon both had significantly greater qobs than colorado colorado had the smallest watershed slope 0 5 sewer density 107 m ha and a substantially larger watershed area null had a significantly greater median qobs 3 99 l s ha than highlander 0 73 l s ha both representing the ldr lulc though the sewer density was less at null the watershed slope was substantially larger table 1 peak 5 minute rainfall intensity and watershed area were the two most important attributes to qobs fig 5 because peak 5 minute rainfall intensity was the most important attribute it may be a more useful attribute to predict peak flow rates than irat or itc this is because the rational method often underpredicts peak flows since irat and itc correspond to too long a duration for rainfall to truly have a constant intensity chin 2019 attributes with a directly proportional relationship with qobs were peak 5 minute rainfall intensity watershed area rainfall depth average rainfall intensity imperviousness sewer density and dcia attributes with an inverse relationship included rainfall duration time to peak and flow duration watershed slope had an inverse relationship with peak flow rate which contradicts the literature liu et al 2017 taylor and schwarz 1952 this result may be attributed to the colorado watershed the largest watershed 149 ha which produced the largest peak flow rates median 0 34 m3 s and had the shallowest slopes 0 5 table 1 excluding colorado and the forested watersheds i e rather steep but least impervious slope had a direct relationship with peak flow rate watershed slope results may be confounded due to the relatively small number of monitored watersheds n 15 in a predominantly flat region rainfall intensity during the time of concentration and watershed area are two of the three variables utilized in the rational method which coincide with the most important attributes for prediction of qobs fig 5 re running boruta s algorithm with itc as an attribute yielded itc as a less important attribute than peak 5 minute intensity but more important than average intensity this result questions the validity of the assumption of constant rainfall intensity throughout the tc of a watershed additionally these results suggest future investigation of which rainfall intensity i e peak 3 minute 5 minute 10 minute etc would be the ideal indicator of peak flow and how it may vary between different urban watersheds 3 3 2 comparing peak flow rate to predictive equations despite similar attributes among watersheds representing the same lulc significant differences in qobs were still observed underlining the potential for error in predictive methodologies that rely on these attributes thus a variety of m lr equations created herein were explored such that itc difficult to obtain was not an input variable the user does not need to subjectively select a crat value and additional attributes were considered table 7 though imperviousness was more important to qobs than dcia fig 5 a result that aligns with sohn et al 2020 imperviousness did not improve mlr model fit beyond levels explained by lulc table 7 as such equation q mlr 5 was selected as the best fit equation since it had less interaction terms than equation q mlr 7 further equation q mlr 8 was explored because the model remained well fit while further increasing model utility since average rainfall intensity is easier to determine than peak 5 minute rainfall intensity in general more attributes were required to predict qobs with lower r2 than vobs table 4 table 7 the explicit q mlr 5 and q mlr 8 equations and parameter constants as well as data repositories and code are provided in simpson 2023 uncertainty in peak flow rate prediction arises because the parameter is often more sensitive to fluctuations in rainfall patterns than volume mandapaka et al 2009 and due to random error that cannot be accounted for in hydrologic models especially for smaller watersheds cunha et al 2012 the qrat model using the maximum crat qrat cmax had the greatest overall nse and kge scores of 0 69 and 0 67 respectively and lowest absolute value overall pbias score 9 3 fig 6 this is largely due to the poor fit of the qq mlr 5 model at the bd north bd south and mound watersheds fig 6 kge scores for qq mlr 5 were considerably greater than qrat cmax for every watershed except mound s tech colorado and bd north thus qq mlr 5 was a typically a better model fit model qq mlr 5 had nse scores considered satisfactory or better at seven of the watersheds all of which were urban model qq mlr 8 was the only model to produce any positive nse and or kge scores for the forested watersheds suggesting predictions of pre development surrogate peak flows are substantially inaccurate in every other model fig 7 factors deemed important to peak flow that were not included in predictive equations herein include length of longest flow path amc and temporal variations or pulses in rainfall intensity al rawas and valeo 2010 miller et al 2021 taylor and schwarz 1952 torres 2008 results from the qrat cmid methodology support the findings from chin 2019 that the rational method generally underestimates peak flows often peak flows were also underestimated when examining the qrat cmax model as exhibited by an overall pbias score of 9 3 fig 6 and the green scatter points in fig 7 however in some cases with the qrat cmax model aragon municipal mound s tech colorado highlander bd north and bd south peak flows were overestimated fig 6 but the only watersheds where peak flows were severely and almost exclusively overestimated were highlander bd north and bd south which were the three most pervious watersheds fig 7 chin 2019 also noted the rational method is generally less accurate in less developed watersheds but specific instances in the urban environment where the rational method is less accurate have not been well documented herein watersheds with satisfactory qrat cmax model fits ranged most lulcs and impervious coverage additionally due to the relatively low number of monitored watersheds an overarching pattern addressing this gap of knowledge has yet to be determined wisner et al 1980 found the rational method to have close agreement with peak flows predicted by a model constructed in storm water management model swmm for watersheds less than 8 1 ha nse and kge for most watersheds less than 8 1 ha were considered unsatisfactory herein wisner et al 1980 also noted a slight increase in crat would optimize rational method outputs for watersheds larger than 40 ha the only watershed greater than 40 ha herein was colorado and results from equation 11 do not support this finding table 5 in all watersheds except mound colorado highlander bd north and bd south increasing the crat max value decreased error utilizing equation 11 in many of the watersheds gateway madison municipal wilmington farr hill main highlander and bd north progressively increasing or decreasing crat beyond reasonable values continued to minimize the objective function table 5 furthermore no watershed had optimal crat values less than 10 different than the mean allowable crat value equation 6 thus there is inherent error in selecting a crat value as well as determining irat herein irat was assumed to be equivalent to itc estimations of tc herein utilized flow data which likely decreased error compared to estimating tc solely from watershed characteristics however lag time was calculated under the assumption of a normal rainfall distribution which seldomly occurred and may have contributed to error in the applied methodology variability in estimates of tc have been observed throughout the literature fang et al 2008 grimaldi et al 2012 mccuen 2009 sandoval erazo et al 2018 with differences in tc up to 500 depending on calculation methodology grimaldi et al 2012 it seems plausible that rainfall intensity is the culprit of more uncertainty when estimating peak flow rate using the rational method than selecting a runoff coefficient table 5 future research should look to reduce error in tc estimates rather than comparing multiple methodologies to one another seventy one storms of greater depth than the one year reoccurrence interval with duration greater than the watershed s median tc were observed figure s3 supplementary material because monitoring occurred for roughly one year in each watershed statistics suggest one storm per watershed should have remained in the dataset however each watershed averaged nearly five storms greater than the aforementioned threshold suggesting the monitoring period was particularly wet or the current rainfall events more frequently exceed point precipitation frequency estimates due to the effects of climate change considering all 71 events across all watersheds the qrat cmax model performed better than the mean or minimum crat models the qrat cmax model produced a nse score of 0 65 and kge score of 0 55 which would be considered good with a pbias of 21 this underprediction despite larger storms depths is likely due to the violation of the rational method assumption that a watershed s crat remains constant throughout a storm and for all storm events generally nse kge and pbias scores were slightly worsened when considering storms above the one year threshold as opposed to all monitored events fig 6 figure s3 however the slight decline in goodness of fit scores is likely because the n value declined from 838 storms table 2 to 71 storms which caused a drop in statistical power of the implemented tests rather than larger storms inducing uncertainty in the rational method nonetheless results herein suggest that focusing on larger events does not improve peak flow prediction across any of the implemented methodologies overall there was much more uncertainty when predicting peak flow rate than runoff volume even when more attributes were considered in models created herein table 4 table 7 this was primarily due to variable rainfall intensity that occurred throughout a given event often resulting in multiple local peaks e g fig 2 in simpson and winston 2022b additionally the rational method contains error in both the crat and irat estimates many authors have quantified peak flow rate reduction in scms using the rational method to predict the influent peak flow rate braswell et al 2018 tirpak et al 2021b winston et al 2016a b 2018 results herein suggest this would yield substantial error in calculating peak flow reduction specifically because performance of the rational method was unsatisfactory for many of the watersheds figs 6 and 7 the mlr equation created herein q mlr 5 based on peak 5 minute rainfall intensity produced nse scores considered satisfactory or better for 47 percent or the watersheds 54 of the urban watersheds which proved to be more accurate than the rational method but would require cross validation before future use there exists a need to improve peak flow estimation to inform the design of urban drainage infrastructure design of scms and assess scm performance perhaps model improvements could be made by assuming peak flow rates are not a linear function i e as was in the mlr models created herein a theory supported by may and sivakumar 2009 and ogden and dawdy 2003 there is also a continued need to improve estimations for watershed tc 4 conclusions hydrologic responses to storm events were monitored from 13 urban watersheds representative of distinct lulcs and two forested watersheds representative of surrogate pre development conditions in ohio usa a feature selection algorithm was applied to the data to find the most important attributes influencing runoff volume and peak flow rates which were included in mlr equations to predict watershed hydrologic responses runoff volumes observed in the field were compared to runoff volumes estimated via the mlr equation created herein the composited and distributed cn methods and the simple method peak flow rates monitored in the field were compared to peak flow rates estimated via the mlr equations created herein and the rational method using three different runoff coefficients to further expound on design robustness and failure mode operations particularly in the face of climate change future work should analyze hydrologic data as a continuous dataset moving beyond the event based approach employed herein for example utilizing flow duration curves insight and knowledge could be gained on extreme runoff events that may overtax urban drainage infrastructure and scms considering all monitored watersheds runoff volume calculated by the curve number using the area weighted mean cn cn c1 had the highest nse and kge scores and was the most versatile model but the simple method produced more nse scores that would be considered very good and good model fits thus a single model may not be optimal in all scenarios for example the simple method and distributed curve number method were more accurate than the cn c1 model when watersheds were more than 45 impervious and when dcia was extremely low or high respectively results from boruta s algorithm revealed adp was not an important attribute to runoff volume a result confirmed when amc corrections were applied to the cn c1 method and substantially lowered nse and kge scores until a soil amc methodology that more marginally adjusts watershed cns is adopted amc corrections to the cn of an urban watershed are not advised based on findings herein the optimal ratio between initial abstraction and maximum storage potential i e λ in the cn c1 method was not constant for all watersheds the median optimized λ value was 0 12 suggesting practitioners should use a lower value for λ than the industry standard of 0 2 the mlr model created herein proved accurate but did not produce nse or kge scores substantially better than the other models except when storms were less than 12 5 mm improved small storm hydrologic methodologies should be a focus of future work to more adequately model annual runoff volume pollutant export and pollutant load reduction from scms the mlr analysis revealed more attributes were needed to predict peak flow rate than runoff volume and model fit was stronger for runoff volume these results highlight stochastic error that is unable to be accounted for in hydrologic particularly peak flow models of small watersheds of the models evaluated herein the rational method with maximum crat value had the greatest nse and kge scores suggesting the rational method typically underestimated peak flow however six watersheds had satisfactory nse scores only one of which was high enough to be considered very good when obtaining the optimal runoff coefficient for the rational method it was discovered that substantial uncertainty existed in itc as well as crat generally reliability of peak flow prediction increased when decreasing the window of time over which a peak rainfall intensity was calculated future work should investigate the optimal rainfall intensity i e peak 3 minute 5 minute etc for peak flow prediction from a variety of watersheds in a few cases peak flow models performed satisfactorily but there still exists a need to improve peak flow estimates to adequately design drainage systems and scms as well as tc estimates furthermore it is critically important to consider future climate conditions in the basis of design as it was evident that the observed rainfall events were either reflective of a particularly wet monitoring period or more repeatedly exceeded point precipitation frequency estimates due to the

2047,the need for resilient stormwater infrastructure is increasingly critical as urbanization and climate change continue to threaten water resources engineers and practitioners require reliable methodologies to estimate rainfall runoff responses to adequately size and design sewer pipes and inlets flood controls and stormwater control measures scms the national resource conservation service technical release 55 often referred to as curve number cn method simple and rational methods are methodologies commonly implemented for such designs by regulatory agencies due to the limited inputs needed to estimate runoff however uncertainty is present in each model since they simplify actual hydrological processes in this study 13 urban and two forested watersheds were monitored and their observed hydrologic responses were compared to modeled hydrologic responses utilizing the aforementioned methods significant differences in observed normalized runoff volumes i e runoff coefficients and normalized peak flow rates were found between watersheds with similar watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns demonstrating the meticulous model inputs required to differentiate hydrologic responses between similar watersheds a suite of alternative predictive models informed by feature selection algorithms were formulated and compared to the performance of standard methods results suggested that composite cn methods were the best predictors of event runoff volume across all watersheds nash sutcliffe nse and kling gupta efficiencies kge of 0 74 and 0 52 respectively but were outperformed by the simple method for watersheds with more than 45 impervious cover nse and kge scores of 0 85 and 0 76 respectively however composite cn methods underestimated runoff volume from every watershed a limitation that was intended to be addressed through the creation of the distributed cn method in the distributed approach runoff volume estimations were improved compared to the composite cn approach only when directly connected impervious area in the watershed was extremely high or extremely low the multi linear regression runoff volume model created herein did not outperform traditional runoff models except when rainfall depth was less than 12 5 mm i e the storms for which traditional runoff volume estimation methods performed the worst uncertainty in modeled peak flow rate was substantially greater than for runoff volume nse and kge scores between 0 48 0 55 and 0 39 0 67 respectively across all methodologies there is a continued need to develop more dependable estimates of peak flow which are critical to the design of pipes flood routing and hydrograph prediction overall these results suggest one model is not optimal in all scenarios

method increasingly adopted by municipalities to mitigate the detrimental impacts of urban stormwater bell et al 2020 because hydrology has been labeled a critical driver of aquatic ecosystem health booth et al 2002 wenger et al 2009 research often suggests stormwater management is best achieved through hydrologic mitigation as opposed to nutrient cycling pollutant abatement or temperature

widely accepted and used in engineering practice in the united states and beyond due in part to the limited inputs needed to estimate runoff these equations are fundamental to the design of urban

drainage infrastructure is sized properly to achieve long term function and return on investment is by improving hydrologic models which underpin their design the cn method was developed in 1954 by the soil conservation service now nrcs and revised extensively in 1975 usda and scs 1975 and 1986 nrcs 1986 this method predicts runoff depth ynrcs as a function of precipitation depth p maximum potential retention s and initial abstraction ia as shown in equation 1 1 y nrcs p i a 2 p i a s runoff depth is calculated under the condition p ia such that the numerator is greater than zero when p is less than ia ynrcs is equal to zero ia and s are both empirically derived equation 2 equation 3 cns were also empirically derived and can be obtained from tables in nrcs 1986 as a function of land use and land cover lulc and hydrologic soil group hsg 2 s 1000 cn 10 25 4 3 i a 0 2 s cns can be amended to account for antecedent moisture conditions amc ward and trimble 2003 the cn method is the most widely used predictive equation for runoff volume because of its ease of use and it has federal and other authoritative bodies support i e users of this methodology receive a degree of protection in legal cases where this method did not perform accurately eli and lamont 2010 despite this the cn method has numerous limitations eli and lamont 2010 hawkins et al 2009 the cn of a watershed changes as a function of rainfall depth and rainfall distribution especially since the method does not account for infiltration during low intensity storms eli and lamont 2010 typically experimentally calibrated cns decline with increasing storm depth as such tabulated cns in nrcs 1986 were determined from horizontal asymptotes of the runoff rainfall relationship i e at large rainfall depths thereby limiting the applicability of this methodology in smaller more frequent events hawkins 1993 lastly it is imprudent to assume the ratio between ia and s 0 2 often referred to as λ is constant and applicable for all types of lulcs and storms cazier and hawkins 1984 chen 1976 jiang 2001 performed a comprehensive study optimizing the λ value and found that λ 0 05 corresponded better to empirical data from urban and forested watersheds however randusová et al 2015 found the cn to be better fit with empirical data from watersheds predominately covered by forests using λ 0 20 thus using λ 0 05 has become more common in recent years for urban watersheds in academic settings the simple method developed by schueler 1987 is utilized to model runoff volume from a watershed as a function of imperviousness watershed area and rainfall depth a predicted runoff coefficient csm is related to the fraction of impervious area in the watershed equation 4 4 c sm 0 05 0 9 i the simple method was developed for annual runoff volume and load prediction schueler 1987 and is used for national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits in the state of ohio oepa 2018 where this research took place the simplicity of this method makes it popular however various watershed and rainfall characteristics are ignored such as lulc watershed slope disconnected impervious surfaces underlying soil type antecedent dry period adp and rainfall intensity additionally the simple method assumes a constant csm throughout a storm and from storm to storm the rational method was developed by mulvaney 1851 and is the most widely used methodology to predict runoff peak flow rate it is an empirical relationship between peak flow qrat and rainfall intensity irat with the rainfall duration equal to the time of concentration tc of a watershed utilizing a constant runoff coefficient crat and watershed area a equation 5 5 q rat c rat i rat a restrictions regarding use of this methodology are implemented for maximum watershed size and vary greatly between jurisdictions the method has remained unchanged since its creation despite increased knowledge of rainfall runoff processes chin 2019 for example the rational method has various underlying assumptions which are often overlooked in engineering design including 1 no spatial or temporal variation in rainfall intensity during the tc 2 runoff coefficients remain constant throughout a storm and from storm to storm 3 the entire watershed contributes to runoff and 4 the contributing watershed area is uniform butler and davis 2011 wang and wang 2018 furthermore chin 2019 also noted rational runoff coefficients vary with geographic setting time of concentration and soil infiltration rate peak flow rates are usually underestimated due to the constant rainfall assumption and rational runoff coefficients can be greater than one recent research has focused on amending widely accepted runoff estimation methodologies wang and wang 2018 zeng et al 2017 however repeated studies with consistent results for new modified methodologies are required to be accepted by design engineers and regulatory agencies further few studies compare field results to multiple predictive methodologies to recommend specific scenarios where one model may be most applicable thus in this study rainfall runoff hydrology data from 13 urban and two forested watersheds were collected to compare against multiple existing methods e g cn rational and simple and newly created hydrologic models the objectives of this work were to 1 compare field monitored hydrologic responses between watersheds to understand the effects of watershed characteristics on runoff volume and peak flow 2 identify watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns hereafter these are referred to as attributes which influence predictive performance of hydrologic models using a feature selection algorithm boruta s algorithm to develop alternative predictive models and 3 compare field monitored runoff volume and peak flow rate to predictions from the cn method simple method rational method and models created herein assessing their applicability under current climate decades after they were originally developed excluding the models created herein results and conclusions from this work can aid the design of drainage systems and scms by characterizing the advantages and drawbacks of each methodology compared to another improve hydrologic monitoring of scms when scms receive run on via sheet flow and increase accuracy of pollutant load removal estimations 2 methods 2 1 watershed descriptions rainfall and resulting runoff hydrology were monitored from 13 urban watersheds in the dayton ohio usa metro area and two forested watersheds in the big darby accord more specifically battelle darby creek metro park of central ohio fig 1 data collected from the two forested watersheds served as surrogates for pre development conditions for the midwestern united states each urban watershed was representative of a distinct lulc e g residential commercial industrial etc lulc and watershed boundaries were defined in arcgis 10 6 1 arcgis 2018 using aerial imagery sewer network data and lidar data these data were supplemented by field observations of connected imperviousness downspout disconnections disturbed areas and other factors that might affect watershed hydrology that are specified in source loading and management model s winslamm field sheets watershed characteristics are presented in table 1 six of the urban watersheds were located in kettering ohio monitoring commenced in october 2018 for acorn gateway and wilmington while monitoring began in march 2019 for the remaining watersheds aragon madison municipal monitoring continued in all six kettering watersheds through december 2019 five of the watersheds farr hill main mound null s tech were located in springboro ohio while two colorado highlander were in xenia ohio monitoring in springboro and xenia commenced in march 2020 and ceased in june 2021 monitoring of the forested watersheds bd north bd south took place from may 2020 through may 2021 all monitoring efforts were decommissioned in the winter december march to avoid freezing conditions that could damage monitoring equipment all watershed outfalls discharged untreated stormwater i e scms were not present in any of the monitored watersheds 2 2 data collection a 0 25 mm tipping bucket rain gauge davis instruments hayward california was installed near each watershed outfall in a location free from overhead obstructions each rain gauge recorded data at 1 minute intervals to a hobo pendant logger onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts manual rain gauges were also deployed and used to verify tipping bucket gauge readings storm events were separated by a minimum 6 hour dry period and a minimum rainfall depth of 2 54 mm teledyne isco 750 area velocity meters avms teledyne isco lincoln nebraska were mounted to each storm sewer outfall in the case of urban watersheds or culverts in the forested watersheds runoff velocity was measured via the doppler effect with ultrasonic waves emitted from the avm bouncing off particles or bubbles in the flow flow depth was measured via an onboard pressure transducer one springboro xenia or two kettering minute interval velocity and level data were transmitted to an isco 6712 autosampler where flow rates were calculated using equations based on the cross sectional geometry of the pipe and integrated with time to determine flow volume because the isco 6712 autosamplers lack several inputs needed to accurately quantify flow in elliptical or arched pipes e g radii of the top arch bottom arch center arch the methods created by perez et al 2015 were used to establish a relationship between depth of flow and hydraulic radius for the elliptical pipe draining the mound watershed all other urban pipes were circular thus data collected from the autosampler could be used to determine flow rate and volume using predetermined cross sectional area relationships rectangular weirs were constructed immediately downstream of the avms in the forested watersheds the avms measured the depth of runoff over the weir at one minute intervals simpson and winston 2022a determined that avms may yield erroneous readings when runoff velocities were below 0 08 m s or when runoff was particularly clear i e low turbidity because this was a common occurrence in only the forested watersheds flow rates were determined using a standard broad crested weir equation 2 3 data analysis all data were analyzed in r statistical software r core team 2021 2 3 1 hydrologic parameter calculation and statistical testing runoff depth yobs was calculated as the quotient of observed stormwater volume vobs and watershed area on a storm by storm basis further a volumetric runoff coefficient cv was calculated for each storm event as the quotient of yobs and rainfall depth an overall runoff coefficient cv sum was calculated for each watershed by dividing the sum of yobs by the sum of rainfall depth over the duration of the monitoring period runoff volumes and peak flow rates defined as the single greatest flow rate during each event from all monitored storms in each watershed were determined to be non normally distributed using the shapiro wilk test differences in cv and normalized peak flow rates between watersheds were assessed using the kruskal wallis test a nonparametric analysis of variance anova the dunn s test a pairwise multiple comparison post hoc test was used to determine which hydrologic response variables significantly varied by watershed a criterion of 95 confidence α 0 05 was utilized to determine statistical significance additionally hydrologic observations from different watersheds were compared with percent differences equation 6 6 difference obs 1 obs 2 obs 1 obs 2 0 5 100 2 3 2 boruta s algorithm feature selection to identify important attributes which influence response variables i e stormwater volume and peak flow rate was performed using the boruta package in r kursa and rudnicki 2010 this method is a wrapper i e uses a subset of features and trains a model using them around the random forest classification algorithm liaw and wiener 2002 and ranks the importance of both categorical and continuous attributes in the boruta algorithm a z score for each attribute is calculated as the ratio of the average loss of accuracy of classification caused by the random permutation of attribute values between each attribute to its standard deviation despite non normally distributed response variables boruta s algorithm is appropriate because z scores consider the fluctuations of the mean accuracy loss among unbiased weak classifiers kursa and rudnicki 2010 to determine importance the z score of each attribute was compared to the minimum mean and maximum z score of shadow features for each attribute iterative shadow copies were created by shuffling original values attributes with a significantly lower importance were consecutively dropped and after each iteration shadow copies were recreated an attribute was dropped if the z score for that attribute was less than the maximum z score among all shadow attributes the algorithm stops when only important attributes remain or when the set number of runs is reached default is 100 runs in the latter case attributes that have not been dropped or confirmed important are labelled as tentative methods exist to potentially eliminate tentative cases but no tentative cases were observed in the analysis performed herein watershed area lulc imperviousness directly connected impervious area dcia slope rainfall depth rainfall duration peak 5 minute rainfall intensity average rainfall intensity adp flow duration underground sewer length time to peak flow rate and season of the storm were attributes included in the boruta analysis due to the design of the algorithm all storm events with an na value for any attribute or response variable i e all storms in the main watershed where sewer data were invalid table 1 or the first storm of the monitoring season where adp could not be calculated were removed from the boruta analysis so the algorithm would run properly underground sewer length was normalized by watershed area to calculate sewer density since sewer length is a function of watershed size and watershed area was used as a separate attribute in the analysis 2 3 3 multi linear regression multi linear regression mlr analyses were performed using important attributes determined with boruta s algorithm as independent variables to predict runoff volume and peak flow responses a cube root transformation was performed on both runoff volume and peak flow rate to account for mlr model assumptions i e linearity equal variance of residuals and to avoid non finite responses of transformed variables which would be the case in logarithmic transformations when runoff volume and peak flow rate were zero various combinations of important attributes were explored in mlr analyses to determine which equation s provided the highest coefficient of determination r2 while utilizing easy to obtain attributes 2 3 4 comparing modeled versus observed hydrologic parameters monitored hydrologic responses were compared to predictions derived from the cn method the simple method the rational method and the mlr models created herein the cn of each watershed was calculated under a variety of potential weighting methods a first composite cn cn c1 was calculated by assigning cns from the dominant lulc and weighting by area in each hsg table s1 supplementary material i e using the same methodology presented in nrcs 1986 a second composite cn cn c2 was calculated by utilizing a cn of 98 for impervious areas and separately area weighting the type of pervious cover by hsg table s2 supplementary material for both cn c1 and cn c2 runoff depths ycn c1 and ycn c2 were calculated utilizing equation 1 lastly a distributed cn approach cn d was calculated wherein specific cns were used for each individual sub watershed table s2 runoff depths were calculated for each sub basin using equation 1 and were area weighted to obtain a runoff depth for the entire watershed ycn d in all cn methodologies λ was assumed to equal 0 2 and hsg was determined from web soil survey nrcs 2022 for all soils nrcs 2022 provided hsg classifications however some soils were classified as c d when this occurred the soil was classified as hsg d watershed areas were multiplied by ycn c1 ycn c2 and ycn d to obtain estimated runoff volumes for each scenario vcn c1 vcn c2 and vcn d respectively curve number adjustments utilizing soil amc were also considered for only the cn methodology that fit vobs best table s1 soils were considered dry amc i if less than 12 7 or 35 6 mm of rain occurred in the previous 5 day period during the dormant september april or growing may august seasons in ohio respectively soils were considered wet amc iii if more than 27 9 or 53 3 mm of rain occurred in the previous 5 day period in the dormant or growing season respectively otherwise soils were classified as amc ii conversions from amc ii to amc i or iii were computed via linear interpolation ward and trimble 2003 runoff volumes tabulated via amc adjusted cns were documented as vx amc where x is either cn c1 cn c2 or cn d runoff volume was also estimated with the simple method where csm was calculated based on the imperviousness fraction of an urban watershed schueler 1987 runoff volume vsm was calculated by multiplying csm with watershed area and precipitation depth vcn c1 vcn c2 vcn d vx amc vsm and predicted volume from the mlr analysis vmlr were compared to vobs goodness of fit for these comparisons was assessed with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 equation 7 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 equation 8 scores as well as the percentage of bias pbias equation 9 additionally model performance was assessed visually with scatter plots as recommended by jain and sudheer 2008 7 nse 1 t 1 n x s t x 0 t 2 t 1 n x 0 t μ 0 2 8 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 9 pbias i 1 n o p i 1 n o 100 it is generally accepted that negative nse scores are indicative of poor model performance i e the mean of the respective dataset is a better measure than model predictions while an nse value 0 indicates the model performed as well as the mean a positive nse value indicates that the model performed better than the mean knoben et al 2019 the kge is an improved version of nse wherein correlation r variability bias α and mean bias β are decomposed into constitutive components kge scores greater than 0 41 indicate improved model performance compared to the mean of the data set knoben et al 2019 pbias is the average tendency for a model to over or under predict an observation moriasi et al 2007 the optimal value for pbias is zero with positive and negative values corresponding to over and under predictions respectively field monitored peak flow rates qobs were compared to those calculated from the rational method qrat and the mlr analyses qmlr using nse kge pbias and scatter plots ranges of allowable crat values are provided for each lulc thus estimated peak flow rates for each storm were calculated under a variety of scenarios 1 using the minimum crat value 2 using the mean crat value and 3 using the maximum crat value presented in lindeburg 2011 appendix 20 a the rainfall intensity over the median time of concentration itc for each watershed was used for irat in rational method calculations there are several methods to estimate tc but many require several inputs which are difficult to obtain for urban watersheds with underground sewer infrastructure e g channel length and slope these parameters prohibit the use of commonly used tc estimations such as the kirpach equation kerby hathaway equation nrcs velocity method etc in urban watersheds thus as applied in other urban settings e g fang et al 2008 mccuen et al 1984 simas 1996 empirical estimates of tc were utilized in this study where tc is determined as 1 67 times the lag time lag time was defined as time to peak i e time between the onset of runoff and peak flow rate minus half of the rainfall measurement interval simas 1996 because peak flow rates are primarily used to design drainage systems and or scms data were also parsed such that only storms of greater depth than the one year recurrence interval for the duration greater than or equal to the median tc of the respective watershed were considered in an additional analysis storm depths equivalent to the one year median tc duration were found at the dayton mcd 33 2067 station using precipitation frequency tables generated by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2021 2 3 5 optimizing hydrologic predictions chen 1976 was among the first to suggest the assumption that the λ value i e ratio of ia to s in the cn methodology possessed error hawkins et al 2009 recommended a methodology to find the optimal value of s briefly this methodology uses a least squares fit between observed paired rainfall and runoff volume data the optimal λ was determined for only the best fit cn approach for each watershed as the value which minimized the objective function fcn x defined as 10 min f cn x min v x v obs 2 similarly for peak flow rate the optimal crat for each watershed was determined as the crat which minimized the objective function frat defined as 11 min f rat min q rat q obs 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitored storm events between 46 and 76 storm events above the qualifying storm event depth 2 54 mm were monitored from each watershed storm depth ranged from 2 8 to 90 7 mm storm characteristics including median depth median peak 5 minute intensity median average intensity median adp and median itc from all watersheds are presented in table 2 the number of monitored events between 2 54 and 12 5 mm are also shown as the cn method is less reliable for storms smaller than 12 5 mm nrcs 1986 at least 50 of storms were less than this threshold in all watersheds thus numerous instances existed where the cn method could result in large uncertainty fassman beck et al 2016 also noted more than half the storms below this threshold when aggregating paired rainfall runoff hydrology data from 21 living roof across varying climatic conditions globally exhibiting limitations of the cn method in other regions rainfall depth peak 5 minute rainfall intensity average rainfall intensity and adp did not vary significantly p 0 05 between watersheds 3 2 runoff coefficients and runoff volume 3 2 1 field monitored results kuichling 1889 discovered that the fraction of rainfall discharged as runoff i e runoff coefficient is nearly equivalent to the impervious coverage in a watershed results herein do not align with kuichling 1889 table 3 as the median cv from each urban watershed was 9 61 different equation 6 always lesser than the impervious percentage of the respective watershed the only watersheds where the percent difference was less than 20 were gateway madison wilmington main and farr hill excluding farr hill these were the only watersheds with impervious coverage greater than 50 of the total area and of which more than 90 of it was dcia thus an adjustment to the impervious fraction is needed to properly estimate cv such as that taken in the simple method schueler 1987 to make estimations of cv based solely on imperviousness more accurate however since watershed imperviousness was more often similar in magnitude to the 90th percentile cv table 3 the adjustment to imperviousness in the simple method to estimate a runoff coefficient may not be accurate when a watershed is less than roughly 50 impervious and or contains a considerable amount of unconnected impervious area uia cv values were observed to vary significantly p 0 001 in all cases between watersheds representing the same lulc watersheds in the commercial sfr and ldr lulc classifications had extremely similar imperviousness ldr ranged from 18 to 20 impervious sfr ranged from 38 to 45 impervious and commercial ranged from 78 to 81 impervious table 1 despite these similarities and no significant differences in rainfall characteristics runoff coefficients significantly varied suggesting runoff volume responses may not be accurately captured by the cn and simple methods or these significant differences may not be substantially different cv sum values in the literature ranged from 0 51 to 0 9 for parking lot passeport and hunt 2009 rushton 2001 were 0 4 and 0 61 for commercial ackerman and schiff 2003 charbeneau and barrett 1998 and ranged from 0 19 to 0 38 for sfr hood et al 2007 page et al 2015 smith et al 2020 lulcs further displaying variability alongside table 3 between watersheds representing the same lulc significant differences in cv values likely occurred in the light industrial lulc because of the substantial differences in impervious coverage at gateway and s tech table 1 median cv values in the commercial lulc were not significantly different between the main and wilmington watersheds yet both watersheds were significantly greater than municipal median cv values in the sfr lulc were significantly lower at the colorado and aragon watersheds compared to the acorn watershed cv values were significantly greater at null than highlander both representing the ldr lulc despite similar rainfall characteristics and imperviousness from watersheds of the same lulc significant differences in cv values could have resulted from the urban karst phenomenon where the volume of stormwater leaked from a sewer is assumed to be greater in systems with larger diameters e g colorado sfr lulc municipal commercial lulc this is because larger sewers have less structural stability and are subjected to longitudinal cracks and fractures davies et al 2001 o reilly et al 1989 other potential explanations include hsg of pervious areas soil compaction pitt et al 2008 curbed versus uncurbed roadways simpson et al 2020 tree canopy coverage selbig et al 2022 and other factors included in the feature selection analysis such as watershed slope dcia sewer density etc results of feature selection in relation to vobs using boruta s algorithm are presented in fig 2 rainfall depth and watershed area were overwhelmingly the most important attributes to vobs important attributes that had a positive relationship with vobs included rainfall depth watershed area flow duration imperviousness rain duration sewer density time to peak flow rate and dcia attributes that had an inverse relationship with vobs were watershed slope peak 5 minute rainfall intensity and average rainfall intensity adp and season were dropped from the algorithm and not considered important to vobs rainfall intensity was indirectly related to vobs as more intense events were typically shorter in duration and had lower depths rainfall depth was a substantially more important attribute to runoff volume than both peak 5 minute and average rain intensity fig 2 the indirect relationship between slope and vobs occurred because the watershed with the smallest slope colorado 0 5 had a watershed area i e the second most important attribute to vobs eight 75 fold greater than all other watershed areas furthermore the watersheds with the greatest slopes i e bd north bd south and null table 1 were 80 100 pervious and had substantially higher infiltration capacities than the more developed watersheds this unusual relationship may further be explained by a low number of monitored watersheds n 15 in a relatively flat region govers 1991 noted a directly proportional relationship between slope and runoff volume in soil plots and found slope to be a more critical attribute in larger drainage areas additionally meierdiercks et al 2017 identified a positive relationship between slope and runoff volume in urban watersheds ranging from 8 to 31 impervious cover if the two forested watersheds i e bd north and bd south and colorado i e the watershed with the largest area were removed from the dataset re running boruta s algorithm yielded slope as a much less important attribute with a positive relationship to volume these results suggest slope may be a more important attribute in urban watersheds than the forested watersheds where complete infiltration or abstraction of rainfall was far more likely to occur simpson and winston 2022b rainfall depth and watershed area were the most important attributes to vobs fig 2 in conjunction with these two attributes the cn method utilizes lulc to estimate the magnitude of the cn while the simple method utilizes imperviousness to estimate csm lulc and imperviousness were the fourth and sixth most important attributes to vobs respectively fig 2 in a meta analysis of runoff quality data from 170 urban watersheds simpson et al 2022 noted a correlation between lulc and imperviousness with imperviousness decreasing from the road lulc followed by commercial industrial mfr and sfr lulcs however every lulc comparison in simpson et al 2022 had overlapping ranges of imperviousness confirming results in brabec 2009 these overlaps highlight the potential uncertainty in runoff volumes estimated by the cn and simple methods given the many interacting factors which affect runoff generation in urban areas thus adjustments to existing models or the creation of new models may be necessary to produce more accurate estimations of runoff volume 3 2 2 comparing runoff volume to predictive equations because significant differences in cv were observed between watersheds with similar attributes and many attributes were important to vobs that are not included in the simple and cn methods various mlr models were developed with the goal of better improving runoff volume predictions table 4 though 12 attributes were deemed important utilizing boruta s algorithm fig 2 mlr analyses revealed minimal improvements in model accuracy determined by r2 values after three or four attributes were included in the model for example although sohn et al 2020 found dcia to be a more important predictor of runoff depth than impervious area dcia did not improve predictive capacity herein after imperviousness was incorporated into the model equation v mlr 7 had the best model fit but it included flow duration as a predictor variable a variable that is impossible to estimate therefore equation v mlr 6 was chosen as the optimal predictive equation because of suitable model fit e g r2 and residual standard error while relying on easily obtainable inputs in mlr predictive equations attributes that interact with one another are denoted with a multiplication symbol between terms the explicit v mlr 6 equation and parameter constants as well as data repositories and code are provided in simpson 2023 nse kge and pbias scores were tabulated for comparisons between vcn c1 vcn c2 vcn d vsm and vv mlr 6 to vobs the vcn c1 and vv mlr 6 the model created herein models were best fit to vobs nse 0 74 kge 0 52 and nse 0 7 kge 0 64 respectively across all watersheds and storms fig 3 model vcn c2 nse 0 74 kge 0 51 performed nearly as well as vcn c1 these three models performed substantially better than the vcn d and vsm models however when only storms less than 12 5 mm were considered i e the threshold for cn reliability nrcs 1986 nse and kge scores for model vcn c1 were substantially lower 0 29 and 0 53 respectively figure s1 supplementary material this result occurred because 61 of the storms less than 12 5 mm did not satisfy the condition p ia i e no predicted runoff yet 91 of the storms produced runoff demonstrating substantial error in ia estimates this error results from cns that were tabularly set based on their horizontal asymptotes with increasing rainfall depth refer to limitations in the introduction nse and kge scores also dramatically decreased for all other models except vv mlr 6 when considering only storms less than 12 5 mm when evaluating storms greater than 12 5 mm vcn c1 slightly outperformed vcn c2 and vv mlr 6 and were substantially better fit to measured data than vcn d and vsm figure s2 supplementary material in this case vcn c1 only 9 of the events did not satisfy the p ia condition eight occurrences from bd north 0 impervious seven from bd south 0 2 impervious five from colorado 38 impervious and 13 from highlander 18 impervious the vcn c1 vcn 2 and vv mlr 6 models had the highest overall nse and kge scores fig 3 though examples of the cn c1 methodology are provided in nrcs 1986 this methodology is typically not recommended in academic literature moglen 2000 ormsbee et al 2020 schoener 2018 because an average imperviousness for a given lulc is assumed for example the cn tables in nrcs 1986 suggest an industrial watershed has 72 impervious cover or a residential watershed with ¼ acre 0 1 ha lots is 38 impervious some real world developments may deviate from these central estimates of imperviousness herein negligible differences were observed between the two composite cn methodologies fig 3 this result occurred because all monitored watersheds were representative of a single dominant lulc where the range of cns within a watershed varied minimally findings from grove et al 1998 and mccuen 2004 suggest area weighting for small variations in the cn i e those less than less than 5 will not hinder the accuracy of the composite cn methodology because vcn c1 was best fit to vobs amc corrections were only applied to this methodology vcn c1 amc fig 3 despite the overall best model performance the composite cn methodologies exclusively underpredicted runoff volume fig 3 pbias scores a finding which is corroborated by grove et al 1998 and ormsbee et al 2020 the composite cn methodology underestimates runoff volume because a simple weighted average of pervious and impervious areas within a watershed does not accurately depict the behavior of the entire watershed that is pervious area will generate disproportionally less runoff than impervious areas under the same rainfall this issue may be further exacerbated by difficulty modeling runoff from pervious areas appels et al 2016 to address underprediction of runoff volume in the composite cn method the cn d approach has been adopted in academic literature and has yielded more accurate runoff volume estimations grove et al 1998 jena et al 2012 niharika et al 2020 however the composite cn c1 methodology is still often considered the standard by practicing engineers since this methodology is outlined in nrcs 1986 and other governmental documents ormsbee et al 2020 additionally it outperformed the distributed approach herein when all watersheds were grouped together fig 3 it is important to consider the number of watersheds and magnitude by which each model outperformed others for example although the combined nse and kge scores for the vcn d were substantially less than both composite cn approaches this model had greater nse and kge scores for more than half of the watersheds than the composite cn models additionally the vv mlr 6 and vsm models had nse and kge scores greater than the composited cn models for roughly half of the watersheds it is likely the poor model performance at a few select watersheds in the vv mlr 6 vcn d and vsm models substantially hindered the overall nse and kge scores fig 3 furthermore an estimate from one or a select few storms that possess notable error can substantially hinder model statistics thus visual assessment of model fit should be used to complement statistical scores fig 4 it is equally important to consider the magnitude of nse and kge scores from each watershed moriasi et al 2007 categorized the following classifications for nse scores unsatisfactory nse 0 5 satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 good 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good 0 75 nse 1 the vcn c1 model had the most watersheds with nse scores classified satisfactory or better n 10 followed by vv vmlr 6 vcn c2 and vd n 9 vsm n 8 and vcn c1 amc n 6 none of these tallies include the forested watersheds since vsm is applicable to only urban watersheds nse scores for the vcn c1 model were unsatisfactory at madison farr hill highlander bd north and bd south according to moriasi et al 2007 generally nse scores were lower for watersheds with less imperviousness i e forested ldr and sfr lulcs due to the complexities in predicting runoff from pervious areas and or runoff threshold i e rainfall depth at which incipient runoff is generated binley et al 1991 this is apparent in fig 4 where scatter points deviate further from the 1 1 line in more pervious watersheds vcn c1 had nse scores less than 0 and 0 49 at bd north and bd south respectively because only 21 of the events satisfied the p ia condition in both watersheds yet 25 and 32 of the observed events produced runoff respectively low nse and kge scores may have been observed at highlander due to the presence of an agricultural field 4 5 ha approximately 38 of watershed area fig 1 which may have led to underpredictions of runoff volumes pbias 36 resulting from limitations present in the composite cn method acorn aragon and colorado consisted of primarily 0 1 ha lots which is a distinct subcategory of the residential lulc in nrcs 1986 this category assumes an impervious percentage of 38 which only corresponds with the colorado watershed table 1 both aragon and acorn had higher imperviousness 45 table 1 possibly explaining why vcn c1 more severely underestimated runoff volume at acorn and aragon pbias 34 and 16 respectively compared to model vcn c2 pbias 23 and 3 2 respectively these results reiterate why the cn c2 methodology is increasingly implemented as opposed to cn c1 in academic literature especially when multiple lulcs are present in a single watershed the distributed cn approach was a better fit to vobs at gateway madison wilmington farr hill main mound s tech bd north and bd south compared to the composite cn approaches figs 3 and 4 that is the distributed method was a more suitable model than the composite method when dcia was extreme table 1 when the impervious area was mixed between dcia and uia vcn d overestimated runoff since runoff from uias could infiltrate into native soils before reaching the storm sewer system methodologies to account for uia exist as shown in schoener 2018 who found the proportion of dcia versus uia to be a critically important attribute in runoff prediction for smaller events however this adjustment is only applicable to composite cn approaches dcia uia can be impractical for practicing engineers to incorporate in drainage analyses due to challenges in accurately quantifying this metric schoener 2018 in future literature researchers should seek a methodology to segregate dcia and uia in the distributed cn approach modifications to the cn methodology to account for amc were established in ward and trimble 2003 however adjusting cn c1 the cn that produced the overall best model fits herein for amc never improved model predictions i e in terms of kge scores for watersheds evaluated herein this was also true for nse scores in all watersheds except mound and bd north fig 3 additionally accounting for amc corrections further exacerbated instances where p ia and modeled runoff volume was zero fig 4 this methodology often adjusted the magnitude of cn c1 substantially table s1 causing large differences in modeled runoff volume predictions this is apparent because the vcn c1 amc model more severely underestimated runoff volume in every watershed except colorado and highlander than this model without amc corrections figs 3 and 4 bondelid et al 1982 and hawkins 1975 found slight variations in cns yield disproportionally larger variations in estimated runoff thus amc corrections may yield improved estimates if cns were altered more modestly it should be noted adp was dropped in boruta s algorithm fig 2 this result is logical for highly impervious urban watersheds where the dominant surface coverage is not soil as adp and other rainfall characteristics and soil amc are clearly related abraham et al 2021 ziadat and taimeh 2013 nse and kge scores also generally decreased for the forested watersheds when amcs were applied fig 3 which may corroborate that cns were adjusted too drastically or suggest that large quantities of interception by tree coverage were not accurately depicted by the cn model runoff volumes from all cn methodologies composited distributed amc assumed that λ 0 2 because numerous instances of the condition p ia were not met during events with observed runoff it stands to reason this assumption is erroneous optimal λ values established through the minimum objective function equation 10 for each watershed for vcn c1 do not support this assumption table 5 the range of optimal values when considering each watershed independently ranged from λ 0 gateway madison farr hill main to λ 0 32 highlander table 5 generally the more impervious a watershed the more λ decreased the one exception was at the municipal watershed λ 0 17 which may be reflective of substantial volume losses due to urban karst see section 3 2 1 other studies also confirm error in λ and generally report a lower optimal value than the λ 0 2 value presented in nrcs 1986 cazier and hawkins 1984 suggested an average value of 0 0006 while hawkins and khojeini 2000 recommended values between 0 and 0 0966 these results also suggest this ratio is not constant for different watersheds jiang 2001 performed a comprehensive investigation of the ratio between ia and s in which the author utilized data from 307 watersheds spanning over 28 000 storm events briefly jiang 2001 discovered λ varies based on watershed and rainfall characteristics however 90 of the λ values were less than the 0 2 ratio leading to the conclusion of an optimal value of λ equal to 0 05 results herein confirm a lower optimal λ as the median across all watersheds was λ 0 12 however values of λ that were below or above the first and third quartiles i e 0 01 and 0 17 respectively might provide evidence for error in cns from nrcs 1986 furthermore the wide range of λ values suggest a single λ value likely will be a source of error in cn method estimations of runoff volume ormsbee et al 2020 cautioned that a new λ value cannot simply be implemented into equation 3 hawkins et al 2009 developed a cn adjustment if the new λ value was 0 05 however future work should consider cn adjustments for a range of λ values based on statistical scores from predictions across all watersheds the simple method performed unsatisfactory i e nse and kge scores of 0 02 and 0 04 respectively fig 3 for the most highly impervious watersheds gateway madison municipal wilmington farr hill main mound and s tech runoff volume responses were well fit to vobs many of the watersheds had greater nse and kge scores than vcn c1 fig 3 including only watersheds greater than 45 impervious the vsm model had nse and kge scores of 0 85 and 0 76 respectively pbias 11 5 this is also evident in fig 4 where the gray colored scatter points in highly impervious watersheds fit much tighter around the 1 1 line than other colored scatter points these results suggest that vsm is more reliable than vcn c1 when a watershed is more than 45 impervious of these watersheds all of the nse scores were considered good and 63 of them would be considered very good model agreement moriasi et al 2007 model vv mlr 6 fit the observed data well for the majority of watersheds however runoff from several events was substantially overpredicted at mound and highlander figs 3 and 4 this could be due to the presence of two small gravel parking lots 0 27 ha or 14 of watershed area that was included as impervious area in the mound watershed and the agricultural field in highlander as previously discussed fig 1 increased rainfall depth may be needed to generate runoff in these small sub basins than predicted in the vv mlr 6 model cross validation of the vv mlr 6 model with data outside this study would be needed to confirm this model as a generally suitable methodology for runoff volume prediction further the vv mlr 6 model would need to be limited to the attributes considered in this study overall the vcn c1 model provided the best predictions of vobs but underestimated runoff volume produced from most storm events fig 4 leading to a negative pbias score in each watershed fig 3 this methodology is suitable for design of urban drainage systems but is less accurate for watersheds representative of pre development conditions ldr and sfr lulcs i e accuracy decreases with decreasing imperviousness the vcn d model addressed many of the concerns of the composited approach however it only outperformed the composite method when dcia was extremely low or high cn methodologies have been used to estimate volume where measurement of inflow to an scm is difficult or impossible to perform braswell et al 2018 li et al 2009 passeport et al 2009 tirpak et al 2020 2021b winston et al 2016b 2018 results herein suggest this would not yield accurate scm volume reduction or pollutant load reduction quantification for a large proportion of storms as all cn methodologies were inaccurate for storms less than 12 5 mm i e the majority of observed storm events the simple method which is used in ohio s npdes permits produced the most reliable predictions when the watershed was more than 45 impervious when watersheds were more than 45 impervious the simple method outperformed all other models figs 3 and 4 however it was also inaccurate for storms less than 12 5 mm figure s1 good model results from the cn and simple methods potentially suggest many of the significant differences observed in cv values between watersheds with similar attributes section 3 2 1 were not substantial the only model that was somewhat useful for small storms was vv mlr 6 in this case most watersheds had positive nse and kge scores but only three watersheds had nse scores classified as satisfactory 3 3 peak flow rate 3 3 1 field monitored results peak flow rates were normalized by watershed area to allow comparison between watersheds of different sizes table 6 normalizing by watershed area is a standard practice in the literature boening ulman et al 2022 boggs and sun 2011 ogden and dawdy 2003 and was justified herein since area was the second most important attribute for prediction of qobs fig 5 peak flows were not normalized by area for boruta s analysis madison wilmington and gateway produced the largest median qobs these watersheds were some of the most impervious had among the highest dcia and had higher sewer densities all of which were important and directly related attributes to qobs in boruta s algorithm fig 5 median qobs was the lowest at highlander among urban watersheds this watershed had the lowest imperviousness mild slopes and second lowest sewer density table 1 similar to results for runoff coefficients watersheds within the same lulc had significant variability p 0 002 in all cases in qobs this implies factors beyond lulc may need to be considered when determining a crat for the rational method median qobs were not significantly different from two commercial lulc watersheds main and municipal 12 1 and 9 19 l s ha respectively but the qobs at wilmington 20 l s ha was significantly greater than main and municipal since qobs was normalized by watershed area and rainfall characteristics were not different across any watershed slope likely resulted in the larger qobs at wilmington watershed slope at wilmington was 3 4 and 1 9 times greater than slope at municipal and main respectively table 1 wilmington also had a much larger sewer density 282 m ha than municipal 211 m ha median qobs was significantly greater at gateway 18 2 l s ha than s tech 8 44 l s ha both of which represented the light industrial lulc though gateway had a lower slope than s tech it was 23 more impervious and had a denser sewer network 121 m ha table 1 median qobs were not significantly different between acorn 4 63 l s ha and aragon 6 09 l s ha the median qobs was slightly larger at aragon likely due to its sewer density which was greater than other sfr lulc watersheds acorn and aragon both had significantly greater qobs than colorado colorado had the smallest watershed slope 0 5 sewer density 107 m ha and a substantially larger watershed area null had a significantly greater median qobs 3 99 l s ha than highlander 0 73 l s ha both representing the ldr lulc though the sewer density was less at null the watershed slope was substantially larger table 1 peak 5 minute rainfall intensity and watershed area were the two most important attributes to qobs fig 5 because peak 5 minute rainfall intensity was the most important attribute it may be a more useful attribute to predict peak flow rates than irat or itc this is because the rational method often underpredicts peak flows since irat and itc correspond to too long a duration for rainfall to truly have a constant intensity chin 2019 attributes with a directly proportional relationship with qobs were peak 5 minute rainfall intensity watershed area rainfall depth average rainfall intensity imperviousness sewer density and dcia attributes with an inverse relationship included rainfall duration time to peak and flow duration watershed slope had an inverse relationship with peak flow rate which contradicts the literature liu et al 2017 taylor and schwarz 1952 this result may be attributed to the colorado watershed the largest watershed 149 ha which produced the largest peak flow rates median 0 34 m3 s and had the shallowest slopes 0 5 table 1 excluding colorado and the forested watersheds i e rather steep but least impervious slope had a direct relationship with peak flow rate watershed slope results may be confounded due to the relatively small number of monitored watersheds n 15 in a predominantly flat region rainfall intensity during the time of concentration and watershed area are two of the three variables utilized in the rational method which coincide with the most important attributes for prediction of qobs fig 5 re running boruta s algorithm with itc as an attribute yielded itc as a less important attribute than peak 5 minute intensity but more important than average intensity this result questions the validity of the assumption of constant rainfall intensity throughout the tc of a watershed additionally these results suggest future investigation of which rainfall intensity i e peak 3 minute 5 minute 10 minute etc would be the ideal indicator of peak flow and how it may vary between different urban watersheds 3 3 2 comparing peak flow rate to predictive equations despite similar attributes among watersheds representing the same lulc significant differences in qobs were still observed underlining the potential for error in predictive methodologies that rely on these attributes thus a variety of m lr equations created herein were explored such that itc difficult to obtain was not an input variable the user does not need to subjectively select a crat value and additional attributes were considered table 7 though imperviousness was more important to qobs than dcia fig 5 a result that aligns with sohn et al 2020 imperviousness did not improve mlr model fit beyond levels explained by lulc table 7 as such equation q mlr 5 was selected as the best fit equation since it had less interaction terms than equation q mlr 7 further equation q mlr 8 was explored because the model remained well fit while further increasing model utility since average rainfall intensity is easier to determine than peak 5 minute rainfall intensity in general more attributes were required to predict qobs with lower r2 than vobs table 4 table 7 the explicit q mlr 5 and q mlr 8 equations and parameter constants as well as data repositories and code are provided in simpson 2023 uncertainty in peak flow rate prediction arises because the parameter is often more sensitive to fluctuations in rainfall patterns than volume mandapaka et al 2009 and due to random error that cannot be accounted for in hydrologic models especially for smaller watersheds cunha et al 2012 the qrat model using the maximum crat qrat cmax had the greatest overall nse and kge scores of 0 69 and 0 67 respectively and lowest absolute value overall pbias score 9 3 fig 6 this is largely due to the poor fit of the qq mlr 5 model at the bd north bd south and mound watersheds fig 6 kge scores for qq mlr 5 were considerably greater than qrat cmax for every watershed except mound s tech colorado and bd north thus qq mlr 5 was a typically a better model fit model qq mlr 5 had nse scores considered satisfactory or better at seven of the watersheds all of which were urban model qq mlr 8 was the only model to produce any positive nse and or kge scores for the forested watersheds suggesting predictions of pre development surrogate peak flows are substantially inaccurate in every other model fig 7 factors deemed important to peak flow that were not included in predictive equations herein include length of longest flow path amc and temporal variations or pulses in rainfall intensity al rawas and valeo 2010 miller et al 2021 taylor and schwarz 1952 torres 2008 results from the qrat cmid methodology support the findings from chin 2019 that the rational method generally underestimates peak flows often peak flows were also underestimated when examining the qrat cmax model as exhibited by an overall pbias score of 9 3 fig 6 and the green scatter points in fig 7 however in some cases with the qrat cmax model aragon municipal mound s tech colorado highlander bd north and bd south peak flows were overestimated fig 6 but the only watersheds where peak flows were severely and almost exclusively overestimated were highlander bd north and bd south which were the three most pervious watersheds fig 7 chin 2019 also noted the rational method is generally less accurate in less developed watersheds but specific instances in the urban environment where the rational method is less accurate have not been well documented herein watersheds with satisfactory qrat cmax model fits ranged most lulcs and impervious coverage additionally due to the relatively low number of monitored watersheds an overarching pattern addressing this gap of knowledge has yet to be determined wisner et al 1980 found the rational method to have close agreement with peak flows predicted by a model constructed in storm water management model swmm for watersheds less than 8 1 ha nse and kge for most watersheds less than 8 1 ha were considered unsatisfactory herein wisner et al 1980 also noted a slight increase in crat would optimize rational method outputs for watersheds larger than 40 ha the only watershed greater than 40 ha herein was colorado and results from equation 11 do not support this finding table 5 in all watersheds except mound colorado highlander bd north and bd south increasing the crat max value decreased error utilizing equation 11 in many of the watersheds gateway madison municipal wilmington farr hill main highlander and bd north progressively increasing or decreasing crat beyond reasonable values continued to minimize the objective function table 5 furthermore no watershed had optimal crat values less than 10 different than the mean allowable crat value equation 6 thus there is inherent error in selecting a crat value as well as determining irat herein irat was assumed to be equivalent to itc estimations of tc herein utilized flow data which likely decreased error compared to estimating tc solely from watershed characteristics however lag time was calculated under the assumption of a normal rainfall distribution which seldomly occurred and may have contributed to error in the applied methodology variability in estimates of tc have been observed throughout the literature fang et al 2008 grimaldi et al 2012 mccuen 2009 sandoval erazo et al 2018 with differences in tc up to 500 depending on calculation methodology grimaldi et al 2012 it seems plausible that rainfall intensity is the culprit of more uncertainty when estimating peak flow rate using the rational method than selecting a runoff coefficient table 5 future research should look to reduce error in tc estimates rather than comparing multiple methodologies to one another seventy one storms of greater depth than the one year reoccurrence interval with duration greater than the watershed s median tc were observed figure s3 supplementary material because monitoring occurred for roughly one year in each watershed statistics suggest one storm per watershed should have remained in the dataset however each watershed averaged nearly five storms greater than the aforementioned threshold suggesting the monitoring period was particularly wet or the current rainfall events more frequently exceed point precipitation frequency estimates due to the effects of climate change considering all 71 events across all watersheds the qrat cmax model performed better than the mean or minimum crat models the qrat cmax model produced a nse score of 0 65 and kge score of 0 55 which would be considered good with a pbias of 21 this underprediction despite larger storms depths is likely due to the violation of the rational method assumption that a watershed s crat remains constant throughout a storm and for all storm events generally nse kge and pbias scores were slightly worsened when considering storms above the one year threshold as opposed to all monitored events fig 6 figure s3 however the slight decline in goodness of fit scores is likely because the n value declined from 838 storms table 2 to 71 storms which caused a drop in statistical power of the implemented tests rather than larger storms inducing uncertainty in the rational method nonetheless results herein suggest that focusing on larger events does not improve peak flow prediction across any of the implemented methodologies overall there was much more uncertainty when predicting peak flow rate than runoff volume even when more attributes were considered in models created herein table 4 table 7 this was primarily due to variable rainfall intensity that occurred throughout a given event often resulting in multiple local peaks e g fig 2 in simpson and winston 2022b additionally the rational method contains error in both the crat and irat estimates many authors have quantified peak flow rate reduction in scms using the rational method to predict the influent peak flow rate braswell et al 2018 tirpak et al 2021b winston et al 2016a b 2018 results herein suggest this would yield substantial error in calculating peak flow reduction specifically because performance of the rational method was unsatisfactory for many of the watersheds figs 6 and 7 the mlr equation created herein q mlr 5 based on peak 5 minute rainfall intensity produced nse scores considered satisfactory or better for 47 percent or the watersheds 54 of the urban watersheds which proved to be more accurate than the rational method but would require cross validation before future use there exists a need to improve peak flow estimation to inform the design of urban drainage infrastructure design of scms and assess scm performance perhaps model improvements could be made by assuming peak flow rates are not a linear function i e as was in the mlr models created herein a theory supported by may and sivakumar 2009 and ogden and dawdy 2003 there is also a continued need to improve estimations for watershed tc 4 conclusions hydrologic responses to storm events were monitored from 13 urban watersheds representative of distinct lulcs and two forested watersheds representative of surrogate pre development conditions in ohio usa a feature selection algorithm was applied to the data to find the most important attributes influencing runoff volume and peak flow rates which were included in mlr equations to predict watershed hydrologic responses runoff volumes observed in the field were compared to runoff volumes estimated via the mlr equation created herein the composited and distributed cn methods and the simple method peak flow rates monitored in the field were compared to peak flow rates estimated via the mlr equations created herein and the rational method using three different runoff coefficients to further expound on design robustness and failure mode operations particularly in the face of climate change future work should analyze hydrologic data as a continuous dataset moving beyond the event based approach employed herein for example utilizing flow duration curves insight and knowledge could be gained on extreme runoff events that may overtax urban drainage infrastructure and scms considering all monitored watersheds runoff volume calculated by the curve number using the area weighted mean cn cn c1 had the highest nse and kge scores and was the most versatile model but the simple method produced more nse scores that would be considered very good and good model fits thus a single model may not be optimal in all scenarios for example the simple method and distributed curve number method were more accurate than the cn c1 model when watersheds were more than 45 impervious and when dcia was extremely low or high respectively results from boruta s algorithm revealed adp was not an important attribute to runoff volume a result confirmed when amc corrections were applied to the cn c1 method and substantially lowered nse and kge scores until a soil amc methodology that more marginally adjusts watershed cns is adopted amc corrections to the cn of an urban watershed are not advised based on findings herein the optimal ratio between initial abstraction and maximum storage potential i e λ in the cn c1 method was not constant for all watersheds the median optimized λ value was 0 12 suggesting practitioners should use a lower value for λ than the industry standard of 0 2 the mlr model created herein proved accurate but did not produce nse or kge scores substantially better than the other models except when storms were less than 12 5 mm improved small storm hydrologic methodologies should be a focus of future work to more adequately model annual runoff volume pollutant export and pollutant load reduction from scms the mlr analysis revealed more attributes were needed to predict peak flow rate than runoff volume and model fit was stronger for runoff volume these results highlight stochastic error that is unable to be accounted for in hydrologic particularly peak flow models of small watersheds of the models evaluated herein the rational method with maximum crat value had the greatest nse and kge scores suggesting the rational method typically underestimated peak flow however six watersheds had satisfactory nse scores only one of which was high enough to be considered very good when obtaining the optimal runoff coefficient for the rational method it was discovered that substantial uncertainty existed in itc as well as crat generally reliability of peak flow prediction increased when decreasing the window of time over which a peak rainfall intensity was calculated future work should investigate the optimal rainfall intensity i e peak 3 minute 5 minute etc for peak flow prediction from a variety of watersheds in a few cases peak flow models performed satisfactorily but there still exists a need to improve peak flow estimates to adequately design drainage systems and scms as well as tc estimates furthermore it is critically important to consider future climate conditions in the basis of design as it was evident that the observed rainfall events were either reflective of a particularly wet monitoring period or more repeatedly exceeded point precipitation frequency estimates due to the

2048,updating the appropriate risk measures is vital for management practice in reservoir operation and offers new insights for decision making water diversion may cause water shortage crises both in the source area and in the downstream flow by focusing on the effect of water demand in the source area and reservoir operation this study proposed a risk assessment framework with the bayesian network and copula based estimation of the parameters the risk assessment framework comprised four parts dependencies estimation specifically established copula a bayesian network based on the copula based estimation of the parameters and scenario analysis this framework was applied to the danjiangkou reservoir part of the source area for the middle route project of the south to north water division project in china the study results showed that the framework provided valuable decision making information the clayton and gumbel functions evidenced superior capabilities for simulating the dependence of hydrological variables using the copula family since it revealed the potential correlation of variables the bayesian network based on the copula based estimation of the parameters was more robust and accurate compared with the classic bayesian network according to the results yielded in different scenarios occurrences presenting the highest degree of disadvantage for the danjiangkou reservoir will be increased from 8 66 to 23 08 for upstream situations and 59 03 for downstream low water situations these results indicate the disadvantages and potential strategies for the successful operation of the reservoir which will be helpful to both researchers and managers keywords risk copula bayesian networks reservoir south to north water division project data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water resources are necessary for sustaining social and economic life water resources management is vital for determining future activity related to the optimum use of these resources the allocation of water resources is thus an important issue both currently and for the future generally water management must consider all competing demands and satisfy all users equitably the risk of hydrological events is a crucial determinant for water allocation particularly in terms of having too little or too much water these issues can pose significant threats to national security concerning water shortages in northern china which led to the south to north water diversion project snwdp launched in china jiang 2009 water diversion may threaten the economy and ecosystems and increase water shortage risks in the source area gu et al 2012 sun et al 2022 however few studies currently provide quantity methods for assessing water shortage risks in source areas modeling hydrological risks is a complex process that involves the spatial temporal variation of water resources and the occurrence of different hydrological events both up and downstream blomfield and plummer 2014 the challenge in determining risks related to water allocation is predicting the possibility of hydrological events paim et al 2019 despite advances in theories and applied risk analysis methods in recent years few new methods have been developed for hydrological risk assessment as a good method to resolve complicated problems during the past few years pearl 1988 koller and friedman 2009 elidan 2010 the bayesian networks bns which represent a semi quantitative approach for dealing with typically complex multidisciplinary and multiple criteria decision making issues were applied for the analysis of risk in water resources management xue et al 2017 these networks are considered suitable for expressing and analyzing uncertain and probabilistic events conditionally enhancing decision making based on multiple control factors and making inferences from incomplete imprecise or uncertain knowledge or information siew and döll 2012 in existing research bns have been used to model the posterior reasoning function for analyzing the correlation between extreme rainfall intensity and duration frequency and exhibited advantages compared with classic methods van de vyver 2015 however the causality of nodes in bns may give rise to failed applications if the connections of variables in networks have poor linear relationships ahooyi et al 2015 accordingly the dependencies of different variables in the risk analysis deserve investigation particularly in the risk analysis of a water resources management context several factors affect the risks involved in water resources management the risk of water diversion may be influenced by water shortages in the source area the upstream inflow and reservoir operation and affected by rainfall in the downstream area gu et al 2012 the local hydrological impact on water resources depends on several key processes such as evapotranspiration sun et al 2019 yang et al 2022 and rainfall cai et al 2020 liu et al 2019 a significant problem in hydrological risk assessment involves dealing with multivariate variables bedford et al 2016 argued that it is necessary to have dependency models of multivariate continuous random variables to conduct a risk analysis the common variables in hydrological risk assessment are rainfall and streamflow in general it is typically to use the classic statistical method to derive the synchronous and asynchronous frequency of rainfall and upstream flow in different periods for example liu and zheng 2000 studied rainfall in northern china and in the han river s upstream flow to analyze the water transfer risk from these studies we concluded the usefulness of gaining quantitative results by taking account of variables in the risk analysis of water diversion however the classic statistical method does not consider the correlation between hydrological variables though correlation coefficients are widely used in relevance analysis it cannot capture the relationship between variables with poor linear or non linear relationships embrechts et al 2002 copulas were considered as an appropriate method for multivariate hydrologic modeling in the current study and have been widely used for flood modeling de michele et al 2005 favre et al 2004 parent et al 2014 tong et al 2015 drought duration chen et al 2013 chen et al 2019 song and singh 2010 streamflow simulation lee and salas 2011 deriving bivariate rainfall frequency distributions zhang and singh 2007 groundwater quality parameters bárdossy 2006 and for dependence modeling zhang and singh 2006 as evidenced in the noted studies the copula functions indicated significant advantages for properly establishing the dependence structures between rare events and also accounted for non linear dependence and upper tail dependence calabrese and osmetti 2019 shiau and shen 2001 when employing copulas using the marginal function must be addressed couasnon et al 2018 proposed modeling compound flood hazards from riverine and coastal interactions at the catchment scale in which the univariate marginal function in the copula was directly selected to represent a normal distribution the modeling compound events were shown to be suited by nonparametric approach to copula estimation as indicated by naseri and hummel 2022 and latif and simonovic 2022 similarly lv et al 2016 chose pearson type iii distribution as the marginal function when using a copula however these approaches may indicate an empirical consideration and may not necessarily be aimed at the optimization problem of a marginal distribution at the same time choosing the correct copula function is essential existing studies found the archimedes copula function to be more suitable for studying dependence between hydrological data kang et al 2010 used the clayton copula function to analyze rainfall encounters representing one of the archimedes copula functions however the study did not disclose a reason for preferring this function an event based copula must ultimately be attributed to the links between nodes in bns grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 used a three dimensional asymmetric copula function to calculate the flood frequency of three variables these studies of the correlations between uncertain hydrological events employed statistics combined with copula functions to indicate the feasibility of deducing their respective occurrence frequencies and joint encounter probabilities some modified copula based frameworks were shown to be helpful for risk assessment naseri and hummel 2022 researchers have combined copulas with bns to implement risk analysis guo et al 2019 used copula based bns to evaluate the system risks in industrial processes by employing one million iterations of monte carlo simulation to estimate the probabilities of industrial process events their results indicated strong randomness in the event group and significant benefits by establishing mutual conditional probabilities to reflect accurate relationships between event groups it will thus be useful to investigate the potential joint use of copulas and bns in hydrological risk assessment as noted by the snwdp despite the complexity of doing so there is an urgent need to assess the hydrological risks involved in such a water transfer project through the use of innovative tools ran et al 2018 tian et al 2019 the danjiangkou reservoir is located in the middle and lower parts of the han river which is part of the snwdp source area as such there is a need to coordinate water demands between the snwdp and the han river downstream the purpose of this research paper is to present the application of a proposed framework in assessing water resource shortage risks in a source area bns were utilized to set up different hydrological events and their states using causality or copula correlation analysis to connect different events the following subsection describes the methods and the proposed framework used in this study section three provides background information about the danjiangkou reservoir and the water diversion risk analysis results additional discussion involving this framework is provided in section four finally section five ends the paper with concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 the basics of copulas joint probability and the dependence structure can be effectively represented by copulas salvadori and de michele 2004 copula theory and copula types are presented in detail in appendix a copulas serve as convenient and effective tools for exploring the correlation between random variables and can also be used to obtain the encounter probability between two variables this study employed copulas to model nodes representing the variables and the dependence structure between nodes the copula function offers an advantage when using a multivariable approach i e it enables selecting the one dimensional marginal distribution of said variables and offers high flexibility in representing the multivariate dependence structure bevacqua et al 2017 for two dimensional copula functions by following sklar s theorem the unique copula function c can be given as follows 1 f x y c θ f x x f y y x y where x and y are continuous random variables the marginal distribution functions of which are f x and f y and f x y are the joint distribution functions of variables x and y then c θ f x x f y y is the copula function and θ represents the parameters yet to be determined the commonly used methods for parameter estimation of a copula function include the kendall rank correlation coefficient and maximum likelihood methods the former is generally applicable to and a relatively simple parameter for the estimation of a two dimensional copula function however the maximum likelihood is generally closer to the true value theoretically when the number of samples is small the maximum likelihood will be closer to the actual value this paper employed the maximum likelihood method to estimate θ calabrese and osmetti 2019 the copula distribution function is c u v θ and its density function is 2 c u v θ 2 c u v θ u v then the maximum likelihood θ to θ is 3 θ arg max i 1 n ln u i v i θ generally to test the fitting accuracy of different copula functions in multivariate frequency analysis the appropriate one is selected by evaluating its goodness of fit genest et al 2009 this work used the akaike information criterion the bayesian information criterion and the root means square error indexes additional theoretical background on these can be found in nelsen 2006 and joe 1997 2 2 bayesian networks a bayesian network bn is a graphical model combining graph theory and probability theory including qualitative and quantitative studies it was introduced at stanford university in the 1970s mccabe et al 1998 it has since been applied in medicine systems reliability and risk analysis antal et al 2004 doguc and ramirez marquez 2009 bouejla et al 2014 the advantage of bns is that they can effectively express the relationship between numerous relevant factors and incorporate prior information and expert knowledge for learning to solve problems that present numerous uncertainties leu and bui 2016 in general the first step in using bns to solve the qualitative problems in the current study included events analysis and node state determination ait mokhrar and laggoune 2016 for transferring water from one area to another we considered the factors that impact achieving this such as rainfall in the water supply area water demand area reservoir impoundment and inflows to the reservoir these considerations comprised bn nodes some of which were interrelated to form a directed edge the above events were divided into three states based on annual average data dry year normal year and wet year they were classified with the following rules kang et al 2010 sun et al 2022 guarantee rate is less than 37 5 wet year guarantee rate is between 37 5 and 62 5 normal year and guarantee rate exceeds 67 5 dry year once the structure of bns had been determined the conditional probability between nodes had to be input for quantitative calculation then the joined probability can be expressed as 4 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a i where p x 1 x 2 x n represents the joint probability of events x 1 x 2 x n x i represents the child nodes and p a i is its parent nodes in addition to the joint probability computation of multiple nodes specific conditional probabilities between two nodes were calculated using an optimal copula as discussed in section 2 3 below 2 3 the framework by using bayesian networks in the bns it was necessary to judge the conditions between nodes after the nodes and network framework had been determined grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 as the classical bns depend on the linear or approximately linear relationship between the variables of parent and child nodes it continues to face the challenges of modeling non linear complex correlations of process components by utilizing bns guo et al 2019 the copula function was used to form a multivariable joint probability distribution function the primary feature was that the marginal distribution of each random variable could take on any form exhibiting strong flexibility and adaptability calabrese and osmetti 2019 a framework that includes copulas and bns is proposed in this study for assessing the probabilities of hydrological events as shown in fig 1 to assess the hydrological risk of different events we first had to identify the main factors related to the circumstances of different events then both the parent and child nodes could be set up based on the causality or relevance of events both classic bns and the proposed framework with bns based on copula based estimation of the parameters were studied and compared the selection of classic bns or the proposed framework was highly dependent on the variables and the dependence structure in the factors of hydrological events using different bns will influence the inputting conditional probability tables cpts unlike classic bns which are based on the statistical frequency of combined events the proposed framework employs the copula method to derive cpts the conditional probability of bns nodes were described in appendix b different scenarios can be analyzed using classic bns or the proposed framework 3 case study 3 1 study area and data collection as the largest reservoir in the han river basin hrb danjiangkou reservoir is located in danjiangkou city and xichuan county in central china see fig 2 it serves as a water source for the middle route project mrp of the snwdp the mrp takes water to the northern part of china rainfall and streamflow data were obtained from meteorological stations located in the hrb there were 13 and nine meteorological stations upstream and downstream of the hrb a summary of rainfall and streamflow data is shown in table 1 according to the statistical analysis of a rainfall and streamflow time series the average value for the annual maximum minimum inflows ratio to the danjiangkou reservoir was large indicating a significant annual variation in streamflow and the highly dependent operation of water resources divisions based on annual inflow it is thus necessary to study the encounter rules of rainfall and inflows in the hrb particularly concerning the low inflow of the danjiangkou reservoir to analyze the dependencies of rainfall and streamflow for the danjiangkou reservoir we employed three correlation functions to conduct the relevant analysis for hydrological variables table 2 as a result there were several close relationships between upstream and downstream rainfall and upstream rainfall and stream inflow to the danjiangkou reservoir accordingly we established dependencies between variables which indicate the directed edges des in the bns 3 2 optimal copulas the archimedean copula was proposed to study hydrological events because of its extensive and mature features as shown in table 3 we compared the performances of four different copula types clayton frank gumbel and ali mikhail haq to model the dependencies of rainfall and inflows in the danjiangkou reservoir the optimal search algorithms outputted both the statistical indices and optimal parameter values the clayton and gumbel copulas were suitable for modeling upstream and downstream variables these results were similar to those in existing studies e g kang et al 2010 and lv et al 2016 which used the clayton copula to calculate the correlation between streamflow and inflows at hydrological stations in different regions in china however kong et al 2018 compared three archimedean copulas gumbel clayton and frank when generating the joint probability distributions for adjacent monthly streamflow where the frank copula was found to be the best within the copula family for modeling these relationships these differences may be ascribed to the limited copula functions used in existing research a vital benefit of the current study could thus be using its results to adopt suitable copula functions in similar future research we derived a contour of different probabilistic by using the optimal parameter values for clayton and gumbel copula functions see fig c1 the cpts of the clayton and gumbel copula functions were severed as inputs to the proposed framework the steps of the probability calculation by clayton and gumbel copula functions were shown in appendix c the use of copulas for deriving rainfall and reservoir inflow must be discussed as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficients were significant between different variables the cpts were required for bns and the des the copulas approach is better suited for tail dependence modeling than the classic statistical approach which may increase the effectiveness of relevance modeling between extreme events bokusheva 2018 additionally it can be coupled with the use of bns the cpts were calculated as shown in table 4 we adapted the wetness normal and dryness classes according to common recommendations in china kang et al 2010 sun et al 2022 as shown in table 4 the encounter probability of wetness for upstream and downstream rainfall is 0 62 and the probability of wetness for upstream rainfall and inflows is 0 82 this indicates the high dependencies of rainfall and streamflow and the high risk to water resources management for a dry year 3 3 comparision of the performances by using bayesian networks regarding the risk of water resources management in water diversion from the danjiangkou reservoir particularly for the mrp of snwdp four main factors were considered upstream rainfall downstream rainfall inflows to the reservoir and reservoir storage these factors were set as parent nodes to reflect their impact on the risks involved the water division risk was considered the child node i e demanded more specific consideration both the classic bns and the proposed framework are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 b the risk of water diversion was estimated as low by the classic bns at 7 21 compared with 8 66 by the proposed framework the robustness of the proposed framework was validated by the probability of wetness normal and dryness as the normal ratios of inflows to the reservoir and downstream rainfall were close to 25 according to fig 3 a when the upstream rainfall was the root node and no scenario was added the result of the probability for the three states was close to indicating three different states dry normal and wet year for downstream rainfall and inflows to the reservoir in contrast although researchers considered that the results of the synchronous asynchronous analysis of hydrological events can be used in bns kang et al 2010 it was obvious that the proposed framework offered more information and presented as better suitable for dealing with these dependencies between hydrological variables see fig 3 3 4 scenario analysis for different hydrological events scenario analyses were conducted to review the danjiangkou reservoir risk assessment using the proposed framework in this study scenario analyses of the proposed framework rendered the posterior analysis of different states more efficiently and provided data for supporting decision making three scenario analyses were implemented 1 risk analysis under simple conditions 2 risk analysis under coupled conditions 3 analysis of adaptive strategies prior to several variable conditions 3 4 1 risk analysis under simple conditions as shown in fig 4 the probability of total unlikely states was 8 66 under normal probability but increased to 23 08 in dry conditions in the downstream rainfall or reservoir storage the maximum probability of total unlikely conditions was 59 03 when both downstream rainfall and reservoir storage experienced dry conditions this result indicated the steep risk increase required forewarning using predictive information 3 4 2 risk analysis under coupled conditions the proposed framework provided more decision making information for dealing with the coupled conditions in the context of hydrological events in addition to the results under simple conditions as shown in fig 4 we changed different nodes to a disadvantageous state dryness year in the proposed framework to derive the risk probability of water transfer in different coupled conditions as shown in table 5 upstream rainfall was regarded as the root node and had four different states each root node considered seven scenarios including no adverse node d i r d i d r and i r these scenarios were applied to the classic bns and the proposed framework the results of the risk probability analysis are shown in figs 5 and 6 four categories were classified according to the upstream rainfall state i e the order of water transfer risk from low to high wetness normal npc no prior condition and dryness figs 5 and 6 the risk increased from single to multiple af predefined adverse factor showing close agreement with the practices however the estimated values of risk probability under the upstream rainfall dryness condition were higher for the proposed framework than for bns additionally the risk of the proposed framework was lower than for bns when the upstream rainfall condition was wetness under the same bn structure copula connections tended to indirectly impact water diversion risk more transmitted to the endpoint indicating the advantage of using copulas in the cpts of bns considering the single adverse factor the impact of the disadvantageous hydrological events on the risk probability of water transfer is shown in fig 7 the contribution values of four different states in the risk analysis were similar from 0 221 to 0 256 when they were in a disadvantageous state dryness year the most important affected factors are shown in ranked order downstream rainfall reservoir storage inflow to the reservoir and upstream rainfall even when the differences between different factors were small the importance of downstream rainfall conditions should be taken into account before or during the risk assessment of water transfer projects 3 4 3 propagation analysis in the bns a posteriori analysis is often used to investigate the cause of a node s state which is reflected in the probability of its parent nodes i e how many probabilities its parent nodes have for giving rise to such a result in this study posterior analysis was employed for adaptive water resources management we explored the possible adaptive strategies according to several disadvantageous states using the proposed framework s posterior analysis accordingly if we consider the guarantee of water transfer in the case of a single adverse node take each node in the dryness state and water transfer is set as an advantageous result state in the proposed framework then the probability of node of other nodes can be calculated to indicate the influence of corresponding states on the result in this instance as shown in fig 8 the probability values were 48 16 50 for the wetness state and 32 11 33 61 for the normal state however other nodes were more likely to cause this risk under normal conditions furthermore a low probability occurred for the wetness state when reservoir storage was in a dryness state as shown in fig 8 c downstream rainfall was the singular cause of a potential water shortage risk moreover the corresponding conditions of these three nodes had a similar probability of providing a successful water transfer this approach served as a practical method for setting the terminal state in the proposed framework and was considered the next largest risk factor under certain adverse circumstances to achieve node state alerts and to implement additional corresponding measures this result also suggested the importance of maintaining reservoir storage to avoid a dryness state 4 discussion as indicated in different scenarios a water shortage in the source area can signal a potential crisis for the snwdp this may be case specific as the danjiangkou reservoir is the largest water storage reservoir in the source area under study because uneven rainfall occurs in the hrb implementing the mrp of the snwdp will be able to affect water diversion to the north of china it will significantly impact the water supply to the middle and lower regions of the hrb these risks should be highlighted and considered in future water resources management this study showed that the developed framework was applicable for quantifying water shortage risks however this study focused primarily on water shortage risks in the limitation of rainfall and water supply for the danjiangkou reservoir there remains a degree of uncertainty due to other factors having been ignored such as poor water quality and increasing the hrb s economy the relationship between water shortages and key factors can be difficult to express explicitly gu et al 2012 sun et al 2023 primarily because only stochastic simulations have previously been utilized to demonstrate this relationship accordingly the framework designed in the current study can provide alternative methods and benefits in this context the advantage of this framework using bns is that it can conduct different types of analyses such as propagation and sensitivity analysis propagation analysis can assist in anticipating the uncertainties that may affect key factors which is extremely important for risk analysis propagation analysis also demonstrated in this study the weight of interdependency among the different variables of the underlying bn structure however as described in section 2 2 the classic bns cannot model complex interrelationships such as non linear dependence among correlated variables therefore the copula function was used to create a multivariable joint probability distribution function the primary feature of which was that the marginal distribution of each random variable could take any form and as a result exhibited strong flexibility and adaptability calabrese and osmetti 2019 also we should noted that the complex of dependencies between variables bárdossy 2023 some new methodology combined the proposal framework of this study may be more useful in further research additionally changing different bns may provide more insight into this framework di giorgio and liberati 2012 used a dynamic bn to conduct a critical infrastructure interdependencies analysis in a reliability study propagation analysis and scenario based failure analysis based on these results and this study using more particularly bns to solve complex problems in practice is suggested 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a framework for identifying hydrological risks in water transfer operation practices copulas were used to manage non linear dependencies in different hydrological variables a framework with bns based on copula based estimation of the parameters were applied to preserve the strengths of bns the results showed that the bns could express causality between variables and event nodes while copulas explained the dependency more clearly than classic statistical methods using the proposed framework was suggested because of its feasibility and stability for updating probabilities which would be able to derive the corresponding dependency probabilities from newly reported data this novel combination makes the risk assessment of classic bns more compatible with quantitative analysis and connects the potential dependent nodes in bns through copulas in this way enabling more speculative information in decision making processes that conditionally rely on multiple control factors is possible different copulas may be used in practice to connect hydrological variables in the form of nodes this will require data calculation and parameter optimization to ultimately determine the best copula in the comparison between bns and the proposed framework the latter was identified as better reflecting the probabilistic relationship between two nodes particularly those with weak linear relationships and fewer data moreover concerning the incomplete data series the framework proposed in this study were more innovative and viable for practical hydrological risks assessment based on the complex relationships between hydrological events declaration of competing interest the authors

revision of the manuscript appendix a copulas theory and types copula is a multidimensional joint distribution function whose domain is 0 1 uniform distribution which can construct the joint distribution by connecting the marginal distributions of multiple variables suppose that f x i p x i x i x i is the marginal distribution functions for the random variables x 1 x 2 x n therefore if the joint distribution function of the random variables denoted as h x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x n p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n x n and the multivariate distribution function h can be written as follows li 2014 a1 c f x 1 x 1 f x 2 x 2 f x n x n h x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x n where c is the copula function essentially c is the variable joint distribution of the random variables and it can express the correlation characteristics between the variables copula satisfies the following three conditions 1 c i n 0 1 n 2 the marginal distribution c n of c satisfies c n un as c 1 1 un 1 1 un un 0 1 n 1 n 3 all variables of c increase monotonically among the copula family archimedes copula is the most widely used in hydrology because of its simple structure and strong adaptability and it can be constructed in many forms zuo et al 2018 there are several common two dimensional archimedes copula functions shown as 1 gumbel hougaard gh copula a2 c u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ θ 0 2 clayton copula a3 c u v u θ

clayton and gumbel copula the steps of the probability calculation were as follows indicated by the red lines in fig c1 1 for the probability of 850 mm in upstream rainfall we derived x u r 50 2 850 to get x d r 59 9 950 and x d r 93 9 1150 for the downstream rainfall 2 using the 0 599 and 0 939 variables in the gumbel function the corresponding joint distribution of these two variables was

2048,updating the appropriate risk measures is vital for management practice in reservoir operation and offers new insights for decision making water diversion may cause water shortage crises both in the source area and in the downstream flow by focusing on the effect of water demand in the source area and reservoir operation this study proposed a risk assessment framework with the bayesian network and copula based estimation of the parameters the risk assessment framework comprised four parts dependencies estimation specifically established copula a bayesian network based on the copula based estimation of the parameters and scenario analysis this framework was applied to the danjiangkou reservoir part of the source area for the middle route project of the south to north water division project in china the study results showed that the framework provided valuable decision making information the clayton and gumbel functions evidenced superior capabilities for simulating the dependence of hydrological variables using the copula family since it revealed the potential correlation of variables the bayesian network based on the copula based estimation of the parameters was more robust and accurate compared with the classic bayesian network according to the results yielded in different scenarios occurrences presenting the highest degree of disadvantage for the danjiangkou reservoir will be increased from 8 66 to 23 08 for upstream situations and 59 03 for downstream low water situations these results indicate the disadvantages and potential strategies for the successful operation of the reservoir which will be helpful to both researchers and managers keywords risk copula bayesian networks reservoir south to north water division project data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water resources are necessary for sustaining social and economic life water resources management is vital for determining future activity related to the optimum use of these resources the allocation of water resources is thus an important issue both currently and for the future generally water management must consider all competing demands and satisfy all users equitably the risk of hydrological events is a crucial determinant for water allocation particularly in terms of having too little or too much water these issues can pose significant threats to national security concerning water shortages in northern china which led to the south to north water diversion project snwdp launched in china jiang 2009 water diversion may threaten the economy and ecosystems and increase water shortage risks in the source area gu et al 2012 sun et al 2022 however few studies currently provide quantity methods for assessing water shortage risks in source areas modeling hydrological risks is a complex process that involves the spatial temporal variation of water resources and the occurrence of different hydrological events both up and downstream blomfield and plummer 2014 the challenge in determining risks related to water allocation is predicting the possibility of hydrological events paim et al 2019 despite advances in theories and applied risk analysis methods in recent years few new methods have been developed for hydrological risk assessment as a good method to resolve complicated problems during the past few years pearl 1988 koller and friedman 2009 elidan 2010 the bayesian networks bns which represent a semi quantitative approach for dealing with typically complex multidisciplinary and multiple criteria decision making issues were applied for the analysis of risk in water resources management xue et al 2017 these networks are considered suitable for expressing and analyzing uncertain and probabilistic events conditionally enhancing decision making based on multiple control factors and making inferences from incomplete imprecise or uncertain knowledge or information siew and döll 2012 in existing research bns have been used to model the posterior reasoning function for analyzing the correlation between extreme rainfall intensity and duration frequency and exhibited advantages compared with classic methods van de vyver 2015 however the causality of nodes in bns may give rise to failed applications if the connections of variables in networks have poor linear relationships ahooyi et al 2015 accordingly the dependencies of different variables in the risk analysis deserve investigation particularly in the risk analysis of a water resources management context several factors affect the risks involved in water resources management the risk of water diversion may be influenced by water shortages in the source area the upstream inflow and reservoir operation and affected by rainfall in the downstream area gu et al 2012 the local hydrological impact on water resources depends on several key processes such as evapotranspiration sun et al 2019 yang et al 2022 and rainfall cai et al 2020 liu et al 2019 a significant problem in hydrological risk assessment involves dealing with multivariate variables bedford et al 2016 argued that it is necessary to have dependency models of multivariate continuous random variables to conduct a risk analysis the common variables in hydrological risk assessment are rainfall and streamflow in general it is typically to use the classic statistical method to derive the synchronous and asynchronous frequency of rainfall and upstream flow in different periods for example liu and zheng 2000 studied rainfall in northern china and in the han river s upstream flow to analyze the water transfer risk from these studies we concluded the usefulness of gaining quantitative results by taking account of variables in the risk analysis of water diversion however the classic statistical method does not consider the correlation between hydrological variables though correlation coefficients are widely used in relevance analysis it cannot capture the relationship between variables with poor linear or non linear relationships embrechts et al 2002 copulas were considered as an appropriate method for multivariate hydrologic modeling in the current study and have been widely used for flood modeling de michele et al 2005 favre et al 2004 parent et al 2014 tong et al 2015 drought duration chen et al 2013 chen et al 2019 song and singh 2010 streamflow simulation lee and salas 2011 deriving bivariate rainfall frequency distributions zhang and singh 2007 groundwater quality parameters bárdossy 2006 and for dependence modeling zhang and singh 2006 as evidenced in the noted studies the copula functions indicated significant advantages for properly establishing the dependence structures between rare events and also accounted for non linear dependence and upper tail dependence calabrese and osmetti 2019 shiau and shen 2001 when employing copulas using the marginal function must be addressed couasnon et al 2018 proposed modeling compound flood hazards from riverine and coastal interactions at the catchment scale in which the univariate marginal function in the copula was directly selected to represent a normal distribution the modeling compound events were shown to be suited by nonparametric approach to copula estimation as indicated by naseri and hummel 2022 and latif and simonovic 2022 similarly lv et al 2016 chose pearson type iii distribution as the marginal function when using a copula however these approaches may indicate an empirical consideration and may not necessarily be aimed at the optimization problem of a marginal distribution at the same time choosing the correct copula function is essential existing studies found the archimedes copula function to be more suitable for studying dependence between hydrological data kang et al 2010 used the clayton copula function to analyze rainfall encounters representing one of the archimedes copula functions however the study did not disclose a reason for preferring this function an event based copula must ultimately be attributed to the links between nodes in bns grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 used a three dimensional asymmetric copula function to calculate the flood frequency of three variables these studies of the correlations between uncertain hydrological events employed statistics combined with copula functions to indicate the feasibility of deducing their respective occurrence frequencies and joint encounter probabilities some modified copula based frameworks were shown to be helpful for risk assessment naseri and hummel 2022 researchers have combined copulas with bns to implement risk analysis guo et al 2019 used copula based bns to evaluate the system risks in industrial processes by employing one million iterations of monte carlo simulation to estimate the probabilities of industrial process events their results indicated strong randomness in the event group and significant benefits by establishing mutual conditional probabilities to reflect accurate relationships between event groups it will thus be useful to investigate the potential joint use of copulas and bns in hydrological risk assessment as noted by the snwdp despite the complexity of doing so there is an urgent need to assess the hydrological risks involved in such a water transfer project through the use of innovative tools ran et al 2018 tian et al 2019 the danjiangkou reservoir is located in the middle and lower parts of the han river which is part of the snwdp source area as such there is a need to coordinate water demands between the snwdp and the han river downstream the purpose of this research paper is to present the application of a proposed framework in assessing water resource shortage risks in a source area bns were utilized to set up different hydrological events and their states using causality or copula correlation analysis to connect different events the following subsection describes the methods and the proposed framework used in this study section three provides background information about the danjiangkou reservoir and the water diversion risk analysis results additional discussion involving this framework is provided in section four finally section five ends the paper with concluding remarks 2 methodology 2 1 the basics of copulas joint probability and the dependence structure can be effectively represented by copulas salvadori and de michele 2004 copula theory and copula types are presented in detail in appendix a copulas serve as convenient and effective tools for exploring the correlation between random variables and can also be used to obtain the encounter probability between two variables this study employed copulas to model nodes representing the variables and the dependence structure between nodes the copula function offers an advantage when using a multivariable approach i e it enables selecting the one dimensional marginal distribution of said variables and offers high flexibility in representing the multivariate dependence structure bevacqua et al 2017 for two dimensional copula functions by following sklar s theorem the unique copula function c can be given as follows 1 f x y c θ f x x f y y x y where x and y are continuous random variables the marginal distribution functions of which are f x and f y and f x y are the joint distribution functions of variables x and y then c θ f x x f y y is the copula function and θ represents the parameters yet to be determined the commonly used methods for parameter estimation of a copula function include the kendall rank correlation coefficient and maximum likelihood methods the former is generally applicable to and a relatively simple parameter for the estimation of a two dimensional copula function however the maximum likelihood is generally closer to the true value theoretically when the number of samples is small the maximum likelihood will be closer to the actual value this paper employed the maximum likelihood method to estimate θ calabrese and osmetti 2019 the copula distribution function is c u v θ and its density function is 2 c u v θ 2 c u v θ u v then the maximum likelihood θ to θ is 3 θ arg max i 1 n ln u i v i θ generally to test the fitting accuracy of different copula functions in multivariate frequency analysis the appropriate one is selected by evaluating its goodness of fit genest et al 2009 this work used the akaike information criterion the bayesian information criterion and the root means square error indexes additional theoretical background on these can be found in nelsen 2006 and joe 1997 2 2 bayesian networks a bayesian network bn is a graphical model combining graph theory and probability theory including qualitative and quantitative studies it was introduced at stanford university in the 1970s mccabe et al 1998 it has since been applied in medicine systems reliability and risk analysis antal et al 2004 doguc and ramirez marquez 2009 bouejla et al 2014 the advantage of bns is that they can effectively express the relationship between numerous relevant factors and incorporate prior information and expert knowledge for learning to solve problems that present numerous uncertainties leu and bui 2016 in general the first step in using bns to solve the qualitative problems in the current study included events analysis and node state determination ait mokhrar and laggoune 2016 for transferring water from one area to another we considered the factors that impact achieving this such as rainfall in the water supply area water demand area reservoir impoundment and inflows to the reservoir these considerations comprised bn nodes some of which were interrelated to form a directed edge the above events were divided into three states based on annual average data dry year normal year and wet year they were classified with the following rules kang et al 2010 sun et al 2022 guarantee rate is less than 37 5 wet year guarantee rate is between 37 5 and 62 5 normal year and guarantee rate exceeds 67 5 dry year once the structure of bns had been determined the conditional probability between nodes had to be input for quantitative calculation then the joined probability can be expressed as 4 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a i where p x 1 x 2 x n represents the joint probability of events x 1 x 2 x n x i represents the child nodes and p a i is its parent nodes in addition to the joint probability computation of multiple nodes specific conditional probabilities between two nodes were calculated using an optimal copula as discussed in section 2 3 below 2 3 the framework by using bayesian networks in the bns it was necessary to judge the conditions between nodes after the nodes and network framework had been determined grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 as the classical bns depend on the linear or approximately linear relationship between the variables of parent and child nodes it continues to face the challenges of modeling non linear complex correlations of process components by utilizing bns guo et al 2019 the copula function was used to form a multivariable joint probability distribution function the primary feature was that the marginal distribution of each random variable could take on any form exhibiting strong flexibility and adaptability calabrese and osmetti 2019 a framework that includes copulas and bns is proposed in this study for assessing the probabilities of hydrological events as shown in fig 1 to assess the hydrological risk of different events we first had to identify the main factors related to the circumstances of different events then both the parent and child nodes could be set up based on the causality or relevance of events both classic bns and the proposed framework with bns based on copula based estimation of the parameters were studied and compared the selection of classic bns or the proposed framework was highly dependent on the variables and the dependence structure in the factors of hydrological events using different bns will influence the inputting conditional probability tables cpts unlike classic bns which are based on the statistical frequency of combined events the proposed framework employs the copula method to derive cpts the conditional probability of bns nodes were described in appendix b different scenarios can be analyzed using classic bns or the proposed framework 3 case study 3 1 study area and data collection as the largest reservoir in the han river basin hrb danjiangkou reservoir is located in danjiangkou city and xichuan county in central china see fig 2 it serves as a water source for the middle route project mrp of the snwdp the mrp takes water to the northern part of china rainfall and streamflow data were obtained from meteorological stations located in the hrb there were 13 and nine meteorological stations upstream and downstream of the hrb a summary of rainfall and streamflow data is shown in table 1 according to the statistical analysis of a rainfall and streamflow time series the average value for the annual maximum minimum inflows ratio to the danjiangkou reservoir was large indicating a significant annual variation in streamflow and the highly dependent operation of water resources divisions based on annual inflow it is thus necessary to study the encounter rules of rainfall and inflows in the hrb particularly concerning the low inflow of the danjiangkou reservoir to analyze the dependencies of rainfall and streamflow for the danjiangkou reservoir we employed three correlation functions to conduct the relevant analysis for hydrological variables table 2 as a result there were several close relationships between upstream and downstream rainfall and upstream rainfall and stream inflow to the danjiangkou reservoir accordingly we established dependencies between variables which indicate the directed edges des in the bns 3 2 optimal copulas the archimedean copula was proposed to study hydrological events because of its extensive and mature features as shown in table 3 we compared the performances of four different copula types clayton frank gumbel and ali mikhail haq to model the dependencies of rainfall and inflows in the danjiangkou reservoir the optimal search algorithms outputted both the statistical indices and optimal parameter values the clayton and gumbel copulas were suitable for modeling upstream and downstream variables these results were similar to those in existing studies e g kang et al 2010 and lv et al 2016 which used the clayton copula to calculate the correlation between streamflow and inflows at hydrological stations in different regions in china however kong et al 2018 compared three archimedean copulas gumbel clayton and frank when generating the joint probability distributions for adjacent monthly streamflow where the frank copula was found to be the best within the copula family for modeling these relationships these differences may be ascribed to the limited copula functions used in existing research a vital benefit of the current study could thus be using its results to adopt suitable copula functions in similar future research we derived a contour of different probabilistic by using the optimal parameter values for clayton and gumbel copula functions see fig c1 the cpts of the clayton and gumbel copula functions were severed as inputs to the proposed framework the steps of the probability calculation by clayton and gumbel copula functions were shown in appendix c the use of copulas for deriving rainfall and reservoir inflow must be discussed as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficients were significant between different variables the cpts were required for bns and the des the copulas approach is better suited for tail dependence modeling than the classic statistical approach which may increase the effectiveness of relevance modeling between extreme events bokusheva 2018 additionally it can be coupled with the use of bns the cpts were calculated as shown in table 4 we adapted the wetness normal and dryness classes according to common recommendations in china kang et al 2010 sun et al 2022 as shown in table 4 the encounter probability of wetness for upstream and downstream rainfall is 0 62 and the probability of wetness for upstream rainfall and inflows is 0 82 this indicates the high dependencies of rainfall and streamflow and the high risk to water resources management for a dry year 3 3 comparision of the performances by using bayesian networks regarding the risk of water resources management in water diversion from the danjiangkou reservoir particularly for the mrp of snwdp four main factors were considered upstream rainfall downstream rainfall inflows to the reservoir and reservoir storage these factors were set as parent nodes to reflect their impact on the risks involved the water division risk was considered the child node i e demanded more specific consideration both the classic bns and the proposed framework are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 b the risk of water diversion was estimated as low by the classic bns at 7 21 compared with 8 66 by the proposed framework the robustness of the proposed framework was validated by the probability of wetness normal and dryness as the normal ratios of inflows to the reservoir and downstream rainfall were close to 25 according to fig 3 a when the upstream rainfall was the root node and no scenario was added the result of the probability for the three states was close to indicating three different states dry normal and wet year for downstream rainfall and inflows to the reservoir in contrast although researchers considered that the results of the synchronous asynchronous analysis of hydrological events can be used in bns kang et al 2010 it was obvious that the proposed framework offered more information and presented as better suitable for dealing with these dependencies between hydrological variables see fig 3 3 4 scenario analysis for different hydrological events scenario analyses were conducted to review the danjiangkou reservoir risk assessment using the proposed framework in this study scenario analyses of the proposed framework rendered the posterior analysis of different states more efficiently and provided data for supporting decision making three scenario analyses were implemented 1 risk analysis under simple conditions 2 risk analysis under coupled conditions 3 analysis of adaptive strategies prior to several variable conditions 3 4 1 risk analysis under simple conditions as shown in fig 4 the probability of total unlikely states was 8 66 under normal probability but increased to 23 08 in dry conditions in the downstream rainfall or reservoir storage the maximum probability of total unlikely conditions was 59 03 when both downstream rainfall and reservoir storage experienced dry conditions this result indicated the steep risk increase required forewarning using predictive information 3 4 2 risk analysis under coupled conditions the proposed framework provided more decision making information for dealing with the coupled conditions in the context of hydrological events in addition to the results under simple conditions as shown in fig 4 we changed different nodes to a disadvantageous state dryness year in the proposed framework to derive the risk probability of water transfer in different coupled conditions as shown in table 5 upstream rainfall was regarded as the root node and had four different states each root node considered seven scenarios including no adverse node d i r d i d r and i r these scenarios were applied to the classic bns and the proposed framework the results of the risk probability analysis are shown in figs 5 and 6 four categories were classified according to the upstream rainfall state i e the order of water transfer risk from low to high wetness normal npc no prior condition and dryness figs 5 and 6 the risk increased from single to multiple af predefined adverse factor showing close agreement with the practices however the estimated values of risk probability under the upstream rainfall dryness condition were higher for the proposed framework than for bns additionally the risk of the proposed framework was lower than for bns when the upstream rainfall condition was wetness under the same bn structure copula connections tended to indirectly impact water diversion risk more transmitted to the endpoint indicating the advantage of using copulas in the cpts of bns considering the single adverse factor the impact of the disadvantageous hydrological events on the risk probability of water transfer is shown in fig 7 the contribution values of four different states in the risk analysis were similar from 0 221 to 0 256 when they were in a disadvantageous state dryness year the most important affected factors are shown in ranked order downstream rainfall reservoir storage inflow to the reservoir and upstream rainfall even when the differences between different factors were small the importance of downstream rainfall conditions should be taken into account before or during the risk assessment of water transfer projects 3 4 3 propagation analysis in the bns a posteriori analysis is often used to investigate the cause of a node s state which is reflected in the probability of its parent nodes i e how many probabilities its parent nodes have for giving rise to such a result in this study posterior analysis was employed for adaptive water resources management we explored the possible adaptive strategies according to several disadvantageous states using the proposed framework s posterior analysis accordingly if we consider the guarantee of water transfer in the case of a single adverse node take each node in the dryness state and water transfer is set as an advantageous result state in the proposed framework then the probability of node of other nodes can be calculated to indicate the influence of corresponding states on the result in this instance as shown in fig 8 the probability values were 48 16 50 for the wetness state and 32 11 33 61 for the normal state however other nodes were more likely to cause this risk under normal conditions furthermore a low probability occurred for the wetness state when reservoir storage was in a dryness state as shown in fig 8 c downstream rainfall was the singular cause of a potential water shortage risk moreover the corresponding conditions of these three nodes had a similar probability of providing a successful water transfer this approach served as a practical method for setting the terminal state in the proposed framework and was considered the next largest risk factor under certain adverse circumstances to achieve node state alerts and to implement additional corresponding measures this result also suggested the importance of maintaining reservoir storage to avoid a dryness state 4 discussion as indicated in different scenarios a water shortage in the source area can signal a potential crisis for the snwdp this may be case specific as the danjiangkou reservoir is the largest water storage reservoir in the source area under study because uneven rainfall occurs in the hrb implementing the mrp of the snwdp will be able to affect water diversion to the north of china it will significantly impact the water supply to the middle and lower regions of the hrb these risks should be highlighted and considered in future water resources management this study showed that the developed framework was applicable for quantifying water shortage risks however this study focused primarily on water shortage risks in the limitation of rainfall and water supply for the danjiangkou reservoir there remains a degree of uncertainty due to other factors having been ignored such as poor water quality and increasing the hrb s economy the relationship between water shortages and key factors can be difficult to express explicitly gu et al 2012 sun et al 2023 primarily because only stochastic simulations have previously been utilized to demonstrate this relationship accordingly the framework designed in the current study can provide alternative methods and benefits in this context the advantage of this framework using bns is that it can conduct different types of analyses such as propagation and sensitivity analysis propagation analysis can assist in anticipating the uncertainties that may affect key factors which is extremely important for risk analysis propagation analysis also demonstrated in this study the weight of interdependency among the different variables of the underlying bn structure however as described in section 2 2 the classic bns cannot model complex interrelationships such as non linear dependence among correlated variables therefore the copula function was used to create a multivariable joint probability distribution function the primary feature of which was that the marginal distribution of each random variable could take any form and as a result exhibited strong flexibility and adaptability calabrese and osmetti 2019 also we should noted that the complex of dependencies between variables bárdossy 2023 some new methodology combined the proposal framework of this study may be more useful in further research additionally changing different bns may provide more insight into this framework di giorgio and liberati 2012 used a dynamic bn to conduct a critical infrastructure interdependencies analysis in a reliability study propagation analysis and scenario based failure analysis based on these results and this study using more particularly bns to solve complex problems in practice is suggested 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a framework for identifying hydrological risks in water transfer operation practices copulas were used to manage non linear dependencies in different hydrological variables a framework with bns based on copula based estimation of the parameters were applied to preserve the strengths of bns the results showed that the bns could express causality between variables and event nodes while copulas explained the dependency more clearly than classic statistical methods using the proposed framework was suggested because of its feasibility and stability for updating probabilities which would be able to derive the corresponding dependency probabilities from newly reported data this novel combination makes the risk assessment of classic bns more compatible with quantitative analysis and connects the potential dependent nodes in bns through copulas in this way enabling more speculative information in decision making processes that conditionally rely on multiple control factors is possible different copulas may be used in practice to connect hydrological variables in the form of nodes this will require data calculation and parameter optimization to ultimately determine the best copula in the comparison between bns and the proposed framework the latter was identified as better reflecting the probabilistic relationship between two nodes particularly those with weak linear relationships and fewer data moreover concerning the incomplete data series the framework proposed in

distribution by connecting the marginal distributions of multiple variables suppose that f x i p x i x i x i is the marginal distribution functions for the random variables x 1 x 2 x n therefore if the joint distribution function of the random variables denoted as h x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x n p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n x n and the multivariate distribution function h can be written as follows li 2014 a1

2049,hydrogeochemical tools were applied to evaluate the effect caused by the presence of municipal waste leachate on the balance of a karstic aquifer the system evaluated correspond to the aquifer underlying the area of the old municipal waste disposal site mwds in the city of merida mexico a contaminant plume identified with chloride ion concentrations was detected groundwater samples were collected from boreholes located along a flow line starting at the downstream boundary of the dump site the parameters involved in the carbonate system were analyzed obtaining a decline in calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 concentrations for high pco2 values this behavior is explained by the presence of high bicarbonate hco3 content as a result of the waste decomposition reactions the bicarbonate ions behaved as a buffer preventing ph reduction in addition to this the calcium and magnesium species indicate that the formation of complexes affected the mineral solubility where leachate has the greatest influence the transport of minerals in moles between boreholes located along the groundwater flow line was determined through inverse modeling it is concluded that the leachate affects the carbonate balance as determined by the transfer of minerals along the flow line it was observed that mixed waters with a higher percentage of leachate tend to dissolve carbonate minerals this is the

major inorganic compounds such as anions cl hco3 so4 2 and cations ca2 mg2 k na nh4 fe2 and fe3 do not constitute serious contamination problems in groundwater overall however they participate in the main physical and chemical processes that define the concentration and transport of compounds in aquifers christensen et al 2001 ibezute and erhunmwunse 2018 rajoo et al 2020 aquifer contamination by

1997 vadillo et al 2000 vadillo and ojeda 2022 due to the vulnerability of the yucatan karstic aquifer the objective of this research was to evaluate the effect caused by the mwds leachate on the balance of the carbonate aquifer system the reactions involved along a groundwater flow line in the leachate contaminated plume were explained by means of an inverse model 1 1 study zone the yucatan peninsula mexico consists of a karst type geologic unit characterized by high permeability carbonate rocks the low relief reduced topographic slope high infiltration capacity along with a high precipitation favor the renewal of groundwater and cause ephemeral or a lack of surface runoff bauer gottwein et al 2011 pacheco and cabrera 2018 the aquifer is almost unprotected in its entirety dggtn 1985 the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination is high so contaminants tend to quickly go into solution and move towards the water table canul macario et al 2019 gonzalez herrera et al 2018 2020 moreno gómez et al 2019 at the same time there is less contaminant rock contact time martínez salvador et al 2019 polanco rodriguez et al 2018 these characteristics confer that highly karstified fractured limestone over which waste disposal sites are located facilitate the migration of leachate towards the aquifer especially where shallow water table exists gonzalez herrera et al 2014 kalhor et al 2019 kogovšek and petrič 2013 long et al 2018 the municipal waste disposal site mwds under study was active for almost twenty years fig 1 the waste was deposited on a 30 ha land with no cover to prevent vertical migration of leachates to the aquifer whose water table is 5 m deep approximately the limestones are covered with a thin rendzina type soil up to 20 cm thick in the vicinity of the site the climate is humid tropical with a mean annual rainfall of around 1000 mm most of which falls between may and october which is responsible for leachate generation in the mwds rapid recharge is estimated to be around 200 to 300 mm per year british geological survey 1995 salazar 2002 brewerton 1993 working on core samples demonstrated porosity variations from 35 to 55 and hydraulic conductivities ranging from 3 5x10 8 to 1 6x10 5 m s tests conducted by gonzález herrera 1996 indicate hydraulic conductivities ranging from 3 4x10 8 to 9 3x10 5 m s porosities range from 40 to 50 aquifer hydraulic conductivity should be higher due to the fissure nature of the rock mendez 1993 indicates values between 10 4 to 10 3 m s the hydraulic gradient is low around 7 5x10 5 with northwesterly and westerly flow direction towards the coast see fig 1 parameterization of the velocity is very difficult in this karstic terrain a calculation of the darcy velocity is a serious underestimate as it does not consider fracture flow groundwater flow velocity values reported in the yucatan peninsula range between 1x10 7 and 1x10 4 m s for the flux in the matrix of the karstic aquifer canul macario et al 2019 2 methods based on the groundwater quality monitoring data it was evident that a contaminant plume was moving away from the mwds klinck and stuart 1999 along the preferential groundwater flow line in a n 30 w direction fig 1 a monitoring network was established drilling six boreholes 8 in in diameter and 50 m deep identified as s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 located 10 25 50 100 300 and 500 m distant from the garbage hill limit respectively the piezometric level was determined and groundwater samples were collected in each borehole at every 5 m of depth starting at the water table a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 1 l min was used for sampling allowing the water in the tube to drain between each sample to ensure liquid removal avoiding cross contamination plastic bottles rinsed with distilled water and the sample itself were used part of each sample was passed through a 0 45 μm filter and placed in 125 ml bottles for sodium and potassium determination samples were no preserved since the analyzes were performed in less than 48 h after collection water quality parameters were examined laboratory analysis techniques published in rice et al 2017 were applied to determine major ions calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chlorides cl bicarbonates hco3 sulfates so4 2 and nitrates no3 the ionic balance was carried out and the error percentage in the determination of the ions considered in milliequivalents per liter was calculated according to eqn 1 deutsch and siegel 2020 1 e r r o r c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i

multiparameter probe the probe sensors accuracy are temperature 0 15 c for ph 0 2 units ec 1 millisiemens and do 0 2 mg l each sensor was calibrated with its corresponding standard solution the same parameters described above were determined in samples of leachate and groundwater collected from a background well snat this is a dug well located one kilometer distant upstream used to determine if the local groundwater is affected by the mwds leachate a dilution line was used to evaluate the mixing process along a flowline relating chloride and hco3 in a scatter plot a positive relationship would indicate leachate presence in the aquifer when both variables increase from the least to the most contaminated borehole the statgraphics plus version 5 1 program manugistics 1992 was used to carry out the statistical data treatment the chemical balance and graphical analyzes of water samples were carried out applying the hydrogeochemical software aquachem v 4 waterloo hydrogeologic inc 2003 saturation indices si of groundwater with respect to calcite dolomite and aragonite were calculated through the phreeq program linked to aquachem the same was used to compute pco2 and speciation as well as to perform the inverse modeling 3 results and discussion the data collected corresponds to sampling campaigns carried out over five years covering periods of rain and drought after the mwds closure average physicochemical properties measured are summarized below 3 1 leachate chemistry leachate samples had an electrical conductivity of 21 466 ms cm cl 4375 33 mg l and hco3 4626 6 mg l were the predominant anions fig 2 these high values fall between the average ones published in the literature christensen et al 2001 lindamulla et al 2022 ma et al 2022 moody and townsend 2017 rajoo et al 2020 hco3 concentrations agree to the leachate high ph values between 7 78 and 8 0 sulfate concentrations were low compared to the other anions during the rainy periods 140 mg l but they increased in the dry season 610 mg l gonzalez herrera 2005 studied in detail the leachate behavior and the waste degradation phases in the merida mwds pointing out that the lower concentrations obtained in the rainy seasons may correspond to a leachate in the methanogenic stage in which the ph is high and the sulfur species hs and h2s are the dominant ones christensen et al 2001 dharmarathne and gunatilake 2013 high sulfate concentrations occur in the acid phase of degradation however in dry season ph values of 7 78 were obtained indicative of a basic phase presence no3 is not present due to reducing state of the leachate thus in the rainy periods very low concentrations were detected less than10 0 mg l however during the dry season no3 concentration rose to 471 mg l since high concentrations of sulfates were also obtained for this period it follows that there is oxygen in the system that allows ammonium and sulfide oxidizing bacteria to be present ca2 and mg2 low concentrations 103 23 and 58 03 mg l respectively are indicative of a leachate in its methanogenic stage ehring 1989 na and k concentrations were high 2785 and 1749 mg l respectively only a small part of these ions is governed by reactions such as precipitation complexation and sorption just like chloride christensen et al 2001 wijekoon et al 2022 in addition no difference can be observed between the acidic and methanogenic phases for these ions ehring 1989 3 2 background groundwater chemistry snat chemistry was fig 2 ca2 106 56 mg l mg2 12 43 mg l na 35 33 mg l k 2 93 mg l cl 49 1 mg l hco3 341 46 so4 2 16 33 no3 21 87 mg l there were lower sodium potassium chloride bicarbonate and sulfate contents compared to the leachate chemistry electrical conductivity ec total ion concentration 0 778 ms cm indicates low mineralization average ph values 6 87 are close to neutrality temperature 28 63 c and do 2 mg l calcite and aragonite saturation indices were very close to equilibrium a slight tendency towards undersaturation was obtained during the dry season table 1 higher si would be expected or mineral precipitation due to a longer contact time of the groundwater with the solid phase as there is no recharge to the aquifer aghazadeh et al 2016 lyu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however the higher than atmospheric 10 3 5 atm pco2 obtained explains the groundwater undersaturation with respect to these minerals groundwater was undersaturated with respect to dolomite it is the least soluble mineral of the three so if it is in the system it will take longer to reach equilibrium appelo and postma 1996 langmuir 1997 3 3 leachate in groundwater chloride concentrations profiles were elaborated for the six control boreholes fig 3 this ion was considered indicative and representative of the leachate presence in the aquifer because it is a dominant ion in mwds leachates it does not undergo any chemical or physicochemical reaction in aquifers with dilution being its only attenuation mechanism brad et al 2022 christensen et al 2001 robertson et al 2021 in fig 3 the zero value of the ordinate axis corresponds to the water table note that on the abscissa axis the concentration scales are not the same for the profiles of the six boreholes the centerline of the leachate plume was identified at a depth of 25 m a chloride advance appeares in the three boreholes closest to the mwds 200 475 mg l it was accentuated in the next three 146 250 mg l the leachate presence and dilution in the contaminant plume can be depicted in fig 4 chloride ion was used as a tracer in combination with bicarbonate hco3 the fitted line represents the theoretical dilution of the leachate mixed with the background water sample snat collected upstream of the mwds data corresponding to samples collected at 25 m depth are plotted note that the results correlate with the dilution line 3 4 hydrogeochemical evolution of aquifer contamination major ions concentrations in all monitoring boreholes were plotted in piper diagrams to classify the underlying groundwater according to its ionic content fig 5 snat samples correspond to the predominant calcium bicarbonate ca2 hco3 groundwater type in the region cabrera et al 2002 sánchez ahuactzin et al 2018 underlying the mwds a mixed type water was detected containing 20 to 60 of calcium and magnesium and 40 to 60 of sodium anion contents ranged from 40 to 60 for chlorides and bicarbonates and sulfates were lower than 20 this change from a calcium bicarbonate to a mixed type of water is due to the mwds leachate contaminating the aquifer this mixing process is clearly depicted in fig 5 snat had cl hco3 molar ratio values of 0 2 and 0 3 for the rainy and dry periods respectively fig 6 this parameter is greater than or equal to 1 in boreholes closest to the mwds boundary and is between 0 8 and 0 9 in the furthest ones although the difference is minimal these values show an increase in groundwater mineralization due to the increase in chloride concentrations indicating that the water has been affected by the leachate despite the fact that the leachate contributes chlorides to the system the waste degradation reactions generate co2 that can increase bicarbonates content in the system which is reflected in the ec values variation of this ion ratio with time was analyzed considering boreholes s2 and s4 as representative of the karst aquifer system fig 7 s2 presented an exponential mineralization increase and cl hco3 ratio with time that is the relationship increases from the most recent period to the oldest although it is almost constant at the beginning this can be interpreted as an evolution of chlorinated waters due to the leachate effect towards the plume attenuation therefore mineralization and chloride content tend to decline on the other hand the boreholes farthest from the mwds see s4 in fig 7 did not show an evolutionary trend they had an almost constant cl hco3 ratio which was not influenced by an increase in mineralization although the mineralization did not vary temporally it presented a spatial variation see fig 6 that is the electrical conductivity was higher in s1 2 4 ms cm and decreased to near 1 4 ms cm in s6 3 5 carbonate system alteration groundwater was undersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals calcite has the greatest tendency to equilibrium followed by aragonite leaving dolomite in third place this is explained because aragonite and calcite have similar ionic composition and solubility products log ksp 8 48 and 8 34 respectively langmuir 1997 on the other hand dolomite presents a lower solubility product log ksp 17 09 therefore it will take longer to reach equilibrium along the flow line the saturation indices oscillate from one borehole to another with no clear trend with respect to groundwater flow fig 8 shows pco2 vs ca2 mg2 and ph vs hco3 for boreholes s1 and s4 ca2 mg2 is greater than 3 5 mmol l with higher pco2 values compared to snat whose pco2 10 1 6 atm 0 025 atm and ca2 mg2 2 9 mmol l in the rainy season l during the dry season j the pco2 was higher close to 10 1 06 atm 0 087 atm and the ca2 mg2 content was 3 2 mmol l a proportional rise in hco3 with ph and an inverse ca2 mg2 vs pco2 proportionality is observed in s1 the equilibrium reactions taking place in a system with carbonate minerals is expressed in eqn 2 langmuir 1997 2 co 2 g h 2 o h 2 c o 3 h h c o 3 this reaction contributes to the high bicarbonate values typically found in leachate deutsch and siegel 2020 when a source of co2 exists there will be greater calcite dissolution while co2 release will cause the precipitation of this mineral as summarized in eqn 3 3 cac o 3 co 2 g h 2 o ca 2 h c o 3 thus a ca2 mg2 decrease would indicate both dilution and the possibility of calcite precipitation therefore the high bicarbonates content in the leachate explains the pco2 trend to increase and minerals precipitation however the ph rise h ions reduction indicates that hco3 acts as a buffer favoring calcite precipitation this result would differ to the behavior of the carbonate systems studied by christensen et al 2001 and vadillo 2003 where landfill leachates led to carbonate minerals dissolution calcite precipitation could also take place in s4 samples a f and d fig 10 in the first instance due to the ca2 mg2 concentrations and to the effect caused in the equilibrium reactions by the increase in bicarbonate concentration subsequently no ca2 mg2 and pco2 relationship was noticed samples h and i attributed to the fact that the leachate plume attenuates at this point ca2 mg2 reduction could also be due to complexes formed from the mixing of groundwater with leachate becoming part of other species in solution according to the ph and pco2 values in the system figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows that more than 92 of the calcium existed in the form of a free ion reaching a maximum of 94 in points with less leachate influence the importance of hco3 and co3 2 ions is the formation of complexes which in a leachate contamination plume are associated with calcium magnesium iron and manganese ions this association was reflected in speciation it was observed that the second most important species dissolved in water was cahco3 aq with values of 2 in wells with less leachate influence and 3 in wells s1 and s2 close to the limit of the mwds at these points the percentage of calcium as a free ion declines favoring caso4 aq and caco3 aq formation calcium ions became part of other species in solution in boreholes closest to the dump affecting the carbonate minerals solubility depending on the ph and pco2 that control their concentration as far as magnesium speciation is concerned the same complexes formation trend as for calcium was obtained fig 10 in boreholes closest to the dump magnesium concentration as a free ion was reduced regarding speciation it is inferred that a decline in calcium and magnesium ions was not necessarily due to carbonate minerals precipitation because of hco3 excess ca2 and mg2 could become part of other species in solution in agreement with the system ph and pco2 values 3 6 inverse modeling a mass balance was carried out to calculate the amount of mass transferred between the different phases solid liquid and gas in order to interpret the processes involved in changes occurring in the carbonate system analyzed appelo and postma 1996 deutsch and siegel 2020 martinez et al 2000 parkhurst and appelo 1999 to integrate the model the following mineral phases were considered calcite dolomite and aragonite in accordance with the equilibrium state dissolution or precipitation they presented in the leachate affected groundwater flow direction the gaseous phases co2 and o2 were considered in consonance to the behavior calculated and determined n2 h2s and h2 were also considered in congruence to a study carried out by gonzález et al 2004 the model assumes that the groundwater characteristics at the end of the flow line are the result of the water initial composition and the phases it has encountered along the way the modeling exercise summarized in table 2 confirms the low and unstable effect of leachate on the carbonate minerals equilibrium along the preferential groundwater flow line a negative sign indicates that the phase is consumed dissolution and positive values indicate that the phases are produced precipitation calcite dolomite and calcite dissolution occurred between snat s1 and s1 s2 respectively as well as a co2 g deficit from the system h2s generation 0 63 mmol l was confirmed in s1 whose presence had been suggested by gonzález et al 2004 according to this gas characteristic odor which is lost from s2 between s2 s3 co2 g production coincides with calcite 0 133 mmol l and dolomite 0 565 mmol l minerals precipitation aragonite did not undergo any change as is namely associated to biogenic precipitatin co2 g loss 1 80 mmol l on average in s4 s5 and s6 manifested itself with little or no change in the balance of minerals in s4 s5 the system anaerobic state is noted in the model with several millimoles of gas oxygen losses in agreement with field oxygen concentrations close to 1 mg l dissolution and precipitation reactions varied between segments of the contaminated groundwater flow line the inverse model showed that solute transport is minimal along the flow line carbonate minerals dissolve closest to the mwds where the highest concentration leachate mixed with groundwater is present more distant an unstable behavior between dissolution and equilibrium exists 4 conclusions the spatial variation of the contamination of the carbonated aquifer underlying the old waste disposal site in merida mexico was manifested as an evolution of groundwater from a mixed chlorinated type due to the effect of leachate to a calcium bicarbonated type the contaminant plume shows signs of attenuation reflected in decreasing trends in mineralization and chloride content carbonate minerals dissolution would take place in the most affected portion of the aquifer the high bicarbonate content in the leachate acts as a buffer preventing the ph from declining due to the presence of co2 which according to the equilibrium reactions leads to a reduction of ca2 and mg2 and the formation of calcium and magnesium species the solubility of the carbonated minerals where leachate content is higher was affected by the formation of complexes the inverse geochemical modeling quantitatively showed that a contaminant attenuation takes place along the groundwater flow line but that indeed the leachate leads to the possibility of minerals dissolution in the system analyzed it can be inferred that in the studied system the leachate causes carbonate minerals dissolution therefore formation of dissolution conduits in the karst system is possible due to contamination credit authorship contribution statement

to 50 aquifer hydraulic conductivity should be higher due to the fissure nature of the rock mendez 1993 indicates values between 10 4 to 10 3 m s the hydraulic gradient is low around 7 5x10 5 with northwesterly and westerly flow direction towards the coast see fig 1 parameterization of the velocity is very difficult in this karstic terrain a calculation of the darcy velocity is a serious underestimate as it does not consider fracture flow groundwater flow velocity values reported in the yucatan peninsula range between 1x10 7 and 1x10 4 m s for the flux in the matrix of the karstic aquifer canul macario et al 2019 2 methods based on the groundwater quality monitoring data it was evident that a contaminant plume was moving away from the mwds klinck and stuart 1999 along the preferential groundwater flow line in a n 30 w direction fig 1 a monitoring network was established drilling six boreholes 8 in in diameter and 50 m deep identified as s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 located 10 25 50 100 300 and 500 m distant from the garbage hill limit respectively the piezometric level was determined and groundwater samples were collected in each borehole at every 5 m of depth starting at the water table a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 1 l min was used for sampling allowing the water in the tube to drain between each sample to ensure liquid removal avoiding cross contamination plastic bottles rinsed with distilled water and the sample itself were used part of each sample was passed through a 0 45 μm filter and placed in 125 ml bottles for sodium and potassium determination samples were no preserved since the analyzes were performed in less than 48 h after collection water quality parameters were examined laboratory analysis techniques published in rice et al 2017 were applied to determine major ions calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chlorides cl bicarbonates hco3 sulfates so4 2 and nitrates no3 the ionic balance was carried out and the error percentage in the determination of the ions considered in milliequivalents per liter was calculated according to eqn 1 deutsch and siegel 2020 1 e r r o r c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i

multiparameter probe the probe sensors accuracy are temperature 0 15 c for ph 0 2 units ec 1 millisiemens and do 0 2 mg l each sensor was calibrated with its corresponding standard solution the same parameters described above were determined in samples of leachate and groundwater collected from a background well snat this is a dug well located one kilometer distant upstream used to determine if the local groundwater is affected by the mwds leachate a dilution line was used to evaluate the mixing process along a flowline relating chloride and hco3 in a scatter plot a positive relationship would indicate leachate presence in the aquifer when both variables increase from the least to the most contaminated borehole the statgraphics plus version 5 1 program manugistics 1992 was used to carry out the statistical data treatment the chemical balance and graphical analyzes of water samples were carried out applying the hydrogeochemical software aquachem v 4 waterloo hydrogeologic inc 2003 saturation indices si of groundwater with respect to calcite dolomite and aragonite were calculated through the phreeq program linked to aquachem the same was used to compute pco2 and speciation as well as to perform the inverse modeling 3 results and discussion the data collected corresponds to sampling campaigns carried out over five years covering periods of rain and drought after the mwds closure average physicochemical properties measured are summarized below 3 1 leachate chemistry leachate samples had an electrical conductivity of 21 466 ms cm cl 4375 33 mg l and hco3 4626 6 mg l were the predominant anions fig 2 these high values fall between the average ones published in the literature christensen et al 2001 lindamulla et al 2022 ma et al 2022 moody and townsend 2017 rajoo et al 2020 hco3 concentrations agree to the leachate high ph values between 7 78 and 8 0 sulfate concentrations were low compared to the other anions during the rainy periods 140 mg l but they increased in the dry season 610 mg l gonzalez herrera 2005 studied in detail the leachate behavior and the waste degradation phases in the merida mwds pointing out that the lower concentrations obtained in the rainy seasons may correspond to a leachate in the methanogenic stage in which the ph is high and the sulfur species hs and h2s are the dominant ones christensen et al 2001 dharmarathne and gunatilake 2013 high sulfate concentrations occur in the acid phase of degradation however in dry season ph values of 7 78 were obtained indicative of a basic phase presence no3 is not present due to reducing state of the leachate thus in the rainy periods very low concentrations were detected less than10 0 mg l however during the dry season no3 concentration rose to 471 mg l since high concentrations of sulfates were also obtained for this period it follows that there is oxygen in the system that allows ammonium and sulfide oxidizing bacteria to be present ca2 and mg2 low concentrations 103 23 and 58 03 mg l respectively are indicative of a leachate in its methanogenic stage ehring 1989 na and k concentrations were high 2785 and 1749 mg l respectively only a small part of these ions is governed by reactions such as precipitation complexation and sorption just like chloride christensen et al 2001 wijekoon et al 2022 in addition no difference can be observed between the acidic and methanogenic phases for these ions ehring 1989 3 2 background groundwater chemistry snat chemistry was fig 2 ca2 106 56 mg l mg2 12 43 mg l na 35 33 mg l k 2 93 mg l cl 49 1 mg l hco3 341 46 so4 2 16 33 no3 21 87 mg l there were lower sodium potassium chloride bicarbonate and sulfate contents compared to the leachate chemistry electrical conductivity ec total ion concentration 0 778 ms cm indicates low mineralization average ph values 6 87 are close to neutrality temperature 28 63 c and do 2 mg l calcite and aragonite saturation indices were very close to equilibrium a slight tendency towards undersaturation was obtained during the dry season table 1 higher si would be expected or mineral precipitation due to a longer contact time of the groundwater with the solid phase as there is no recharge to the aquifer aghazadeh et al 2016 lyu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however the higher than atmospheric 10 3 5 atm pco2 obtained explains the groundwater undersaturation with respect to these minerals groundwater was undersaturated with respect to dolomite it is the least soluble mineral of the three so if it is in the system it will take longer to reach equilibrium appelo and postma 1996 langmuir 1997 3 3 leachate in groundwater chloride concentrations profiles were elaborated for the six control boreholes fig 3 this ion was considered indicative and representative of the leachate presence in the aquifer because it is a dominant ion in mwds leachates it does not undergo any chemical or physicochemical reaction in aquifers with dilution being its only attenuation mechanism brad et al 2022 christensen et al 2001 robertson et al 2021 in fig 3 the zero value of the ordinate axis corresponds to the water table note that on the abscissa axis the concentration scales are not the same for the profiles of the six boreholes the centerline of the leachate plume was identified at a depth of 25 m a chloride advance appeares in the three boreholes closest to the mwds 200 475 mg l it was accentuated in the next three 146 250 mg l the leachate presence and dilution in the contaminant plume can be depicted in fig 4 chloride ion was used as a tracer in combination with bicarbonate hco3 the fitted line represents the theoretical dilution of the leachate mixed with the background water sample snat collected upstream of the mwds data corresponding to samples collected at 25 m depth are plotted note that the results correlate with the dilution line 3 4 hydrogeochemical evolution of aquifer contamination major ions concentrations in all monitoring boreholes were plotted in piper diagrams to classify the underlying groundwater according to its ionic content fig 5 snat samples correspond to the predominant calcium bicarbonate ca2 hco3 groundwater type in the region cabrera et al 2002 sánchez ahuactzin et al 2018 underlying the mwds a mixed type water was detected containing 20 to 60 of calcium and magnesium and 40 to 60 of sodium anion contents ranged from 40 to 60 for chlorides and bicarbonates and sulfates were lower than 20 this change from a calcium bicarbonate to a mixed type of water is due to the mwds leachate contaminating the aquifer this mixing process is clearly depicted in fig 5 snat had cl hco3 molar ratio values of 0 2 and 0 3 for the rainy and dry periods respectively fig 6 this parameter is greater than or equal to 1 in boreholes closest to the mwds boundary and is between 0 8 and 0 9 in the furthest ones although the difference is minimal these values show an increase in groundwater mineralization due to the increase in chloride concentrations indicating that the water has been affected by the leachate despite the fact that the leachate contributes chlorides to the system the waste degradation reactions generate co2 that can increase bicarbonates content in the system which is reflected in the ec values variation of this ion ratio with time was analyzed considering boreholes s2 and s4 as representative of the karst aquifer system fig 7 s2 presented an exponential mineralization increase and cl hco3 ratio with time that is the relationship increases from the most recent period to the oldest although it is almost constant at the beginning this can be interpreted as an evolution of chlorinated waters due to the leachate effect towards the plume attenuation therefore mineralization and chloride content tend to decline on the other hand the boreholes farthest from the mwds see s4 in fig 7 did not show an evolutionary trend they had an almost constant cl hco3 ratio which was not influenced by an increase in mineralization although the mineralization did not vary temporally it presented a spatial variation see fig 6 that is the electrical conductivity was higher in s1 2 4 ms cm and decreased to near 1 4 ms cm in s6 3 5 carbonate system alteration groundwater was undersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals calcite has the greatest tendency to equilibrium followed by aragonite leaving dolomite in third place this is explained because aragonite and calcite have similar ionic composition and solubility products log ksp 8 48 and 8 34 respectively langmuir 1997 on the other hand dolomite presents a lower solubility product log ksp 17 09 therefore it will take longer to reach equilibrium along the flow line the saturation indices oscillate from one borehole to another with no clear trend with respect to groundwater flow fig 8 shows pco2 vs ca2 mg2 and ph vs hco3 for boreholes s1 and s4 ca2 mg2 is greater than 3 5 mmol l with higher pco2 values compared to snat whose pco2 10 1 6 atm 0 025 atm and ca2 mg2 2 9 mmol l in the rainy season l during the dry season j the pco2 was higher close to 10 1 06 atm 0 087 atm and the ca2 mg2 content was 3 2 mmol l a proportional rise in hco3 with ph and an inverse ca2 mg2 vs pco2 proportionality is observed in s1 the equilibrium reactions taking place in a system with carbonate minerals is expressed in eqn 2 langmuir 1997 2 co 2 g h 2 o h 2 c o 3 h h c o 3 this reaction contributes to the high bicarbonate values typically found in leachate deutsch and siegel 2020 when a source of co2 exists there will be greater calcite dissolution while co2 release will cause the precipitation of this mineral as summarized in eqn 3 3 cac o 3 co 2 g h 2 o ca 2 h c o 3 thus a ca2 mg2 decrease would indicate both dilution and the possibility of calcite precipitation therefore the high bicarbonates content in the leachate explains the pco2 trend to increase and minerals precipitation however the ph rise h ions reduction indicates that hco3 acts as a buffer favoring calcite precipitation this result would differ to the behavior of the carbonate systems studied by christensen et al 2001 and vadillo 2003 where landfill leachates led to carbonate minerals dissolution calcite precipitation could also take place in s4 samples a f and d fig 10 in the first instance due to the ca2 mg2 concentrations and to the effect caused in the equilibrium reactions by the increase in bicarbonate concentration subsequently no ca2 mg2 and pco2 relationship was noticed samples h and i attributed to the fact that the leachate plume attenuates at this point ca2 mg2 reduction could also be due to complexes formed from the mixing of groundwater with leachate becoming part of other species in solution according to the ph and pco2 values in the system figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows that more than 92 of the calcium existed in the form of a free ion reaching a maximum of 94 in points with less leachate influence the importance of hco3 and co3 2 ions is the formation of complexes which in a leachate contamination plume are associated with calcium magnesium iron and manganese ions this association was reflected in speciation it was observed that the second most important species dissolved in water was cahco3 aq with values of 2 in wells with less leachate influence and 3 in wells s1 and s2 close to the limit of the mwds at these points the percentage of calcium as a free ion declines favoring caso4 aq and caco3 aq formation calcium ions became part of other species in solution in boreholes closest to the dump affecting the carbonate minerals solubility depending on the ph and pco2 that control their concentration as far as magnesium speciation is concerned the same complexes formation trend as for calcium was obtained fig 10 in boreholes closest to the dump magnesium concentration as a free ion was reduced regarding speciation it is inferred that a decline in calcium and magnesium ions was not necessarily due to carbonate minerals precipitation because of hco3 excess ca2 and mg2 could become part of other species in solution in agreement with the system ph and pco2 values 3 6 inverse modeling a mass balance was carried out to calculate the amount of mass transferred between the different phases solid liquid and gas in order to interpret the processes involved in changes occurring in the carbonate system analyzed appelo and postma 1996 deutsch and siegel 2020 martinez et al 2000 parkhurst and appelo 1999 to integrate the model the following mineral phases were considered calcite dolomite and aragonite in accordance with the equilibrium state dissolution or precipitation they presented in the leachate affected groundwater flow direction the gaseous phases co2 and o2 were considered in consonance to the behavior calculated and determined n2 h2s and h2 were also considered in congruence to a study carried out by gonzález et al 2004 the model assumes that the groundwater characteristics at the end of the flow line are the result of the water initial composition and the phases it has encountered along the way the modeling exercise summarized in table 2 confirms the low and unstable effect of leachate on the carbonate minerals equilibrium along the preferential groundwater flow line a negative sign indicates that the phase is consumed dissolution and positive values indicate that the phases are produced precipitation calcite dolomite and calcite dissolution occurred between snat s1 and s1 s2 respectively as well as a co2 g deficit from the system h2s generation 0 63 mmol l was confirmed in s1 whose presence had been suggested by gonzález et al 2004 according to this gas characteristic odor which is lost from s2 between s2 s3 co2 g production coincides with calcite 0 133 mmol l and dolomite 0 565 mmol l minerals precipitation aragonite did not undergo any change as is namely associated to biogenic precipitatin co2 g loss 1 80 mmol l on average in s4 s5 and s6 manifested itself with little or no change in the balance of minerals in s4 s5 the system anaerobic state is noted in the model with several millimoles of gas oxygen losses in agreement with field oxygen concentrations close to 1 mg l dissolution and precipitation reactions varied between segments of the contaminated groundwater flow line the inverse model showed that solute transport is minimal along the flow line carbonate minerals dissolve closest to the mwds where the highest concentration leachate mixed with groundwater is present more distant an unstable behavior between dissolution and equilibrium exists 4 conclusions the spatial variation of the contamination of the carbonated aquifer underlying the old waste disposal site in merida mexico was manifested as an evolution of groundwater from a mixed chlorinated type due to the effect of leachate to a calcium bicarbonated type the contaminant plume shows signs of attenuation reflected in decreasing trends in mineralization and chloride content carbonate minerals dissolution would take place in the most affected portion of the aquifer the high bicarbonate content in the leachate acts as a buffer preventing the ph from declining due to the presence of co2 which according to the equilibrium reactions leads to a reduction of ca2 and mg2 and the formation of calcium and magnesium species the solubility of the carbonated minerals where leachate content is higher was affected by the formation of complexes the inverse geochemical modeling quantitatively showed that a contaminant attenuation takes place along the groundwater flow line but that indeed the leachate leads to the possibility of minerals dissolution in the system analyzed it can be inferred that in the studied system the leachate causes carbonate minerals dissolution therefore formation of dissolution conduits in the karst system is possible due to contamination credit authorship contribution statement
