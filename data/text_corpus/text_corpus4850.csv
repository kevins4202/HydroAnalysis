24250,anadromous arctic char salvelinus alpinus iqaluppik and their freshwater habitats are vulnerable to the effects of climate change spawning habitats are critical to ensure the propagation of populations and the fisheries they support however detailed descriptions for river systems in the canadian arctic are limited especially in the nunavik region as arctic char is a traditionally important species for culture and subsistence of inuit some harvesters have a deep knowledge pertaining to habitat use including optimal habitat conditions for spawning interviews of inuit knowledge holders on arctic char were conducted in three communities of nunavik canada kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk from the knowledge of inuit experts the most suitable spawning habitats were located in rivers at depths between 0 6 m and 1 5 m with velocities 0 1 m s a large range of riverbed substrate was deemed suitable as long as the smaller substrate size class showed some presence of gravel or coarse sand depending on the local geomorphology we used fuzzy logic to code natural language description provided by inuit experts into a numerical value representing the habitat suitability index for spawning sites the model was able to predict the spawning habitat suitability or unsuitability of 14 out of 15 sites given values of depth velocity and substrate the methodology presented is well suited to build quantitative model based on the description of local observations and could be applied for other animal or plant species for which local and or traditional knowledge

economical importance for inuit families and communities of nunavik canada blanchet et al 2002 watts et al 2017 berkes 2018 adults anadromous arctic char exclusively feed in marine environment during one to two summer months they return to freshwater systems for reproduction and or overwintering until the next downstream migration during the ice breakup the spawning period between mid september and mid october cunjak et al 1986 johnson 1980 is a popular fishing season hence knowledge of reproduction habitat preferences is important for northern communities to protect critical arctic char habitat especially in the context of potential vulnerability such as low water level and bank erosion increasingly observed in nunavik neelin 2021 and in other northern regions smart 2021 local organization of hunters trappers and fishers local nunavimmi umajulirijiit katujjiqatigiinninga lnuk in nunavik have concerns about the stocks of arctic char that are perceived to have decreased in some communities of ungava bay there are indeed more frequent observations from fishers that mature arctic char have difficulties to access their spawning habitats during their upstream migration as they become more limited and or disconnected and even some watercourses which no longer sustaining char populations lnuk meeting kangiqsualujjuaq 2019 pers communication w cain jr tasiujaq 2019 pers communication in nunavik anadromous arctic char mainly spawn in rivers from small streams to delimited areas of large rivers and areas of flowing water in lake inlets and outlets johnson 1980 reist et al 2018 dubos et al inpress to our knowledge no spawning habitat suitability model has been established for anadromous arctic char in rivers a few spawning sites used by anadromous arctic char in rivers were described in the literature dempson and green 1985 johnson 1980 cunjak et al 1986 however their descriptions were not made in a perspective of detailed habitat characterization and the information provided was not sufficient to infer preferred ranges of values for depth velocity and substrate required to construct predictive models of spawning habitat local or traditional knowledge holders like indigenous people can have a deep understanding of species distribution and behavior through the regular observation of animals especially when they are part of subsistence or traditional country food mackinson and nøttestad 1998 berkes and berkes 2009 traditional ecological knowledge tek is a qualitative knowledge and a way of knowing that derived from the experience and traditions of a particular group of people usher 2000 it is a cumulative body of knowledge practice and belief evolving by adaptative processes and handed down though generations by cultural transmission about the relationship of living beings including humans with one another and with their environment berkes 2017 tek has been used to inform animals habitat studies for instance for seals gryba et al 2021 and in habitat modeling through cartographic description for caribou and moose polfus et al 2014 tendeng et al 2016 although increasingly used in habitat models tek remains rarely quantitatively integrated in scientific studies nor used as the main source of information roux et al 2019 stern and humphries 2022 inuit hunters are harvesting arctic char since time immemorial and are traditional knowledge holders scientists studying fish population have worked advantageously with inuit hunters for data collection bell and harwood 2012 and inuit knowledge is more and more considered in fisheries management moller et al 2004 snook et al 2019 since inuit knowledge is accumulated from the past but also an evolving and current knowledge usher 2000 it allows to identify environmental change and trends including changes in abundance when quantitative data were limited knopp et al 2012 janjua et al 2016 falardeau et al 2022 however inuit knowledge has not been yet incorporated in the understanding of physical arctic char habitat though the fish use the same specific spawning sites year after year kristofferson 2003 moore et al 2017 and are regularly observed by inuit harvesters experts systems have the faculty to model and represent human logic reasoning using linguistic variables i e by reasoning on imprecise data among them bayesian modeling e g tantipisanuh et al 2014 or fuzzy logic zadeh 1965 can be applied to predict habitat suitability however in bayesian models experts knowledge is most often used to supplement quantitative field data which are costly and challenging to acquire in arctic remote environment indeed the posterior distribution obtained in bayesian models if often based on field data see e g ellison 2004 fuzzy logic is a method that allow for the incorporation of the complex indigenous knowledge in ecological modeling through qualitatively described observations berkes and berkes 2009 without the need of quantitative input data the fuzzy logic method consists of using reasoning through logic rules to get a numerical value representing a degree of truth between 0 and 1 the method is suitable for modeling the behavior of living species from fishers knowledge since it allows one to consider the continuum that exists between descriptive variables and the uncertainty in associated ranges of variable values to categories mackinson and nøttestad 1998 this method was successfully applied to assess habitat suitability of several fish species based on scientific experts opinion mouton et al 2007 ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 mocq et al 2013 wegscheider et al 2021 nevertheless the results of the model can be biased by the geographical origin of the experts who established the variables categories and logic rules as their observations were made in different environments mocq et al 2015 thus using this finding positively local or traditional knowledge rooted in specific regions can be expected to yield relevant information for regional fish habitat studies fuzzy logic modeling can thus be useful when applied in concert with inuit knowledge given the limited detailed scientific data pertaining to the physical characteristics of anadromous arctic char spawning sites in nunavik region the overall goal of the study is to model and assess spawning habitat suitability based only on inuit knowledge inuit knowledge inuit qaujimajatuqangit is a way of being and embraces all aspect of the inuit traditional culture nunavut department of education 2007 in the present study the term inuit knowledge is nonetheless restricted to the factual knowledge of the environment category 1 usher 2000 our specific objectives were to assess if 1 inuit knowledge can describe accurately spawning habitat with the classical fish habitat model variables water depth velocity and substrate and if 2 fuzzy logic was well suited to use knowledge of inuit hunters for quantitative analysis of arctic char spawning sites building habitat suitability model for spawning sites will bring insight for river habitats and fisheries management by local communities 3 methods 3 1 study area the study was conducted in the three communities of kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk located in the ungava bay nunavik quebec canada fig 1 regional climate is classified as polar with mean annual temperature of 5 7 c and mean annual precipitation of 526 mm with average snowfall of 257 cm year from kuujjuaq a meteorological station kangiqsualujjuaq is located on the east side of the bay on the shore of the george river and the land is covered with shrub tundra with local forested tundra in valleys lowlands tasiujaq is located south of the west coast of ungava bay on the shore of the berard river in shrub tundra zone kangirsuk lies on the west coast of ungava bay along the ariaq river payne arnaud river and is at the edge of shrub tundra zone and herb tundra zone the villages of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq lie both on widespread discontinued permafrost at the edge of continuous permafrost whereas kangirsuk is on continuous permafrost zone l hérault and allard 2018 in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq bed substrate consists mainly of shallow marine deposits mrnf québec 2004 with gravel size substrate inter mixed among larger size boulders and is more heterogenous than in kangirsuk area around these two communities arctic char have access to a large variety of streams and lakes in kangirsuk arctic char spawning sites were mainly identified in large and fast flowing rivers such as the kuugat buet and avaluk vachon which have slopes of 4 2 and 3 6 respectively on their lowest 30 km used locally by arctic char for spawning the rivers around kangirsuk are flowing over fluviatile deposits mrnf québec 2004 3 2 interviews of inuit experts interviews were conducted during summer 2019 with elders and younger active hunters from the kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk villages inuit hunters who conduct both hunting and fishing activities play an important role in inuit communities as they provide country food and contribute to the maintenance of social relationships kishigami 2000 the participants were selected by the local hunters and trappers associations local nunavimmi umajulirijiit katujaqatigininga lnuk for their knowledge of arctic char and are herein referred to as experts of the arctic char a total of 11 experts were interviewed among them two were women and nine were men nine of the participants were elders and two were middle aged experienced hunters elders were considered very knowledgeable in their communities and held in great respect interviews were conducted on an individual basis in kangiqsualujjuaq n 5 and tasiujaq n 3 although participants from kangirsuk requested to be interviewed as a group n 3 the interviews were conducted in semi directed form mainly under informal conversation framed with fixed topics and questions see interview guide in dubos et al 2023 supp material all interviews were conducted by the first author with the assistance of inuktitut english interpreters except for the two youngest participants who were interviewed directly in english it was noticed that all participants were comfortable specifying when they were unsure or did not have knowledge of certain aspects or sites more detail on the interviews context and process and on the qualitative analysis is given in dubos et al inpress specific questions were asked about anadromous arctic char river habitat preferences for spawning with multiple choice answers based on photos and videos for the present study the habitat patch scale 0 10 m2 preferences were based on the information collected on water depth velocity and substrate type selected by arctic char these three variables correspond to classical fish habitat variables used as inputs in models bovee 1986 five photos showing different substrate with increasing range of mean diameter and including different levels of heterogeneity fig 2 were presented to the participants who gave an opinion on the suitability of the substrate for spawning to assess the suitable velocities three videos of flowing rivers were presented showing current velocities of 0 10 m s 0 27 m s and 0 73 m s as they appeared to be representative of velocities of categories of low medium and high mocq et al 2013a mouton et al 2008 that could be expressed in natural language questions about depth used by the fish to spawn were simply answered by participants giving numerical values in feet although a measuring tape was available some spawning sites were also located on maps independently of the site descriptions most of the spawning sites identified on maps were well known by the participants of the same community and by other collaborators including our fieldwork guides a validation of the interview transcription was done by lead author with each participant except for three of them who were not available to ensure experts opinion and interpretation were adequately reported and coded this validation process was conducted with interpreters translating the english synthesis of information to inuktitut to minimize misunderstandings misinterpretations that could have arisen from translation a synthesis of the information collected during the interviews was produced and provided to the participants to the lnuk and the municipal office of each community and to the nunavik research center informed written consent was given by each participant the location of spawning sites illustrated on maps during the interviews had to remain confidential an ethics certificate for research involving humans was obtained from the ethics committee of institut national de la recherche scientifique for the conduct of the interviews cer 19 517 3 3 fuzzy logic model habitat suitability of spawning sites were modelled using fuzzy logic the general principle of fuzzy logic is a mathematical method that handles unprecise fuzzy variables as input data and applies simple relations between these data called logic rules zadeh 1965 the resulting combinations of these rules is a solution that represents a degree of truth 0 completely false 1 completely true in our case the input variables were the local characteristics of the physical variables river depth velocity and substrate described during the interviews and the output was a habitat suitability index hsi the fuzzy logic method was implemented with the matlab fuzzy toolbox mathworks 2018 a general description of the procedure and the definition of membership function is given in mocq et al 2013 and beaupré et al 2019 in our study the following specific steps were applied 1 transform input variables i e physical habitat variables depth velocity and substrate and model output i e spawning habitat suitability index into fuzzy sets fuzzification a fuzzy set is described by a range of values of a variable assigned to a category to which is associated a membership function 0 no membership 1 100 membership in the specified category fig 3 to incorporate the uncertainty about the boundaries of each category the so called fuzziness each value of the specified variable can belong to one or more categories simultaneously the limits of the categories were established according to interviews results see section 4 2 1 for a given combination of input variables the model output was a value of habitat suitability index hsi not to be confused with the membership function the hsi also varies from 0 habitat is inadequate to 1 habitat is fully adequate the hsi fuzzy set was also chosen to have three categories with low hsi 0 5 meaning a poorly suitable habitat medium 0 3 hsi 0 7 for moderate suitability and high hsi 0 5 for good habitat suitability it was not possible to determine a consensus in the literature on the standard limits for hsi categories a triangular membership function was chosen for the medium category of the hsi fuzzy sets to better differentiate between suitable or unsuitable sites similarly to ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 and zhang et al 2016 the same fuzzy sets were used for each set of rules 2 establish logic rules for combinations of the variables and the implication on the suitability of the spawning sites for instance if the substrate is in the coarse high category and the velocity is in the medium category and the water depth belongs to the medium category then hsi is in the high category i e this site has good spawning habitat suitability rules were established from the interviews results according to selected scenarios to verify and consider inter community differences and similarities see section 4 1 4 3 run the model apply the rules the model was applied to field data for validation the key habitat variables depth velocity and substrate of each validation site were measured a membership value and a category were associated to each of the variable a variable can belong to more than one category simultaneously e g a velocity value of 0 25 m s can belong in the low category with a membership of 0 5 and to the medium category with the same membership value thereby representing the uncertainty or fuzziness for this reason several rules can be applied at the same time their association is called aggregation in the present study the maximum method was applied for aggregation i e the combined resulting membership function value for hsi fig 4 4 defuzzify the aggregate fuzzy hsi to get a crisp numerical value of hsi between 0 and 1 0 unsuitability of habitat and 1 maximum habitat suitability three defuzzification methods were tested fig 5 i the centroid for which the crisp value corresponds to the abscissa of the center of gravity of the aggregated hsi ii the mom which is the abscissa of the middle of the maximum aggregation and iii the lom which is the abscissa largest value of the maximum aggregation ouellet et al 2021 3 4 intra community similarities inter community differences and establishment of model scenarios for a given community the spawning site characteristics were described similarly although some individual variations between responses were encountered fig 6 and table s1 supp data the small number of answers for variables categories did not allow us to apply distribution tests to compare potential inter community differences as statistical power was too low 1 β 0 1 however during the interviews a discrepancy was noted between spawning site descriptions by the kangirsuk experts and those from the other two communities kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq which seemed qualitatively in agreement in kangirsuk spawning sites were known to be specifically located in little bays along large rivers the differences of suitable ranges of habitat variables were mostly noticeable regarding velocities and substrate hence five spawning habitat models were built using different scenarios for input information model 1a 1b and 1c rules from each community alone respectively kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk model 2 combined rules from the two communities of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq model 3 combined rules from all the three communities of kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk 3 5 partial validation of the habitat suitability index hsi 3 5 1 validation sites the models built from inuit knowledge were applied on 15 river sites table 1 located in the three communities validation sites were distributed in three different river systems in kangiqsualujjuaq and two different systems in tasiujaq sites in kangirsuk were all in the payne river while in the same river all sites were in different river sections separated by a few hundred meters for the closest ones the spawning sites were selected among the accessible sites located on maps during the interviews field guides also knew the exact location of those sites non spawning sites were selected randomly during the fieldwork in areas known to not support spawning but connected to spawning areas and not showing obvious limitation for the fish the sites were characterized in the field in september 2019 at or near the beginning of the spawning season arctic char in spawning color were observed in some identified spawning sites during the characterization but their presence during the fieldwork could not be a criterion for the identification of sites as the spawning was not already started no fish were seen at non spawning sites the measurements done at validation sites were representative of the habitat patch scale 0 10 m2 water depth was measured with a weighed measuring tape and the smallest class of substrate with at least 15 of areal coverage was estimated visually directly or using underwater camera mean surface velocity was estimated by measuring the time taken by a floating object to run through a distance from 1 m to 3 m we chose to work with the surface velocity as observed by inuit from the shore or by boat the resulting hsi of these sites were used for partial validation of the model s performance in the present study the models were built to assess spawning site suitability in rivers or lake inlet or outlet but not in deeper areas or lakes 3 5 2 results analysis each of these five models see 3 4 were built using different defuzzification methods the mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 was used to compared the performance of the different models according to the three defuzzification methods tested centroid mom lom the null hypothesis was that model mean hsi calculated on sites with presence of spawning and on sites with absence of spawning had the same distribution a rejection of the null hypothesis indicated that one of the mean hsi was significantly higher than the other the results agreement to the field data was assessed using cohen s kappa coefficient κ cohen 1960 the kappa value is a measure of a true agreement of two data sets in our case spawning non spawning and model prediction beyond the by chance agreement and is calculated from the following equation mouton et al 2008 1 κ a d a c a b b d c d n n a c a b b d c d n where a is the number of true positive predictions b is the number of false positive predictions c is the number of false negative predictions d is the number of true negative predictions and n is the number of data points a positive value of κ implies that the model is in agreement with the data the strength of agreement can be scaled between slight 0 0 2 fair 0 21 0 4 moderate 0 41 0 6 substantial 0 61 0 8 or almost perfect 0 81 1 landis and koch 1977 in addition to the kappa value the model sensitivity and the specificity respectively the percentage of true positive suitable spawning prediction on spawning site and true negative unsuitable prediction on non spawning sites were calculated 4 results 4 1 inuit knowledge about spawning sites characteristics an interview synthesis of the information about the suitability of the physical variables for anadromous arctic char spawning sites is provided in table s1 supp data 4 1 1 depth suitability there was a consensus on water depth suitability or unsuitability for spawning sites all participants 100 mentioned that depths between 0 6 m and 1 5 m were suitable for spawning fig 6 water depth less than 0 6 m were deemed inappropriate by 78 of participants for different reasons such as the greater vulnerability to predators and the risks of freezing in the winter or dewatering during low flows three participants indicated that depths higher than 1 5 m were also suitable 27 one participant from kangiqsualujjuaq and the participants of kangirsuk 36 declared depths higher than 1 5 m as unsuitable and the other participants did not express an opinion about the upper limit of depth preferences 4 1 2 velocity suitability 73 of the experts indicated that spawning takes place only in rivers including in areas located near outlet or inlet of lakes where there is flowing water and 27 think that some anadromous arctic char can spawn in deeper area of lakes too the presence of flowing water was considered an important variable for the choice of spawning site and a suitable velocity could be either slow or medium 0 10 m s and 0 27 m s videos in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq even fast velocity from the 0 73 m s video was considered more suitable than unsuitable hence the range of the suitable velocities was rather large according to the experts of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq the less suitable condition for anadromous arctic char was null or near zero velocity in kangirsuk where the rivers used by arctic char to spawn are large and fast flowing the suitable velocities were described as slow and always associated with habitat located in side bays protected from the current of the river main channel 4 1 3 substrate suitability substrate photos presented were initially planned to represent a range of substrate diameter including different levels of heterogeneity fig 2 nonetheless the answers to these images indicated that any bed substrate could be good for spawning as long as there was the presence of gravel patches in kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk or coarse sand in kangirsuk table s1 supp data sand or finer sediment were declared unsuitable for spawning sites in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq hence the model was built using the representative diameter of the smallest class of substrate 4 2 establishing fuzzy sets and logic rules 4 2 1 input variables fuzzy sets fuzzy sets were defined by three categories low medium high associated to a range of values of each habitat variable by a membership function fig 3 the three categories of depth d were defined by the participants through their description of habitat used by spawning char low d 0 6 m medium 0 6 m d 1 5 m and high d 1 5 m for velocity the participants found the videos presented well suited to correspond to the different categories of velocities low 0 1 m s medium 0 27 m s high 0 73 m s the substrate categories were established from the experts comments according to the smallest class of bed substrate instead of the mean grain size of overall substrate corresponding to the photos indeed participants were discriminating photos showing riverbeds with presence of gravel or coarse sand for the suitable substrate diameter independently of the presence of other larger substrate the range of substrate diameter was implicitly associated to the following classes sand 0 062 to 2 mm gravel 2 to 64 mm cobble 64 to 256 mm boulder 256 mm valentine 2019 the boundaries and overlap of the membership functions were established to be simultaneously linked to the perception of the variable category and to the physical characteristic of the variable a smaller overlap of membership functions was used when the experts could easily discriminate the categories like for example low and medium substrate linked respectively to sand and gravel a larger overlap was used when the membership to a category was less consensual like for example cobble substrate which could be classified as either medium or large 4 2 2 logic rules five sets of specific logic rules and thus five fuzzy models were established from the three scenarios of input information see 3 4 the sets of rules described the implication of different combinations of variables on the suitability of a spawning site from the interviews results table 2 both the specific answers to the variables suitability fig 6 and the conversational descriptions given during the interviews were used 4 3 fuzzy models result habitat suitability index hsi 4 3 1 comparison of defuzzification method the five fuzzy models sets of rules were applied to the 15 characterized validation sites classified as spawning or non spawning sites table 1 for each model the resulting hsi were compared to the actual presence or absence of spawning a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the three different defuzzification methods the centroid defuzzification was the most discriminating method for sites suitability as the mean hsi were significantly higher for spawning sites than for non spawning sites for each of the five models mann whitney u test table 3 with the centroid method the mean hsi calculated on identified spawning sites was above 0 5 and the mean hsi on non spawning sites was below 0 5 except for model 1c built with data from kangirsuk only table 3 for this model 1c the value of mean hsi for spawning sites hsi 0 45 remained below 0 50 making it difficult to assess suitability of some sites however as for other models the difference of mean hsi between spawning and non spawning was significant 0 45 vs 0 28 the largest difference was achieved for model 3 information from the three communities together with a mean hsi of 0 62 for spawning sites and of 0 26 for non spawning sites when using mom and lom defuzzification methods the difference between hsi calculated for spawning sites and hsi calculated for non spawning sites decreased with the mom methods only the results for model 1a information from kangiqsualujjuaq only and model 3 information from the three communities together showed a significant difference in hsi values between spawning and non spawning sites table s2 table s3 and table s4 in supp data with the lom methods more models showed significant difference in hsi however the resultant hsi were not only higher at spawning sites but also higher at non spawning sites often close or even above 0 5 which made it more difficult to discriminate suitable from unsuitable sites fig 7 4 3 2 comparison of model scenarios compared to the results for scenario 1 or scenario 2 scenario 3 improved the ability to detect unsuitable spawning sites and to discriminate spawning and non spawning sites with respectively a sensitivity of 83 and a specificity of 100 the model agreement to the field data given by the kappa value was also the highest for model 3 κ 0 80 this model successfully assessed the suitability of 14 of the 15 sites from the information given by all inuit experts the lowest kappa value κ 0 30 was obtained for model 1b and model 2 as these models gave hsi values inferior of 0 5 for two spawning sites and three hsi values of 0 5 for non spawning sites fig 8 the three models of scenario 1 built with information from only one community did not perform significantly better on validation sites from the same community table s5 in supp data models 1a and 1b perform similarly on all identified spawning sites but showed discrepancies on sites of absence model 1b information from tasiujaq only gave higher hsi on non spawning sites of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq increasing the possibility of false positive even on tasiujaq sites model 1c gave the lowest mean hsi for both spawning and non spawning sites including on kangirsuk validation sites 5 discussion 5 1 inuit knowledge supports scientific literature on spawning sites examples of anadromous arctic char spawning habitat characterization are relatively scarce in the literature but some studies covering various geographic regions have described spawning sites characteristics that could be compared with the present study the most suitable depth range given by the inuit experts 0 6 m to 1 5 m was slightly narrower but comparable to the ranges described in the literature where records indicate suitable depths between 0 2 m and 2 m johnson 1980 dempson and green 1985 cunjak et al 1986 beddow et al 1998 the measured water velocities described in these studies were also variable between 0 2 m s and 0 8 m s but non zero similar to what was described by inuit participants in the present study streams used by anadromous arctic char to spawn in nunavik and northern labrador still flow during winter and the minimum depth to prevent freezing is about 0 6 m as mentioned by inuit experts this stream use is contrasting to canadian high arctic where the rivers freeze to the bottom preventing anadromous arctic char to spawn in river unless some ground water feed the bottom harwood and babaluk 2014 although some spawning sites described in the literature showed a predominance of gravel and pebble char are known to use also heterogeneous substrates for spawning consisting of a mix of coarse sand gravel pebble and boulders johnson 1980 cunjak et al 1986 beddow et al 1998 larger diameter substrate does not appear to hinder spawning however fine substrate i e fine sand and silt is typically not used for spawning as described by inuit experts char in the fraser river labrador exhibited two nesting strategies associated with the different type of substrate either char dug redds when the substrate was dominated by coarse sand and gravel or they dispersed eggs through the interstices of coarser substrate dempson and green 1985 these two strategies were also described during the interviews as participants from kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq mentioned that char usually do not build redds and the current rather disperses the eggs in the substrate whereas in kangirsuk participants explained that char builds redds in the sand dubos et al 2023 a potentially important finding from the analysis of our interviews is that substrate suitability for arctic char spawning site is linked to the diameter of the smallest class of substrate instead of the mean diameter of substrate the total proportion of this smallest class did not seem to be a factor determining the spawning site selectivity as long as there was a usable patch of suitable substrate the minimal area of the patch is currently unknown the importance of taking specifically into account small size substrate classes or substrate heterogeneity for fish spawning habitat studies has been known for a long time bain et al 1985 nonetheless in previous studies a single value of mean median or dominant substrate diameter was often included to model habitat suitability for example in beaupré et al 2019 garbe et al 2016 ayllón et al 2012 probably because values describing the center of substrate distribution are commonly used in hydraulic and physical habitat models granulometric indices have been widely used to integrate a level of substrate heterogeneity mocq et al 2013 dfo 2015 but when these indices are used the dominant substrate classes are emphasized and the grain size of the smallest substrate class is not specifically represented although it could be of interest for spawning suitability like in our study this finding should be considered when describing substrate class for arctic char and tested for other salmonids habitat suitability studies the fine substrate could be considered from a threshold proportion either by its diameter like we did here or by its proportion further work should be conducted to assess the minimum size of required substrate patch which must be related to the stream size or order experts interviewed expressed that a large variety of velocity and substrate can be suitable for arctic char which is in agreement with the known flexibility in niche selection of the species hammar 2014 thus in the present study the characteristics they deemed unsuitable were also useful to establish rules and discriminate spawning and non spawning sites 5 2 implication of the land based knowledge of inuit experts for sites characterization 5 2 1 intra community inuit experts generally agreed on the characteristics of suitable spawning sites within each community during the interviews most participants from the same community located on maps the same spawning sites since arctic char show high spawning site fidelity the knowledge of inuit experts was gained from their own local use of territory but also from other hunters relatives and ancestors this shared knowledge leads to rich and tested information as their survival depends on it mackinson and nøttestad 1998 berkes 2017 as fuzzy logic is sensitive to the fuzzy rules ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 recommended to combine several experts opinion and ask them for a revision of their opinion in regards to what other participants thought we presented interviews synthesis to the experts following the delphi method leite and gasalla 2013 the validation of the interviews transcription did not result in changes in opinion from the experts about the spawning sites characteristics and the concordant intra community opinion among inuit experts limited the variability of results and was implicitly conducive to knowledge combination 5 2 2 inter community the different hydrographic and geomorphological features related to the geographic location of the communities could result in different inter community perceptions of suitable variable categories for spawning habitats for example a velocity of 0 4 m s in a small spawning stream of tasiujaq could be described as medium whereas the same value could be qualified as low in a side pool of a large rapid river in kangirsuk where arctic char spawning sites were mainly identified that might explain why medium velocities were considered suitable in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq but not in kangirsuk the difference of perception related to the type and size of rivers used by the fish was also one of the modeling challenges identified by mocq et al 2015 as the geographic origin of experts from europe and from north america was a factor that partially explained discrepancies in estimation of suitable habitat this is what was observed for the substrate suitability indeed sand or finer sediment were deemed unsuitable for spawning sites in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq where the riverbed substrate is more heterogenous with gravel size substrate inter mixed among larger size boulders due to the geology mrnf québec 2004 in contrast the reaches of rivers in the kangirsuk region are flowing over fluviatile deposits this explains the presence of sand in the slower reaches of the rivers which are areas used by arctic char to spawn according to the interviews the substrate suitability discrepancies noticed between kangirsuk and the two other communities was consistent with the different geologic characteristics this highlights the importance of investigating the similarities discrepancies of habitat characteristics among region communities the geologic characteristics and the type of surface deposits may be considered as additional model variables to discriminate the regions and established scenarios for the fuzzy rules in addition the global size of streams used for spawning in each community should be also considered indeed the validation site 12 was the only spawning site characterized in kangirsuk whereas the model 1c from kangirsuk experts information performed the worst giving a false negative this site was located on the payne river whereas the discussion during the interviews was based mainly on the kuugat buet and avaluk vachon two tributaries that were of high importance in the past and still are their access in fall for fieldwork was not compatible with our logistic constraints the difference of scale of the rivers might be in cause indeed the depth of the validation site was 1 8 m which falls in the high depth category while categories were established for all communities high depth was nonetheless deemed 100 unsuitable habitat by kangirsuk experts a specific fuzzy set for kangirsuk would have been more adapted as the order of streams used by arctic char was higher hence in future work fuzzy sets should be fitted to each region showing hydrogeomorphologic discrepancies 5 3 potential of fuzzy logic to evaluate spawning habitat suitability from inuit knowledge fuzzy logic was a successful approach for the use of inuit experts knowledge and the models predicted spawning habitat suitability globally adequately for all models using centroid defuzzification method all models exhibited significantly higher hsi for spawning sites than non spawning sites one of the validation spawning sites the site 7 was evaluated as a poor spawning site by all five models this site was located in a small rapid although it was indeed an identified spawning site spawning was observed or at least highly suspected during the fieldwork the hydraulic characteristics of this specific site were not in the range of highly suitable habitat with a depth of 0 6 m and velocity of 0 9 m s the fish might have selected other characteristics since the site is on the downstream side of a large lake hydraulic control it is likely that the presence of a hyporheic flow keep a suitable temperature for the eggs in winter even with a low water depth despite this false negative the agreement of model 3 combined information from the three communities to the field data is substantial with a kappa value of 0 80 showing the ability of the model to assess suitable spawning sites but also unsuitable sites these results highlight the relative agreement in spawning habitat assessment among inuit experts from different communities of the ungava bay region compared to other studies using fuzzy logic with experts for example in beaupré et al 2019 scientific experts had to assess habitat suitability of salmon salmo salar parr from a combination of velocity depth substrate and temperature categories which lead to variable results and a stronger consensus about rivers originating from the experts region in mocq et al 2015 the variability among scientific experts was found to be due to geographic origin possibly also as fish can have specific and local preferences like it was established for brown trout salmo trutta mouton et al 2009 the fact that inuit experts used large territory likely gave them the opportunity to acquire knowledge covering a large range of sites specificities and thus allowed the fuzzy model to be representative of ungava bay arctic char the fuzzy rules were established following the analysis of the interviews content beyond the specific questions on habitat variables depth velocity substrate as the descriptions of spawning sites suitability or unsuitability were also included during the overall discussion which covered a larger scope hence a certain degree of subjectivity is present and some differences in the interpretation of variables combination might depend on the person who is assessing the logic rules however given there was very few disagreements between experts from a same community on the suitable spawning sites characteristics a consensus was generally quite naturally obtained on experts opinion the low number of validation sites did not allow to optimize the model through the definition of variable categories and their range mouton et al 2008 the validation was conducted on all the available validation sites notwithstanding their location in doing so some knowledge that was specific to each community was not considered when applying the model to the variables of a site the validation sites were also situated on rivers of various size which could have an impact on the relative characterization of variables for example in kangirsuk the three validation sites were located in the payne river a major river whereas in tasiujaq they were located on rivers less than 20 m large this means that a depth of 0 8 m that would be deemed suitable for spawning in rivers near tasiujaq would not be suitable in the payne river an increase of the number of validation sites would also allow to do a sensitivity study of the scenarios of input information applied on the different sites regions in addition testing the model on sites outside of the ungava bay region would allow to assess its robustness in other arctic regions in the present study the regional discrepancies were insufficient to truly affect model performance as model 3 i e using the information from all the three communities provided the best performance in terms of spawning site identification although specific values of the three variables depth velocity and substrate chosen to describe spawning sites could be associated to these sites they lacked the hydrogeomorphologic context of the sites e g little bay side channel and may not have been able to provide information that is site specific for example in kangirsuk participants described the river hydrodynamic characteristics at a broader scale than the local spawning habitat the sites were indeed described as shallow sandy little bays in large and fast flowing rivers it would be relevant to include mesoscale habitat information coupled with the fuzzy logic model the use of remote sensing to extract predictive variables at the mesoscale hamann et al 2014 may be a strong complement and should be considered in further studies a difference in scale of analysis between western scientific and indigenous knowledge can actually lead to more complete and improved habitat models polfus et al 2014 and further such studies would be relevant for arctic char spawning habitats 5 4 other variables to be considered according to the inuit experts water temperature triggers the spawning timing dubos et al 2023 water temperature is also an important factor for the quality of eggs incubation jeuthe et al 2016 jobling et al 1993 nonetheless inuit experts could not describe temperature as an absolute variable since the char are in cold environment and the spawning is happening in fall while water temperature is below a certain threshold local temperature and warm thermal refuges could be of interest for the char indeed regarding the habitat selectivity presence of warm thermal refuges is a proxy for the presence of spring fed water source or hyporheic flow in the winter groundwater or hyporheic flow are important to the spawning sites for several char species including dolly varden stewart et al 2010 bull trout baxter and hauer 2000 and brook trout curry and noakes 2011 upwelling of groundwater has also been associated with arctic char spawning grounds near kangiqsualujjuaq cunjak et al 1986 nonetheless groundwater inflow through the riverbed is generally not visible from the surface and is seldom noticed unless the suspected upwelling site is instrumented hence participants did not have any knowledge of the potential presence of underground springs in the rivers or associated to spawning sites however they mentioned that arctic char were choosing sites where the water column was not freezing completely in the winter which suggests the presence of upwelling ground water or hyporheic flow that increase the water temperature in winter further investigations are needed to test the hypothesis of spawning site selectivity according to the presence of groundwater inflow by anadromous arctic char local temperature monitoring of spawning sites in winter could be a research avenue related to spawning selectivity periphyton abundance can be positively associated to groundwater source hunt et al 2006 during the fieldwork done to characterize the validation sites periphyton was observed on the riverbed of several spawning sites and seemed absent from several non spawning sites although it was solely based on qualitative observations periphyton constitute a source of food for benthic invertebrates including chironomids bégin et al 2020 themselves sources of food for juvenile arctic char moore and moore 1974 sinnatamby et al 2012 in addition at a broader scale the probability of occurrence of juvenile was associated to the streams with the highest density of benthic invertebrates danandeh mehr et al 2022 hence at a local scale in addition to the presence of groundwater itself as a selectivity factor the possibility of periphyton being a favorable biotic environment for early stage of fry should be considered in further research on spawning habitats and on connectivity with fry habitat climate change have already major impacts on hydrology and river erosion and thus on available habitat and on connectivity jeuthe et al 2016 for example one of the identified spawning sites on maps during the interviews is now seldom used by arctic char because too many rocks and a low water level make the fish passage difficult hence given the fast modification to the environment it is important to make sure that spawning sites identified by elders are still up to date which was the case of our validation sites regarding temperature climate change can have an impact on the spawning timing since the spawning act seems triggered by water temperature dubos et al inpress and a post spawning warming episode could be detrimental for the eggs and possibly on the eggs incubation jeuthe et al 2016 however climate change impact is still difficult to predict on the direct selectivity of spawning sites in a modeling perspective in the present study only abiotic physical variables were analysed nonetheless during the interviews biotic factors such as the presence of other fish species the increasing abundance of algae or the presence of predators were mentioned by some inuit experts as potential variables that could have an impact on spawning habitat and the presence or not of arctic char on specific sites fish habitat studies would benefit from this traditional and local knowledge about specific sites 6 conclusion fuzzy logic was a successful approach to build a habitat model based on inuit experts knowledge the model predicted spawning habitat suitability index in agreement with the field data for 14 of the 15 validation sites the best results were achieved using the combined information of experts from the three communities of kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk the present study is to our knowledge the first fish habitat model based solely on inuit knowledge and the first spawning habitat suitability model in river for anadromous arctic char the proposed model is intrinsically adapted to the ungava bay region affected by changes in river hydrology and variation of arctic char stock population and can be a useful additional tool for fisheries and river management for example as local initiatives are occasionally conducted to improve fish passage and restore spawning site access to arctic char modeling spawning habitat can add information for river or site selection being able to have a quantitative habitat suitability index of vulnerable sites could serve as a tool for habitat protection by the communities in a context of ongoing pressure for mining development on the territory inuit experts interviewed had good knowledge of the physical characteristics of anadromous arctic char spawning habitats and were able to describe the three classical variables of fish habitat models depth velocity and substrate associated to spawning sites for a given community inuit experts generally agreed on the suitable and unsuitable characteristics of spawning sites however discrepancies of spawning sites description were noted between communities and could be linked to the different local geology and geomorphology the more suitable depths for spawning sites ranged between 0 6 m and 1 5 m and a large range of velocity was deemed suitable as long as there was flowing water arctic char remains flexible in the selection of spawning habitats regarding the substrate the analysis of the interviews highlighted the fact that substrate suitability for arctic char spawning site was depended on the smaller class of substrate instead of the overall mean median or dominant substrate diameter that is often used in fish habitat models this finding should be considered when describing substrate class for further arctic char habitat suitability it would be relevant for future work to add validation sites inside and outside the ungava bay region to assess the model robustness further research should also consider additional predictive variables of spawning site suitability such as biotic factors as mentioned by some inuit experts the potential of groundwater inflow that could not be described by the visual observation of the experts but could be established through local temperature and considering mesoscale habitat through the use of remote sensing these different perspectives highlight the advantages of braiding indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge and methods to increase global understanding of habitat selection the methodology presented in this study allows to formalize the description of local observations in a quantitative model and can be applied for other animal or plant species for which local and or traditional knowledge exists the prerequisite is that the predictive variables of the model can be categorized hence the semi directed interview method including specific questions is compatible with

24250,anadromous arctic char salvelinus alpinus iqaluppik and their freshwater habitats are vulnerable to the effects of climate change spawning habitats are critical to ensure the propagation of populations and the fisheries they support however detailed descriptions for river systems in the canadian arctic are limited especially in the nunavik region as arctic char is a traditionally important species for culture and subsistence of inuit some harvesters have a deep knowledge pertaining to habitat use including optimal habitat conditions for spawning interviews of inuit knowledge holders on arctic char were conducted in three communities of nunavik canada kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk from the knowledge of inuit experts the most suitable spawning habitats were located in rivers at depths between 0 6 m and 1 5 m with velocities 0 1 m s a large range of riverbed substrate was deemed suitable as long as the smaller substrate size class showed some presence of gravel or coarse sand depending on the local geomorphology we used fuzzy logic to code natural language description provided by inuit experts into a numerical value representing the habitat suitability index for spawning sites the model was able to predict the spawning habitat suitability or unsuitability of 14 out of 15 sites given values of depth velocity and substrate the methodology

economical importance for inuit families and communities of nunavik canada blanchet et al 2002 watts et al 2017 berkes 2018 adults anadromous arctic char exclusively feed in marine environment during one to two summer months they return to freshwater systems for reproduction and or overwintering until the next downstream migration during the ice breakup the spawning period between mid september and mid october cunjak et al 1986 johnson 1980 is a popular fishing season hence knowledge of reproduction habitat preferences is important for northern communities to protect critical arctic char habitat especially in the context of potential vulnerability such as low water level and bank erosion increasingly observed in nunavik neelin 2021 and in other northern regions smart 2021 local organization of hunters trappers and fishers local nunavimmi umajulirijiit katujjiqatigiinninga lnuk in nunavik have concerns about the stocks of arctic char that are perceived to have decreased in some communities of ungava bay there are indeed more frequent observations from fishers that mature arctic char have difficulties to access their spawning habitats during their upstream migration as they become more limited and or disconnected and even some watercourses which no longer sustaining char populations lnuk meeting kangiqsualujjuaq 2019 pers communication w cain jr tasiujaq 2019 pers

al 2018 dubos et al inpress to our knowledge no spawning habitat suitability model has been established for anadromous arctic char in rivers a few spawning sites used by anadromous arctic char in rivers were described in the literature dempson and green 1985 johnson 1980 cunjak et al 1986 however their descriptions were not made in a perspective of detailed habitat characterization and the information provided was not sufficient to infer preferred ranges of values for depth velocity and substrate required to construct predictive models of spawning habitat local or traditional knowledge holders like indigenous people can have a deep understanding of species distribution and behavior through the regular observation of animals especially when they are part of subsistence or traditional country food mackinson and nøttestad 1998 berkes and berkes 2009 traditional ecological knowledge tek is a qualitative knowledge and a way of knowing that derived from the experience and traditions of a particular group of people usher 2000 it is a cumulative body of knowledge practice and belief evolving by adaptative processes and handed down though generations by cultural transmission about the relationship of living beings including humans with one another and with their environment berkes 2017 tek has been used to inform animals habitat studies for instance for seals gryba et al 2021 and in habitat modeling through cartographic description for caribou and moose polfus et al 2014 tendeng et al 2016 although increasingly used in habitat models tek remains rarely quantitatively integrated in scientific studies nor used as the main source of information roux et al 2019 stern and humphries 2022 inuit hunters are harvesting arctic char since time immemorial and are traditional knowledge holders scientists studying fish population have worked advantageously with inuit hunters for data collection bell and harwood 2012 and inuit knowledge is more and more considered in fisheries management moller et al 2004 snook et al 2019 since inuit knowledge is accumulated from the past but also an evolving and current knowledge usher 2000 it allows to identify environmental change and trends including changes in abundance when quantitative data were limited knopp et al 2012 janjua et al 2016 falardeau et al 2022 however inuit knowledge has not been yet incorporated in the understanding of physical arctic char habitat though the fish use the same specific spawning sites year after year kristofferson 2003 moore et al 2017 and are regularly observed by inuit harvesters experts systems have the faculty to model and represent human logic reasoning using linguistic variables i e by reasoning on imprecise data among them bayesian modeling e g tantipisanuh et al 2014 or fuzzy logic zadeh 1965 can be applied to predict habitat suitability however in bayesian models experts knowledge is most often used to supplement quantitative field data which are costly and challenging to acquire in arctic remote environment indeed the posterior distribution obtained in bayesian models if often based on field data see e g ellison 2004 fuzzy logic is a method that allow for the incorporation of the complex indigenous knowledge in ecological modeling through qualitatively described observations berkes and berkes 2009 without the need of quantitative input data the fuzzy logic method consists of using reasoning through logic rules to get a numerical value representing a degree of truth between 0 and 1 the method is suitable for modeling the behavior of living species from fishers knowledge since it allows one to consider the continuum that exists between descriptive variables and the uncertainty in associated ranges of variable values to categories mackinson and nøttestad 1998 this method was successfully applied to assess habitat suitability of several fish species based on scientific experts opinion mouton et al 2007 ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 mocq et al 2013 wegscheider et al 2021 nevertheless the results of the model can be biased by the geographical origin of the experts who established the variables categories and logic rules as their observations were made in different environments mocq et al 2015 thus using this finding positively local or traditional knowledge rooted in specific regions can be expected to yield relevant information for regional fish habitat studies fuzzy logic modeling can thus be useful when applied in concert with inuit knowledge given the limited detailed scientific data pertaining to the physical characteristics of anadromous arctic char spawning sites in nunavik region the overall goal of the study is to model and assess spawning habitat suitability based only on inuit knowledge inuit knowledge inuit qaujimajatuqangit is a way of being and embraces all aspect of the inuit traditional culture nunavut department of education 2007 in the present study the term inuit knowledge is nonetheless restricted to the factual knowledge of the environment category 1 usher 2000 our specific objectives were to assess if 1 inuit knowledge can describe accurately spawning habitat with the classical fish habitat model variables water depth velocity and substrate and if 2 fuzzy logic was well suited to use knowledge of inuit hunters for quantitative analysis of arctic char spawning sites building habitat suitability model for spawning sites will bring insight for river habitats and fisheries management by local communities 3 methods 3 1 study area the study was conducted in the three communities of kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk located in the ungava bay nunavik quebec canada fig 1 regional climate is classified as polar with mean annual temperature of 5 7 c and mean annual precipitation of 526 mm with average snowfall of 257 cm year from kuujjuaq a meteorological station kangiqsualujjuaq is located on the east side of the bay on the shore of the george river and the land is covered with shrub tundra with local forested tundra in valleys lowlands tasiujaq is located south of the west coast of ungava bay on the shore of the berard river in shrub tundra zone kangirsuk lies on the west coast of ungava bay along the ariaq river payne arnaud river and is at the edge of shrub tundra zone and herb tundra zone the villages of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq lie both on widespread discontinued permafrost at the edge of continuous permafrost whereas kangirsuk is on continuous permafrost zone l hérault and allard 2018 in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq bed substrate consists mainly of shallow marine deposits mrnf québec 2004 with gravel size substrate inter mixed among larger size boulders and is more heterogenous than in kangirsuk area around these two communities arctic char have access to a large variety of streams and lakes in kangirsuk arctic char spawning sites were mainly identified in large and fast flowing rivers such as the kuugat buet and avaluk vachon which have slopes of 4 2 and 3 6 respectively on their lowest 30 km used locally by arctic char for spawning the rivers around kangirsuk are flowing over fluviatile deposits mrnf québec 2004 3 2 interviews of inuit experts interviews were conducted during summer 2019 with elders and younger active hunters from the kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk villages inuit hunters who conduct both hunting and fishing activities play an important role in inuit communities as they provide country food and contribute to the maintenance of social relationships kishigami 2000 the participants were selected by the local hunters and trappers associations local nunavimmi umajulirijiit katujaqatigininga lnuk for their knowledge of arctic char and are herein referred to as experts of the arctic char a total of 11 experts were interviewed among them two were women and nine were men nine of the participants were elders and two were middle aged experienced hunters elders were considered very knowledgeable in their communities and held in great respect interviews were conducted on an individual basis in kangiqsualujjuaq n 5 and tasiujaq n 3 although participants from kangirsuk requested to be interviewed as a group n 3 the interviews were conducted in semi directed form mainly under informal conversation framed with fixed topics and questions see interview guide in dubos et al 2023 supp material all interviews were conducted by the first author with the assistance of inuktitut english interpreters except for the two youngest participants who were interviewed directly in english it was noticed that all participants were comfortable specifying when they were unsure or did not have knowledge of certain aspects or sites more detail on the interviews context and process and on the qualitative analysis is given in dubos et al inpress specific questions were asked about anadromous arctic char river habitat preferences for spawning with multiple choice answers based on photos and videos for the present study the habitat patch scale 0 10 m2 preferences were based on the information collected on water depth velocity and substrate type selected by arctic char these three variables correspond to classical fish habitat variables used as inputs in models bovee 1986 five photos showing different substrate with increasing range of mean diameter and including different levels of heterogeneity fig 2 were presented to the participants who gave an opinion on the suitability of the substrate for spawning to assess the suitable velocities three videos of flowing rivers were presented showing current velocities of 0 10 m s 0 27 m s and 0 73 m s as they appeared to be representative of velocities of categories of low medium and high mocq et al 2013a mouton et al 2008 that could be expressed in natural language questions about depth used by the fish to spawn were simply answered by participants giving numerical values in feet although a measuring tape was available some spawning sites were also located on maps independently of the site descriptions most of the spawning sites identified on maps were well known by the participants of the same community and by other collaborators including our fieldwork guides a validation of the interview transcription was done by lead author with each participant except for three of them who were not available to ensure experts opinion and interpretation were adequately reported and coded this validation process was conducted with interpreters translating the english synthesis of information to inuktitut to minimize misunderstandings misinterpretations that could have arisen from translation a synthesis of the information collected during the interviews was produced and provided to the participants to the lnuk and the municipal office of each community and to the nunavik research center informed written consent was given by each participant the location of spawning sites illustrated on maps during the interviews had to remain confidential an ethics certificate for research involving humans was obtained from the ethics committee of institut national de la recherche scientifique for the conduct of the interviews cer 19 517 3 3 fuzzy logic model habitat suitability of spawning sites were modelled using fuzzy logic the general principle of fuzzy logic is a mathematical method that handles unprecise fuzzy variables as input data and applies simple relations between these data called logic rules zadeh 1965 the resulting combinations of these rules is a solution that represents a degree of truth 0 completely false 1 completely true in our case the input variables were the local characteristics of the physical variables river depth velocity and substrate described during the interviews and the output was a habitat suitability index hsi the fuzzy logic method was implemented with the matlab fuzzy toolbox mathworks 2018 a general description of the procedure and the definition of membership function is given in mocq et al 2013 and beaupré et al 2019 in our study the following specific steps were applied 1 transform input variables i e physical habitat variables depth velocity and substrate and model output i e spawning habitat suitability index into fuzzy sets fuzzification a fuzzy set is described by a range of values of a variable assigned to a category to which is associated a membership function 0 no membership 1 100 membership in the specified category fig 3 to incorporate the uncertainty about the boundaries of each category the so called fuzziness each value of the specified variable can belong to one or more categories simultaneously the limits of the categories were established according to interviews results see section 4 2 1 for a given combination of input variables the model output was a value of habitat suitability index hsi not to be confused with the membership function the hsi also varies from 0 habitat is inadequate to 1 habitat is fully adequate the hsi fuzzy set was also chosen to have three categories with low hsi 0 5 meaning a poorly suitable habitat medium 0 3 hsi 0 7 for moderate suitability and high hsi 0 5 for good habitat suitability it was not possible to determine a consensus in the literature on the standard limits for hsi categories a triangular membership function was chosen for the medium category of the hsi fuzzy sets to better differentiate between suitable or unsuitable sites similarly to ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 and zhang et al 2016 the same fuzzy sets were used for each set of rules 2 establish logic rules for combinations of the variables and the implication on the suitability of the spawning sites for instance if the substrate is in the coarse high category and the velocity is in the medium category and the water depth belongs to the medium category then hsi is in the high category i e this site has good spawning habitat suitability rules were established from the interviews results according to selected scenarios to verify and consider inter community differences and similarities see section 4 1 4 3 run the model apply the rules the model was applied to field data for validation the key habitat variables depth velocity and substrate of each validation site were measured a membership value and a category were associated to each of the variable a variable can belong to more than one category simultaneously e g a velocity value of 0 25 m s can belong in the low category with a membership of 0 5 and to the medium category with the same membership value thereby representing the uncertainty or fuzziness for this reason several rules can be applied at the same time their association is called aggregation in the present study the maximum method was applied for aggregation i e the combined resulting membership function value for hsi fig 4 4 defuzzify the aggregate fuzzy hsi to get a crisp numerical value of hsi between 0 and 1 0 unsuitability of habitat and 1 maximum habitat suitability three defuzzification methods were tested fig 5 i the centroid for which the crisp value corresponds to the abscissa of the center of gravity of the aggregated hsi ii the mom which is the abscissa of the middle of the maximum aggregation and iii the lom which is the abscissa largest value of the maximum aggregation ouellet et al 2021 3 4 intra community similarities inter community differences and establishment of model scenarios for a given community the spawning site characteristics were described similarly although some individual variations between responses were encountered fig 6 and table s1 supp data the small number of answers for variables categories did not allow us to apply distribution tests to compare potential inter community differences as statistical power was too low 1 β 0 1 however during the interviews a discrepancy was noted between spawning site descriptions by the kangirsuk experts and those from the other two communities kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq which seemed qualitatively in agreement in kangirsuk spawning sites were known to be specifically located in little bays along large rivers the differences of suitable ranges of habitat variables were mostly noticeable regarding velocities and substrate hence five spawning habitat models were built using different scenarios for input information model 1a 1b and 1c rules from each community alone respectively kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk model 2 combined rules from the two communities of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq model 3 combined rules from all the three communities of kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk 3 5 partial validation of the habitat suitability index hsi 3 5 1 validation sites the models built from inuit knowledge were applied on 15 river sites table 1 located in the three communities validation sites were distributed in three different river systems in kangiqsualujjuaq and two different systems in tasiujaq sites in kangirsuk were all in the payne river while in the same river all sites were in different river sections separated by a few hundred meters for the closest ones the spawning sites were selected among the accessible sites located on maps during the interviews field guides also knew the exact location of those sites non spawning sites were selected randomly during the fieldwork in areas known to not support spawning but connected to spawning areas and not showing obvious limitation for the fish the sites were characterized in the field in september 2019 at or near the beginning of the spawning season arctic char in spawning color were observed in some identified spawning sites during the characterization but their presence during the fieldwork could not be a criterion for the identification of sites as the spawning was not already started no fish were seen at non spawning sites the measurements done at validation sites were representative of the habitat patch scale 0 10 m2 water depth was measured with a weighed measuring tape and the smallest class of substrate with at least 15 of areal coverage was estimated visually directly or using underwater camera mean surface velocity was estimated by measuring the time taken by a floating object to run through a distance from 1 m to 3 m we chose to work with the surface velocity as observed by inuit from the shore or by boat the resulting hsi of these sites were used for partial validation of the model s performance in the present study the models were built to assess spawning site suitability in rivers or lake inlet or outlet but not in deeper areas or lakes 3 5 2 results analysis each of these five models see 3 4 were built using different defuzzification methods the mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 was used to compared the performance of the different models according to the three defuzzification methods tested centroid mom lom the null hypothesis was that model mean hsi calculated on sites with presence of spawning and on sites with absence of spawning had the same distribution a rejection of the null hypothesis indicated that one of the mean hsi was significantly higher than the other the results agreement to the field data was assessed using cohen s kappa coefficient κ cohen 1960 the kappa value is a measure of a true agreement of two data sets

spawning prediction on spawning site and true negative unsuitable prediction on non spawning sites were calculated 4 results 4 1 inuit knowledge about spawning sites characteristics an interview synthesis of the information about the suitability of the physical variables for anadromous arctic char spawning sites is provided in table s1 supp data 4 1 1 depth suitability there was a consensus on water depth suitability or unsuitability for spawning sites all participants 100 mentioned that depths between 0 6 m and 1 5 m were suitable for spawning fig 6 water depth less than 0 6 m were deemed inappropriate by 78 of participants for different reasons such as the greater vulnerability to predators and the risks of freezing in the winter or dewatering during low flows three participants indicated that depths higher than 1 5 m were also suitable 27 one participant from kangiqsualujjuaq and the participants of kangirsuk 36 declared depths higher than 1 5 m as unsuitable and the other participants did not express an opinion about the upper limit of depth preferences 4 1 2 velocity suitability 73 of the experts indicated that spawning takes place only in rivers including in areas located near outlet or inlet of lakes where there is flowing water and 27 think that some anadromous arctic char can spawn in deeper area of lakes too the presence of flowing water was considered an important variable for the choice of spawning site and a suitable velocity could be either slow or medium 0 10 m s and 0 27 m s videos in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq even fast velocity from the 0 73 m s video was considered more suitable than unsuitable hence the range of the suitable velocities was rather large according to the experts of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq the less suitable condition for anadromous arctic char was null or near zero velocity in kangirsuk where the rivers used by arctic char to spawn are large and fast flowing the suitable velocities were described as slow and always associated with habitat located in side bays protected from the current of the river main channel 4 1 3 substrate suitability substrate photos presented were initially planned to represent a range of substrate diameter including different levels of heterogeneity fig 2 nonetheless the answers to these images indicated that any bed substrate could be good for spawning as long as there was the presence of gravel patches in kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk or coarse sand in kangirsuk table s1 supp data sand or finer sediment were declared unsuitable for spawning sites in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq hence the model was built using the representative diameter of the smallest class of substrate 4 2 establishing fuzzy sets and logic rules 4 2 1 input variables fuzzy sets fuzzy sets were defined by three categories low medium high associated to a range of values of each habitat variable by a membership function fig 3 the three categories of depth d were defined by the participants through their description of habitat used by spawning char low d 0 6 m medium 0 6 m d 1 5 m and high d 1 5 m for velocity the participants found the videos presented well suited to correspond to the different categories of velocities low 0 1 m s medium 0 27 m s high 0 73 m s the substrate categories were established from the experts comments according to the smallest class of bed substrate instead of the mean grain size of overall substrate corresponding to the photos indeed participants were discriminating photos showing riverbeds with presence of gravel or coarse sand for the suitable substrate diameter independently of the presence of other larger substrate the range of substrate diameter was implicitly associated to the following classes sand 0 062 to 2 mm gravel 2 to 64 mm cobble 64 to 256 mm boulder 256 mm valentine 2019 the boundaries and overlap of the membership functions were established to be simultaneously linked to the perception of the variable category and to the physical characteristic of the variable a smaller overlap of membership functions was used when the experts could easily discriminate the categories like for example low and medium substrate linked respectively to sand and gravel a larger overlap was used when the membership to a category was less consensual like for example cobble substrate which could be classified as either medium or large 4 2 2 logic rules five sets of specific logic rules and thus five fuzzy models were established from the three scenarios of input information see 3 4 the sets of rules described the implication of different combinations of variables on the suitability of a spawning site from the interviews results table 2 both the specific answers to the variables suitability fig 6 and the conversational descriptions given during the interviews were used 4 3 fuzzy models result habitat suitability index hsi 4 3 1 comparison of defuzzification method the five fuzzy models sets of rules were applied to the 15 characterized validation sites classified as spawning or non spawning sites table 1 for each model the resulting hsi were compared to the actual presence or absence of spawning a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the three different defuzzification methods the centroid defuzzification was the most discriminating method for sites suitability as the mean hsi were significantly higher for spawning sites than for non spawning sites for each of the five models mann whitney u test table 3 with the centroid method the mean hsi calculated on identified spawning sites was above 0 5 and the mean hsi on non spawning sites was below 0 5 except for model 1c built with data from kangirsuk only table 3 for this model 1c the value of mean hsi for spawning sites hsi 0 45 remained below 0 50 making it difficult to assess suitability of some sites however as for other models the difference of mean hsi between spawning and non spawning was significant 0 45 vs 0 28 the largest difference was achieved for model 3 information from the three communities together with a mean hsi of 0 62 for spawning sites and of 0 26 for non spawning sites when using mom and lom defuzzification methods the difference between hsi calculated for spawning sites and hsi calculated for non spawning sites decreased with the mom methods only the results for model 1a information from kangiqsualujjuaq only and model 3 information from the three communities together showed a significant difference in hsi values between spawning and non spawning sites table s2 table s3 and table s4 in supp data with the lom methods more models showed significant difference in hsi however the resultant hsi were not only higher at spawning sites but also higher at non spawning sites often close or even above 0 5 which made it more difficult to discriminate suitable from unsuitable sites fig 7 4 3 2 comparison of model scenarios compared to the results for scenario 1 or scenario 2 scenario 3 improved the ability to detect unsuitable spawning sites and to discriminate spawning and non spawning sites with respectively a sensitivity of 83 and a specificity of 100 the model agreement to the field data given by the kappa value was also the highest for model 3 κ 0 80 this model successfully assessed the suitability of 14 of the 15 sites from the information given by all inuit experts the lowest kappa value κ 0 30 was obtained for model 1b and model 2 as these models gave hsi values inferior of 0 5 for two spawning sites and three hsi values of 0 5 for non spawning sites fig 8 the three models of scenario 1 built with information from only one community did not perform significantly better on validation sites from the same community table s5 in supp data models 1a and 1b perform similarly on all identified spawning sites but showed discrepancies on sites of absence model 1b information from tasiujaq only gave higher hsi on non spawning sites of kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq increasing the possibility of false positive even on tasiujaq sites model 1c gave the lowest mean hsi for both spawning and non spawning sites including on kangirsuk validation sites 5 discussion 5 1 inuit knowledge supports scientific literature on spawning sites examples of anadromous arctic char spawning habitat characterization are relatively scarce in the literature but some studies covering various geographic regions have described spawning sites characteristics that could be compared with the present study the most suitable depth range given by the inuit experts 0 6 m to 1 5 m was slightly narrower but comparable to the ranges described in the literature where records indicate suitable depths between 0 2 m and 2 m johnson 1980 dempson and green 1985 cunjak et al 1986 beddow et al 1998 the measured water velocities described in these studies were also variable between 0 2 m s and 0 8 m s but non zero similar to what was described by inuit participants in the present study streams used by anadromous arctic char to spawn in nunavik and northern labrador still flow during winter and the minimum depth to prevent freezing is about 0 6 m as mentioned by inuit experts this stream use is contrasting to canadian high arctic where the rivers freeze to the bottom preventing anadromous arctic char to spawn in river unless some ground water feed the bottom harwood and babaluk 2014 although some spawning sites described in the literature showed a predominance of gravel and pebble char are known to use also heterogeneous substrates for spawning consisting of a mix of coarse sand gravel pebble and boulders johnson 1980 cunjak et al 1986 beddow et al 1998 larger diameter substrate does not appear to hinder spawning however fine substrate i e fine sand and silt is typically not used for spawning as described by inuit experts char in the fraser river labrador exhibited two nesting strategies associated with the different type of substrate either char dug redds when the substrate was dominated by coarse sand and gravel or they dispersed eggs through the interstices of coarser substrate dempson and green 1985 these two strategies were also described during the interviews as participants from kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq mentioned that char usually do not build redds and the current rather disperses the eggs in the substrate whereas in kangirsuk participants explained that char builds redds in the sand dubos et al 2023 a potentially important finding from the analysis of our interviews is that substrate suitability for arctic char spawning site is linked to the diameter of the smallest class of substrate instead of the mean diameter of substrate the total proportion of this smallest class did not seem to be a factor determining the spawning site selectivity as long as there was a usable patch of suitable substrate the minimal area of the patch is currently unknown the importance of taking specifically into account small size substrate classes or substrate heterogeneity for fish spawning habitat studies has been known for a long time bain et al 1985 nonetheless in previous studies a single value of mean median or dominant substrate diameter was often included to model habitat suitability for example in beaupré et al 2019 garbe et al 2016 ayllón et al 2012 probably because values describing the center of substrate distribution are commonly used in hydraulic and physical habitat models granulometric indices have been widely used to integrate a level of substrate heterogeneity mocq et al 2013 dfo 2015 but when these indices are used the dominant substrate classes are emphasized and the grain size of the smallest substrate class is not specifically represented although it could be of interest for spawning suitability like in our study this finding should be considered when describing substrate class for arctic char and tested for other salmonids habitat suitability studies the fine substrate could be considered from a threshold proportion either by its diameter like we did here or by its proportion further work should be conducted to assess the minimum size of required substrate patch which must be related to the stream size or order experts interviewed expressed that a large variety of velocity and substrate can be suitable for arctic char which is in agreement with the known flexibility in niche selection of the species hammar 2014 thus in the present study the characteristics they deemed unsuitable were also useful to establish rules and discriminate spawning and non spawning sites 5 2 implication of the land based knowledge of inuit experts for sites characterization 5 2 1 intra community inuit experts generally agreed on the characteristics of suitable spawning sites within each community during the interviews most participants from the same community located on maps the same spawning sites since arctic char show high spawning site fidelity the knowledge of inuit experts was gained from their own local use of territory but also from other hunters relatives and ancestors this shared knowledge leads to rich and tested information as their survival depends on it mackinson and nøttestad 1998 berkes 2017 as fuzzy logic is sensitive to the fuzzy rules ahmadi nedushan et al 2008 recommended to combine several experts opinion and ask them for a revision of their opinion in regards to what other participants thought we presented interviews synthesis to the experts following the delphi method leite and gasalla 2013 the validation of the interviews transcription did not result in changes in opinion from the experts about the spawning sites characteristics and the concordant intra community opinion among inuit experts limited the variability of results and was implicitly conducive to knowledge combination 5 2 2 inter community the different hydrographic and geomorphological features related to the geographic location of the communities could result in different inter community perceptions of suitable variable categories for spawning habitats for example a velocity of 0 4 m s in a small spawning stream of tasiujaq could be described as medium whereas the same value could be qualified as low in a side pool of a large rapid river in kangirsuk where arctic char spawning sites were mainly identified that might explain why medium velocities were considered suitable in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq but not in kangirsuk the difference of perception related to the type and size of rivers used by the fish was also one of the modeling challenges identified by mocq et al 2015 as the geographic origin of experts from europe and from north america was a factor that partially explained discrepancies in estimation of suitable habitat this is what was observed for the substrate suitability indeed sand or finer sediment were deemed unsuitable for spawning sites in kangiqsualujjuaq and tasiujaq where the riverbed substrate is more heterogenous with gravel size substrate inter mixed among larger size boulders due to the geology mrnf québec 2004 in contrast the reaches of rivers in the kangirsuk region are flowing over fluviatile deposits this explains the presence of sand in the slower reaches of the rivers which are areas used by arctic char to spawn according to the interviews the substrate suitability discrepancies noticed between kangirsuk and the two other communities was consistent with the different geologic characteristics this highlights the importance of investigating the similarities discrepancies of habitat characteristics among region communities the geologic characteristics and the type of surface deposits may be considered as additional model variables to discriminate the regions and established scenarios for the fuzzy rules in addition the global size of streams used for spawning in each community should be also considered indeed the validation site 12 was the only spawning site characterized in kangirsuk whereas the model 1c from kangirsuk experts information performed the worst giving a false negative this site was located on the payne river whereas the discussion during the interviews was based mainly on the kuugat buet and avaluk vachon two tributaries that were of high importance in the past and still are their access in fall for fieldwork was not compatible with our logistic constraints the difference of scale of the rivers might be in cause indeed the depth of the validation site was 1 8 m which falls in the high depth category while categories were established for all communities high depth was nonetheless deemed 100 unsuitable habitat by kangirsuk experts a specific fuzzy set for kangirsuk would have been more adapted as the order of streams used by arctic char was higher hence in future work fuzzy sets should be fitted to each region showing hydrogeomorphologic discrepancies 5 3 potential of fuzzy logic to evaluate spawning habitat suitability from inuit knowledge fuzzy logic was a successful approach for the use of inuit experts knowledge and the models predicted spawning habitat suitability globally adequately for all models using centroid defuzzification method all models exhibited significantly higher hsi for spawning sites than non spawning sites one of the validation spawning sites the site 7 was evaluated as a poor spawning site by all five models this site was located in a small rapid although it was indeed an identified spawning site spawning was observed or at least highly suspected during the fieldwork the hydraulic characteristics of this specific site were not in the range of highly suitable habitat with a depth of 0 6 m and velocity of 0 9 m s the fish might have selected other characteristics since the site is on the downstream side of a large lake hydraulic control it is likely that the presence of a hyporheic flow keep a suitable temperature for the eggs in winter even with a low water depth despite this false negative the agreement of model 3 combined information from the three communities to the field data is substantial with a kappa value of 0 80 showing the ability of the model to assess suitable spawning sites but also unsuitable sites these results highlight the relative agreement in spawning habitat assessment among inuit experts from different communities of the ungava bay region compared to other studies using fuzzy logic with experts for example in beaupré et al 2019 scientific experts had to assess habitat suitability of salmon salmo salar parr from a combination of velocity depth substrate and temperature categories which lead to variable results and a stronger consensus about rivers originating from the experts region in mocq et al 2015 the variability among scientific experts was found to be due to geographic origin possibly also as fish can have specific and local preferences like it was established for brown trout salmo trutta mouton et al 2009 the fact that inuit experts used large territory likely gave them the opportunity to acquire knowledge covering a large range of sites specificities and thus allowed the fuzzy model to be representative of ungava bay arctic char the fuzzy rules were established following the analysis of the interviews content beyond the specific questions on habitat variables depth velocity substrate as the descriptions of spawning sites suitability or unsuitability were also included during the overall discussion which covered a larger scope hence a certain degree of subjectivity is present and some differences in the interpretation of variables combination might depend on the person who is assessing the logic rules however given there was very few disagreements between experts from a same community on the suitable spawning sites characteristics a consensus was generally quite naturally obtained on experts opinion the low number of validation sites did not allow to optimize the model through the definition of variable categories and their range mouton et al 2008 the validation was conducted on all the available validation sites notwithstanding their location in doing so some knowledge that was specific to each community was not considered when applying the model to the variables of a site the validation sites were also situated on rivers of various size which could have an impact on the relative characterization of variables for example in kangirsuk the three validation sites were located in the payne river a major river whereas in tasiujaq they were located on rivers less than 20 m large this means that a depth of 0 8 m that would be deemed suitable for spawning in rivers near tasiujaq would not be suitable in the payne river an increase of the number of validation sites would also allow to do a sensitivity study of the scenarios of input information applied on the different sites regions in addition testing the model on sites outside of the ungava bay region would allow to assess its robustness in other arctic regions in the present study the regional discrepancies were insufficient to truly affect model performance as model 3 i e using the information from all the three communities provided the best performance in terms of spawning site identification although specific values of the three variables depth velocity and substrate chosen to describe spawning sites could be associated to these sites they lacked the hydrogeomorphologic context of the sites e g little bay side channel and may not have been able to provide information that is site specific for example in kangirsuk participants described the river hydrodynamic characteristics at a broader scale than the local spawning habitat the sites were indeed described as shallow sandy little bays in large and fast flowing rivers it would be relevant to include mesoscale habitat information coupled with the fuzzy logic model the use of remote sensing to extract predictive variables at the mesoscale hamann et al 2014 may be a strong complement and should be considered in further studies a difference in scale of analysis between western scientific and indigenous knowledge can actually lead to more complete and improved habitat models polfus et al 2014 and further such studies would be relevant for arctic char spawning habitats 5 4 other variables to be considered according to the inuit experts water temperature triggers the spawning timing dubos et al 2023 water temperature is also an important factor for the quality of eggs incubation jeuthe et al 2016 jobling et al 1993 nonetheless inuit experts could not describe temperature as an absolute variable since the char are in cold environment and the spawning is happening in fall while water temperature is below a certain threshold local temperature and warm thermal refuges could be of interest for the char indeed regarding the habitat selectivity presence of warm thermal refuges is a proxy for the presence of spring fed water source or hyporheic flow in the winter groundwater or hyporheic flow are important to the spawning sites for several char species including dolly varden stewart et al 2010 bull trout baxter and hauer 2000 and brook trout curry and noakes 2011 upwelling of groundwater has also been associated with arctic char spawning grounds near kangiqsualujjuaq cunjak et al 1986 nonetheless groundwater inflow through the riverbed is generally not visible from the surface and is seldom noticed unless the suspected upwelling site is instrumented hence participants did not have any knowledge of the potential presence of underground springs in the rivers or associated to spawning sites however they mentioned that arctic char were choosing sites where the water column was not freezing completely in the winter which suggests the presence of upwelling ground water or hyporheic flow that increase the water temperature in winter further investigations are needed to test the hypothesis of spawning site selectivity according to the presence of groundwater inflow by anadromous arctic char local temperature monitoring of spawning sites in winter could be a research avenue related to spawning selectivity periphyton abundance can be positively associated to groundwater source hunt et al 2006 during the fieldwork done to characterize the validation sites periphyton was observed on the riverbed of several spawning sites and seemed absent from several non spawning sites although it was solely based on qualitative observations periphyton constitute a source of food for benthic invertebrates including chironomids bégin et al 2020 themselves sources of food for juvenile arctic char moore and moore 1974 sinnatamby et al 2012 in addition at a broader scale the probability of occurrence of juvenile was associated to the streams with the highest density of benthic invertebrates danandeh mehr et al 2022 hence at a local scale in addition to the presence of groundwater itself as a selectivity factor the possibility of periphyton being a favorable biotic environment for early stage of fry should be considered in further research on spawning habitats and on connectivity with fry habitat climate change have already major impacts on hydrology and river erosion and thus on available habitat and on connectivity jeuthe et al 2016 for example one of the identified spawning sites on maps during the interviews is now seldom used by arctic char because too many rocks and a low water level make the fish passage difficult hence given the fast modification to the environment it is important to make sure that spawning sites identified by elders are still up to date which was the case of our validation sites regarding temperature climate change can have an impact on the spawning timing since the spawning act seems triggered by water temperature dubos et al inpress and a post spawning warming episode could be detrimental for the eggs and possibly on the eggs incubation jeuthe et al 2016 however climate change impact is still difficult to predict on the direct selectivity of spawning sites in a modeling perspective in the present study only abiotic physical variables were analysed nonetheless during the interviews biotic factors such as the presence of other fish species the increasing abundance of algae or the presence of predators were mentioned by some inuit experts as potential variables that could have an impact on spawning habitat and the presence or not of arctic char on specific sites fish habitat studies would benefit from this traditional and local knowledge about specific sites 6 conclusion fuzzy logic was a successful approach to build a habitat model based on inuit experts knowledge the model predicted spawning habitat suitability index in agreement with the field data for 14 of the 15 validation sites the best results were achieved using the combined information of experts from the three communities of kangiqsualujjuaq tasiujaq and kangirsuk the present study is to our knowledge the first fish habitat model based solely on inuit knowledge and the first spawning habitat suitability model in river for anadromous arctic char the proposed model is intrinsically adapted to the ungava bay region affected by changes in river hydrology and variation of arctic char stock population and can be a useful additional tool for fisheries and river management for example as local initiatives are occasionally conducted to improve fish passage and restore spawning site access to arctic char modeling spawning habitat can add information for river or site selection being able to have a quantitative habitat suitability index of vulnerable sites could serve as a tool for habitat protection by the communities in a context of ongoing pressure for mining development on the territory inuit experts interviewed had good knowledge of the physical characteristics of anadromous arctic char spawning habitats and were able to describe the three classical variables of fish habitat models depth velocity and substrate associated to spawning sites for a given community inuit experts generally agreed on the suitable and unsuitable characteristics of spawning sites however discrepancies of spawning sites description were noted between communities and could be linked to the different local geology and geomorphology the more suitable depths for spawning sites ranged between 0 6 m and 1 5 m and a large range of velocity was deemed suitable as long as there was flowing water arctic char remains flexible in the selection of spawning habitats regarding the substrate the analysis of the interviews highlighted the fact that substrate suitability for arctic char spawning site was depended on the smaller class of substrate instead of the overall mean median or dominant substrate diameter that is often used in fish habitat models this finding should be considered when describing substrate class for further arctic char habitat suitability it would be relevant for future work to add validation sites inside and outside the ungava bay region to assess the model robustness further research should also consider additional predictive variables of spawning site suitability such as biotic factors as mentioned by some inuit experts the potential of groundwater inflow that could not be described by the visual observation of the experts but could be established through local temperature and considering mesoscale habitat through the use of remote sensing these different perspectives highlight the advantages of braiding indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge and methods to increase global understanding of habitat selection the methodology presented in this study allows to formalize the description of local observations in a quantitative model and can be applied for other animal or plant species for which local and or traditional knowledge exists the prerequisite is that the predictive variables of the model can be categorized hence the semi directed interview method including specific questions is compatible with and complementary to the scientific quantitative method applied declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

mann kendall trend analysis and theil sen slope estimator were applied on the modeled et over china from 1982 to 2015 as shown in fig 2a et at the 5 significance levels was increasing in most regions zs 0 et at the 5 significance levels was decreasing in the ten percent of region zs 0 such as the extreme north region of china and southeast region of qinghai tibet plateau the magnitudes of the significant increasing and decreasing in annual et ranged between 21 09 mm year and 10 64 mm year the mean theil sen slope over china is 1 40 mm year for different climate types in china subtropical monsoon climate region showed the most significant increasing trend with highest values of theil sen slope βvalue 3 04 mm year and then the theil sen slopes mm year of temperate monsoon climate region plateau and mountain climate region and temperate continental climate region are 1 22 0 90 and 0 45 respectively 3 2 investigation of environmental controls on evapotranspiration 3 2 1 selection of dominant controls to select the dominant environmental controls on et we used vip scores to investigate the importance of environmental controls on et over china from 1982 to 2015 normally variables that are more than 1 in vip score are considered relevant johnson and wichern 2002 fig 3 shows that the vip method selected 3 dominant environmental controls on et with vip scores greater than 1 t 1

spatial distribution of three dominant controls sr lai and t influence vip scores on et from 1982 to 2015 in plateau and mountain climate region sr is the most important dominant control factor and in monsoon climate region lai and t has a greater impact on et than other area specifically lai has a greater influence on et in temperate monsoon climate region than other climate regions 3 2 2 validation of dominant controls we estimated the dominant controls of the in situ et data to validate previous results in section 3 2 1 as shown in table 2 sr t and lai is the most frequent factor in the largest three impact controls on et the average vip scores of sr t and lai are 1 18 1 09 1 04 separately in addition rh and ppt are one of the dominant controls on et at 8 chinaflux sites in grassland and forest sites sr and t have a greater impact on et in cropland site lai and sr are the most influential factors on et 3 3 change of dominant controls on evapotranspiration vip score was applied to assess the dominant controls variation on et every 10 years as shown in fig 5 there is an increasing influence of lai on et from 1982 to 2015 especially the effect of lai exceeds t effect on et during 2011 2015 in contrast the vip scores variation of sr and t indicate decreasing influences on et during the 34 years interestingly the vip scores of t and sr show a trend of increasing before 2000 and then decrease however the trend of lai vip score decreases first before 2000 and then increases for all the climate regions there is an increasing influence of lai on et and decreasing influence of t and sr on et specifically lai become the most important environmental factor after 2010 with the highest growth rate of vip score in temperate monsoon climate region and in plateau and mountain climate region t has the greatest effect on et during 2001 to 2010 vip score 1 16 after 2011 the effect of t decreases and the effect of lai increases to the second influential environmental factor in plateau and mountain climate region figs 6 and 7 4 discussion 4 1 increasing trend of evapotranspiration our findings suggest a significant increasing et trend over 1982 2015 being 1 40 mm year for swh model p 0 05 it was pointed out by jung et al 2010 that climate change is expected to intensify the water cycle and to alter et resulting in an impact on ecosystem services and growth of global climate recently several research revealed that global changing climate and human activities contributed to the increase in et fisher et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a found a significant increasing et trend from 1982 to 2011 with pml p 0 01 mte p 0 01 and gleam p 0 1 models et of 0 68 0 32 and 0 38 mm year 2 respectively as an area sensitive to climate change china shows an increase trend in et as well the results of our study are in agreement with feng et al 2018 which revealed that the annual et of china has shown a significant upward trend from 1979 to 2015 p 0 01 particularly in autumn 4 2 dominant controls on evapotranspiration understanding the influence of environmental controls on increasing et is essential to water cycle and hydrological modeling we used vip scores based on plsr method to explore the dominant controls on et over china from 1982 to 2015 this factorial analysis results revealed that sr t and lai are the dominant controls contributing to the dynamics of et sr constitutes a key variable to the circulation of water in the atmosphere li et al 2018 wang et al 2018 temperatures have risen more rapidly in china since the 1950s with the rate of increase of more than 0 25 c decade 1 ren et al 2017 possibly a warmer surface and atmosphere affected by sr cause et to increase in other hand sr have an influence on precipitation due to the changes in atmospheric circulation which is an important factors on et as well dagon and schrag 2016 as we know temperature is one of the primary factors that affect et which is the major component of hydrological cycle there has been an increase of 0 3 0 6 c in global temperature since the late 19th century and a rise of 0 2 0 3 c over the last 40 years milly and dunne 2016 mcnulty et al 1997 discovered a 5 increase in total seasonal et under conditions of warmer air temperatures and a 4 decrease under conditions of cooler air temperatures zhu et al 2015 has shown that air temperature may influences water cycle by altering stomatal resistance at the site scale additionally et s rising trend is primarily driven by temperature driven increases in vapor pressure deficits bell et al 2010 lai is the principal factor controlling variation in et as it reflects the surface of canopy plants fatichi and pappas 2017 lian et al 2018 modis lai data analysis results indicated that one third of the global vegetation area is undergoing a process of greening whereas 5 is undergoing a process of browning chen et al 2019 increased lai promotes canopy transpiration and interception evaporation by increasing the surface area which increases et piao et al 2007 a significant increase in the global et 0 88 mm year p 0 001 has been reported by zhang et al 2015 between 1998 and 2008 primarily due to greening 0 018 per year p 0 001 and rising atmosphere moisture demand 0 75 mm year p 0 016 to validate the dominant controls on et over china we investigated the key impact factors of et at 8 chinaflux sites using vip scores sr t and lai is the most frequent factor in the largest three impact controls on et which is consistent with previous results in section 3 2 1 the average vip scores of sr t and lai are 1 18 1 09 1 04 separately in addition rh and ppt are one of the dominant controls on et at dx hb and nm station possibly et could be stimulated under global warming due to the increase in t and water vapor pressure deficit which is related to rh on the qinghai tibet plateau including dx hb station peng et al 2015 and in temperate continental climate zone p is also an influencing factors on et due to water limitation in this semiarid area mo et al 2018 4 3 change of dominant controls on evapotranspiration even though the influence of sr and t are greater than lai on et fig 3 our study suggested that lai has an increasing contribute to et over 1982 2015 period especially in temperate monsoon climate region in contrast the vip scores variation of sr and t indicate decreasing influences on et during the 34 years we calculated the theil sen slope of leaf area index β value lai yr and it was found that the growth rate β value of lai in china was 0 27 yr for different climatic regions the growth rate was more obvious in the subtropical and temperate monsoon climate region with 0 42 yr and 0 38 yr the growth rate of temperate continental climate region and plateau and mountain climate region was 0 17 yr and 0 18 yr respectively it is consistent with the findings of previous studies as chen et al 2019 reported one third of global vegetation areas are being greened as a result of anthropogenic and natural factors with this situation being particularly evident in china s subtropical monsoon and temperate monsoon regions that account for about 45 of the country s land area furthermore other related studies found that after 2000 an increase or decrease in tree cover or non tree cover was observed in greening areas chen et al 2019 liu et al 2016 meanwhile forest ecosystem evapotranspiration is more sensitive to stomatal resistance estimates related to leaf area index hu et al 2017 compared with the subtropical monsoon region evapotranspiration in the temperate monsoon region is more constrained by water availability zhang et al 2020 this may be one of the reasons for the increasing influence of leaf area index on evapotranspiration over the past 34 years especially for the most obvious contribution to the increase of evapotranspiration in temperate monsoon regions 5 conclusion we investigated the change of dominant controls on et over china from 1982 to 2015 we selected the three dominant controls on et through plsr analysis and vip score assessment and then explore the change of dominant controls our results indicate that significantly increasing et trend over 1982 2015 being 1 40 mm year and sr t and lai are the dominant controls contributing to the increasing changes of et in plateau and mountain climate region sr shows the more important effect on et than lai and t and in monsoon climate region lai and t have a greater impact on et than other area specifically lai has a greater influence on et in temperate monsoon climate region than other climate regions in terms of trend of dominant controls lai has an increasing contribute to et variability over 1982 2015 period especially in temperate monsoon climate region in contrast the vip scores variation of sr and t indicate decreasing influences on et during the 34 years possibly the different contribution trend of dominant controls to et may be due to different sensitivity to canopy resistance in different vegetation types by conducting this research we will be better equipped to understand how dominant controls around china have changed from 1982 to 2015 and the influence to et under the changing climate and impact credit authorship contribution statement genan wu conceptualization methodology

24251,evapotranspiration et in terrestrial ecosystems is of great significance for water resource evaluation crop water requirements and drought monitoring and is affected by multiple environmental factors several studies investigated the environmental factors affecting evapotranspiration with long time series but there are few detailed research exploring changes in the dominant controls of et it is essential to understand the primary mechanisms involved and their response to climate change in this study we analyzed the dominant controls on et using variable importance in projection vip scores from a partial least squares regression plsr analysis and then explored the change of dominant controls over time our results indicated a significant et increase trend over 1982 2015 of 1 40 mm year in china with solar radiation sr temperature t and leaf area index lai as the dominant controls contributing to the increasing changes of et increase in lai greening was the primary cause of increasing et over the 1982 2015 period especially in temperate monsoon climate regions in contrast the vip scores of sr and t indicated a negative contribution to increasing et during the 34 years the differences in the contribution dynamics of dominant controls to et may result from different sensitivities to canopy resistance in different vegetation types this research revealed an increasing contribution of greening to terrestrial evapotranspiration in china and improved our understanding of the change of dominant controls over china from 1982 to 2015 and their influence to et under the changing climate and its impact keywords evapotranspiration models dominant controls climate change data availability i have shared the link to my data at the manuscript 1 introduction the effects of climate change will be felt significantly in the hydrological cycle through processes such as precipitation runoff and soil moisture konapala et al 2020 wang et al 2017 evapotranspiration et have profound influences on global water balance agriculture and water management ecosystem sustainability and economic development and is significantly influenced by climate change fisher et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 in previous studies it has been demonstrated that global terrestrial et has increased significantly during past years due to increases in transpiration and canopy transpiration zhang et al 2016b a variation in terrestrial et and its associated latent heat flux is likely to affect the sensible heat flux by affecting land surface temperatures this has a significant impact on regional and global warming as a result badgley et al 2015 it is possible that interactions between climate change and water flux will lead to changes in factors affecting et variability one of the most critical questions is to focus on how global warming greening and other changing environmental factors contribute to et variation at long term scales feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 with the acceleration of global climate change global temperature precipitation solar radiation vegetation and other environmental factors affecting et are changing as well andrews et al 2010 chen et al 2019 körner and basler 2010 piao et al 2019 for instance global warming will lead to major changes in climate factors affecting et such as absolute humidity rainfall net surface radiation and global solar irradiation abtew and melesse 2013 wang and dickinson 2012 wang et al 2022 found that the recent increase in temperature plays more of a role than the change in precipitation in the global et increase in addition vegetation affects the water balance by accessing transporting and transpiring soil water in ecosystems yinglan et al 2019 in the last 20 years one third of the world s vegetation has greened and 5 has browned according to the modis satellite lai data chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 concluded that vegetation greening contributed to multidecadal increases in global land et previous studies focused on exploring and quantifying the dominant factors of et but there are few detailed research exploring changes in the dominant controls of et with the changing climate the dominant factors of et may have changed and there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the change of dominant controls on et at regional and global scales our study aims to investigate change of dominant controls on et at regional and global scales taking china as an example research area we 1 selected the three dominant controls on et modeled by an improved shuttleworth wallace model hu et al 2013 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 from 1982 to 2015 through variable importance in projection vip scores of partial least squares regression plsr analysis 2 validated the three dominant controls by investigation of

chinaflux sites using vip scores sr t and lai is the most frequent factor in the largest three impact controls on et which is consistent with previous results in section 3 2 1 the average vip scores of sr t and lai are 1 18 1 09 1 04 separately in addition rh and ppt are one of the dominant controls on et at dx hb and nm station possibly et could be stimulated under global warming due to the increase in t and water vapor pressure deficit which is related to rh on the qinghai tibet plateau including dx hb station peng et al 2015 and in temperate continental climate zone p is also an influencing factors on et due to water limitation in this semiarid area mo et al 2018 4 3 change of dominant controls on evapotranspiration even though the influence of sr and t are greater than lai on et fig 3 our study suggested that lai has an increasing contribute to et over 1982 2015 period especially in temperate monsoon climate region in contrast the vip scores variation of sr and t indicate decreasing influences on et during the 34 years we calculated the theil sen slope of leaf area index β value lai yr and it was found that the growth rate β value of lai in china was 0 27 yr for different climatic regions the growth rate was more obvious in the subtropical and temperate monsoon climate region with 0 42 yr and 0 38 yr the growth rate of temperate continental climate region and plateau and mountain climate region was 0 17 yr and 0 18 yr respectively it is consistent with the findings of previous studies as chen et al 2019 reported one third of global vegetation areas are being greened as a result of anthropogenic and natural factors with this situation being particularly evident in china s subtropical monsoon and temperate monsoon regions that account for about 45 of the country s land area furthermore other related studies found that after 2000 an increase or decrease in tree cover or non tree cover was observed in greening areas chen et al 2019 liu et al 2016 meanwhile forest ecosystem evapotranspiration is more sensitive to stomatal resistance estimates related to leaf area index hu et al 2017 compared with the subtropical monsoon region evapotranspiration in the temperate monsoon region is more constrained by water availability zhang et al 2020 this may be one of the reasons for the increasing influence of leaf area index on evapotranspiration over the past 34 years especially for the most obvious contribution to the increase of evapotranspiration in temperate monsoon regions 5 conclusion we investigated the change of dominant controls on et over china from 1982 to 2015 we selected the three dominant controls on et through plsr analysis and vip score assessment and then explore the change of dominant controls our results indicate that significantly increasing et trend over 1982 2015 being 1 40 mm year and sr t and lai are the dominant controls contributing to the increasing changes of et in plateau and mountain climate region sr shows the more important effect on et than lai and t and in monsoon climate region lai and t have a greater impact on et than other area specifically lai has a greater influence on et in temperate monsoon climate region than other climate regions in terms of trend of dominant controls lai has an increasing contribute to et variability over 1982 2015 period especially in temperate monsoon climate region in contrast the vip scores variation of sr and t indicate decreasing influences on et during the 34 years possibly the different contribution trend of dominant controls to et may be due to different sensitivity to canopy resistance in different vegetation types by conducting this research we will be better equipped to understand how dominant controls around china have changed from 1982 to 2015 and the influence to et under the changing climate and impact credit authorship contribution statement genan wu conceptualization methodology

24252,background the lack of previous exposure to arbovirus and the ongoing geographical expansion of viable vector populations has fostered the implementation of preventive strategies in those areas more prone to disease importation catalonia receives a wealth of travelers from southeast asia south america and the caribbean and around 700 cases of imported arbovirosis 2012 2016 totaling dengue chikungunya and zika have been notified in primary care health centers traveler advice public health services and main hospitals with the large asymptomatic proportion of infections well known for these diseases the threat for autochthonous outbreaks increases in those areas that for particular environmental and socio demographic conditions might be more susceptible operational early warning systems are lacking in most places where these outbreaks pose a serious health treat methods here we present the arbocat platform for the prediction of autochthonous outbreaks of arboviruses emanating from imported cases implemented for catalonia at municipality resolution three sub models provide estimations for importation rates and the basic reproduction number and their outcomes are used to fit a stochastic compartmental model that yields the generation time and the risk of local outbreaks for 948 municipalities we used also isimip 2b the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project temperature data to generate future outbreak risk maps for the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios where rcp is representative concentration trajectories findings substantial differences exist between the low and middle risk scenarios but most catalonia municipalities are not at risk for a sustained epidemic instead high r 0 are obtained for the maximum risk scenario with the number of municipalities affected being over 150 in the rcp 8 5 scenario many of the highest risk areas lie in the most populated cities in the coastal region particularly in the south near to the ebre s river interpretation the current outbreak risk is low both for the mean and minimum temperature scenarios and rises in the high risk situation projections for 2050 are not so optimistic leading to a significant increase in affected municipalities over 100 mainly in the coastal area due to the temperature increase followed in rcp 8 5 funding this study was partially supported by the catalonia department of health and the spanish ministry of science and innovation keywords arbovirus surveillance arboviral infections climate change modeling risk map mosquito data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction arboviruses are mainly transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes flies ticks or fleas their common infectious pathway does allow us to broadly characterize their geographic extension which is constrained by the presence of suitable vectors paksa et al 2019 most arthropods require warm and humid conditions to survive and therefore arbovirosis exists mainly present in the tropics where adequate weather conditions ensure year round or at least seasonal vector presence bartholomay 2012 arboviruses are maintained in natural transmission cycles in which they replicate in hematophagous arthropods and are transmitted to vertebrate hosts during a blood meal arboviruses are initially maintained in an enzootic sylvatic cycle involving rodents birds or nonhuman primates as reservoir hosts boulanger 2018 spillover from the enzootic cycle sometimes occurs through incidental biting of humans by enzootic and or bridge vectors some arboviruses may achieve further amplification in domestic animals within a rural epizootic cycle others may alter their host range from nonhuman primates to humans leading to an urban epidemic transmission cycle vertical transmission from an infected vector to its progeny is a common feature of arboviral infections for tick borne viruses transovarial transstadial and venereal transmissions also occur yu et al 2019 turell 2020 every year unweighted disability adjusted life years dalys attributable to yellow fever yfv japanese encephalitis jev chikungunya chikv and rift valley fever rvfv viruses were estimated to fall between 300 000 and 5 000 000 for the year 2005 of the above yfv was the most prevalent infection of the four viruses evaluated labeaud et al 2011 whereas recently also west nile fever caused a serious local outbreak in southwest spain ecdc 2020 recurrent outbreaks of arboviruses in endemic regions of the world represent a serious threat of potential propagation to naive settings where the population is immunologically naive lack of previous exposure and the ongoing geographical expansion of viable vector populations has fostered the implementation of preventive strategies in those areas more liable to disease importation global warming in addition is broadening the geographical range of most vector suitable habitats which along with ever increasing human circulation and land use and land cover changes might result in the establishment of local arboviral transmission cycles in temperate regions in the european context southern europe is the most affected area for these pathogens travelers who are infected with denv or chikv in endemic areas of the world and who return to european areas colonized by ae albopictus increase the risk of introduction of the respective diseases particularly if they are in the viraemic phase concerns about such a risk arose with chikungunya outbreaks in italy in 2007 rezza et al 2007 in the late summer of 2010 an autochthonous dengue case was reported in nice france the likely index case was described as a man who lived in the proximity of the first case and who had recently returned from martinique where he contracted denv infection la ruche et al 2010 autochthonous cases of dengue have been reported in france la ruche et al 2010 croatia gjenero margan et al 2010 madeira spain on the other hand chikungunya has been reported in italy and france grandadam et al 2011 due to its location in the mediterranean basin as one of spain s autonomous communities catalonia north eastern spain has not been exempt from these diseases and in 2018 and 2019 some local cases of these diseases have been observed both diseases along with zika and yfv are transmitted by mosquitoes of the aedes genus whose two most locally widespread species are aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus the first one aedes aegypti feeds almost exclusively on humans and is therefore the most efficient disease spreader it is the main culprit for the huge burden that such diseases pose in tropical regions the second one aedes albopictus on the other hand feeds less often and on a variety of host species and therefore it is a worse spreader however it geographically extends far beyond the range of its sister species and therefore it is responsible for the ongoing arboviral colonization of temperate regions it was first introduced in europe around 1979 and it is now present in the whole mediterranean basin figure s1 aedes mosquitoes are very well adapted to both tropical and temperate urban settings perrin et al 2020 this fact poses an additional threat to our highly urbanized societies current projections estimate that around two thirds of the world s population will live in urban areas by 2050 68 of the world population projected un 2022 all in all the presence of aedes albopictus mosquitoes in catalonia opens the possibility of an aedes borne disease outbreak which necessarily must start with the arrival of an infected person from an endemic country dengue and chikungunya have already shown the potential threat they pose for southern europe and so does zika as illustrated by the large 2015 south american epidemic the worldwide incidence of dengue has increased dramatically during the last decades before 1970 only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics nowadays however dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries of africa the americas the eastern mediterranean south east asia and the western pacific recent estimates indicate that around 390 million dengue infections occur yearly of which around 96 million manifest clinically and currently more than half of the world s population is at risk of contracting such infectious disease du et al 2021 yang et al 2021 chikungunya was first described in tanzania in 1952 and it rapidly spread a major outbreak occurred in the islands of the indian ocean in 2005 and it is now present in more than 60 countries zika is one of the viruses that has experienced a faster geographical spread zavala colon and gonzalez sanchez 2022 to date a total of 84 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted zika infection puntasecca et al 2021 in this study we implemented a computational platform arbocat based on castro et al 2017 lópez et al 2019 that allows the investigation of different infection importation scenarios grounded on the local socioeconomic and demographic structure of the receiving populations while integrating relevant climate determinants and the local data on vector distribution the platform has a rich and user friendly data visualization framework www arbocat cat isglobal climate and health group 2020 aimed at real time interaction by both the public health stakeholders and the general public it is then possible to select different epidemiological descriptors for different future climatic scenarios at both the level of entire catalonia as well as at the municipality scale and visualize all the information related to epidemic outbreaks and their associated risk arbocat allows for the prediction of autochthonous outbreaks of arboviruses in catalonia at a municipality resolution 948 cities the platform configuration is composed of three sub models providing estimates of the importation rates basic reproduction number r 0 and a stochastic compartmental model that ultimately yields both the generation time and the relative risk of an autochthonous outbreak it also yields the epidemic curves for both current and future socioeconomic and climate change scenarios so that the different projected changes can be compared the framework is entirely probabilistic and the system is updated regularly so that new infections arriving at each location enter the system and can alter current risk conditions at this stage the platform focuses on modeling the risk of an outbreak of dengue chikungunya or zika in catalunya by the aedes albopictus mosquito species indeed the highest and most pressing emergency risk identified but it could also be extended to other similar arboviral threats e g to wnv and its culex vector catalunya receives a plethora of travelers from both southeast asia and the caribbean and around 700 cases of imported arbovirosis in the interval 2014 2017 totaling dengue chikungunya and zika have been notified in primary care health centers traveler advice public health services and main hospitals with the large asymptomatic proportion of infections well known for these diseases the threat of autochthonous outbreaks increases in those areas that for particular environmental and sociodemographic conditions might be more prone to both taking in imported cases and having a higher community transmission having precise knowledge of those areas and cities becomes a matter of priority 2 methods the arbocat platform yields the epidemic expansion risk e g the probability of having an uncontrolled outbreak of dengue zika and chikungunya in a naive area using threshold criteria to classify outbreaks as epidemics for example more than 10 autochthonous transmissions in this way public health experts can adapt their surveillance indicators through the estimation of the probability of an epidemic given several observed cases in a municipality similarly arbocat enables the simulation of different scenarios for calculating r 0 e g for different climate change scenarios over the variable proliferation of vectors as well as according to different economic projections and their associated impact on socioeconomic variables it is then possible to simulate future epidemic projections in these situations and calculate their associated risk levels to this end we generated different climate change projections using the isimip 2b dataset for rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 emissions scenarios frieler et al 2017 for comparison we calculated the r 0 distributions using the mean and minimum temperatures and then we used the mean value of the distribution to generate both current and future risk maps rcp 2 6 is a scenario that requires that carbon dioxide co2 emissions start declining by 2020 and go to zero by 2100 it also requires that methane emissions ch4 go to approximately half the ch4 levels of 2020 and that sulfur dioxide so2 emissions decline to approximately 10 of those of registered levels in the period 1980 1990 this scenario requires negative co2 emissions such as co2 absorption by trees for rcp 2 6 those negative emissions would be on average 2 gigatons of co2 per year g t co2 yr with all these assumptions rcp 2 6 is likely to keep the global temperature rising below 2 c by 2100 riahi et al 2017 in the rcp 8 5 scenario emissions continue to rise throughout the 21 st century since the first assessment reports of the ipcc this has been thought to be unlikely but still possible as feedbacks are not well understood rcp 8 5 which is generally taken as the basis for worst case climate change scenarios was based on what proved to be an overestimation of projected coal outputs it is still used for predicting mid century and earlier emissions based on current and stated policies under this scenario the temperature increase is around 5 c by 2100 schwalm et al 2020 the platform also provides a set of tools for the epidemiological analysis of simulated arboviral outbreaks following this idea and depending on the initial parameters used to feed the compartmental stochastic s e i r model it is possible to simulate different scenarios and obtain their probability distributions and their temporal epidemic curves e g incidence cases after 100 days for assessment of the initial stages of the outbreak the platform allows to select among different variables and visualize the resulting data it is possible to choose among different buttons as selection tools and among different social economic demographic and environmental layers representing indicators this way a particular municipality can be selected and the information related to it displayed on the screen isglobal climate and health group 2020 this new platform is implemented for 948 municipalities in catalonia arbocat is formed by three sub models providing estimates of the importation rates the basic reproduction number r 0 and then it fits a stochastic seir compartmental model that yields the generation time fig 1 this platform provides simulations for the municipality s risk of autochthonous outbreaks and the resulting epidemic curves for the summer season there are two layers available in arbocat on the one hand there are risk maps where it is possible to select among different risk scenarios and explore both their associated probability distributions and dynamical epidemic curves on the other hand there is the choice of the covariates or layers figure s2 these maps provide a user friendly visualization of the co variable s used by the model for instance visualization can be generated of the mosquito abundance that provides information relative to the mosquito distribution calculated using the data provided either by kramer et al perkins et al 2016 or by the mosquito alert platform creaf 2018 figure s2a r 0 the basic reproduction number can be visualized as denoting the number of secondary cases originated by a single infection figure s2d figure s2b displays temperature as the mean temperature for the current period the average mosquito alert data provided by the mosquito alert platform also yields the probability of mosquito presence in a particular municipality as a first output the importation risk model can generate the risk of having an imported arboviral case derived from the history of reported cases in the importation database this model takes into account the socio economic and demographic characteristics of each municipality for this it uses as input the previous imported cases for each municipality for the whole of catalonia then the gdp population density and health infrastructure are all used as inputs to run a bayesian algorithm of inference in a similar way to castro et al 2017 and perkins et al 2016 as an example figure s2c depicts the average annual family income per municipality three different risk scenarios can be obtained by using the aforementioned monte carlo approach perkins et al 2016 rubinstein and kroese 2016 to produce a parameter distribution of r 0 after which different risk values of this distribution can be selected e g low middle and high a low risk scenario is generated by taking the quantile 25 from the fitted r 0 distribution a medium risk scenario is generated by using the quantile 50 from the fitted r 0 distribution and finally a high risk scenario is generated from the quantile 90 of the fitted r 0 distribution 2 1 data the temperature data were obtained from the isimip 2b database the isimip2b forcing data are adjusted to the newly compiled reference dataset ewembi e2obs wfdei and erai data merged and bias corrected for isimip which covers the entire globe at 0 5 degree horizontal and daily temporal resolution from 1979 the ewembi dataset was compiled to support the bias correction of climate input data for the impact assessments carried out in phase 2b of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project frieler et al 2017 the isimip2b scenarios are designed to elicit the contribution of climate change to impacts arising from low emissions climate change scenarios pre industrial control runs are included to facilitate statistical comparison with a no climate change case among the main characteristics of this data set can be mentioned a bias correction of the ewembi data set at daily temporal and 0 5 horizontal resolution daily time step at 0 5 horizontal resolution pre industrial 1661 1860 historical 1861 2005 and future rcp 2 6 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 conditions provided based on cmip5 output of gfdlesm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 for the initial calibration of the model and assessment of the effect of historical climate on the sub models we used worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 data set due to the high resolution this data set provides 0 5 0 5 of grid size furthermore worldclim is one of the most cited data sets using 9 general circulation and earth system models gcms and esms as part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 the data were loaded for each municipality polygon of the map according to the coordinates of the same area and having as a reference each quadrant of the data file then we used the data for each polygon in the grid to calculate the r 0 distribution as shown eq 1 to run the suite of climate change scenarios the isimip 2b data were then used because they have already been subject to a bias correction for the projections made by the models methodologically the worldclim and isimip 2b models used to generate both climate products are similar kim et al 2018 so using one or the other does not convey a technical impediment to arbocat such as the lack of consistency of the epidemiological products the platform develops mosquito data for catalonia were obtained either from perkins et al 2016 or from the mosquito alert platform creaf 2018 bartumeus et al 2018 in collaboration with the platform developers this data set provides a proxy for the mosquito abundance at the municipality level for all of catalonia for the socio economic data we used the official gross domestic product gdp provided by the spanish national institute of statistics ine national institute of statistics 2019 2 2 importation risk model arbocat assumes that outbreaks originate with the importation of an infectious case as a result the importation sub model generates a catalonia wide cases importation rate as well as a municipality specific probability of receiving the next imported case needed for the platform to compute the corresponding epidemic risks to calculate such rates the importation sub model takes into account several estimators such as historical arbovirus data collected by the catalan public health agency sociological predictors such as municipality population size poverty and education indices and health insurance measurements among others table 2 we then identify the relevant predictive variables by using backward selection draper 2014 george et al 2015 and akaike information criterion a i c methods lamperti 2018 we can generate the simulated rates through a bayesian maximum entropy maxent predictive framework maximum entropy methods are very general ways to predict probability distributions given constraints on their moments lubinda et al 2019 these methods can predict relative abundance distributions based on the number of individuals species and total energy of the system kong et al 2019 the approach also enables the prediction of community composition along ecological gradients based on characteristic traits species distributions based on environmental co variates and associations in food webs kark 2012 the maximum entropy method used here works as follows suppose that you have a set x whose elements are each of the 948 municipalities of catalonia i e x x 1 x 2 x 948 on the other hand there is a set p with the probabilities of receiving a new imported case of arboviral disease then p p 1 p 2 p 948 and i 1 i 948 p i 1 the relative probabilities p i can be constrained with a known statistical measure of some known f j x for each municipality the functions f j x are functions of socioeconomic environmental and travel variables in our case mathematically this type of problem is then posed as an inverse convex minimization problem the most commonly used function for this is shannon entropy the selection of relevant variables was carried out using backward selection methods as in the work of castro et al 2017 these methods fit a maximum entropy model given a set of variables f j in this case the socio economic and environmental variables and then return the out of sample log likelihood averaged over seven randomly sampled cross validation folds the likelihood function is evaluated on a measure of distance between variable i and variable j d i j normally the infinite norm is used the number of variables tested at the beginning was 15 socio economic variables including the percentage of both male and female populations and the percentage of the population with university studies among others in table 1 the complete list of socioeconomic variables evaluated when calibrating the import model is shown all the data can be accessed openly through the link at the foot of the table the final list is detailed in table 2 and eventually the a i c yamashita et al 2007 was calculated to corroborate that these variables account for the phenomenon in question the probability of receiving a new case the a i c was calculated as a i c 2 k 2 l o g l where k is the number of variables and l is the likelihood function we can summarize the importation risk model as follow we estimated the catalonia importation rate expected number of imported cases per day for the period august 2014 2017 then we estimated the probability import risk that the next catalonia imported case will arrive in each municipality then we took the product of the catalonia importation rate and each municipality importation probability we validated our importation model by comparing the predicted distribution of cases across catalonia given a total number of imported cases december of 2017 as a linear predictor of the empirical distribution of cases across municipalities it is important to note that we used the period 2014 2017 of the importation data since at the moment of the initial model training this was the available information we therefore validated the model by using only 2017 data and we are re running the platform now with the newly updated cases in order to validate the results of the importation risk model we make a visual validation in section 1 in which we can see the total imported cases of dengue zika and chikungunya throughout catalonia at the municipal level during the week 30 of 2017 end of july compared against the risk predicted by the model 2 3 reproduction number model the basic reproduction number r 0 can be defined as the number of new cases one case generates on average throughout its infectious period in an otherwise uninfected population tesla et al 2018 this metric is useful because it helps determine whether or not an infectious disease can spread through a population baylis 2013 most of the time when r 0 1 the infection will most likely die out in the long run but if r 0 1 the infection instead will be able to spread in a population the r 0 model uses the ross macdonald formulation smith et al 2014 1 r 0 m b c α 2 e μ ω μ λ where m t g d p is the municipality mosquito abundance modulated by t temperature and g d p the gross domestic product to do this we follow perkins et al 2016 with this function measuring the ratio of mosquitoes to humans and quantified using a combination of occurrence probabilities and the gdp by municipality as in the original work this method follows the formulation by brady et al 2013 b is the mosquito to human probability of transmission per bite and it was quantified as b 0 4 reiner et al 2013 c is the human to mosquito probability of transmission per bite we set the value of this parameter to c 3 5 scott et al 2000 α t is the mosquito biting rate with a value of α t 0 67 reiner et al 2013 μ t is the mosquito female average lifespan which for the relationship between temperature and mean duration of the extrinsic incubation period we used a temperature dependent exponential rate chan and johansson 2012 ω t is the extrinsic incubation period calculated from α t chan and johansson 2012 and λ denotes the average individual recovery rate of infection the data used for this r 0 model correspond to the mosquito presence probability provided by mosquito alert eritja et al 2018 the temperature data comes from worldclim cosmos among others and the gdp or other municipality level economic factors considered as a contact modulator figure s2 the values of r 0 were calculated using a monte carlo algorithm applied to fig 3 to produce a realistic parameter distribution fig 1 the mosquito alert data set provides information about the asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus from observations done by citizen scientists using the mosquito alert app it includes reports from citizens tagged by them as adult mosquitoes that contain at least one picture and that have been evaluated by entomological experts creaf 2018 it is assumed that mosquito abundance in a municipality is distributed as a poisson random variable with expectation λ l n 1 p v m where p v m is the probability of occurrence vector presence for a particular municipality perkins et al 2016 for each municipality the occurrence probability was estimated by averaging the 1 km 2 occurrence probabilities given by mosquito alert information mosquito abundance creaf 2018 of the abundance within the municipality and then the equation was applied above to derive an average abundance the analysis was carried out essentially taking into account the presence of aedes albopictus since it is the most common vector found in the mediterranean basin something that seems to be aggravated by climate change linares et al 2020 for the temperature the average of 10 years 2007 2017 was taken into account weighing maximum and minimum temperatures at the municipal level for the gdp the process was similar to taking information from spain s national institute of statistics given the high uncertainty in the underlying parameter estimates it is natural to choose to analyze the relative risk by scaling the median r 0 estimate of each municipality from 0 lowest risk to 1 highest risk for that reason we also present several different scenarios each scenario corresponds to different measures of the r 0 distribution as described later after generating these two parameters importation risk and r 0 the model simulates the potential outbreaks using a s e i r like compartmental model castro et al 2017 fig 3 as well as the final size of the forecasted outbreak fig 4 the value of r 0 is one of the input parameters of the s e i r model both with the importation risk probability as duly explained in section 2 methods the r 0 model gives as a result a distribution of possible reproductive ratios in each municipality such value then is taken as entry by the s e i r model at time zero for the simulations this value is then used in the compartmental model shown below to determine the rate β as the relation with the recovery rate this is not explicitly incorporated into the model since we are interested only in the first weeks of the outbreak the recovery rate was selected to be representative of the three infectious of interest and it is calculated randomly following a uniform distribution 15 21 days 1 2 4 outbreak simulations compartmental models are convenient tools for modeling infectious diseases because they offer a very simple mathematical formulation keeling and rohani 2011 the population is divided into compartments with the assumption that every individual within the compartments has equivalent epidemiological characteristics in the case of s e i r models the population is divided in four compartments s susceptible e exposed i infected and r recovered eq 2 for many important infections such as arbovirus there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but it is not yet infectious during this period the individual is in compartment e for the outbreak simulation we use a s e i r markov branching process to model the outbreaks simulations start with a single imported case and temporal evolution is governed by daily probabilities of infected to progress through e i r states the model considers explicitly the tracking of imported and autochthonous cases both reported and unreported and in a non explicit way the tracking of mosquito dynamics e g fitting of generation time for the e i transition the diagram in fig 1 summarizes the entire process the exposed class e and the infected class i are divided into multiple compartments through a boxcar implementation to simulate the delay periods and get realistic outbreak timing the generation time measures the average duration from the onset of initial symptoms to the subsequent exposure by a secondary case estimated to range from 10 to 23 days it corresponds to the sum of the e period and half of the i period we set the i period to human arboviral shedding estimates and then set the e period so that the sum e i matches the different estimated arboviral intervals in the time series of data by doing this the model produces realistic outbreak timings the equations of the stochastic epidemiological model are described below eqs 2 4 model equations 2 i i u i i i u 1 t 1 p o i

same but with pessimistic projections mean temperature these scenarios are the baseline comparison of the scenarios proposed in 7 and 8 3 results figure s3 shows the evolution of weekly imported aggregated cases for dengue zika and chikungunya for catalonia for the individual years 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 at the bottom of figure s3 the historical spatial distribution in annual accumulated cases is shown at the municipality level most populated areas in coastal regions tend to concentrate the highest number of imported cases the municipality associated risk is shown in fig 2 after running the importation risk model not surprisingly the cities of barcelona and others in its vicinity are the ones showing up to twelve times higher risk values where the scale represents the daily probability of having a new imported case fig 4 shows the dynamics of outbreaks for two municipalities with quite different socio economic and demographic structures on the one hand fig 4 a and 4 c show the outbreak dynamics and distribution of the final size of outbreaks respectively for the barcelona metropolitan area containing the main city of catalonia with both the largest population size over 3 2 million inhabitants and socio demographic heterogeneity on the other hand figs 4 b and 4 d show the same results derived for lloret a small size municipality in terms of population size 40 000 inhabitants with a more homogeneous demographic and socio economic structure the projected temperatures for the isimip2b scenarios can be seen in figure s4 for the minimum temperatures and figure s5 for the mean temperatures using these projections as entries of the r 0 model the different r 0 distributions are generated and the future projections of the imported risk by 2050 by using the isimip 2b temperature predictions can be displayed in figure s5a s5b and figure s5c s5e the generated distributions are shown in fig 5 for the minimum temperatures profile and figure 6 for the mean temperatures profile under the rcp 2 6 and the rcp 8 5 scenarios in fig 7 the best case scenario is displayed when the outbreak risk is calculated for the minimum temperature profile for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in figs 7 a and 7 b instead the associated risk for rcp 2 6 shown is for 2020 and 2050 are respectively in figs 7 c and 7 d the associated epidemic risk for the rcp 8 5 scenario both in 2020 and 2050 are displayed for comparison in fig 8 the outbreak risk is calculated for the mean temperature profile for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in figs 8 a and 8 b it can be compared to the associated risk derived from the rcp 2 6 scenario in contrast figs 8 c and 8 d show the associated risk for the more extreme rcp 8 5 scenario 4 discussion this new computational framework implemented in 2019 by the catalan public health agency as a pre operational system provides a data driven approach to estimating near real time the arboviral emergence risk from a potentially sparse and possibly uncertain surveillance data collected by travelers arriving at primary care health centers we show the application of arbocat across the 948 environmentally and demographically diverse municipalities spanning all of catalonia a mediterranean region in which local transmission of arboviral diseases has been reported mouzo quintans 2019 the most recent case was on 16 september 2019 when the catalonian public health agency confirmed an autochthonous case of dengue in a resident of barcelonès county the case had onset of symptoms on 6 september 2019 with no recent travel history outside of spain dengue infection was later confirmed by the catalan reference laboratory for arboviruses and the spanish national reference laboratory for arboviruses according to national authorities control measures are foreseen to be implemented due to the impending threat ecdc 2019 following results obtained for the low and middle risk scenarios we would not expect most catalonia municipalities to be at high risk for sustained local epidemics figs 8 a at most the highest risk cities will lie in the coastal region mainly in the south near the ebre s river mouth these are the areas where aedes albopictus maintains larger seasonal populations and where more favorable conditions for survival and proliferation exist by mapping observed cases to current and future risks and in the face of the large associated uncertainty in case recognition this approach can also be used to design actionable public health prevention plans and evaluate the utility in ews of local versus regional triggers surveillance triggers guidelines specifying situations that warrant intervention are a key component of many public health response plans given the urgency and uncertainty surrounding the importation of arboviral infections universal recommendations can be both pragmatic and judicious this pilot platform was implemented to assist catalonia policymakers in interpreting the triggers for deriving actionable and efficient interventions guided by the public health protocols valid at each moment across municipalities there is an enormous variation in both the chance of occurrence of a trigger and the magnitude of the public health threat if and when local cases are reported following the previous successful implementation of a predecessor platform in texas castro et al 2017 yuan and nishiura 2018 tracking arboviral importation from mexico and the caribbean we used a similar framework to integrate importation and transmission risks to estimate the probability of local transmission this is to our knowledge the first such attempt in europe simulated scenarios can be ranked from best to worst case scenarios based on the value of r 0 that was used to run the simulations the input r 0 used can be seen in figs 5 and 6 5000 experiments were run for each scenario to generate the risk distributions summarized in figs 8 a and 8 b for the rcp 2 6 actual and future mid risk scenarios similarly figs 7 a and 7 b display the rcp 2 6 actual and future low risk scenarios and figs 8 d 8 c show the same for the rcp 8 5 mid risk scenario finally figs 7 c 7 c show the projected situation for the rcp 8 5 low risk scenario an outbreak criterion of more than 10 local cases was selected in all cases as the threshold for defining an epidemic castro et al 2017 as it can be seen when compared with the r 0 projections the outbreak risk does not follow the same pattern as the reproduction number predictions this seems to be the result of the model taking into account each locality the different weights of the socio economic variables affecting disease propagation and the importation risk according to the risk projections obtained in these simulations neither the rcp 2 6 nor the rcp 8 5 low risk scenarios are worry some for most of the municipalities the middle risk scenario is worse in terms of the number and extent of affected municipalities but still the risk probability keeps at a low end fig 8 for the maximum risk situation fig 8 d the worst possible case scenario occurs in conjunction with the maximum values for r 0 in this projection the number of municipalities affected is beyond 150 municipalities and the probabilities rise considerably if compared to the two other scenarios arbocat is a vectorborne disease ews model platform that allows the user to generate thousands of probabilistic simulations for estimating both the r 0 model and the importation risk model that was previously calibrated with historical datasets of arbovirus infection imported cases arbocat also allows the performing of different statistical analyses to post process results and obtain estimates of the epidemic risk in a probabilistic framework this computational platform enables the calculation of the epidemic expansion risk using criteria to classify outbreaks as epidemics for example defined as more than 10 autochthonous transmissions castro et al 2017 solimini et al 2018 albeit this threshold can be changed if other thresholds are preferred for intervention this way public health experts can better design following those surveillance triggers of their interest through the estimation of the probability of a local epidemic outbreak given the number of observed cases in a municipality also by simulating different scenarios for calculating r 0 e g taking into consideration factors such as different levels of climate change over proliferation of vectors economic projections and their impact on the population s socio economic variables it is possible to accurately simulate all likely future epidemic scenarios following this concept and depending on the initial parameters used to feed the compartmental stochastic s e i r model it is possible to simulate future actionable scenarios and obtain probability distributions and the most likely evolution in time of the epidemic curves developing in the initial stages of the outbreak in future versions of the platform with updated data on the imports of the different arboviral diseases that arrive in catalonia a new layer will be added to the epidemiological model in order to parameterize it for each of them independently arbocat can also be easily upscaled continentally keeping the same configuration or alternately downscaled to simulate urban scale outbreaks provided high resolution city scale climatic and socio economic indicators datasets are available coupling to urban climate models e g urbclim de ridder et al 2015 to achieve higher spatial resolution is indeed possible and should be pursued as a logical extension of the early warning capacity of arbocat of potential application in both european cities and regions and elsewhere credit authorship

24252,background the lack of previous exposure to arbovirus and the ongoing geographical expansion of viable vector populations has fostered the implementation of preventive strategies in those areas more prone to disease importation catalonia receives a wealth of travelers from southeast asia south america and the caribbean and around 700 cases of imported arbovirosis 2012 2016 totaling dengue chikungunya and zika have been notified in primary care health centers traveler advice public health services and main hospitals with the large asymptomatic proportion of infections well known for these diseases the threat for autochthonous outbreaks increases in those areas that for particular environmental and socio demographic conditions might be more susceptible operational early warning systems are lacking in most places where these outbreaks pose a serious health treat methods here we present the arbocat platform for the prediction of autochthonous outbreaks of arboviruses emanating from imported cases implemented for catalonia at municipality resolution three sub models provide estimations for importation rates and the basic reproduction number and their outcomes are used to fit a stochastic compartmental model that yields the generation time and the risk of local outbreaks for 948 municipalities we used also isimip 2b the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project temperature data to generate future outbreak risk maps for the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios where rcp is representative concentration trajectories findings substantial differences exist between the low and middle risk scenarios but most catalonia municipalities are not at risk for a sustained epidemic instead high r 0 are obtained for the maximum risk scenario with the number of municipalities affected being over 150 in the rcp 8 5 scenario many of the highest risk areas lie in the most populated cities in the coastal region particularly in the south near to the ebre s river interpretation the current outbreak risk is low both for the mean and minimum temperature scenarios and rises in the high risk situation projections for 2050 are not so optimistic leading to a significant increase in affected municipalities over 100 mainly in the coastal area due to the temperature increase followed in rcp 8 5 funding this study was partially supported by the catalonia department of health and the spanish ministry of science and innovation keywords arbovirus surveillance arboviral infections climate change modeling risk map mosquito data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction arboviruses are mainly transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes flies ticks or fleas their common infectious pathway does allow us to broadly characterize their geographic extension which is constrained by the presence of suitable vectors paksa et al 2019 most arthropods require warm and humid conditions to survive and therefore arbovirosis exists mainly present in the tropics where adequate weather conditions ensure year round or at least seasonal vector presence bartholomay 2012 arboviruses are maintained in natural transmission cycles in which they replicate in hematophagous arthropods and are transmitted to vertebrate hosts during a blood meal arboviruses are initially maintained in an enzootic sylvatic cycle involving rodents birds or nonhuman primates as reservoir hosts boulanger 2018 spillover from the enzootic cycle sometimes occurs through incidental biting of humans by enzootic and or bridge vectors some arboviruses may achieve further amplification in domestic animals within a rural epizootic cycle others may alter their host range from nonhuman primates to humans leading to an urban epidemic transmission cycle vertical transmission from an infected vector to its progeny is a common feature of arboviral infections for tick borne viruses transovarial transstadial and venereal transmissions also occur yu et al 2019 turell 2020 every year unweighted disability adjusted life years dalys attributable to yellow fever yfv japanese encephalitis jev chikungunya chikv and rift valley fever rvfv viruses were estimated to fall between 300 000 and 5 000 000 for the year 2005 of the above yfv was the most prevalent infection of the four viruses evaluated labeaud et al 2011 whereas recently also west nile fever caused a serious local outbreak in southwest spain ecdc 2020 recurrent outbreaks of arboviruses in endemic regions of the world represent a serious threat of potential propagation to naive settings where the population is immunologically naive lack of previous exposure and the ongoing geographical expansion of viable vector populations has fostered the implementation of preventive strategies in those areas more liable to disease importation global warming in addition is broadening the geographical range of most vector suitable habitats which along with ever increasing human circulation and land use and land cover changes might result in the establishment of local arboviral transmission cycles in temperate regions in the european context southern europe is the most affected area for these pathogens travelers who are infected with denv or chikv in endemic areas of the world and who return to european areas colonized by ae albopictus increase the risk of introduction of the respective diseases particularly if they are in the viraemic phase concerns about such a risk arose with chikungunya outbreaks in italy in 2007 rezza et al 2007 in the late summer of 2010 an autochthonous dengue case was reported in nice france the likely index case was described as a man who lived in the proximity of the first case and who had recently returned from martinique where he contracted denv infection la ruche et al 2010 autochthonous cases of dengue have been reported in france la ruche et al 2010 croatia gjenero margan et al 2010 madeira spain on the other hand chikungunya has been reported in italy and france grandadam et al 2011 due to its location in the mediterranean basin as one of spain s autonomous communities catalonia north eastern spain has not been exempt from these diseases and in 2018 and 2019 some local cases of these diseases have been observed both diseases along with zika and yfv are transmitted by mosquitoes of the aedes genus whose two most locally widespread species are aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus the first one aedes aegypti feeds almost exclusively on humans and is therefore the most efficient disease spreader it is the main culprit for the huge burden that such diseases pose in tropical regions the second one aedes albopictus on the other hand feeds less often and on a variety of host species and therefore it is a worse spreader however it geographically extends far beyond the range of its sister species and therefore it is responsible for the ongoing arboviral colonization of temperate regions it was first introduced in europe around 1979 and it is now present in the whole mediterranean basin figure s1 aedes mosquitoes are very well adapted to both tropical and temperate urban settings perrin et al 2020 this fact poses an additional threat to our highly urbanized societies current projections estimate that around two thirds of the world s population will live in urban areas by 2050 68 of the world population projected un 2022 all in all the presence of aedes albopictus mosquitoes in catalonia opens the possibility of an aedes borne disease outbreak which necessarily must start with the arrival of an infected person from an endemic country dengue and chikungunya have already shown the potential threat they pose for southern europe and so does zika as illustrated by the large 2015 south american epidemic the worldwide incidence of dengue has increased dramatically during the last decades before 1970 only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics nowadays however dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries of africa the americas the eastern mediterranean south east asia and the western pacific recent estimates indicate that around 390 million dengue infections occur yearly of which around 96 million manifest clinically and currently more than half of the world s population is at risk of contracting such infectious disease du et al 2021 yang et al 2021 chikungunya was first described in tanzania in 1952 and it rapidly spread a major outbreak occurred in the islands of the indian ocean in 2005 and it is now present in more than 60 countries zika is one of the viruses that has experienced a faster geographical spread zavala colon and gonzalez sanchez 2022 to date a total of 84 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted zika infection puntasecca et al 2021 in this study we implemented a computational platform arbocat based on castro et al 2017 lópez et al 2019 that allows the investigation of different infection importation scenarios grounded on the local socioeconomic and demographic structure of the receiving populations while integrating relevant climate determinants and the local data on vector distribution the platform has a rich and user friendly data visualization framework www arbocat cat isglobal climate and health group 2020 aimed at real time interaction by both the public health stakeholders and the general public it is then possible to select different epidemiological descriptors for different future climatic scenarios at both the level of entire catalonia as well as at the municipality scale and visualize all the information related to epidemic outbreaks and their associated risk arbocat allows for the prediction of autochthonous outbreaks of arboviruses in catalonia at a municipality resolution 948 cities the platform configuration is composed of three sub models providing estimates of the importation rates basic reproduction number r 0 and a stochastic compartmental model that ultimately yields both the generation time and the relative risk of an autochthonous outbreak it also yields the epidemic curves for both current and future socioeconomic and climate change scenarios so that the different projected changes can be compared the framework is entirely probabilistic and the system is updated regularly so that new infections arriving at each location enter the system and can alter current risk conditions at this stage the platform focuses on modeling the risk of an outbreak of dengue chikungunya or zika in catalunya by the aedes albopictus mosquito species indeed the highest and most pressing emergency risk identified but it could also be extended to other similar arboviral threats e g to wnv and its culex vector catalunya receives a plethora of travelers from both southeast asia and the caribbean and around 700 cases of imported arbovirosis in the interval 2014 2017 totaling dengue chikungunya and zika have been notified in primary care health centers traveler advice public health services and main hospitals with the large asymptomatic proportion of infections well known for these diseases the threat of autochthonous outbreaks increases in those areas that for particular environmental and sociodemographic conditions might be more prone to both taking in imported cases and having a higher community transmission having precise knowledge of those areas and cities becomes a matter of priority 2 methods the arbocat platform yields the epidemic expansion risk e g the probability of having an uncontrolled outbreak of dengue zika and chikungunya in a naive area using threshold criteria to classify outbreaks as epidemics for example more than 10 autochthonous transmissions in this way public health experts can adapt their surveillance indicators through the estimation of the probability of an epidemic given several observed cases in a municipality similarly arbocat enables the simulation of different scenarios for calculating r 0 e g for different climate change scenarios over the variable proliferation of vectors as well as according to different economic projections and their associated impact on socioeconomic variables it is then possible to simulate future epidemic projections in these situations and calculate their associated risk levels to this end we generated different climate change projections using the isimip 2b dataset for rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 emissions scenarios frieler et al 2017 for comparison we calculated the r 0 distributions using the mean and minimum temperatures and then we used the mean value of the distribution to generate both current and future risk maps rcp 2 6 is a scenario that requires that carbon dioxide co2 emissions start declining by 2020 and go to zero by 2100 it also requires that methane emissions ch4 go to approximately half the ch4 levels of 2020 and that sulfur dioxide so2 emissions decline to approximately 10 of those of registered levels in the period 1980 1990 this scenario requires negative co2 emissions such as co2 absorption by trees for rcp 2 6 those negative emissions would be on average 2 gigatons of co2 per year g t co2 yr with all these assumptions rcp 2 6 is likely to keep the global temperature rising below 2 c by 2100 riahi et al 2017 in the rcp 8 5 scenario emissions continue to rise throughout the 21 st century since the first assessment reports of the ipcc this has been thought to be unlikely but still possible as feedbacks are not well understood rcp 8 5 which is generally taken as the basis for worst case climate change scenarios was based on what proved to be an overestimation of projected coal outputs it is still used for predicting mid century and earlier emissions based on current and stated policies under this scenario the temperature increase is around 5 c by 2100 schwalm et al 2020 the platform also provides a set of tools for the epidemiological analysis of simulated arboviral outbreaks following this idea and depending on the initial parameters used to feed the compartmental stochastic s e i r model it is possible to simulate different scenarios and obtain their probability distributions and their temporal epidemic curves e g incidence cases after 100 days for assessment of the initial stages of the outbreak the platform allows to select among different variables and visualize the resulting data it is possible to choose among different buttons as selection tools and among different social economic demographic and environmental layers representing indicators this way a particular municipality can be selected and the information related to it displayed on the screen isglobal climate and health group 2020 this new platform is implemented for 948 municipalities in catalonia arbocat is formed by three sub models providing estimates of the importation rates the basic reproduction number r 0 and then it fits a stochastic seir compartmental model that yields the generation time fig 1 this platform provides simulations for the municipality s risk of autochthonous outbreaks and the resulting epidemic curves for the summer season there are two layers available in arbocat on the one hand there are risk maps where it is possible to select among different risk scenarios and explore both their associated probability distributions and dynamical epidemic curves on the other hand there is the choice of the covariates or layers figure s2 these maps provide a user friendly visualization of the co variable s used by the model for instance visualization can be generated of the mosquito abundance that provides information relative to the mosquito distribution calculated using the data provided either by kramer et al perkins et al 2016 or by the mosquito alert platform creaf 2018 figure s2a r 0 the basic reproduction number can be visualized as denoting the number of secondary cases originated by a single infection figure s2d figure s2b displays temperature as the mean temperature for the current period the average mosquito alert data provided by the mosquito alert platform also yields the probability of mosquito presence in a particular municipality as a first output the importation risk model can generate the risk of having an imported arboviral case derived from the history of reported cases in the importation database this model takes into account the socio economic and demographic characteristics of each municipality for this it uses as input the previous imported cases for each municipality for the whole of catalonia then the gdp population density and health infrastructure are all used as inputs to run a bayesian algorithm of inference in a similar way to castro et al 2017 and perkins et al 2016 as an example figure s2c depicts the average annual family income per municipality three different risk scenarios can be obtained by using the aforementioned monte carlo approach perkins et al 2016 rubinstein and kroese 2016 to produce a parameter distribution of r 0 after which different risk values of this distribution can be selected e g low middle and high a low risk scenario is generated by taking the quantile 25 from the fitted r 0 distribution a medium risk scenario is generated by using the quantile 50 from the fitted r 0 distribution and finally a high risk scenario is generated from the quantile 90 of the fitted r 0 distribution 2 1 data the temperature data were obtained from the isimip 2b database the isimip2b forcing data are adjusted to the newly compiled reference dataset ewembi e2obs wfdei and erai data merged and bias corrected for isimip which covers the entire globe at 0 5 degree horizontal and daily temporal resolution from 1979 the ewembi dataset was compiled to support the bias correction of climate input data for the impact assessments carried out in phase 2b of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project frieler et al 2017 the isimip2b scenarios are designed to elicit the contribution of climate change to impacts arising from low emissions climate change scenarios pre industrial control runs are included to facilitate statistical comparison with a no climate change case among the main characteristics of this data set can be mentioned a bias correction of the ewembi data set at daily temporal and 0 5 horizontal resolution daily time step at 0 5 horizontal resolution pre industrial 1661 1860 historical 1861 2005 and future rcp 2 6 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 conditions provided based on cmip5 output of gfdlesm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 for the initial calibration of the model and assessment of the effect of historical climate on the sub models we used worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 data set due to the high resolution this data set provides 0 5 0 5 of grid size furthermore worldclim is one of the most cited data sets using 9 general circulation and earth system models gcms and esms as part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 the data were loaded for each municipality polygon of the map according to the coordinates of the same area and having as a reference each quadrant of the data file then we used the data for each polygon in the grid to calculate the r 0 distribution as shown eq 1 to run the suite of climate change scenarios the isimip 2b data were then used because they have already been subject to a bias correction for the projections made by the models methodologically the worldclim and isimip 2b models used to generate both climate products are similar kim et al 2018 so using one or the other does not convey a technical impediment to arbocat such as the lack of consistency of the epidemiological products the platform develops mosquito data for catalonia were obtained either from perkins et al 2016 or from the mosquito alert platform creaf 2018 bartumeus et al 2018 in collaboration with the platform developers this data set provides a proxy for the mosquito abundance at the municipality level for all of catalonia for the socio economic data we used the official gross domestic product gdp provided by the spanish national institute of statistics ine national institute of statistics 2019 2 2 importation risk model arbocat assumes that outbreaks originate with the importation of an infectious case as a result the importation sub model generates a catalonia wide cases importation rate as well as a municipality specific probability of receiving the next imported case needed for the platform to compute the corresponding epidemic risks to calculate such rates the importation sub model takes into account several estimators such as historical arbovirus data collected by the catalan public health agency sociological predictors such as municipality population size poverty and education indices and health insurance measurements among others table 2 we then identify the relevant predictive variables by using backward selection draper 2014 george et al 2015 and akaike information criterion a i c methods lamperti 2018 we can generate the simulated rates through a bayesian maximum entropy maxent predictive framework maximum entropy methods are very general ways to predict probability distributions given constraints on their moments lubinda et al 2019 these methods can predict relative abundance distributions based on the number of individuals species and total energy of the system kong et al 2019 the approach also enables the prediction of community composition along ecological gradients based on characteristic traits species distributions based on environmental co variates and associations in food webs kark 2012 the maximum entropy method used here works as follows suppose that you have a set x whose elements are each of the 948 municipalities of catalonia i e x x 1 x 2 x 948 on the other hand there is a set p with the probabilities of receiving a new imported case of arboviral disease then p p 1 p 2 p 948 and i 1 i 948 p i 1 the relative probabilities p i can be constrained with a known statistical measure of some known f j x for each municipality the functions f j x are functions of socioeconomic environmental and travel variables in our case mathematically this type of problem is then posed as an inverse convex minimization problem the most commonly used function for this is shannon entropy the selection of relevant variables was carried out using backward selection methods as in the work of castro et al 2017 these methods fit a maximum entropy model given a set of variables f j in this case the socio economic and environmental variables and then return the out of sample log likelihood averaged over seven randomly sampled cross validation folds the likelihood function is evaluated on a measure of distance between variable i and variable j d i j normally the infinite norm is used the number of variables tested at the beginning was 15 socio economic variables including the percentage of both male and female populations and the percentage of the population with university studies among others in table 1 the complete list of socioeconomic variables evaluated when calibrating the import model is shown all the data can be accessed openly through the link at the foot of the table the final list is detailed in table 2 and eventually the a i c yamashita et al 2007 was calculated to corroborate that these variables account for the phenomenon in question the probability of receiving a new case the a i c was calculated as a i c 2 k 2 l o g l where k is the number of variables and l is the likelihood function we can summarize the importation risk model as follow we estimated the catalonia importation rate expected number of imported cases per day for the period august 2014 2017 then we estimated the probability import risk that the next catalonia imported case will arrive in each municipality then we took the product of the catalonia importation rate and each municipality importation probability we validated our importation model by comparing the predicted distribution of cases across catalonia given a total number of imported cases december of 2017 as a linear predictor of the empirical distribution of cases across municipalities it is important to note that we used the period 2014 2017 of the importation data since at the moment of the initial model training this was the available information we therefore validated the model by using only 2017 data and we are re running the platform now with the newly updated cases in order to validate the results of the importation risk model we make a visual validation in section 1 in which we can see the total imported cases of dengue zika and chikungunya throughout catalonia at the municipal level during the week 30 of 2017 end of july compared against the risk predicted by the model 2 3 reproduction number model the basic reproduction number r 0 can be defined as the number of new cases one case generates on average throughout its infectious period in an otherwise uninfected population tesla et al 2018 this metric is useful because it helps determine whether or not an infectious disease can spread through a population baylis 2013 most of the time when r 0 1 the infection will most likely die out in the long run but if r 0 1 the infection instead will be able to spread in a population the r 0 model uses the ross macdonald formulation smith et al 2014 1 r 0 m b c α 2 e μ ω μ λ where m t g d p is the municipality mosquito abundance modulated by t temperature and g d p the gross domestic product to do this we follow perkins et al 2016 with this function measuring the ratio of mosquitoes to humans and quantified using a combination of occurrence probabilities and the gdp by municipality as in the original work this method follows the formulation by brady et al 2013 b is the mosquito to human probability of transmission per bite and it was quantified as b 0 4 reiner et al 2013 c is the human to mosquito probability of transmission per bite we set the value of this parameter to c 3 5 scott et al 2000 α t is the mosquito biting rate with a value of α t 0 67 reiner et al 2013 μ t is the mosquito female average lifespan which for the relationship between temperature and mean duration of the extrinsic incubation period we used a temperature dependent exponential rate chan and johansson 2012 ω t is the extrinsic incubation period calculated from α t chan and johansson 2012 and λ denotes the average individual recovery rate of infection the data used for this r 0 model correspond to the mosquito presence probability provided by mosquito alert eritja et al 2018 the temperature data comes from worldclim cosmos among others and the gdp or other municipality level economic factors considered as a contact modulator figure s2 the values of r 0 were calculated using a monte carlo algorithm applied to fig 3 to produce a realistic parameter distribution fig 1 the mosquito alert data set provides information about the asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus from observations done by citizen scientists using the mosquito alert app it includes reports from citizens tagged by them as adult mosquitoes that contain at least one picture and that have been evaluated by entomological experts creaf 2018 it is assumed that mosquito abundance in a municipality is distributed as a poisson random variable with expectation λ l n 1 p v m where p v m is the probability of occurrence vector presence for a particular municipality perkins et al 2016 for each municipality the occurrence probability was estimated by averaging the 1 km 2 occurrence probabilities given by mosquito alert information mosquito abundance creaf 2018 of the abundance within the municipality and then the equation was applied above to derive an average abundance the analysis was carried out essentially taking into account the presence of aedes albopictus since it is the most common vector found in the mediterranean basin something that seems to be aggravated by climate change linares et al 2020 for the temperature the average of 10 years 2007 2017 was taken into account weighing maximum and minimum temperatures at the municipal level for the gdp the process was similar to taking information from spain s national institute of statistics given the high uncertainty in the underlying parameter estimates it is natural to choose to analyze the relative risk by scaling the median r 0 estimate of each municipality from 0 lowest risk to 1 highest risk for that reason we also present several different scenarios each scenario corresponds to different measures of the r 0 distribution as described later after generating these two parameters importation risk and r 0 the model simulates the potential outbreaks using a s e i r like compartmental model castro et al 2017 fig 3 as well as the final size of the forecasted outbreak fig 4 the value of r 0 is one of the input parameters of the s e i r model both with the importation risk probability as duly explained in section 2 methods the r 0 model gives as a result a distribution of possible reproductive ratios in each municipality such value then is taken as entry by the s e i r model at time zero for the simulations this value is then used in the compartmental model shown below to determine the rate β as the relation with the recovery rate this is not explicitly incorporated into the model since we are interested only in the first weeks of the outbreak the recovery rate was selected to be representative of the three infectious of interest and it is calculated randomly following a uniform distribution 15 21 days 1 2 4 outbreak simulations compartmental models are convenient tools for modeling infectious diseases because they offer a very simple mathematical formulation keeling and rohani 2011 the population is divided into compartments with the assumption that every individual within the compartments has equivalent epidemiological characteristics in the case of s e i r models the population is divided in four compartments s susceptible e exposed i infected and r recovered eq 2 for many important infections such as arbovirus there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but it is not yet infectious during this period the individual is in compartment e for the outbreak simulation we use a s e i r markov branching process to model the outbreaks simulations start with a single imported case and temporal evolution is governed by daily probabilities of infected to progress through e i r states the model considers explicitly the tracking of imported and autochthonous cases both reported and unreported and in a non explicit way the tracking of mosquito dynamics e g fitting of generation time for the e i transition the diagram in fig 1 summarizes the entire process the exposed class e and the infected class i are divided into multiple compartments through a boxcar implementation to simulate the delay periods and get realistic outbreak timing the generation time measures the average duration from the onset of initial symptoms to the subsequent exposure by a secondary case estimated to range from 10 to 23 days it corresponds to the sum of the e period and half of the i period we set the i period to human arboviral shedding estimates and then set the e period so that the sum e i matches the different estimated arboviral intervals in the time series of data by doing this the model produces realistic outbreak timings the equations of the stochastic epidemiological model are described below eqs 2 4 model equations 2 i i u i i i u 1 t 1 p o i

the most optimistic since they were run using the minimum average temperature scenarios 5 8 correspond to the worst case since they were simulated using the mean temperature projections on each case scenarios 1 and 2 correspond to the baseline scenarios for the most optimistic projections minimum temperature and they are used to compare with the future projections 3 and 4 scenarios 5 and 6 do the same but with pessimistic projections mean temperature these scenarios are the baseline comparison of the scenarios proposed in 7 and 8 3 results figure s3 shows the evolution of weekly imported aggregated cases for dengue zika and chikungunya for catalonia for the individual years 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 at the bottom of figure s3 the historical spatial distribution in annual accumulated cases is shown at the municipality level most populated areas in coastal regions tend to concentrate the highest number of imported cases the municipality associated risk is shown in fig 2 after running the importation risk model not surprisingly the cities of barcelona and others in its vicinity are the ones showing up to twelve times higher risk values where the scale represents the daily probability of having a new imported case fig 4 shows the dynamics of outbreaks for two municipalities with quite different socio economic and demographic structures on the one hand fig 4 a and 4 c show the outbreak dynamics and distribution of the final size of outbreaks respectively for the barcelona metropolitan area containing the main city of catalonia with both the largest population size over 3 2 million inhabitants and socio demographic heterogeneity on the other hand figs 4 b and 4 d show the same results derived for lloret a small size municipality in terms of population size 40 000 inhabitants with a more homogeneous demographic and socio economic structure the projected temperatures for the isimip2b scenarios can be seen in figure s4 for the minimum temperatures and figure s5 for the mean temperatures using these projections as entries of the r 0 model the different r 0 distributions are generated and the future projections of the imported risk by 2050 by using the isimip 2b temperature predictions can be displayed in figure s5a s5b and figure s5c s5e the generated distributions are shown in fig 5 for the minimum temperatures profile and figure 6 for the mean temperatures profile under the rcp 2 6 and the rcp 8 5 scenarios in fig 7 the best case scenario is displayed when the outbreak risk is calculated for the minimum temperature profile for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in figs 7 a and 7 b instead the associated risk for rcp 2 6 shown is for 2020 and 2050 are respectively in figs 7 c and 7 d the associated epidemic risk for the rcp 8 5 scenario both in 2020 and 2050 are displayed for comparison in fig 8 the outbreak risk is calculated for the mean temperature profile for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in figs 8 a and 8 b it can be compared to the associated risk derived from the rcp 2 6 scenario in contrast figs 8 c and 8 d show the associated risk for the more extreme rcp 8 5 scenario 4 discussion this new computational framework implemented in 2019 by the catalan public health agency as a pre operational system provides a data driven approach to estimating near real time the arboviral emergence risk from a potentially sparse and possibly uncertain surveillance data collected by travelers arriving at primary care health centers we show the application of arbocat across the 948 environmentally and demographically diverse municipalities spanning all of catalonia a mediterranean region in which local transmission of arboviral diseases has been reported mouzo quintans 2019 the most recent case was on 16 september 2019 when the catalonian public health agency confirmed an autochthonous case of dengue in a resident of barcelonès county the case had onset of symptoms on 6 september 2019 with no recent travel history outside of spain dengue infection was later confirmed by the catalan reference laboratory for arboviruses and the spanish national reference laboratory for arboviruses according to national authorities control measures are foreseen to be implemented due to the impending threat ecdc 2019 following results obtained for the low and middle risk scenarios we would not expect most catalonia municipalities to be at high risk for sustained local epidemics figs 8 a at most the highest risk cities will lie in the coastal region mainly in the south near the ebre s river mouth these are the areas where aedes albopictus maintains larger seasonal populations and where more favorable conditions for survival and proliferation exist by mapping observed cases to current and future risks and in the face of the large associated uncertainty in case recognition this approach can also be used to design actionable public health prevention plans and evaluate the utility in ews of local versus regional triggers surveillance triggers guidelines specifying situations that warrant intervention are a key component of many public health response plans given the urgency and uncertainty surrounding the importation of arboviral infections universal recommendations can be both pragmatic and judicious this pilot platform was implemented to assist catalonia policymakers in interpreting the triggers for deriving actionable and efficient interventions guided by the public health protocols valid at each moment across municipalities there is an enormous variation in both the chance of occurrence of a trigger and the magnitude of the public health threat if and when local cases are reported following the previous successful implementation of a predecessor platform in texas castro et al 2017 yuan and nishiura 2018 tracking arboviral importation from mexico and the caribbean we used a similar framework to integrate importation and transmission risks to estimate the probability of local transmission this is to our knowledge the first such attempt in europe simulated scenarios can be ranked from best to worst case scenarios based on the value of r 0 that was used to run the simulations the input r 0 used can be seen in figs 5 and 6 5000 experiments were run for each scenario to generate the risk distributions summarized in figs 8 a and 8 b for the rcp 2 6 actual and future mid risk scenarios similarly figs 7 a and 7 b display the rcp 2 6 actual and future low risk scenarios and figs 8 d 8 c show the same for the rcp 8 5 mid risk scenario finally figs 7 c 7 c show the projected situation for the rcp 8 5 low risk scenario an outbreak criterion of more than 10 local cases was selected in all cases as the threshold for defining an epidemic castro et al 2017 as it can be seen when compared with the r 0 projections the outbreak risk does not follow the same pattern as the reproduction number predictions this seems to be the result of the model taking into account each locality the different weights of the socio economic variables affecting disease propagation and the importation risk according to the risk projections obtained in these simulations neither the rcp 2 6 nor the rcp 8 5 low risk scenarios are worry some for most of the municipalities the middle risk scenario is worse in terms of the number and extent of affected municipalities but still the risk probability keeps at a low end fig 8 for the maximum risk situation fig 8 d the worst possible case scenario occurs in conjunction with the maximum values for r 0 in this projection the number of municipalities affected is beyond 150 municipalities and the probabilities rise considerably if compared to the two other scenarios arbocat is a vectorborne disease ews model platform that allows the user to generate thousands of probabilistic simulations for estimating both the r 0 model and the importation risk model that was previously calibrated with historical datasets of arbovirus infection imported cases arbocat also allows the performing of different statistical analyses to post process results and obtain estimates of the epidemic risk in a probabilistic framework this computational platform enables the calculation of the epidemic expansion risk using criteria to classify outbreaks as epidemics for example defined as more than 10 autochthonous transmissions castro et al 2017 solimini et al 2018 albeit this threshold can be changed if other thresholds are preferred for intervention this way public health experts can better design following those surveillance triggers of their interest through the estimation of the probability of a local epidemic outbreak given the number of observed cases in a municipality also by simulating different scenarios for calculating r 0 e g taking into consideration factors such as different levels of climate change over proliferation of vectors economic projections and their impact on the population s socio economic variables it is possible to accurately simulate all likely future epidemic scenarios following this concept and depending on the initial parameters used to feed the compartmental stochastic s e i r model it is possible to simulate future actionable scenarios and obtain probability distributions and the most likely evolution in time of the epidemic curves developing in the initial stages of the outbreak in future versions of the platform with updated data on the imports of the different arboviral diseases that arrive in catalonia a new layer will be added to the epidemiological model in order to parameterize it for each of them independently arbocat can also be easily upscaled continentally keeping the same configuration or alternately downscaled to simulate urban scale outbreaks provided high resolution city scale climatic and socio economic indicators datasets are available coupling to urban climate models e g urbclim de ridder et al 2015 to achieve higher spatial resolution is indeed possible and should be pursued as a logical extension of the early warning capacity of arbocat of potential application in both european cities and regions and elsewhere credit authorship

24253,recently requests for forest management to conserve water resources and sequester carbon have increased in japan where approximately 27 and 12 of the total land area are covered by forest plantations and japanese cedar cryptomeria japonica d don to formulate better forest management practices that maximize forest functions by maintaining water and carbon cycles an understanding of how leaf level ecophysiological traits influence canopy level co2 and h2o exchanges in japanese cedar plantations is required in this study observations of eddy covariance flux and leaf ecophysiology in a japanese cedar plantation in southern japan indicate that significantly greater productivity and seasonal variations tend to occur in canopy co2 and h2o fluxes with seasonal patterns of photosynthetic traits maximum carboxylation rate normalized at 25 c v cmax 25 and leaf area index lai we also examined how biotic e g v cmax 25 and lai and abiotic e g meteorological variables factors govern canopy fluxes using a multi layer soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model the model validation suggests that seasonal variations in v cmax 25 and lai must be included to reproduce the fluxes observed in the plantation quantitative experiments using the validated svat model indicate that considering cold acclimation during the winter improved the reproducibility of the model with regard to the measured fluxes constant high intra annual lai had the least impact on forest productivity and a consistently high v cmax 25 value increased forest productivity but considerably decreased the nitrogen use efficiency and required a larger nitrogen supply from the ecosystem during the winter these findings highlight the necessity of decreasing photosynthetic ability during the winter which safeguards the ecosystem s nitrogen resources to sustain the productivity of the japanese cedar plantation throughout the year graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eddy covariance soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model canopy photosynthesis canopy transpiration leaf area index net ecosystem carbon exchange data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests cover 70 of the total land area in japan and are mostly located in mountainous regions forest plantations and forests that contain a single conifer species japanese cedar cryptomeria japonica d don cover approximately 27 and 12 of the total land area respectively japan forestry agency 2021 thus japanese forest plantations that are mainly composed of evergreen conifers such as japanese cedar play a substantial role in supplying water resources to lowlands e g momiyama et al 2021 and sequestering large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere egusa et al 2020 estimated that at least 40 tg year 1 of net carbon was taken up by japanese forests of which the presumed contribution of japanese cedar is approximately one fourth of the total uptake recently requests for forest plantation management to control water discharge from the mountains and maximize carbon sequestration have increased japan forestry agency 2021 in addition to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and land use on the anticipated forest functions an improved understanding of the carbon and water cycle processes in japanese cedar plantations is required which can provide strategies for forest plantation management few studies have assessed canopy level co2 and h2o exchanges in japanese cedar plantations by the eddy covariance method which is a prerequisite for assessing forest carbon and water cycle processes saitoh et al 2010 shimizu et al 2015 previous studies have focused on the importance of japanese cedar as a woody material and as a silvicultural species e g ohsumi 2018 further few studies have examined the leaf scale ecophysiology of japanese cedar which is critical for understanding the mechanisms of canopy co2 and h2o exchanges e g han et al 2003 miyazawa et al 2017 the ability to understand existing carbon and water cycling and predict future cycling under a changing environment in japanese cedar plantations has been limited owing to the lack of integrated leaf and canopy scale data for model input and evaluation numerous simple big leaf canopy frameworks have been used to describe co2 and h2o fluxes from the canopy by coupling ecophysiological principles with above canopy aerodynamic transport mechanics which have also been adopted in land surface models e g lawrence et al 2019 sellers et al 1996 however bonan et al 2021 noted the limitations of a big leaf scheme which are caused by ignoring vertical microclimate profiles and leaf physiology in the canopy and suggested the necessity of using a multi layer formulation for the canopies to achieve a thorough understanding of the fluxes e g baldocchi and meyers 1998 katul and albertson 1999 lai et al 2000 in this study a multi layer soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model was parameterized using independently collected leaf level ecophysiological measurements and was not calibrated or parameterized using canopy level flux measurements e g kumagai and kume 2012 kumagai et al 2006 2013 xue et al 2011 the svat model used herein is useful for investigating the effects of meteorological factors and or ecophysiological functions on co2 and h2o exchanges between the forest canopy and the atmosphere although seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits have been considered in svat models to accurately estimate co2 and h2o fluxes e g wilson et al 2001 little attention has been paid to flux simulations in evergreen conifer biomes e g wang et al 2019 moreover evergreen conifers are known to exhibit seasonal photosynthetic traits despite their constant greenness e g bourdeau 1959 recent studies have demonstrated the mechanism by which evergreen conifer trees regulate seasonal photosynthetic activity e g bowling et al 2018 yang et al 2020 bowling et al 2018 and seyednasrollah et al 2021 examined the relationships between gross primary productivity gpp and canopy color associated with leaf pigment to predict seasonal variations in gpp for evergreen conifer forests luo et al 2019 reported that the simulated gpp of evergreen conifers was less accurate after applying the seasonal leaf chlorophyll content constraint considering the seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits wang et al 2019 found that the big leaf scheme in a land surface model could better reproduce eddy covariance measured daily gpp and evapotranspiration values for evergreen conifer forests when considering seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits and leaf area index lai however seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits have rarely been used to constrain land surface models for evergreen conifers thus the observation of seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits lai of evergreen conifers and their application to multi layer svat models should be investigated both locally and globally the primary objective of this study was to investigate how seasonally varying leaf ecophysiology and meteorological factors affect the canopy co2 and h2o fluxes in a japanese cedar plantation the colors of the cedar canopy differ between the winter and the growing season resulting in a higher photosynthetic ability during the growing season e g han and mukai 1999 in this study we addressed three main questions 1 to what degree do photosynthetic traits and lai vary seasonally 2 how large of an impact does seasonality in photosynthetic traits and lai have on canopy flux processes 3 the ecological implications of deciduous behavior are generally related to meteorological seasonality hence what ecological implications underlie seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits and lai in evergreen conifers to address these questions we collected detailed field measurements of leaf scale gas exchange lai and eddy covariance fluxes using these data we analyzed the factors controlling canopy fluxes with a multi layer svat model prior to assessing the impacts of the seasonality of photosynthetic traits and lai on the canopy fluxes the svat model was validated using field measurements collected during one year in a japanese cedar plantation in kyushu japan 2 study site and observations the study site and instruments relevant to the meteorological and flux measurements are described in kumagai et al 2014 and shimizu et al 2015 a review the leaf level ecophysiology measurements and leaf area density profile measurements are provided here for clarity 2 1 site description experiments were carried out in a 2 63 ha sub catchment in the kahoku experimental watershed khew on the island of kyushu japan 33 08 n 130 43 e 150 220 m a s l this sub catchment is underlain by crystalline schist and the slopes on both sides of the valley are steep 20 40 the mean annual precipitation in the study area during 2000 2008 was 2183 mm with a rainy season that occurs from mid june to early july the mean annual temperature during 2000 2008 was 15 3 c with a minimum mean monthly temperature of 4 c during january february and a maximum mean monthly temperature of 26 c during august forests in this sub catchment mainly consist of 52 year old as of 2007 japanese cedar stands japanese cypress chamaecyparis obtuse endl stands are also present in the study area ranging in age from 30 to 52 years as of 2007 japanese cedar trees are dominant on the right stream bank whereas japanese cypress and broadleaved tree species cover the left stream bank and compete with the planted conifers see fig 1 in shimizu et al 2015 the understory vegetation comprises various evergreen tree species including quercus glauca thunb castanopsis sieboldii hatsusima ex yamazaki et mashiba and eurya japonica thunb 2 2 meteorological and flux measurements we measured meteorological factors and eddy covariance fluxes using a 52 m over canopy tower at the center of the sub catchment an albedo meter cm14b kipp zonen delft netherlands and two pyrgeometers cg3 kipp zonen were installed at a height of 47 2 m to measure the upward shortwave radiation incident solar radiation r s and upward and downward infrared radiation respectively the net radiation r n was calculated as the total of these four radiation values air temperature t a and relative humidity were measured using two ventilated psychrometers mh 020l eko instruments tokyo japan installed at heights of 42 0 m and 20 0 m respectively precipitation p was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge rt 5 ikeda keiki tokyo japan placed on a waist high bench in an open field approximately 100 m from the watershed discharge q from the sub catchment was also recorded using a weir and float level meter adr 115d ikeda keiki the wetness index wi shimizu et al 2015 in the watershed was defined as wi min q r q max90 0 2 1 where q r is the representative q measured in another sub catchment in the watershed and q max90 is the maximum q r during the past 90 days note that wi was only used for quality control qc for the eddy covariance fluxes see supplementary material soil heat flux g and temperature t 5cm at a

described in the supplementary material in this study flux data within 48 h after a rainfall event were discarded thereby allowing us to understand the canopy transpiration rate e from the dry canopy to validate the proposed svat model the flux data when r s 350 w m 2 and u 0 1 m s 1 or when r s 500 w m 2 and u 1 0 m s 1 were discarded as the model output unreasonably high leaf and soil surface temperatures under low u and high incident radiation conditions the co2 efflux from the soil surface was measured during other observational campaigns at the study site ishizuka et al 2006 tamai 2010 the soil co2 efflux data were averaged over the measurement points which was regarded as the half hourly value of soil respiration r soil μmol m 2 s 1 in the svat model used herein r soil was expressed as a power function given by the following equation 1 r soil r soil 0 q 10 t soil 273 15 10 where r soil 0 and q 10 are the fitted parameters representing r soil at 0 c and the rate of increase when soil surface temperature t soil increased by 10 c respectively parameters r soil 0 and q 10 were estimated to be 0 135 μmol m 2 s 1 and 3 63 respectively table 1 using least squares regression analysis r 2 0 91 ishizuka et al 2006 to avoid overestimating r soil when t soil was high we set the upper limit of r soil as 4 03 μmol m 2 s 1 according to observations made by tamai 2010 2 3 leaf area and leaf level ecophysiology measurements total lai including understory vegetation was measured every month during the study period at three lai observation points in the sub catchment using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor fig 1a we obtained a significantly higher lai at one observation point p 0 001 paired t test fitting an approximate second order fourier curve to the lai

and exhibited minor seasonal variations table 1 we defined april november and december march as the growth and winter periods respectively which corresponded to a significantly higher lai in april november p 0 01 t test fig 1a vertical lai profiles within the canopy were measured at eight heights using 1 5 m intervals along three vertical observation lines using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 on the tower we then obtained the vertical leaf area density a leaf profile which was calculated as the difference in lai between the two nearest neighboring heights divided by the interval fig 2 here we obtained a local minimum point at 10 4 m which was estimated as the understory vegetation height table 1 we assumed that the canopy height h c and lai ratio of japanese cedar to the understory vegetation were 32 0 m and 2 1 respectively leaf level ecophysiological traits were measured nine times from july 2007 to august 2008 using a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6400 li cor the relationship between the net photosynthetic rate a n and intercellular co2 concentrations c i a n c i curve was obtained for the excised shoots of four japanese cedar trees adjacent to the observation tower overall 5 16 shoots including young needle leaves and twigs were selected for each photosynthesis measurement from the upper crowns that were exposed to the sun and within the horizontal reach of a pole pruner from the tower notably we previously confirmed the negligible impact of excision on leaf gas exchange or its simulation miyazawa et al 2017 following the procedure described by miyazawa et al 2011 we then determined the photosynthetic parameters described by farquhar et al 1980 the maximum ribulose bisphosphate rubp carboxylation v cmax rate at 25 c v cmax 25 which was obtained for the sampled shoots by measuring light saturated a n under six co2 concentrations and by regressing a n with c i using the equation in farquhar et al 1980 on a n limited by rubp carboxylase oxygenase rubisco activity in this study the v cmax 25 of japanese cedar was estimated as the value per shoot projected area we assumed that j max 25 1 63v cmax 25 and r d 25 0 056v cmax 25 where j max 25 and r d 25 are the potential rate of whole chain electron transport j max and the dark respiration rate r d at 25 c respectively based on measurements by wullschleger 1993 and this study a second order fourier approximate curve was fitted to the estimated v cmax 25 data yielding v cmax 25 t i 0 2 a i cos irt b i sin irt where t is time days t 1 is july 1 2007 a 0 74 33 a 1 5 896

significantly smaller than during the growth period p 0 01 t test fig 1b the photosynthetic traits of the understory vegetation were measured in three individuals per species i e q glauca ca sieboldii and e japonica and 8 10 current year leaves per individual around the observation tower were sampled every two or three months during the study period gaseous exchange in leaves within the cuvette was measured in situ using a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6400 under light saturation and at 11 cuvette co2 concentrations to obtain the v cmax 25 values although photosynthetic traits are known to change with leaf age escudero and mediavilla 2003 the area ratio of older leaves was much smaller than that of the current year leaves in each individual therefore we assumed that the photosynthetic traits of all leaves were the same as those of the current year leaves in addition we found that the estimated v cmax 25 values were somewhat constant within 20 50 μmol m 2 s 1 regardless of the seasonality or species thus we set the value for the understory vegetation v cmax 25 as 33 0 μmol m 2 s 1 throughout the study period table 1 3 methodology 3 1 svat model description the svat model kumagai et al 2006 2013 used in this study consists of three major sub models fig 3 computational domains for the canopy and atmosphere above it were divided into 50 layers each all of the equations in this model were solved for each layer in the model we updated the sub models for stomatal conductance and daytime respiration rate we also accounted for the clumped conifer foliage a brief description of the modeling scenario used herein and explanations of the new components are provided in the following sub sections cf kumagai et al 2006 2013 3 1 1 radiative transfer and energy balance at leaf and soil levels when considering the leaf scale energy balance and photosynthesis within a forest canopy radiative transfer through the canopy must be determined direct beam and diffuse irradiance must be considered separately owing to their differing attenuations in the canopy the probability of no contact for beam irradiance p b within a canopy layer must be formulated to describe the direct irradiance transfer within the canopy this formulation includes a leaf which is the beam extinction function of the solar elevation and leaf angle distribution within a given layer goudriaan 1977 conifers are generally regarded as having clumped foliage as their needle leaves are organized onto the shoots in this study we incorporated a clumping factor ω in the p b equation by replacing a leaf with ωa leaf where ω is a function of the solar zenith angle ψ campbell and norman 1998 2 ω ψ ω 0 ω 0 1 ω 0 exp 2 2 ψ ω where ω 0 is the clumping factor when looking up out of the canopy toward the zenith ω is given by 3 80 0 46d crown d crown is the ratio of crown depth to crown diameter and is considered to be 1 or 3 34 when ω is less than 1 or greater than 3 34 respectively the probability of no contact for diffuse irradiance p d within the canopy layer was calculated by integrating p b over the solid angles of the sky hemisphere downward and upward longwave radiation r l transfer within the canopy followed the theories of diffuse irradiance transfer it is noteworthy that r l was emitted from any plant body within the canopy both direct and diffuse solar radiation can be further divided into photosynthetic active radiation par and near infrared radiation nir based on their absorptions by leaves approximately half of the r s over the canopy is par while the other half is nir thereby enabling estimates of r s penetration inside the canopy the absorbed par or nir within the canopy layer between z height above the ground and z δz δs is defined by the following equations 3 δ s b 1 p b 1 η ξ s b z δ z 4 δ s d 1 p d 1 η ξ s d z δ z 5 δ s d 1 p d 1 η ξ s d z where η and ξ are the leaf transmissivity and reflectivity respectively for par or nir and s is the par or nir at a given height subscripts b and d denote direct beam and diffuse irradiation respectively and the superscript arrows denote the irradiation direction note that eqs 3 5 are not simple 2 stream radiative transfer models as p b and p d are complex functions of a leaf leaf angle distribution and ω within a given canopy layer and for a given solar geometric direction kumagai et al 2006 the total absorbed solar radiation within the canopy layer was then calculated as the sum of the absorbed par and nir which were calculated using eqs 3 5 sunlit leaves receive the beam as well as upward and downward diffuse radiation whereas shaded leaves only receive upward and downward diffuse radiation therefore irradiance absorption and energy balance must be computed separately for sunlit and shaded leaves kumagai et al 2006 the energy balance at the soil surface used to compute t soil is expressed using the following equation 6 r sab soil r l down 0 ε s σ t soil 4 h soil l e soil g where r sab soil is the total r s absorbed by the soil surface r l down 0 is the downward r l at z 0 ε s is the soil emissivity σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 and h soil and le soil are the sensible and latent heat fluxes at the soil surface respectively h soil and le soil are functions of t soil as described by the products of transport conductance and concentration difference in addition the soil surface moisture availability was used to compute le soil kumagai et al 2006 g is a sinusoidal function of time kumagai et al 2013 3 1 2 leaf level ecophysiological functions the leaf level scalar source strengths i e leaf sensible heat flux h l transpiration rate e l and net photosynthesis rate a l can be obtained from physiological controls using the following equations 7 h l 2 m a c p g ah t l t a 8 e l m w g aw g sw g aw g sw e sat t l e p a 9 a l g ac c a c s 10 a l g sc c s c i where m a and m w are the molecular weights of air and water respectively c p is the specific heat of air at a constant pressure e sat t l and e are the saturated vapor pressure at the leaf temperature t l and atmospheric vapor pressure respectively p a is the atmospheric pressure and c s c a and c i are the co2 concentrations of the air inside and outside the laminar boundary layer of the leaves and within the stomatal cavity respectively g ah g aw and g ac are the boundary layer conductances of heat water vapor and co2 respectively calculated according to the methods described by campbell and norman 1998 g sw and g sc are the stomatal conductances for water vapor and co2 respectively g sw is linked to a l c a and the vapor pressure deficit at the leaf surface d l as proposed by medlyn et al 2011 in the following equation 11 g sw g 0 1 6 1 g 1 d l a l c a where g 0 and g 1 are the parameters representing positive nighttime conductance and a value proportional to γ λ where γ is the co2 compensation point and λ is the marginal water cost of carbon gain respectively g 0 and g 1 were assumed to be 0 01 mol m 2 s 1 and 4 60 kpa0 5 table 1 lin et al 2015 miner et al 2017 g sc was obtained from g sc g sw 1 6 where 1 6 is the ratio of the diffusivities of water and co2 in air von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 a l was computed using the biochemical model of farquhar et al 1980 and collatz et al 1991 as a minimum value of the gross rate of photosynthesis limited by rubisco activity a v the rate of rubp regeneration through electron transport a j and the export rate of synthesized sucrose a s as illustrated by the following equation 12 a l min a v a j a s r l where r l is the respiration rate during the day and nighttime in the absence of photosynthesis r d is suppressed in light compared to a dark scenario due to the kok effect heskel et al 2013 yin et al 2020 thus the r l in the svat model is given by the following equation wohlfahrt et al 2005 13 r l r d 1 1 a kok q p b kok q p where a kok and b kok are parameters set as 0 5 and 2 0 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively and q p μmol m 2 s 1 is the absorbed par per leaf area the formulation and parameterizations of a v a j a s and r d as functions of q p c i and t l were used collatz et al 1991 de pury and farquhar 1997 farquhar and wong 1984 farquhar et al 1980 kumarathunge et al 2019 the photosynthetic model constants were determined according to the findings of previous studies e g badger and collatz 1977 bernacchi et al 2001 2003 de pury and farquhar 1997 farquhar et al 1980 von caemmerer et al 1994 the v cmax and j max values used in these calculations are expressed as non linear functions of temperature using v cmax 25 and j max 25 respectively the formulations of which were described by de pury and farquhar 1997 r d is expressed as a nonlinear function of temperature using r d 25 both j max 25 and r d 25 are practically related to v cmax 25 and v cmax 25 is the key parameter in the leaf photosynthesis model 3 1 3 momentum and scalar transport the momentum scalar continuity and turbulent flux equations were obtained by assuming a steady state planar homogeneous state the turbulent schmidt number for a scalar is unity and a first order turbulent closure scheme was applied using time and horizontal averaging as shown in the following equation 14 0 z k t φ z s φ where k t is the eddy turbulent diffusivity φ is a variable such as wind speed u air temperature t specific humidity q and air co2 concentration c s φ is a source or sink term for φ because of the drag force and mass release or uptake by the ensemble of leaves within the averaging plane which is given by the following equations 15 s u c d a leaf u 2 16 s t 1 ρ c p h l sl a leaf sl h l sh a leaf sh 17 s q 1 ρ e l sl a leaf sl e l sh a leaf sh 18 s c a l sl a leaf sl a l sh a leaf sh where c d is the drag coefficient 0 06 and ρ is the air density to calculate k t we used the mixing length theory of kondo and watanabe 1992 the subscripts sl and sh refer to sunlit and shaded leaves respectively in general first order closure principles are applicable when the production term is balanced by the dissipation term in a scalar flux budget with minimal contributions from gradients in the turbulent flux transport terms which is generally satisfied in the forest canopy studied here manzoni et al 2011 3 2 model computation the svat model used in this study was parameterized using independently collected values from ecophysiological measurements or references and was not calibrated or parameterized using canopy level flux measurements after model validation using the canopy flux measurements the model could examine how seasonal patterns of v cmax 25 and lai fig 1 are generated thereby determining the way in which ecophysiological traits control nee and e in the japanese cedar plantation in this study thus we conducted four types of model simulation as listed in table 2 variability in v cmax 25 due to vertical gradients in the light environment is described by changes in leaf nitrogen per unit area niinements and tenhunen 1997 thus in accordance with leuning et al 1995 we assumed that v cmax 25 at canopy position z can be expressed as decreasing exponentially with cumulative lai ξ z from h c to z as in the following equation 19 v cmax 25 z v cmax 25 h c exp k n ξ z where k n is the attenuation coefficient which is the only calibration parameter used in the svat model it should be noted that v cmax 25 h c denotes the measured v cmax 25 at h c and the temporal variations in v cmax 25 z are assumed to be expressed by variations in v cmax 25 h c in addition temporal variations in a leaf at z were expressed using the following equation 20 a leaf z lai 0 h c a leaf o z d z a leaf o z where a leaf o is the measured a leaf during intense observations fig 2 in order to reproduce the observed nee and e values using the svat model developed herein we used the measured temporal variations in v cmax 25 h c and lai with the calibrated k n control in table 2 control optimized k n to maximize the sum of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for nee and e and was applied separately during the growth period april november and the winter december march as well as for the entire calculation period table 1 summarizes the major parameters used for model validation in addition three numerical experiments cases 1 2 and 3 were conducted using different inputs for v cmax 25 and lai as summarized in table 2 in cases 1 and 2 the fluxes were calculated using the measured temporal variations in v cmax 25 and a constant lai annual maximum during the calculation period and using a constant maximum v cmax 25 and the measured variations in lai respectively case 3 assumed that both v cmax 25 and lai were constant their annual maximum values the seasonal variations in the parameters and constants of the annual maximum values are shown in fig 1 4 results 4 1 environmental data and model validation the daily environmental data for the study period are shown in fig 4 as a typical seasonal pattern of p in the snow free region of japan the monthly p amounts were larger during the summer than during the winter resulting in a substantial seasonal contrast in soil moisture the maximum t a reached 35 c between early august and mid september 2007 and in july 2008 the minimum t a was 5 c in mid february 2008 t a and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit d exhibited seasonal variations d and the daily total r s were low from mid june to mid july in 2008 owing to the regular rainy season in japan we compared the measured nee and e values with the simulated values using the climatic forcing data in fig 4 and the measured temporal variations in v cmax 25 and lai see control in table 2 fig 5 assuming that we could only obtain data for ecophysiological traits during the growing season we also simulated the fluxes using constant v cmax 25 and lai values which were the average values during the growing season and the calibrated k n only during the growing season regardless of the assumptions used in the simulation the svat model successfully reproduced canonical forms of both the nee and e time series throughout the year thereby highlighting the model s ability to synthesize canopy co2 and water vapor transport through stomatal behavior table 3 presents the statistical parameters of the comparisons between the modeled and measured nee and e values for the three simulation assumptions in the control considering k n separately for the growing and winter periods improved the reproducibility of the model notably simulation using the growing season values of v cmax 25 lai and k n had the best reproducibility it is noteworthy that some partial cancellations emerged higher nee and e values during the winter with constant higher v cmax 25 and lai values were likely to be reduced due to higher k n optimized as the growth period value resulting in an apparently good simulation but with impractical processes thus the simulation with temporal variations in v cmax 25 lai and k n determined for the growth period and winter appeared to be more resistant to changes in the simulation scenarios and was adopted as the control table 2 the control model estimated annual nee and e values of 7 516 mg ha 1 of c and 884 2 mm respectively which exhibited overestimations of the eddy flux observed annual nee and e i e 5 626 mg ha 1 of c and 875 1 mm respectively while the simulated fluxes were only obtained from the dry canopy observed fluxes included those from the wet canopy thus these overestimations occurred because the model tended to overestimate fluxes under rainfall conditions it should also be noted that there is an intrinsic difficulty in measuring the eddy covariance fluxes under rainfall and those from the wet canopy 4 2 numerical experiments fig 6 compares the differences in the monthly and daily mean nee values between the control and each case table 2 for the entire canopy japanese cedar and the understory vegetation maintenance of the higher japanese cedar lai case 1 slightly enhanced the productivity of the japanese cedar but reduced that of the understory vegetation by increasing shade produced by the upper canopy this resulted in a small reduction in total ecosystem productivity only an increase in the japanese cedar v cmax 25 case 2 increased the productivity of the japanese cedar particularly from the winter to early summer we found that the experiment with mixed effects of cases 1 and 2 i e case 3 yielded almost the same results as case 2 suggesting that seasonal variations in v cmax 25 are a determining factor for the productivity of japanese cedar and the entire canopy throughfall and stemflow observations at the study site allowed us to estimate canopy interception i c related to concurrent precipitation kumagai et al 2014 shimizu et al 2015 following this we examined how ecosystem water resources including soil moisture and effective precipitation i e p i c sustain forest water use e for each case fig 7 the smallest differences were observed for e between cases including the control in september november and july the water supply to the soil p i c was unable to satisfy the water demands of e however soil moisture was stable and ample throughout the year because the ecosystem s water resources during those months could be retained from previous months this indicates that the ecosystem s water resources cannot be a limiting factor for fluxes at this study site despite slight increases in e in cases 2 and 3 it is worth investigating why the highest v cmax 25 during the growth period was not maintained from winter to early summer when higher productivity occurred even during the winter fig 6b it is logical to assume that leaf nitrogen dynamics could be key for answering this question as v cmax 25 can be related to the nitrogen content per leaf area n leaf niinements and tenhunen 1997 in this study we estimated the ground area based leaf nitrogen usage 0 h c n leaf z a leaf z d z by using the linear relationship between v cmax 25 and n leaf reported by tobita et al 2015 and eqs 19 and 20 fig 8 a we found that maintaining the highest v cmax 25 during the winter led to an overuse of leaf nitrogen in addition we estimated the nitrogen use efficiency nue and water use efficiency wue demonstrating that a constant high v cmax 25 value substantially exacerbated nue but slightly improved wue fig 8b c 5 discussion lai and v cmax 25 are crucial biotic parameters used to simulate canopy level co2 and h2o exchanges in land surface models and must be determined prior to simulation nevertheless very few direct observations of lai and v cmax 25 time series are available for evergreen conifer trees since their evergreen nature allows us to intuitively assume that the seasonal variations in lai and v cmax 25 are small wang et al 2019 luo et al 2019 found that simulated gpp results for evergreen conifer forests were worse when considering the seasonality of lai and v cmax 25 however we inferred that this might be due to underestimation of the satellite derived lai wang et al 2019 demonstrated that considering seasonality was important for lai the corrected satellite derived lai value and v cmax 25 which improved the simulated gpp of evergreen conifer forests to the best of our knowledge direct observations of seasonal lai and v cmax 25 trajectories for japanese cedar forests have not been performed cf miyazawa et al 2017 we obtained minor seasonal variations in lai i e a higher lai during the growth period than in winter with a somewhat constant lai fig 1a this might be explained by the small leaf turnover rate estimated from the long leaf lifespan of the japanese cedar 5 years and the timing of shoot generation during the early growth period according to personal observations in general satellite derived lai data used to drive land surface models for evergreen conifer forests such as the copernicus global land service geov1 lai product baret et al 2013 and the university of toronto s lai product version 2 gonsamo and chen 2014 tend to underestimate lai appreciably during the winter 0 wang et al 2019 successfully corrected satellite derived evergreen conifer forest lai values using leaf lifespan information the lai observation results obtained herein were consistent with these corrections in the studied japanese cedar forest ecosystem even small seasonal variations in lai fig 1a had ecological implications maintaining a higher lai throughout the year has small advantages for japanese cedar trees and large disadvantages for the understory vegetation fig 6 note that not much data is available regarding directly observed evergreen conifer v cmax 25 values cf walker et al 2014 in particular yearlong v cmax 25 data were found only in han et al 2008 and miyazawa et al 2017 we estimated the global trends of evergreen conifer shoot projected area based v cmax 25 from the global leaf ecophysiology dataset walker et al 2014 using previous studies e g bauer et al 2001 bown et al 2007 carswell et al 2005 han et al 2008 manter et al 2005 merilo et al 2006 porté and loustau 1998 tissue et al 2005 this estimate resulted in a value of 88 6 57 6 mean standard deviation μmol m 2 s 1 the v cmax 25 values observed in this study table 1 50 8 98 4 μmol m 2 s 1 were comparable to this global estimate han et al 2008 demonstrated evident seasonal variations in v cmax 25 for pinus densiflora sieb et zucc ranging from 60 μmol m 2 s 1 growing period to 20 μmol m 2 s 1 winter in addition han et al 2003 observed a seasonal trend in v cmax 25 for japanese cedar trees of 63 3 august and 34 4 μmol m 2 s 1 february in contrast miyazawa et al 2017 observed little seasonality in v cmax 25 50 60 μmol m 2 s 1 throughout the year in another japanese cedar plantation indices for the photosynthetic traits of evergreen conifer forests have been documented using satellite e g luo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 or near surface e g bowling et al 2018 seyednasrollah et al 2021 remote sensing data these studies successfully inferred seasonal changes in leaf chlorophyll content and v cmax 25 thus the apparent seasonal variations in v cmax 25 observed in this study fig 1b table 1 are consistent with the general findings regarding seasonal variations in v cmax 25 for evergreen conifers to reproduce the observed seasonal variations in nee and e k n was calibrated to be 0 92 and 0 47 in the growth and winter periods respectively table 1 since we assumed a linear relationship between v cmax 25 and n leaf the photosynthetic nitrogen distribution attenuation coefficient k b in the global meta analysis of hikosaka et al 2016 could be equivalent to k n hikosaka et al 2016 suggested that gpp simulated with a terrestrial carbon flux model is sensitive to k b which ranged from 0 15 to 0 40 for woody species in their meta analysis the k n values estimated in this study were within the range of reported values for crop species i e 0 1 1 2 rather than those of tree species hikosaka et al 2016 farquhar 1989 demonstrated that the maximum photosynthesis rate is proportional to the relative light intensity along the canopy depth to maximize canopy photosynthesis therefore because leaf area density is concentrated in the upper crown of the trees fig 2 the k n values estimated in this study might be higher than the expected values from the quantitative experiments conducted in this study we found that maintaining a high v cmax 25 throughout the year even during the winter led to higher productivity fig 6 however v cmax 25 decreased in the winter fig 1b it was evident that the ecosystem s water resources could not be a limiting factor for vegetation activities at this study site fig 7 then we considered nitrogen availability which often controls net primary productivity e g goll et al 2012 in order to maintain high v cmax 25 values during the winter japanese cedar apparently overused the nitrogen resources and exacerbated the nue with an almost unchanged wue fig 8 it would be more difficult to cover overused nitrogen during the winter as the mineral nitrogen supply from soil organic matter decomposition is insufficient under low temperature conditions e g wieder et al 2013 hence a decrease in v cmax 25 during the winter appears to be necessary for sustaining the forest ecosystem another possibility is that long term acclimation to low temperatures might cause the v cmax 25 values to be lower during the winter han et al 2003 found that xanthophyll rhodoxanthin which plays a photoprotective role during cold acclimation accumulated in cedar needle leaves during the winter inducing reddish brown leaves with reduced v cmax 25 values a reddish brown upper canopy was observed at the study site kumagai et al 2008 from which we inferred that cold acclimation was a major reason for the decreases in v cmax 25 and nee during the winter furthermore han et al 2004 suggested that japanese cedar trees accumulate rhodoxanthin and have decreased electron transport rates and photochemical quenching in sun exposed leaves during the winter but do not accumulate rhodoxanthin or consistent photosynthetic activity in the shaded leaves this also implies that the lower k n during the winter could be due to reduced and maintained photosynthetic activity in the upper and lower shaded parts of the canopy respectively 6 conclusions using a combination of annual eddy covariance fluxes and leaf ecophysiology observations and the multi layer svat model we examined how seasonal variations in v cmax 25 affected canopy co2 and h2o fluxes and ecosystem productivity in a japanese cedar plantation we arrived at conclusions regarding the ecological meaning of the aforementioned seasonal variations in v cmax 25 and its relationship with the reddish brown canopy color canopy color information provides a useful metric for monitoring and modeling photosynthetic activity in global evergreen forests e g bowling et al 2018 seyednasrollah et al 2021 the svat model can consider the effect of the canopy structure and detailed leaf level physiology including vertical profiles within the canopy on the computed outputs hence numerical experiments using the svat model and a simple method to predict v cmax 25 such as canopy color information would allow us to investigate the impacts of forest management on carbon and water cycling e g

24253,recently requests for forest management to conserve water resources and sequester carbon have increased in japan where approximately 27 and 12 of the total land area are covered by forest plantations and japanese cedar cryptomeria japonica d don to formulate better forest management practices that maximize forest functions by maintaining water and carbon cycles an understanding of how leaf level ecophysiological traits influence canopy level co2 and h2o exchanges in japanese cedar plantations is required in this study observations of eddy covariance flux and leaf ecophysiology in a japanese cedar plantation in southern japan indicate that significantly greater productivity and seasonal variations tend to occur in canopy co2 and h2o fluxes with seasonal patterns of photosynthetic traits maximum carboxylation rate normalized at 25 c v cmax 25 and leaf area index lai we also examined how biotic e g v cmax 25 and lai and abiotic e g meteorological variables factors govern canopy fluxes using a multi layer soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model the model validation suggests that seasonal variations in v cmax 25 and lai must be included to reproduce the fluxes observed in the plantation quantitative experiments using the validated svat model indicate that considering cold acclimation during the winter improved the reproducibility of the model with regard to the measured fluxes constant high intra annual lai had the least impact on forest productivity and a consistently high v cmax 25 value increased forest productivity but considerably decreased the nitrogen use efficiency and required a larger nitrogen supply from the ecosystem during the winter these findings highlight the necessity of decreasing photosynthetic ability during the winter which safeguards the ecosystem s nitrogen resources to sustain the productivity of the japanese cedar plantation throughout the year graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eddy covariance soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model canopy photosynthesis canopy transpiration leaf area index net ecosystem carbon exchange data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests cover 70 of the total land area in japan and are mostly located in mountainous regions forest plantations and forests that contain a single conifer species japanese cedar cryptomeria japonica d don cover approximately 27 and 12 of the total land area respectively japan forestry agency 2021 thus japanese forest plantations that are mainly composed of evergreen conifers such as japanese cedar play a substantial role in supplying water resources to lowlands e g momiyama et al 2021 and sequestering large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere egusa et al 2020 estimated that at least 40 tg year 1 of net carbon was taken up by japanese forests of which the presumed contribution of japanese cedar is approximately one fourth of the total uptake recently requests for forest plantation management to control water discharge from the mountains and maximize carbon sequestration have increased japan forestry agency 2021 in addition to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and land use on the anticipated forest functions an improved understanding of the carbon and water cycle processes in japanese cedar plantations is required which can provide strategies for forest plantation management few studies have assessed canopy level co2 and h2o exchanges in japanese cedar plantations by the eddy covariance method which is a prerequisite for assessing forest carbon and water cycle processes saitoh et al 2010 shimizu et al 2015 previous studies have focused on the importance of japanese cedar as a woody material and as a silvicultural species e g ohsumi 2018 further few studies have examined the leaf scale ecophysiology of japanese cedar which is critical for understanding the mechanisms of canopy co2 and h2o exchanges e g han et al 2003 miyazawa et al 2017 the ability to understand existing carbon and water cycling and predict future cycling under a changing environment in japanese cedar plantations has been limited owing to the lack of integrated leaf and canopy scale data for model input and evaluation numerous simple big leaf canopy frameworks have been used to describe co2 and h2o fluxes from the canopy by coupling ecophysiological principles with above canopy aerodynamic transport mechanics which have also been adopted in land surface models e g lawrence et al 2019 sellers et al 1996 however bonan et al 2021 noted the limitations of a big leaf scheme which are caused by ignoring vertical microclimate profiles and leaf physiology in the canopy and suggested the necessity of using a multi layer formulation for the canopies to achieve a thorough understanding of the fluxes e g baldocchi and meyers 1998 katul and albertson 1999 lai et al 2000 in this study a multi layer soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model was parameterized using independently collected leaf level ecophysiological measurements and was not calibrated or parameterized using canopy level flux measurements e g kumagai and kume 2012 kumagai et al 2006 2013 xue et al 2011 the svat model used herein is useful for investigating the effects of meteorological factors and or ecophysiological functions on co2 and h2o exchanges between the forest canopy and the atmosphere although seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits have been considered in svat models to accurately estimate co2 and h2o fluxes e g wilson et al 2001 little attention has been paid to flux simulations in evergreen conifer biomes e g wang et al 2019 moreover evergreen conifers are known to exhibit seasonal photosynthetic traits despite their constant greenness e g bourdeau 1959 recent studies have demonstrated the mechanism by which evergreen conifer trees regulate seasonal photosynthetic activity e g bowling et al 2018 yang et al 2020 bowling et al 2018 and seyednasrollah et al 2021 examined the relationships between gross primary productivity gpp and canopy color associated with leaf pigment to predict seasonal variations in gpp for evergreen conifer forests luo et al 2019 reported that the simulated gpp of evergreen conifers was less accurate after applying the seasonal leaf chlorophyll content constraint considering the seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits wang et al 2019 found that the big leaf scheme in a land surface model could better reproduce eddy covariance measured daily gpp and evapotranspiration values for evergreen conifer forests when considering seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits and leaf area index lai however seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits have rarely been used to constrain land surface models for evergreen conifers thus the observation of seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits lai of evergreen conifers and their application to multi layer svat models should be investigated both locally and globally the primary objective of this study was to investigate how seasonally varying leaf ecophysiology and meteorological factors affect the canopy co2 and h2o fluxes in a japanese cedar plantation the colors of the cedar canopy differ between the winter and the growing season resulting in a higher photosynthetic ability during the growing season e g han and mukai 1999 in this study we addressed three main questions 1 to what degree do photosynthetic traits and lai vary seasonally 2 how large of an impact does seasonality in photosynthetic traits and lai have on canopy flux processes 3 the ecological implications of deciduous behavior are generally related to meteorological seasonality hence what ecological implications underlie seasonal variations in photosynthetic traits and lai in evergreen conifers to address these questions we collected detailed field measurements of leaf scale gas exchange lai and eddy covariance fluxes using these data we analyzed the factors controlling canopy fluxes with a multi layer svat model prior to assessing the impacts of the seasonality of photosynthetic traits and lai on the canopy fluxes the svat model was validated using field measurements collected during one year in a japanese cedar plantation in kyushu japan 2 study site and observations the study site and instruments relevant to the meteorological and flux measurements are described in kumagai et al 2014 and shimizu et al 2015 a review the leaf level ecophysiology measurements and leaf area density profile measurements are provided here for clarity 2 1 site description experiments were carried out in a 2 63 ha sub catchment in the kahoku experimental watershed khew on the island of kyushu japan 33 08 n 130 43 e 150 220 m a s l this sub catchment is underlain by crystalline schist and the slopes on both sides of the valley are steep 20 40 the mean annual precipitation in the study area during 2000 2008 was 2183 mm with a rainy season that occurs from mid june to early july the mean annual temperature during 2000 2008 was 15 3 c with a minimum mean monthly temperature of 4 c during january february and a maximum mean monthly temperature of 26 c during august forests in this sub catchment mainly consist of 52 year old as of 2007 japanese cedar stands japanese cypress chamaecyparis obtuse endl stands are also present in the study area ranging in age from 30 to 52 years as of 2007 japanese cedar trees are dominant on the right stream bank whereas japanese cypress and broadleaved tree species cover the left stream bank and compete with the planted conifers see fig 1 in shimizu et al 2015 the understory vegetation comprises various evergreen tree species including quercus glauca thunb castanopsis sieboldii hatsusima ex yamazaki et mashiba and eurya japonica thunb 2 2 meteorological and flux measurements we measured meteorological factors and eddy covariance fluxes using a 52 m over canopy tower at the center of the sub catchment an albedo meter cm14b kipp zonen delft netherlands and two pyrgeometers cg3 kipp zonen were installed at a height of 47 2 m to measure the upward shortwave radiation incident solar radiation r s and upward and downward infrared radiation respectively the net radiation r n was calculated as the total of these four radiation values air temperature t a and relative humidity were measured using two ventilated psychrometers mh 020l eko instruments tokyo japan installed at heights of 42 0 m and 20 0 m respectively precipitation p was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge rt 5 ikeda keiki tokyo japan placed on a waist high bench in an open field approximately 100 m from the watershed discharge q from the sub catchment was also recorded using a weir and float level meter adr 115d ikeda keiki the wetness index wi shimizu et al 2015 in the watershed was defined as wi min q r q max90 0 2 1 where q r is the representative q measured in another sub catchment in the watershed and q max90 is the maximum q r during the past 90 days note that wi was only used for quality control qc for the eddy covariance fluxes see supplementary material soil heat flux g and temperature t 5cm at a depth of 5 cm were measured near the tower using a heat flux plate hft3 1 rebs seattle wa usa and a thermistor tr 71u t d corp nagano japan that was waterproofed with a polyethylene tube and silicone the volumetric soil moisture contents θ at 10 20 and 40 cm beneath the forest floor were measured using dielectric aquameter sensors ec 10 decagon devices inc pullman wa usa a weighted average of θ in the 0 50 cm soil layer θ 0 50 was calculated as θ 0 50 15θ 10 15θ 20 20θ 40 50 where θ 10 θ 20 and θ 40 are the θ values at depths of 10 20 and 40 cm respectively three dimensional wind speed u and gas co2 and h2o concentration time series data were collected at a height of 51 0 m with a 10 hz sampling frequency using a three dimensional sonic anemo thermometer sat da 600 3t tr 61c kaijo tokyo japan co located with a gas inlet that led to a closed path infrared gas analyzer irga li 7000 li cor lincoln ne usa all variances and covariances required for the eddy covariance flux estimates were computed using a 30 min average interval air samples were obtained using gas inlets at 6 0 11 5 17 3 24 0 31 2 36 5 40 3 and 46 1 m above ground level and co2 concentrations were measured using an irga li 6262 li cor the net ecosystem co2 exchange nee was obtained as the sum of the above canopy co2 flux f c which was obtained using the eddy covariance system above the canopy and the within canopy storage flux s c which was determined by quantifying the rate of change of the co2 concentration in the air column within the canopy i e nee f c s c the qc for the processed flux data was described in the supplementary material in this study flux data within 48 h after a rainfall event were discarded thereby allowing us to understand the canopy transpiration rate e from the dry canopy to validate the proposed svat model the flux data when r s 350 w m 2 and u 0 1 m s 1 or when r s 500 w m 2 and u 1 0 m s 1 were discarded as the model output unreasonably high leaf and soil surface temperatures under low u and high incident radiation conditions the co2 efflux from the soil surface was measured during other observational campaigns at the study site ishizuka et al 2006 tamai 2010 the soil co2 efflux data were averaged over the measurement points which was regarded as the half hourly value of soil respiration r soil μmol m 2 s 1 in the svat model used herein r soil was expressed as a power function given by the following equation 1 r soil r soil 0 q 10 t soil 273 15 10 where r soil 0 and q 10 are the fitted parameters representing r soil at 0 c and the rate of increase when soil surface temperature t soil increased by 10 c respectively parameters r soil 0 and q 10 were estimated to be 0 135 μmol m 2 s 1 and 3 63 respectively table 1 using least squares regression analysis r 2 0 91 ishizuka et al 2006 to avoid overestimating r soil when t soil was high we set the upper limit of r soil as 4 03 μmol m 2 s 1 according to observations made by tamai 2010 2 3 leaf area and leaf level ecophysiology measurements total lai including understory vegetation was measured every month during the study period at three lai observation points in the sub catchment using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor fig 1a we obtained a significantly higher lai at one observation point p 0 001 paired t test fitting an approximate second order fourier curve to the lai

and exhibited minor seasonal variations table 1 we defined april november and december march as the growth and winter periods respectively which corresponded to a significantly higher lai in april november p 0 01 t test fig 1a vertical lai profiles within the canopy were measured at eight heights using 1 5 m intervals along three vertical observation lines using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 on the tower we then obtained the vertical leaf area density a leaf profile which was calculated as the difference in lai between the two nearest neighboring heights divided by the interval fig 2 here we obtained a local minimum point at 10 4 m which was estimated as the understory vegetation height table 1 we assumed that the canopy height h c and lai ratio of japanese cedar to the understory vegetation were 32 0 m and 2 1 respectively leaf level ecophysiological traits were measured nine times from july 2007 to august 2008 using a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6400 li cor the relationship between the net photosynthetic rate a n and intercellular co2 concentrations c i a n c i curve was obtained for the excised shoots of four japanese cedar trees adjacent to the observation tower overall 5 16 shoots including young needle leaves and twigs were selected for each photosynthesis measurement from the upper crowns that were exposed to the sun and within the horizontal reach of a pole pruner from the tower notably we previously confirmed the negligible impact of excision on leaf gas exchange or its simulation miyazawa et al 2017 following the procedure described by miyazawa et al 2011 we then determined the photosynthetic parameters described by farquhar et al 1980 the maximum ribulose bisphosphate rubp carboxylation v cmax rate at 25 c v cmax 25 which was obtained for the sampled shoots by measuring light saturated a n under six co2 concentrations and by regressing a n with c i using the equation in farquhar et al 1980 on a n limited by rubp carboxylase oxygenase rubisco activity in this study the v cmax 25 of japanese cedar was estimated as the value per shoot projected area we assumed that j max 25 1 63v cmax 25 and r d 25 0 056v cmax 25 where j max 25 and r d 25 are the potential rate of whole chain electron transport j max and the dark respiration rate r d at 25 c respectively based on measurements by wullschleger 1993 and this study a second order fourier approximate curve was fitted to the estimated v cmax 25 data yielding v cmax 25 t i 0 2 a i cos irt b i sin irt where t is time days t 1 is july 1 2007 a 0 74 33 a 1 5 896

significantly smaller than during the growth period p 0 01 t test fig 1b the photosynthetic traits of the understory vegetation were measured in three individuals per species i e q glauca ca sieboldii and e japonica and 8 10 current year leaves per individual around the observation tower were sampled every two or three months during the study period gaseous exchange in leaves within the cuvette was measured in situ using a portable photosynthesis measurement system li 6400 under light saturation and at 11 cuvette co2 concentrations to obtain the v cmax 25 values although photosynthetic traits are known to change with leaf age escudero and mediavilla 2003 the area ratio of older leaves was much smaller than that of the current year leaves in each individual therefore we assumed that the photosynthetic traits of all leaves were the same as those of the current year leaves in addition we found that the estimated v cmax 25 values were somewhat constant within 20 50 μmol m 2 s 1 regardless of the seasonality or species thus we set the value for the understory vegetation v cmax 25 as 33 0 μmol m 2 s 1 throughout the study period table 1 3 methodology 3 1 svat model description the svat model kumagai et al 2006 2013 used in this study consists of three major sub models fig 3 computational domains for the canopy and atmosphere above it were divided into 50 layers each all of the equations in this model were solved for each layer in the model we updated the sub models for stomatal conductance and daytime respiration rate we also accounted for the clumped conifer foliage a brief description of the modeling scenario used herein and explanations of the new components are provided in the following sub sections cf kumagai et al 2006 2013 3 1 1 radiative transfer and energy balance at leaf and soil levels when considering the leaf scale energy balance and photosynthesis within a forest canopy radiative transfer through the canopy must be determined direct beam and diffuse irradiance must be considered separately owing to their differing attenuations in the canopy the probability of no contact for beam irradiance p b within a canopy layer must be formulated to describe the direct irradiance transfer within the canopy this formulation includes a leaf which is the beam extinction function of the solar elevation and leaf angle distribution within a given layer goudriaan 1977 conifers are generally regarded as having clumped foliage as their needle leaves are organized onto the shoots in this study we incorporated a clumping factor ω in the p b equation by replacing a leaf with ωa leaf where ω is a function of the solar zenith angle ψ campbell and norman 1998 2 ω ψ ω 0 ω 0 1 ω 0 exp 2 2 ψ ω where ω 0 is the clumping factor when looking up out of the canopy toward the zenith ω is given by 3 80 0 46d crown d crown is the ratio of crown depth to crown diameter and is considered to be 1 or 3 34 when ω is less than 1 or greater than 3 34 respectively the probability of no contact for diffuse irradiance p d within the canopy layer was calculated by integrating p b over the solid angles of the sky hemisphere downward and upward longwave radiation r l transfer within the canopy followed the theories of diffuse irradiance transfer it is noteworthy that r l was emitted from any plant body within the canopy both direct and diffuse solar radiation can be further divided into photosynthetic active radiation par and near infrared radiation nir based on their absorptions by leaves approximately half of the r s over the canopy is par while the other half is nir thereby enabling estimates of r s penetration inside the canopy the absorbed par or nir within the canopy layer between z height above the ground and z δz δs is defined by the following equations 3 δ s b 1 p b 1 η ξ s b z δ z 4 δ s d 1 p d 1 η ξ s d z δ z 5 δ s d 1 p d 1 η ξ s d z where η and ξ are the leaf transmissivity and reflectivity respectively for par or nir and s is the par or nir at a given height subscripts b and d denote direct beam and diffuse irradiation respectively and the superscript arrows denote the irradiation direction note that eqs 3 5 are not simple 2 stream radiative transfer models as p b and p d are complex functions of a leaf leaf angle distribution and ω within a given canopy layer and for a given solar geometric direction kumagai et al 2006 the total absorbed solar radiation within the canopy layer was then calculated as the sum of the absorbed par and nir which were calculated using eqs 3 5 sunlit leaves receive the beam as well as upward and downward diffuse radiation whereas shaded leaves only receive upward and downward diffuse radiation therefore irradiance absorption and energy balance must be computed separately for sunlit and shaded leaves kumagai et al 2006 the energy balance at the soil surface used to compute t soil is expressed using the following equation 6 r sab soil r l down 0 ε s σ t soil 4 h soil l e soil g where r sab soil is the total r s absorbed by the soil surface r l down 0 is the downward r l at z 0 ε s is the soil emissivity σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 and h soil and le soil are the sensible and latent heat fluxes at the soil surface respectively h soil and le soil are functions of t soil as described by the products of transport conductance and concentration difference in addition the soil surface moisture availability was used to compute le soil kumagai et al 2006 g is a sinusoidal function of time kumagai et al 2013 3 1 2 leaf level ecophysiological functions the leaf level scalar source strengths i e leaf sensible heat flux h l transpiration rate e l and net photosynthesis rate a l can be obtained from physiological controls using the following equations 7 h l 2 m a c p g ah t l t a 8 e l m w g aw g sw g aw g sw e sat t l e p a 9 a l g ac c a c s 10 a l g sc c s c i where m a and m w are the molecular weights of air and water respectively c p is the specific heat of air at a constant pressure e sat t l and e are the saturated vapor pressure at the leaf temperature t l and atmospheric vapor pressure respectively p a is the atmospheric pressure and c s c a and c i are the co2 concentrations of the air inside and outside the laminar boundary layer of the leaves and within the stomatal cavity respectively g ah g aw and g ac are the boundary layer conductances of heat water vapor and co2 respectively calculated according to the methods described by campbell and norman 1998 g sw and g sc are the stomatal conductances for water vapor and co2 respectively g sw is linked to a l c a and the vapor pressure deficit at the leaf surface d l as proposed by medlyn et al 2011 in the following equation 11 g sw g 0 1 6 1 g 1 d l a l c a where g 0 and g 1 are the parameters representing positive nighttime conductance and a value proportional to γ λ where γ is the co2 compensation point and λ is the marginal water cost of carbon gain respectively g 0 and g 1 were assumed to be 0 01 mol m 2 s 1 and 4 60 kpa0 5 table 1 lin et al 2015 miner et al 2017 g sc was obtained from g sc g sw 1 6 where 1 6 is the ratio of the diffusivities of water and co2 in air von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 a l was computed using the biochemical model of farquhar et al 1980 and collatz et al 1991 as a minimum value of the gross rate of photosynthesis limited by rubisco activity a v the rate of rubp regeneration through electron transport a j and the export rate of synthesized sucrose a s as illustrated by the following equation 12 a l min a v a j a s r l where r l is the respiration rate during the day and nighttime in the absence of photosynthesis r d is suppressed in light compared to a dark scenario due to the kok effect heskel et al 2013 yin et al 2020 thus the r l in the svat model is given by the following equation wohlfahrt et al 2005 13 r l r d 1 1 a kok q p b kok q p where a kok and b kok are parameters set as 0 5 and 2 0 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively and q p μmol m 2 s 1 is the absorbed par per leaf area the formulation and parameterizations of a v a j a s and r d as functions of q p c i and t l were used collatz et al 1991 de pury and farquhar 1997 farquhar and wong 1984 farquhar et al 1980 kumarathunge et al 2019 the photosynthetic model constants were determined according to the findings of previous studies e g badger and collatz 1977 bernacchi et al 2001 2003 de pury and farquhar 1997 farquhar et al 1980 von caemmerer et al 1994 the v cmax and j max values used in these calculations are expressed as non linear functions of temperature using v cmax 25 and j max 25 respectively the formulations of which were described by de pury and farquhar 1997 r d is expressed as a nonlinear function of temperature using r d 25 both j max 25 and r d 25 are practically related to v cmax 25 and v cmax 25 is the key parameter in the leaf photosynthesis model 3 1 3 momentum and scalar transport the momentum scalar continuity and turbulent flux equations were obtained by assuming a steady state planar homogeneous state the turbulent schmidt number for a scalar is unity and a first order turbulent closure scheme was applied using time and horizontal averaging as shown in the following equation 14 0 z k t φ z s φ where k t is the eddy turbulent diffusivity φ is a variable such as wind speed u air temperature t specific humidity q and air co2 concentration c s φ is a source or sink term for φ because of the drag force and mass release or uptake by the ensemble of leaves within the averaging plane which is given by the following equations 15 s u c d a leaf u 2 16 s t 1 ρ c p h l sl a leaf sl h l sh a leaf sh 17 s q 1 ρ e l sl a leaf sl e l sh a leaf sh 18 s c a l sl a leaf sl a l sh a leaf sh where c d is the drag coefficient 0 06 and ρ is the air density to calculate k t we used the mixing length theory of kondo and watanabe 1992 the subscripts sl and sh refer to sunlit and shaded leaves respectively in general first order closure principles are applicable when the production term is balanced by the dissipation term in a scalar flux budget with minimal contributions from gradients in the turbulent flux transport terms which is generally satisfied in the forest canopy studied here manzoni et al 2011 3 2 model computation the svat model used in this study was parameterized using independently collected values from ecophysiological measurements or references and was not calibrated or parameterized using canopy level flux measurements after model validation using the canopy flux measurements the model could examine how seasonal patterns of v cmax 25 and lai fig 1 are generated thereby determining the way in which ecophysiological traits control nee and e in the japanese cedar plantation in this study thus we conducted four types of model simulation as listed in table 2 variability in v cmax 25 due to vertical gradients in the light environment is described by changes in leaf nitrogen per unit area niinements and tenhunen 1997 thus in accordance with leuning et al 1995 we assumed that v cmax 25 at canopy position z can be expressed as decreasing exponentially with cumulative lai ξ z from h c to z as in the following equation 19 v cmax 25 z v cmax 25 h c exp k n ξ z where k n is the attenuation coefficient which is the only calibration parameter used in the svat model it should be noted that v cmax 25 h c denotes the measured v cmax 25 at h c and the temporal variations in v cmax 25 z are assumed to be expressed by variations in v cmax 25 h c in addition temporal variations in a leaf at z were expressed using the following equation 20 a leaf z lai 0 h c a leaf o z d z a leaf o z where a leaf o is the measured a leaf during intense observations fig 2 in order to reproduce the observed nee and e values using the svat model developed herein we used the measured temporal variations in v cmax 25 h c and lai with the calibrated k n control in table 2 control optimized k n to maximize the sum of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for nee and e and was applied separately during the growth period april november and the winter december march as well as for the entire calculation period table 1 summarizes the major parameters used for model validation in addition three numerical experiments cases 1 2 and 3 were conducted using different inputs for v cmax 25 and lai as summarized in table 2 in cases 1 and 2 the fluxes were calculated using the measured temporal variations in v cmax 25 and a constant lai annual maximum during the calculation period and using a constant maximum v cmax 25 and the measured variations in lai respectively case 3 assumed that both v cmax 25 and lai were constant their annual maximum values the seasonal variations in the parameters and constants of the annual maximum values are shown in fig 1 4 results 4 1 environmental data and model validation the daily environmental data for the study period are shown in fig 4 as a typical seasonal pattern of p in the snow free region of japan the monthly p amounts were larger during the summer than during the winter resulting in a substantial seasonal contrast in soil moisture the maximum t a reached 35 c between early august and mid september 2007 and in july 2008 the minimum t a was 5 c in mid february 2008 t a and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit d exhibited seasonal variations d and the daily total r s were low from mid june to mid july in 2008 owing to the regular rainy season in japan we compared the measured nee and e values with the simulated values using the climatic forcing data in fig 4 and the measured temporal variations in v cmax 25 and lai see control in table 2 fig 5 assuming that we could only obtain data for ecophysiological traits during the growing season we also simulated the fluxes using constant v cmax 25 and lai values which were the average values during the growing season and the calibrated k n only during the growing season regardless of the assumptions used in the simulation the svat model successfully reproduced canonical forms of both the nee and e time series throughout the year thereby highlighting the model s ability to synthesize canopy co2 and water vapor transport through stomatal behavior table 3 presents the statistical parameters of the comparisons between the modeled and measured nee and e values for the three simulation assumptions in the control considering k n separately for the growing and winter periods improved the reproducibility of the model notably simulation using the growing season values of v cmax 25 lai and k n had the best reproducibility it is noteworthy that some partial cancellations emerged higher nee and e values during the winter with constant higher v cmax 25 and lai values were likely to be reduced due to higher k n optimized as the growth period value resulting in an apparently good simulation but with impractical processes thus the simulation with temporal variations in v cmax 25 lai and k n determined for the growth period and winter appeared to be more resistant to changes in the simulation scenarios and was adopted as the control table 2 the control model estimated annual nee and e values of 7 516 mg ha 1 of c and 884 2 mm respectively which exhibited overestimations of the eddy flux observed annual nee and e i e 5 626 mg ha 1 of c and 875 1 mm respectively while the simulated fluxes were only obtained from the dry canopy observed fluxes included those from the wet canopy thus these overestimations occurred because the model tended to overestimate fluxes under rainfall conditions it should also be noted that there is an intrinsic difficulty in measuring the eddy covariance fluxes under rainfall and those from the wet canopy 4 2 numerical experiments fig 6 compares the differences in the monthly and daily mean nee values between the control and each case table 2 for the entire canopy japanese cedar and the understory vegetation maintenance of the higher japanese cedar lai case 1 slightly enhanced the productivity of the japanese cedar but reduced that of the understory vegetation by increasing shade produced by the upper canopy this resulted in a small reduction in total ecosystem productivity only an increase in the japanese cedar v cmax 25 case 2 increased the productivity of the japanese cedar particularly from the winter to early summer we found that the experiment with mixed effects of cases 1 and 2 i e case 3 yielded almost the same results as case 2 suggesting that seasonal variations in v cmax 25 are a determining factor for the productivity of japanese cedar and the entire canopy throughfall and stemflow observations at the study site allowed us to estimate canopy interception i c related to concurrent precipitation kumagai et al 2014 shimizu et al 2015 following this we examined how ecosystem water resources including soil moisture and effective precipitation i e p i c sustain forest water use e for each case fig 7 the smallest differences were observed for e between cases including the control in september november and july the water supply to the soil p i c was unable to satisfy the water demands of e however soil moisture was stable and ample throughout the year because the ecosystem s water resources during those months could be retained from previous months this indicates that the ecosystem s water resources cannot be a limiting factor for fluxes at this study site despite slight increases in e in cases 2 and 3 it is worth investigating why the highest v cmax 25 during the growth period was not maintained from winter to early summer when higher productivity occurred even during the winter fig 6b it is logical to assume that leaf nitrogen dynamics could be key for answering this question as v cmax 25 can be related to the nitrogen content per leaf area n leaf niinements and tenhunen 1997 in this study we estimated the ground area based leaf nitrogen usage 0 h c n leaf z a leaf z d z by using the linear relationship between v cmax 25 and n leaf reported by tobita et al 2015 and eqs 19 and 20 fig 8 a we found that maintaining the highest v cmax 25 during the winter led to an overuse of leaf nitrogen in addition we estimated the nitrogen use efficiency nue and water use efficiency wue demonstrating that a constant high v cmax 25 value substantially exacerbated nue but slightly improved wue fig 8b c 5 discussion lai and v cmax 25 are crucial biotic parameters used to simulate canopy level co2 and h2o exchanges in land surface models and must be determined prior to simulation nevertheless very few direct observations of lai and v cmax 25 time series are available for evergreen conifer trees since their evergreen nature allows us to intuitively assume that the seasonal variations in lai and v cmax 25 are small wang et al 2019 luo et al 2019 found that simulated gpp results for evergreen conifer forests were worse when considering the seasonality of lai and v cmax 25 however we inferred that this might be due to underestimation of the satellite derived lai wang et al 2019 demonstrated that considering seasonality was important for lai the corrected satellite derived lai value and v cmax 25 which improved the simulated gpp of evergreen conifer forests to the best of our knowledge direct observations of seasonal lai and v cmax 25 trajectories for japanese cedar forests have not been performed cf miyazawa et al 2017 we obtained minor seasonal variations in lai i e a higher lai during the growth period than in winter with a somewhat constant lai fig 1a this might be explained by the small leaf turnover rate estimated from the long leaf lifespan of the japanese cedar 5 years and the timing of shoot generation during the early growth period according to personal observations in general satellite derived lai data used to drive land surface models for evergreen conifer forests such as the copernicus global land service geov1 lai product baret et al 2013 and the university of toronto s lai product version 2 gonsamo and chen 2014 tend to underestimate lai appreciably during the winter 0 wang et al 2019 successfully corrected satellite derived evergreen conifer forest lai values using leaf lifespan information the lai observation results obtained herein were consistent with these corrections in the studied japanese cedar forest ecosystem even small seasonal variations in lai fig 1a had ecological implications maintaining a higher lai throughout the year has small advantages for japanese cedar trees and large disadvantages for the understory vegetation fig 6 note that not much data is available regarding directly observed evergreen conifer v cmax 25 values cf walker et al 2014 in particular yearlong v cmax 25 data were found only in han et al 2008 and miyazawa et al 2017 we estimated the global trends of evergreen conifer shoot projected area based v cmax 25 from the global leaf ecophysiology dataset walker et al 2014 using previous studies e g bauer et al 2001 bown et al 2007 carswell et al 2005 han et al 2008 manter et al 2005 merilo et al 2006 porté and loustau 1998 tissue et al 2005 this estimate resulted in a value of 88 6 57 6 mean standard deviation μmol m 2 s 1 the v cmax 25 values observed in this study table 1 50 8 98 4 μmol m 2 s 1 were comparable to this global estimate han et al 2008 demonstrated evident seasonal variations in v cmax 25 for pinus densiflora sieb et zucc ranging from 60 μmol m 2 s 1 growing period to 20 μmol m 2 s 1 winter in addition han et al 2003 observed a seasonal trend in v cmax 25 for japanese cedar trees of 63 3 august and 34 4 μmol m 2 s 1 february in contrast miyazawa et al 2017 observed little seasonality in v cmax 25 50 60 μmol m 2 s 1 throughout the year in another japanese cedar plantation indices for the photosynthetic traits of evergreen conifer forests have been documented using satellite e g luo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 or near surface e g bowling et al 2018 seyednasrollah et al 2021 remote sensing data these studies successfully inferred seasonal changes in leaf chlorophyll content and v cmax 25 thus the apparent seasonal variations in v cmax 25 observed in this study fig 1b table 1 are consistent with the general findings regarding seasonal variations in v cmax 25 for evergreen conifers to reproduce the observed seasonal variations in nee and e k n was calibrated to be 0 92 and 0 47 in the growth and winter periods respectively table 1 since we assumed a linear relationship between v cmax 25 and n leaf the photosynthetic nitrogen distribution attenuation coefficient k b in the global meta analysis of hikosaka et al 2016 could be equivalent to k n hikosaka et al 2016 suggested that gpp simulated with a terrestrial carbon flux model is sensitive to k b which ranged from 0 15 to 0 40 for woody species in their meta analysis the k n values estimated in this study were within the range of reported values for crop species i e 0 1 1 2 rather than those of tree species hikosaka et al 2016 farquhar 1989 demonstrated that the maximum photosynthesis rate is proportional to the relative light intensity along the canopy depth to maximize canopy photosynthesis therefore because leaf area density is concentrated in the upper crown of the trees fig 2 the k n values estimated in this study might be higher than the expected values from the quantitative experiments conducted in this study we found that maintaining a high v cmax 25 throughout the year even during the winter led to higher productivity fig 6 however v cmax 25 decreased in the winter fig 1b it was evident that the ecosystem s water resources could not be a limiting factor for vegetation activities at this study site fig 7 then we considered nitrogen availability which often controls net primary productivity e g goll et al 2012 in order to maintain high v cmax 25 values during the winter japanese cedar apparently overused the nitrogen resources and exacerbated the nue with an almost unchanged wue fig 8 it would be more difficult to cover overused nitrogen during the winter as the mineral nitrogen supply from soil organic matter decomposition is insufficient under low temperature conditions e g wieder et al 2013 hence a decrease in v cmax 25 during the winter appears to be necessary for sustaining the forest ecosystem another possibility is that long term acclimation to low temperatures might cause the v cmax 25 values to be lower during the winter han et al 2003 found that xanthophyll rhodoxanthin which plays a photoprotective role during cold acclimation accumulated in cedar needle leaves during the winter inducing reddish brown leaves with reduced v cmax 25 values a reddish brown upper canopy was observed at the study site kumagai et al 2008 from which we inferred that cold acclimation was a major reason for the decreases in v cmax 25 and nee during the winter furthermore han et al 2004 suggested that japanese cedar trees accumulate rhodoxanthin and have decreased electron transport rates and photochemical quenching in sun exposed leaves during the winter but do not accumulate rhodoxanthin or consistent photosynthetic activity in the shaded leaves this also implies that the lower k n during the winter could be due to reduced and maintained photosynthetic activity in the upper and lower shaded parts of the canopy respectively 6 conclusions using a combination of annual eddy covariance fluxes and leaf ecophysiology observations and the multi layer svat model we examined how seasonal variations in v cmax 25 affected canopy co2 and h2o fluxes and ecosystem productivity in a japanese cedar plantation we arrived at conclusions regarding the ecological meaning of the aforementioned seasonal variations in v cmax 25 and its relationship with the reddish brown canopy color canopy color information provides a useful metric for monitoring and modeling photosynthetic activity in global evergreen forests e g bowling et al 2018 seyednasrollah et al 2021 the svat model can consider the effect of the canopy structure and detailed leaf level physiology including vertical profiles within the canopy on the computed outputs hence numerical experiments using the svat model and a simple method to predict v cmax 25 such as canopy color information would allow us to investigate the impacts of forest management on carbon and water cycling e g

24254,cyanobacterial blooms are becoming more frequent in freshwater sources causing concern throughout the world cyanobacterial blooms affect human health and the entire environment numerical modeling is an effective tool for investigating aquatic systems in this study a 3d hydrodynamic and water quality ecological model was used to simulate eutrophication of a drinking water source lake vomb in sweden under present and future scenarios the hydrodynamic model was set up in mike 3 fm software based on meteorological hydrological and water quality data the hydrodynamic model performance was satisfactory in terms of the water temperature simulation with root mean square error rmse ranging from 0 38 to 1 2 c in the ecological model chlorophyll a chl a was used as a proxy for cyanobacteria and the model proved acceptable in simulating the chl a concentrations with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 93 and 0 87 for calibration and validation respectively the findings revealed that external nitrogen loading and internal phosphorus loading had significant impact on the nutrient concentrations in lake vomb the findings also showed a correlation between chl a levels and total phosphorus levels in the lake to simulate future water quality in the lake two representative concentration pathways rcp for the year 2050 were used to make projections for changes in air temperature and precipitation under the projected future climate the simulations showed a considerable rise in cyanobacteria biomass independent of the changes in external nutrient loading the model findings can assist water managers in planning mitigation strategies by identifying major nutrient sources keywords blue green algae chlorophyll a climate change hydrodynamic model nutrient loading process based modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacteria often called blue green algae are microscopic organisms that can form dense slimy and sometimes toxic blooms in the aquatic environments huisman et al 2018 the release of cyanotoxins has the potential to endanger the ecosystem as well as the human health toxin production by cyanobacterial blooms varies in space and time huisman et al 2018 some toxins are released into the water after cell death however some cyanobacteria species release toxins without cell death or rupture some toxins can harm the liver while others can be lethal such as anatoxin a which causes death via neural damage within minutes méjean et al 2014 cyanobacteria thrive in environments where light water and nutrients mostly nitrogen and phosphorus are abundant chorus and welker 2021 cyanobacterial blooms in lakes are associated with the overgrowth under eutrophication with high nutrient loadings into water bodies conley et al 2009 these blooms can form immediately at the surface and cover large areas of the water body and are most common in the upper layers where light is accessible for photosynthesis but may form deeper inside the water column as well huisman et al 2018 these blooms are increasing both in frequency and magnitude across the globe and pose challenges to freshwater systems ranging from aesthetics to serious human health risks huisman et al 2018 cyanobacterial blooms are known to be positively correlated to the total phosphorus tp levels in water bodies and therefore phosphorus is often the limiting factor for growth xie et al 2011 li et al 2018 payen et al 2021 excess tp in freshwater is linked to agricultural and urban growth paerl and barnard 2020 and is caused by for example manure in grazing grounds and fertilizer use in agricultural fields motew et al 2017 as well as effluents from wastewater treatment facilities comber et al 2015 over time tp accumulates in lake sediments and can be resuspended and mixed in the water column this process is usually referred to as internal loading on the other hand nitrogen can be a co limiting factor for algal growth some cyanobacteria species can fix atmospheric nitrogen allowing them to grow even when nitrogen levels are low in the water li et al 2018 chorus and welker 2021 in addition to nitrogen fixation cyanobacteria can uptake inorganic nitrogen in from the water column for growth similar to tp high in levels in water bodies originate from anthropogenic activities such as the use of fertilizers in agriculture wastewater effluents or nitrogen oxides emissions from industrial development erisman et al 2013 deterioration of swedish waters due to eutrophication has been investigated since the second half of the 20th century willén 1972 and phytoplankton has been considered an important water quality variable since 1964 willén 2001 the investigations were mainly focused on large lakes e g lake mälaren and lake vättern near highly populated areas the knowledge of phytoplankton before 1965 was limited thus these investigation projects were vital for assessment and future comparison the blue green algae were noticed to predominate in 1969 1970 in lake mälaren corresponding to extremely hot summers willén 1972 reports of early sight of algal blooms were even found in the 1940s in lake ringsjön with the first known algal poisoning in 1968 cronberg et al 1999 over time cyanobacteria biomass were increasing even in nutrient poor lakes under global warming in their study of many nutrient poor lakes in southern sweden freeman et al 2020 found a relative increase in cyanobacteria biomass of 21 between the years 1998 2013 climate change effects have been globally seen in higher air temperatures severe precipitation events and altered hydrological cycles taranu et al 2015 meerhoff et al 2022 cyanobacterial proliferation can be affected by climate change in both direct and indirect ways warmer climate conditions result in increase in surface water temperature piccolroaz et al 2020 that can directly accelerate in lake biochemical processes and in turn increase phytoplankton biomass thomas et al 2017 climate change can also influence nutrient loading by altering the hydrological and nutrient cycles affecting algal growth meerhoff et al 2022 kakouei et al 2021 studied the impacts of changes in climate and land use on over 1500 lakes in europe and north america and concluded that cyanobacteria abundance is expected to increase with the increase in temperature and radiation with a decrease in wind speed and forest areas under urbanization in sweden both the average precipitation and air temperature are projected to increase under climate change scenarios jiménez navarro et al 2021 modeling of cyanobacteria has a long history dating back to the early 20th century when scientists first began studying these organisms in detail in the 1950s and 1960s researchers developed simple models to understand the basic biology and ecology of cyanobacteria these models focused on the role of cyanobacteria in nutrient cycling and the factors that influence their growth and distribution in the 1980s and 1990s advances in computer technology and computational biology allowed for the development of more complex models that took into account a wider range of biological processes and environmental factors and were used to better understand the role of cyanobacteria in ecosystems and to predict their responses to environmental changes guven and howard 2006 process based modeling of aquatic ecosystems simulates the interaction between the complex physical biological and chemical processes anagnostou et al 2017 models vary intrinsically in their formulae level of detail simplicity and applicability however all eutrophication models include the fate and transport of nutrients dissolved oxygen dynamics and temperature dependency of their processes anagnostou et al 2017 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 multiple eutrophication modeling studies e g elliott et al 2007 markensten et al 2010 trolle et al 2011 elliott and defew 2012 tasnim et al 2021 utilized chlorophyll a chl a as a proxy for cyanobacteria biomass in lakes and rivers since chl a is an indication of all phytoplankton species many models predict total phytoplankton biomass with the premise that cyanobacteria dominate the growth vinçon leite and casenave 2019 several studies have investigated the effects of climate change on algal blooms e g markensten et al 2010 trolle et al 2011 yindong et al 2021 trolle et al 2011 in their study area in new zealand found that future warmer air temperature can impact eutrophication equivalent to increasing external nutrient loading by up to 50 although predicted climate change impacts vary in magnitude and duration most of the models predict more intense blooming under future warming conditions yindong et al 2021 the goal of this study was to apply a hydrodynamic and water quality model to investigate mixing dynamics in lake nutrient dynamics and cyanobacterial bloom developments under present and future conditions in a drinking water source lake vomb in sweden the results of this study benefit the safety of the local drinking water supply and are useful for other temperate and eutrophic lakes a 3d hydrodynamic model of the lake was created using mike 3 fm powered by dhi and calibrated to describe the water temperature distribution in the lake then a 3d ecological model was calibrated to simulate chl a as a surrogate for cyanobacteria in the lake the research questions that this study addresses are how accurate can a 3d model with an intermediate level of detail describe eutrophication conditions what are the driving forces of algal blooms in lake vomb how will the future changes in temperature and precipitation affect the future algal blooms in lake vomb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake vomb 55 41 n 13 35 e is a freshwater lake in scania sweden s southernmost region fig 1 lake vomb has a surface area of around 12 km2 and an average depth of 6 6 m with a maximum depth of 16 m the lake serves as a drinking water source to approximately 350 000 people in malmö parts of lund and other parts of scania lake vomb is located in kävlingeån s catchment with agriculture as the dominating land use and has three main tributaries namely björkaån torpsbäcken and borstbäcken the water quality in the lake suffers from heavy nutrient loading through runoff from agricultural lands as well as wastewater effluents bergion et al 2018 li et al 2018 chuquimia et al 2019 as a result heavy algal blooms have been observed in the lake for decades with cyanobacteria frequently dominating the algal blooms li et al 2018 the most common species of cyanobacteria are microcystis spp johansson et al 2019 2 2 model input data the model was set up and calibrated on the year 2019 baseline and validated on the year 2020 the data required to set up the model included water temperature measurements used for calibration and validation lake bathymetry data provided by sydvatten ab hydrological and water quality data for the tributaries and meteorological conditions the hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated using the water temperature data from the lake profile monitoring program at lake vomb by sydvatten ab the data were measured at six locations fig 1 in the lake with 1 m vertical resolution from the surface to the bottom of the lake the temporal resolution of the data varied with season from almost no data in winter to ten monitoring occasions per month in summer the hydrological data for the three tributaries to the lake björkaån torpsbäcken and borstbäcken were daily time series of discharge and water temperature downloaded from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi modeled data webpage https vattenwebb smhi se modelarea for the years 2019 and 2020 the water level at the lake outlet was used as a boundary condition and the data were obtained from the reports of kävlingeån s water council for the years 2019 and 2020 ekologigruppen ekoplan ab 2020 2021 a constant extraction of 1 m3 s was included in the model to account for the water withdrawal for drinking water production the meteorological data used in the model were downloaded from smhi for the years 2019 and 2020 the data for precipitation were obtained with daily resolution from the vomb station reference number 53410 the data for wind speed and direction air temperature and relative humidity were obtained with hourly resolution from the hörby a station 53530 which is located around 20 5 kms north of lake vomb furthermore the data for hourly shortwave radiation were obtained from the lund station 53445 which is approximately 23 kms west of the lake and hourly longwave radiation data were only accessible at the växjö station 64565 which is more than 100 kms north the future projections for air temperature and precipitation were downloaded from smhi s advanced climate change scenario service https www smhi se en climate future climate advanced climate change scenario service met skane lan medeltemperatur rcp45 2041 2070 year anom for scania county for the period between 2041 2070 in the form of seasonal changes compared to a reference period 1971 2000 the year 2050 was chosen as the target year under two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the rcps depict scenarios for climate modeling and are labelled after possible future total solar radiative forcing by the year 2100 resulting from greenhouse gas emission rcp4 5 4 5 w m2 is a moderate scenario in which emissions peak around the year 2040 and subsequently drop while the highest emissions scenario rcp8 5 8 5 w m2 assumes emissions will continue to rise throughout the century as a result climate change under rcp8 5 is expected to be more severe than under rcp4 5 we limit the future projections in this study to air temperature and precipitation in addition to the data utilized for the baseline year 2019 the historical records of air temperature were obtained for numerous sites in scania county i e smhi stations 52230 53300 53430 53530 54230 54290 62030 and 62040 to cover as much of the county s geographical expanse as possible these data were used to calculate seasonal average temperatures in the periods 1971 2000 and 2015 2019 the five year period was deemed more representative than the single year 2019 to adjust the expected changes reported by smhi with the changes that had already occurred up until 2019 likewise the historical records for precipitation were obtained from smhi stations 52230 53260 53290 53320 53410 53500 53540 54290 62120 and 63080 and the changes in seasonal average precipitation in mm month projected by smhi were then adjusted with the changes that had previously occurred between the reference period 1971 2000 and 2015 2019 the expected changes in 2050 were then expressed as a percentage increase over the baseline year 2019 to create input data for the year 2050 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the data series for air temperature and precipitation of the year 2019 were adjusted with projected seasonal changes as shown in section 1 in the supplementary document the water quality data were downloaded from the reports produced by kävlingeån s water council kävlingeåns vattenråd for the years 2019 and 2020 ekologigruppen ekoplan ab 2020 2021 and from the database of the swedish university of agricultural sciences slu for lakes and watercourses https miljodata slu se mvm the following data were extracted and combined from both datasets biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 tp and dissolved oxygen do in the three tributaries björkaån torpsbäcken and borstbäcken the water quality data were available from april to december in both the calibration year 2019 and validation year 2020 the temporal resolution of the data was approximately monthly therefore linear interpolation was conducted to deduce daily concentrations of all the variables the model simulations were compared to the observation data for these variables except for bod due to unavailability at one location in the lake the data were downloaded from slu in the surface and bottom layer chl a measurements were only available from slu for the surface layer at the same location in the lake slu uses a spectrophotometer in accordance with swedish standards ss 22028146 all other variables were measured by slu or kävlingen s water council in accordance with swedish european standards ekologigruppen ekoplan ab 2020 2021 the modeling results for chl a were compared to additional measurements from satellite sentinel 3 data provided by dicyano project partner brockmann geomatics sweden ab sentinel 3a and 3b are observation satellites within the copernicus program launched on 16 february 2016 and 25 april 2018 respectively chl a levels in the surface water were extracted from all available images during 2016 2021 and used for the comparison with respective simulated years all estimates were calculated as a mean of all valid e g cloud free pixels 9 at maximum centered on the predefined station coordinate the pixels are 300 300 m in size 2 3 model description mike 3 fm powered by dhi https www mikepoweredbydhi com products mike 21 3 was used in this study for hydrodynamic and water quality modeling mike 3 fm is based on the flexible mesh approach which employs a cell centered finite volume method to solve the navier stokes equation for incompressible fluids in its reynolds averaged form the module s governing equations are the shallow water equations which are simplified navier stokes equations the computational mesh for lake vomb was created using the point elevations of the lake s bottom the mesh was composed of 536 nodes and 935 triangular mesh elements with areas ranging from 2150 to 30 839 m2 vertically the lake was divided into 16 layers two of which were set up using sigma coordinates upper 1 m of the lake and the others of 1 m height each using cartesian z coordinates the water density in the model was defined as a function of temperature bed resistance roughness height and wind friction coefficient were set to model default values of 0 05 m and 0 00125 respectively the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosities were simulated using smagorinsky and k epsilon formulations respectively using model default settings heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere was included in the model and contained latent heat sensible heat short and long wave radiation as well as atmospheric conditions for air temperature and relative humidity the hydrodynamic simulations spanned the period january december of each year whereas the water quality simulations covered april december due to data availability the initial conditions of water level water temperature and the water quality state variables were set to match the measurements in the lake on the corresponding simulation start dates the water quality model was adapted by modifying the mike 21 3 wq with nutrients and chlorophyll a template in the eco lab module the template included the interdependent state variables bod do tp in and chl a the model equations applied similar principles to other models such as accounting for light and temperature dependency the key distinction between the model equations and other models is that the stoichiometry of the photosynthetic process is used to calculate chl a growth rather than an empirical growth parameter the full set of model equations and the calibrated parameter values can be found in the supplementary document section 2 the following is a brief overview of the main processes in eco lab each state variable is affected by the advection dispersion and is also defined by an ordinary differential equation that models its rate of change under the applicable processes the scaled eddy viscosity formulation was used to apply the dispersion in the model the horizontal scaled constant was set to 1 for all the variables whereas the vertical constant was 0 1 except for do which was calibrated to 0 001 in the selected template chl a production is modeled proportional to the net daily oxygen production the template was modified from default to include phosphorus release from sediment internal loading and temperature dependency of chl a growth to characterize the nutrient constraints for development the michaelis menten equation with half saturation constants were utilized to account for the temperature effect the arrhenius formula was used the in cycle in the model was simulated in terms of nh4 no2 and no3 components and included the yield from bod decay uptake by plants and bacteria nitrification and denitrification processes the tp cycle included the yield from bod decay uptake by plants and bacteria and sediment release the tp sediment release mechanism was included as temperature dependent and the effect of bottom layer do levels on the release was accounted for by multiplying by the inverse of michaelis menten formula lastly the do variable included the net photosynthetic oxygen production reaeration with the atmosphere nitrification bod decay and sediment oxygen demand the net photosynthetic oxygen production is computed by subtracting phytoplankton respiration from light dependent photosynthesis in this study the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients were utilized as statistical performance metrics the standard deviation of the prediction errors is represented by the rmse eq 1 the nse eq 2 computes a dimensionless number in the range 1 where nse 1 indicates a perfect match nse 0 indicates that the model performance is equivalent to assuming the mean actual value and nse 0 indicates that the model fails to perform better than simply assuming the mean value 1 r m s e i n p r e d i c t i o n i a c t u a l i 2 n 2 n s e 1 i n p r e d i c t i o n i a c t u a l i 2 i n a c t u a l i m e a

heat exchange parameters namely light extinction coefficient heating coefficient and cooling coefficient were adjusted and the final values were 0 45 1 m 0 009 and 0 009 respectively the model was then validated using the water temperature data of the year 2020 the simulated and measured water temperature time series for the six sites can be found in the interactive supplementary figures t1 to t6 the simulated water temperatures from the model were retrieved to compare with the available data from the six observation sites and the rmse and nse were determined for each depth at each site the modeling results of water temperature for the calibration year 2019 demonstrated close agreement at all measurement locations table 1 similarly the modeling results for water temperature for the validation year 2020 were in fair agreement with the measured data except for several instances when bottom layer temperature was underestimated the simulations of water temperatures indicated that the lake mixes continuously throughout the year during the summer season particularly during the first three weeks of june the temperature gradient with depth occasionally resembled stratification conditions at the lake s deepest point site 2 supplementary figure t2 but the gradient was not strong enough less than 1 c m to be classified as thermal stratification similar to the hydrodynamic model the water quality model was calibrated using the observations of the year 2019 to determine the model parameters and the model was then validated using the data of the year 2020 among all the modeled water quality variables the simulated in had the best agreement with the measurements table 1 fig 2 the high seasonal variability of surface in concentrations found in both model results and measured data fig 2 clearly demonstrates the influence of nitrogen provided by the external loading in the spring the tributaries discharge a significant load of in which is reduced during the summer in contrast the input from the tributaries was shown to have minimal impact on the peak in tp concentrations in autumn 2019 and the major contributor to tp was found to be the internal loading the sediment release rate of tp at 20 c was calibrated to 20 5 mg m2 d and varied with temperature and do content the addition of the do influence on the sediment release of tp enhanced model performance since tp concentrations were seen to increase following incidences of decreased bottom do concentrations fig 2 the statistical measures table 1 and the visual assessment of the findings fig 2 showed that the model follows the overall trend of tp the modeling results for surface do showed general agreement with the observations but failed to reflect fine local fluctuations in the surface do levels and instead fell within the season s average but the modeling results for the bottom layer showed better agreement with observations table 1 fig 2 it was critical that the model captures the events of low do bottom concentrations e g end of july and start of august 2019 fig 2 in order to accurately apply their impact on the sediment release of tp lastly the simulated concentrations of surface do were seen to be negatively correlated to chl a chl a simulations were in agreement with the general pattern of observations from slu table 1 fig 3 however the satellite deduced chl a levels suggested high variability in the summer blooms fig 3 the mortality and settling rates and the growth temperature coefficient of chl a were calibrated to account for the link between tp and chl a the nutrient limitation function in the model was adjusted the nutrient limitation function was calibrated to also reduce the nitrogen limitation on chl a growth chl a concentrations in the lake increased during late spring and peaked at late summer with concentrations more than 20 μ g l fig 3 3 2 effects of climate change on the lake the simulated future scenarios showed a rise in water temperature that was proportional to the expected air temperature the simulated water temperature time series at the deepest section of the lake site 2 can be found in supplementary figure t7 in 2050 the average annual rise in water temperature was 0 665 c under rcp4 5 and 1 043 c under rcp8 5 scenarios relative to the baseline scenario summer autumn and winter changes were more dramatic than spring changes table 2 the days with a substantial water temperature gradient in the baseline simulation exhibited a stronger gradient in the future scenarios section 3 supplementary document increased lake water temperatures accelerated the temperature dependent water quality processes in the model in comparison to the baseline year 2019 chl a surface levels under climate change scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 increased in all seasons and this increase was most pronounced in fall and winter table 2 fig 4 this increase in chl a levels was caused by the increase in tp together with the increased water temperature similarly tp levels increased over the summer autumn and winter fig 4 this was a direct effect of the lake s internal loading mechanism which is temperature dependent in contrast the concentrations of in and do decreased under both scenarios fig 4 this was expected since the in levels of the baseline year were strongly controlled by external loading thus the higher temperature accelerated the nitrogen processes e g denitrification while the external loading remained unchanged 4 discussion mike 3 fm was used in this study to model the hydrodynamics and ecological conditions of the eutrophic lake vomb the model was created and calibrated for the year 2019 and validated on the year 2020 the model performance was satisfactory in representing all state variables table 1 to investigate the impact of projected changes in air temperature and precipitation for the year 2050 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were chosen as medium and severe scenario respectively for simplicity other input to the model e g solar radiation wind and relative humidity remained unchanged between scenarios the future scenarios showed a projected increase in cyanobacteria biomass table 2 throughout the baseline year 2019 the simulated and measured water temperature indicated no obvious thermal stratification conditions in lake vomb i e the temperature gradient in the water column was always less than 1 c m to investigate this behavior the mixing depth was calculated using the empirical equation 10 0 185 log a 0 842 2 37 1 05 where a is the lake surface area in km2 qin et al 2020 the lake s mixing depth was estimated to be 8 2 m which is more than the lake s average depth of 6 6 m explaining the lake s unlikelihood of stable thermal stratification in the future scenarios the projected rise in air temperature caused an increase in water temperature however precipitation had essentially little effect on simulated water temperature interestingly the increase in water temperature was rather uniform across the water column with a similar shape of the temperature profiles to the ones from the baseline year 2019 this was mostly due to the solar radiation and wind conditions which were kept the same in the model for the future scenarios as in the baseline however water temperature changes were not uniform in the summer season and future projections appeared to favor larger thermal gradients using observed solar radiation conditions improved the simulation of the lake hydrodynamics the errors in the simulated temperatures can stem from the manual calibration of the multivariate model parameters li et al 2017 as well as uncertainty in meteorological data due to errors in measurements or the absence of some data in the lake s immediate vicinity the modeling results for tp showed that when only external phosphorus loading was considered the tp levels in the lake were significantly lower than those observed the internal loading mechanism improved the model performance and allowed the model to reproduce the autumn tp peaks fig 2 this finding is consistent with the findings of qin et al 2020 who showed that shallow and medium lakes have considerable interaction between the sediments and water column influencing nutrient dynamics the release of tp from sediments was modeled as temperature dependent according to the findings of several studies redshaw et al 1990 wu et al 2014 consequently under warmer future conditions higher tp levels were projected fig 4 this increase can be expected since warmer temperatures affect phosphorus adsorption to sediments cornelissen et al 1997 and enhance the exchange with the overlaying layers additionally the inclusion of do impact on the release mechanism slightly improved tp simulations furthermore for simplicity and data availability this study employed tp as the limiting nutrient of cyanobacteria while this method is commonly employed in research trolle et al 2008 chen et al 2013 huang et al 2015 cui et al 2016 using tp remains a simplification since only a fraction of tp e g soluble reactive phosphate is available for cyanobacteria uptake chorus and welker 2021 in contrast to tp the in levels in the lake were shown to be controlled by the mass flow from the tributaries rendering in lake nitrogen generation insignificant the lake receives elevated nitrogen loading over the winter to early spring as seen in the two modeled years 2019 and 2020 fig 2 the model results showed exceptional agreement with observed in for both the surface and bottom layers in the lake table 1 to account for the capacity of cyanobacteria to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere the effect of in limitation on the chl a growth process in the model was lessened thus chl a levels in the lake were observed to rise even when overall nitrogen concentrations decreased given an increase in tp the model findings demonstrated that chl a levels are positively correlated with tp this is consistent with previous research studies that emphasize phosphorus as the most significant limiting nutrient xie et al 2011 schindler et al 2016 li et al 2018 payen et al 2021 according to sensitivity analysis tp internal loading had the major impact on chl a levels section 4 supplementary document on the other hand chl a was also noticed to be negatively correlated with in fig 2 and fig 3 but this was attributed to the seasonal variation of in mass flow from the tributaries under future conditions the biomass of cyanobacteria represented by chl a concentration was shown to increase even without any increase of nutrient loadings from the catchment higher chl a concentrations were found in all seasons because of increased lake temperatures as well as the increase in tp content in the lake from internal loading because of the lower chl a levels in winter and autumn in the baseline scenario the relative seasonal rise in chl a was more pronounced in these seasons compared to spring and summer table 2 in general this projected increase was consistent with other research on the influence of climate change on cyanobacterial proliferation in another part of sweden markensten et al 2010 new zealand trolle et al 2011 and china yindong et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to model nutrients and cyanobacteria conditions in lake vomb moreover this study reports a further development of water quality modeling focusing on the release of phosphorus from sediments to improve the simulation of the internal loading the next step would be to collect data on resuspension of phosphorus from sediments furthermore the lack of water quality data prevented extending the model outside of the simulated periods the sources of uncertainty in the model are the accuracy of the water quality measurements the manual calibration method used in this work as well as the relative simplicity of the water quality module in further work modules that include zooplankton different phytoplankton groups and other variables e g iron silica phosphorus fractions can be tested to expand and enhance the model the current model can assist water managers to plan mitigation strategies for the lake the model can also be coupled with a hydrological water quality model of the catchment making it possible to examine socioeconomic projections by simulating future nutrient loading scenarios finally while ecological models are typically developed using area specific parameterization anagnostou et al 2017 the major findings of this model agreed with those of other models from different regions indicating a wider applicability of the model following proper calibration 5 conclusions a 3d hydrodynamic and eutrophication model was used in this study to reproduce algal blooms in lake vomb seen in the baseline year 2019 as well as to estimate eutrophication conditions in the year 2050 under two climate change scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the hydrodynamic model was shown to be effective in recreating lake water temperature the model showed that lake vomb did not undergo stratification in 2019 whereas future scenarios predicted stronger vertical gradients in water temperature the eutrophication model was adapted by modeling nutrients dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand processes cyanobacteria were successfully modeled in the lake represented by chlorophyll a the model suggested that nitrogen levels in the lake were highly driven by external loading but phosphorus levels in the lake were heavily impacted by internal loading via sediment release according to future water quality predictions chlorophyll a level is expected to rise up to 12 under warmer temperature conditions regardless of external nutrient loading finally uncertainties in the model range from the simplified description of processes to data availability and assumptions this was the initial eutrophication model in lake vomb and therefore requires further improvement nonetheless the findings show that if no preventive management measures are taken the lake will be susceptible to increasing harmful algal blooms in the future credit authorship

24254,cyanobacterial blooms are becoming more frequent in freshwater sources causing concern throughout the world cyanobacterial blooms affect human health and the entire environment numerical modeling is an effective tool for investigating aquatic systems in this study a 3d hydrodynamic and water quality ecological model was used to simulate eutrophication of a drinking water source lake vomb in sweden under present and future scenarios the hydrodynamic model was set up in mike 3 fm software based on meteorological hydrological and water quality data the hydrodynamic model performance was satisfactory in terms of the water temperature simulation with root mean square error rmse ranging from 0 38 to 1 2 c in the ecological model chlorophyll a chl a was used as a proxy for cyanobacteria and the model proved acceptable in simulating the chl a concentrations with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 93 and 0 87 for calibration and validation respectively the findings revealed that external nitrogen loading and internal phosphorus loading had significant impact on the nutrient concentrations in lake vomb the findings also showed a correlation between chl a levels and total phosphorus levels in the lake to simulate future water quality in the lake two representative concentration pathways rcp for the year 2050 were used to make projections for changes in air temperature and precipitation under the projected future climate the simulations showed a considerable rise in cyanobacteria biomass independent of the changes in external nutrient loading the model findings can assist water managers in planning mitigation strategies by identifying major nutrient sources keywords blue green algae chlorophyll a climate change hydrodynamic model nutrient loading process based modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacteria often called blue green algae are microscopic organisms that can form dense slimy and sometimes toxic blooms in the aquatic environments huisman et al 2018 the release of cyanotoxins has the potential to endanger the ecosystem as well as the human health toxin production by cyanobacterial blooms varies in space and time huisman et al 2018 some toxins are released into the water after cell death however some cyanobacteria species release toxins without cell death or rupture some toxins can harm the liver while others can be lethal such as anatoxin a which causes death via neural damage within minutes méjean et al 2014 cyanobacteria thrive in environments where light water and nutrients mostly nitrogen and phosphorus are abundant chorus and welker 2021 cyanobacterial blooms in lakes are associated with the overgrowth under eutrophication with high nutrient loadings into water bodies conley et al 2009 these blooms can form immediately at the surface and cover large areas of the water body and are most common in the upper layers where light is accessible for photosynthesis but may form deeper inside the water column as well huisman et al 2018 these blooms are increasing both in frequency and magnitude across the globe and pose challenges to freshwater systems ranging from aesthetics to serious human health risks huisman et al 2018 cyanobacterial blooms are known to be positively correlated to the total phosphorus tp levels in water bodies and therefore phosphorus is often the limiting factor for growth xie et al 2011 li et al 2018 payen et al 2021 excess tp in freshwater is linked to agricultural and urban growth paerl and barnard 2020 and is caused by for example manure in grazing grounds and fertilizer use in agricultural fields motew et al 2017 as well as effluents from wastewater treatment facilities comber et al 2015 over time tp accumulates in lake sediments and can be resuspended and mixed in the water column this process is usually referred to as internal loading on the other hand nitrogen can be a co limiting factor for algal growth some cyanobacteria species can fix atmospheric nitrogen allowing them to grow even when nitrogen levels are low in the water li et al 2018 chorus and welker 2021 in addition to nitrogen fixation cyanobacteria can uptake inorganic nitrogen in from the water column for growth similar to tp high in levels in water bodies originate from anthropogenic activities such as the use of fertilizers in agriculture wastewater effluents or nitrogen oxides emissions from industrial development erisman et al 2013 deterioration of swedish waters due to eutrophication has been investigated since the second half of the 20th century willén 1972 and phytoplankton has been considered an important water quality variable since 1964 willén 2001 the investigations were mainly focused on large lakes e g lake mälaren and lake vättern near highly populated areas the knowledge of phytoplankton before 1965 was limited thus these investigation projects were vital for assessment and future comparison the blue green algae were noticed to predominate in 1969 1970 in lake mälaren corresponding to extremely hot summers willén 1972 reports of early sight of algal blooms were even found in the 1940s in lake ringsjön with the first known algal poisoning in 1968 cronberg et al 1999 over time cyanobacteria biomass were increasing even in nutrient poor lakes under global warming in their study of many nutrient poor lakes in southern sweden freeman et al 2020 found a relative increase in cyanobacteria biomass of 21 between the years 1998 2013 climate change effects have been globally seen in higher air temperatures severe precipitation events and altered hydrological cycles taranu et al 2015 meerhoff et al 2022 cyanobacterial proliferation can be affected by climate change in both direct and indirect ways warmer climate conditions result in increase in surface water temperature piccolroaz et al 2020 that can directly accelerate in lake biochemical processes and in turn increase phytoplankton biomass thomas et al 2017 climate change can also influence nutrient loading by altering the hydrological and nutrient cycles affecting algal growth meerhoff et al 2022 kakouei et al 2021 studied the impacts of changes in climate and land use on over 1500 lakes in europe and north america and concluded that cyanobacteria abundance is expected to increase with the increase in temperature and radiation with a decrease in wind speed and forest areas under urbanization in sweden both the average precipitation and air temperature are projected to increase under climate change scenarios jiménez navarro et al 2021 modeling of cyanobacteria has a long history dating back to the early 20th century when scientists first began studying these organisms in detail in the 1950s and 1960s researchers developed simple models to understand the basic biology and ecology of cyanobacteria these models focused on the role of cyanobacteria in nutrient cycling and the factors that influence their growth and distribution in the 1980s and 1990s advances in computer technology and computational biology allowed for the development of more complex models that took into account a wider range of biological processes and environmental factors and were used to better understand the role of cyanobacteria in ecosystems and to predict their responses to environmental changes guven and howard 2006 process based modeling of aquatic ecosystems simulates the interaction between the complex physical biological and chemical processes anagnostou et al 2017 models vary intrinsically in their formulae level of detail simplicity and applicability however all eutrophication models include the fate and transport of nutrients dissolved oxygen dynamics and temperature dependency of their processes anagnostou et al 2017 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 multiple eutrophication modeling studies e g elliott et al 2007 markensten et al 2010 trolle et al 2011 elliott and defew 2012 tasnim et al 2021 utilized chlorophyll a chl a as a proxy for cyanobacteria biomass in lakes and rivers since chl a is an indication of all phytoplankton species many models predict total phytoplankton biomass with the premise that cyanobacteria dominate the growth vinçon leite and casenave 2019 several studies have investigated the effects of climate change on algal blooms e g markensten et al 2010 trolle et al 2011 yindong et al 2021 trolle et al 2011 in their study area in new zealand found that future warmer air temperature can impact eutrophication equivalent to increasing external nutrient loading by up to 50 although predicted climate change impacts vary in magnitude and duration most of the models predict more intense blooming under future warming conditions yindong et al 2021 the goal of this study was to apply a hydrodynamic and water quality model to investigate mixing dynamics in lake nutrient dynamics and cyanobacterial bloom developments under present and future conditions in a drinking water source lake vomb in sweden the results of this study benefit the safety of the local drinking water supply and are useful for other temperate and eutrophic lakes a 3d hydrodynamic model of the lake was created using mike 3 fm powered by dhi and calibrated to describe the water temperature distribution in the lake then a 3d ecological model was calibrated to simulate chl a as a surrogate for cyanobacteria in the lake the research questions that this study addresses are how accurate can a 3d model with an intermediate level of detail describe eutrophication conditions what are the driving forces of algal blooms in lake vomb how will the future changes in temperature and precipitation affect the future algal blooms in lake vomb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake vomb 55 41 n 13 35 e is a freshwater lake in scania sweden s southernmost region fig 1 lake vomb has a surface area of around 12 km2 and an average depth of 6 6 m with a maximum depth of 16 m the lake serves as a drinking water source to approximately 350 000 people in malmö parts of lund and other parts of scania lake vomb is located in kävlingeån s catchment with agriculture as the dominating land use and has three main tributaries namely björkaån torpsbäcken and borstbäcken the water quality in the lake suffers from heavy nutrient loading through runoff from agricultural lands as well as wastewater effluents bergion et al 2018 li et al 2018 chuquimia et al 2019 as a result heavy algal blooms have been observed in the lake for decades with cyanobacteria frequently dominating the algal blooms li et al 2018 the most common species of cyanobacteria are microcystis spp johansson et al 2019 2 2 model input data the model was set up and calibrated on the year 2019 baseline and validated on the year 2020 the data required to set up the model included water temperature measurements used for calibration and validation lake bathymetry data provided by sydvatten ab hydrological and water quality data for the tributaries and meteorological conditions the hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated using the water temperature data from the lake profile monitoring program at lake vomb by sydvatten ab the data were measured at six locations fig 1 in the lake with 1 m vertical resolution from the surface to the bottom of the lake the temporal resolution of the data varied with season from almost no data in winter to ten monitoring occasions per month in summer the hydrological data for the three tributaries to the lake björkaån torpsbäcken and borstbäcken were daily time series of discharge and water temperature downloaded from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi modeled data webpage https vattenwebb smhi se modelarea for the years 2019 and 2020 the water level at the lake outlet was used as a boundary condition and the data were obtained from the reports of kävlingeån s water council for the years 2019 and 2020 ekologigruppen ekoplan ab 2020 2021 a constant extraction of 1 m3 s was included in the model to account for the water withdrawal for drinking water production the meteorological data used in the model were downloaded from smhi for the years 2019 and 2020 the data for precipitation were obtained with daily resolution from the vomb station reference number 53410 the data for wind speed and direction air temperature and relative humidity were obtained with hourly resolution from the hörby a station 53530 which is located around 20 5 kms north of lake vomb furthermore the data for hourly shortwave radiation were obtained from the lund station 53445 which is approximately 23 kms west of the lake and hourly longwave radiation data were only accessible at the växjö station 64565 which is more than 100 kms north the future projections for air temperature and precipitation were downloaded from smhi s advanced climate change scenario service https www smhi se en climate future climate advanced climate change scenario service met skane lan medeltemperatur rcp45 2041 2070 year anom for scania county for the period between 2041 2070 in the form of seasonal changes compared to a reference period 1971 2000 the year 2050 was chosen as the target year under two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the rcps depict scenarios for climate modeling and are labelled after possible future total solar radiative forcing by the year 2100 resulting from greenhouse gas emission rcp4 5 4 5 w m2 is a moderate scenario in which emissions peak around the year 2040 and subsequently drop while the highest emissions scenario rcp8 5 8 5 w m2 assumes emissions will continue to rise throughout the century as a result climate change under rcp8 5 is expected to be more severe than under rcp4 5 we limit the future projections in this study to air temperature and precipitation in addition to the data utilized for the baseline year 2019 the historical records of air temperature were obtained for numerous sites in scania county i e smhi stations 52230 53300 53430 53530 54230 54290 62030 and 62040 to cover as much of the county s geographical expanse as possible these data were used to calculate seasonal average temperatures in the periods 1971 2000 and 2015 2019 the five year period was deemed more representative than the single year 2019 to adjust the expected changes reported by smhi with the changes that had already occurred up until 2019 likewise the historical records for precipitation were obtained from smhi stations 52230 53260 53290 53320 53410 53500 53540 54290 62120 and 63080 and the changes in seasonal average precipitation in mm month projected by smhi were then adjusted with the changes that had previously occurred between the reference period 1971 2000 and 2015 2019 the expected changes in 2050 were then expressed as a percentage increase over the baseline year 2019 to create input data for the year 2050 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the data series for air temperature and precipitation of the year 2019 were adjusted with projected seasonal changes as shown in section 1 in the supplementary document the water quality data were downloaded from the reports produced by kävlingeån s water council kävlingeåns vattenråd for the years 2019 and 2020 ekologigruppen ekoplan ab 2020 2021 and from the database of the swedish university of agricultural sciences slu for lakes and watercourses https miljodata slu se mvm the following data were extracted and combined from both datasets biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 tp and dissolved oxygen do in the three tributaries björkaån torpsbäcken and borstbäcken the water quality data were available from april to december in both the calibration year 2019 and validation year 2020 the temporal resolution of the data was approximately monthly therefore linear interpolation was conducted to deduce daily concentrations of all the variables the model simulations were compared to the observation data for these variables except for bod due to unavailability at one location in the lake the data were downloaded from slu in the surface and bottom layer chl a measurements were only available from slu for the surface layer at the same location in the lake slu uses a spectrophotometer in accordance with swedish standards ss 22028146 all other variables were measured by slu or kävlingen s water council in accordance with swedish european standards ekologigruppen ekoplan ab 2020 2021 the modeling results for chl a were compared to additional measurements from satellite sentinel 3 data provided by dicyano project partner brockmann geomatics sweden ab sentinel 3a and 3b are observation satellites within the copernicus program launched on 16 february 2016 and 25 april 2018 respectively chl a levels in the surface water were extracted from all available images during 2016 2021 and used for the comparison with respective simulated years all estimates were calculated as a mean of all valid e g cloud free pixels 9 at maximum centered on the predefined station coordinate the pixels are 300 300 m in size 2 3 model description mike 3 fm powered by dhi https www mikepoweredbydhi com products mike 21 3 was used in this study for hydrodynamic and water quality modeling mike 3 fm is based on the flexible mesh approach which employs a cell centered finite volume method to solve the navier stokes equation for incompressible fluids in its reynolds averaged form the module s governing equations are the shallow water equations which are simplified navier stokes equations the computational mesh for lake vomb was created using the point elevations of the lake s bottom the mesh was composed of 536 nodes and 935 triangular mesh elements with areas ranging from 2150 to 30 839 m2 vertically the lake was divided into 16 layers two of which were set up using sigma coordinates upper 1 m of the lake and the others of 1 m height each using cartesian z coordinates the water density in the model was defined as a function of temperature bed resistance roughness height and wind friction coefficient were set to model default values of 0 05 m and 0 00125 respectively the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosities were simulated using smagorinsky and k epsilon formulations respectively using model default settings heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere was included in the model and contained latent heat sensible heat short and long wave radiation as well as atmospheric conditions for air temperature and relative humidity the hydrodynamic simulations spanned the period january december of each year whereas the water quality simulations covered april december due to data availability the initial conditions of water level water temperature and the water quality state variables were set to match the measurements in the lake on the corresponding simulation start dates the water quality model was adapted by modifying the mike 21 3 wq with nutrients and chlorophyll a template in the eco lab module the template included the interdependent state variables bod do tp in and chl a the model equations applied similar principles to other models such as accounting for light and temperature dependency the key distinction between the model equations and other models is that the stoichiometry of the photosynthetic process is used to calculate chl a growth rather than an empirical growth parameter the full set of model equations and the calibrated parameter values can be found in the supplementary document section 2 the following is a brief overview of the main processes in eco lab each state variable is affected by the advection dispersion and is also defined by an ordinary differential equation that models its rate of change under the applicable processes the scaled eddy viscosity formulation was used to apply the dispersion in the model the horizontal scaled constant was set to 1 for all the variables whereas the vertical constant was 0 1 except for do which was calibrated to 0 001 in the selected template chl a production is modeled proportional to the net daily oxygen production the template was modified from default to include phosphorus release from sediment internal loading and temperature dependency of chl a growth to characterize the nutrient constraints for development the michaelis menten equation with half saturation constants were utilized to account for the temperature effect the arrhenius formula was used the in cycle in the model was simulated in terms of nh4 no2 and no3 components and included the yield from bod decay uptake by plants and bacteria nitrification and denitrification processes the tp cycle included the yield from bod decay uptake by plants and bacteria and sediment release the tp sediment release mechanism was included as temperature dependent and the effect of bottom layer do levels on the release was accounted for by multiplying by the inverse of michaelis menten formula lastly the do variable included the net photosynthetic oxygen production reaeration with the atmosphere nitrification bod decay and sediment oxygen demand the net photosynthetic oxygen production is computed by subtracting phytoplankton respiration from light dependent photosynthesis in this study the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients were utilized as statistical performance metrics the standard deviation of the prediction errors is represented by the rmse eq 1 the nse eq 2 computes a dimensionless number in the range 1 where nse 1 indicates a perfect match nse 0 indicates that the model performance is equivalent to assuming the mean actual value and nse 0 indicates that the model fails to perform better than simply assuming the mean value 1 r m s e i n p r e d i c t i o n i a c t u a l i 2 n 2 n s e 1 i n p r e d i c t i o n i a c t u a l i 2 i n a c t u a l i m e a

heat exchange parameters namely light extinction coefficient heating coefficient and cooling coefficient were adjusted and the final values were 0 45 1 m 0 009 and 0 009 respectively the model was then validated using the water temperature data of the year 2020 the simulated and measured water temperature time series for the six sites can be found in the interactive supplementary figures t1 to t6 the simulated water temperatures from the model were retrieved to compare with the available data from the six observation sites and the rmse and nse were determined for each depth at each site the modeling results of water temperature for the calibration year 2019 demonstrated close agreement at all measurement locations table 1 similarly the modeling results for water temperature for the validation year 2020 were in fair agreement with the measured data except for several instances when bottom layer temperature was underestimated the simulations of water temperatures indicated that the lake mixes continuously throughout the year during the summer season particularly during the first three weeks of june the temperature gradient with depth occasionally resembled stratification conditions at the lake s deepest point site 2 supplementary figure t2 but the gradient was not strong enough less than 1 c m to be classified as thermal stratification similar to the hydrodynamic model the water quality model was calibrated using the observations of the year 2019 to determine the model parameters and the model was then validated using the data of the year 2020 among all the modeled water quality variables the simulated in had the best agreement with the measurements table 1 fig 2 the high seasonal variability of surface in concentrations found in both model results and measured data fig 2 clearly demonstrates the influence of nitrogen provided by the external loading in the spring the tributaries discharge a significant load of in which is reduced during the summer in contrast the input from the tributaries was shown to have minimal impact on the peak in tp concentrations in autumn 2019 and the major contributor to tp was found to be the internal loading the sediment release rate of tp at 20 c was calibrated to 20 5 mg m2 d and varied with temperature and do content the addition of the do influence on the sediment release of tp enhanced model performance since tp concentrations were seen to increase following incidences of decreased bottom do concentrations fig 2 the statistical measures table 1 and the visual assessment of the findings fig 2 showed that the model follows the overall trend of tp the modeling results for surface do showed general agreement with the observations but failed to reflect fine local fluctuations in the surface do levels and instead fell within the season s average but the modeling results for the bottom layer showed better agreement with observations table 1 fig 2 it was critical that the model captures the events of low do bottom concentrations e g end of july and start of august 2019 fig 2 in order to accurately apply their impact on the sediment release of tp lastly the simulated concentrations of surface do were seen to be negatively correlated to chl a chl a simulations were in agreement with the general pattern of observations from slu table 1 fig 3 however the satellite deduced chl a levels suggested high variability in the summer blooms fig 3 the mortality and settling rates and the growth temperature coefficient of chl a were calibrated to account for the link between tp and chl a the nutrient limitation function in the model was adjusted the nutrient limitation function was calibrated to also reduce the nitrogen limitation on chl a growth chl a concentrations in the lake increased during late spring and peaked at late summer with concentrations more than 20 μ g l fig 3 3 2 effects of climate change on the lake the simulated future scenarios showed a rise in water temperature that was proportional to the expected air temperature the simulated water temperature time series at the deepest section of the lake site 2 can be found in supplementary figure t7 in 2050 the average annual rise in water temperature was 0 665 c under rcp4 5 and 1 043 c under rcp8 5 scenarios relative to the baseline scenario summer autumn and winter changes were more dramatic than spring changes table 2 the days with a substantial water temperature gradient in the baseline simulation exhibited a stronger gradient in the future scenarios section 3 supplementary document increased lake water temperatures accelerated the temperature dependent water quality processes in the model in comparison to the baseline year 2019 chl a surface levels under climate change scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 increased in all seasons and this increase was most pronounced in fall and winter table 2 fig 4 this increase in chl a levels was caused by the increase in tp together with the increased water temperature similarly tp levels increased over the summer autumn and winter fig 4 this was a direct effect of the lake s internal loading mechanism which is temperature dependent in contrast the concentrations of in and do decreased under both scenarios fig 4 this was expected since the in levels of the baseline year were strongly controlled by external loading thus the higher temperature accelerated the nitrogen processes e g denitrification while the external loading remained unchanged 4 discussion mike 3 fm was used in this study to model the hydrodynamics and ecological conditions of the eutrophic lake vomb the model was created and calibrated for the year 2019 and validated on the year 2020 the model performance was satisfactory in representing all state variables table 1 to investigate the impact of projected changes in air temperature and precipitation for the year 2050 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were chosen as medium and severe scenario respectively for simplicity other input to the model e g solar radiation wind and relative humidity remained unchanged between scenarios the future scenarios showed a projected increase in cyanobacteria biomass table 2 throughout the baseline year 2019 the simulated and measured water temperature indicated no obvious thermal stratification conditions in lake vomb i e the temperature gradient in the water column was always less than 1 c m to investigate this behavior the mixing depth was calculated using the empirical equation 10 0 185 log a 0 842 2 37 1 05 where a is the lake surface area in km2 qin et al 2020 the lake s mixing depth was estimated to be 8 2 m which is more than the lake s average depth of 6 6 m explaining the lake s unlikelihood of stable thermal stratification in the future scenarios the projected rise in air temperature caused an increase in water temperature however precipitation had essentially little effect on simulated water temperature interestingly the increase in water temperature was rather uniform across the water column with a similar shape of the temperature profiles to the ones from the baseline year 2019 this was mostly due to the solar radiation and wind conditions which were kept the same in the model for the future scenarios as in the baseline however water temperature changes were not uniform in the summer season and future projections appeared to favor larger thermal gradients using observed solar radiation conditions improved the simulation of the lake hydrodynamics the errors in the simulated temperatures can stem from the manual calibration of the multivariate model parameters li et al 2017 as well as uncertainty in meteorological data due to errors in measurements or the absence of some data in the lake s immediate vicinity the modeling results for tp showed that when only external phosphorus loading was considered the tp levels in the lake were significantly lower than those observed the internal loading mechanism improved the model performance and allowed the model to reproduce the autumn tp peaks fig 2 this finding is consistent with the findings of qin et al 2020 who showed that shallow and medium lakes have considerable interaction between the sediments and water column influencing nutrient dynamics the release of tp from sediments was modeled as temperature dependent according to the findings of several studies redshaw et al 1990 wu et al 2014 consequently under warmer future conditions higher tp levels were projected fig 4 this increase can be expected since warmer temperatures affect phosphorus adsorption to sediments cornelissen et al 1997 and enhance the exchange with the overlaying layers additionally the inclusion of do impact on the release mechanism slightly improved tp simulations furthermore for simplicity and data availability this study employed tp as the limiting nutrient of cyanobacteria while this method is commonly employed in research trolle et al 2008 chen et al 2013 huang et al 2015 cui et al 2016 using tp remains a simplification since only a fraction of tp e g soluble reactive phosphate is available for cyanobacteria uptake chorus and welker 2021 in contrast to tp the in levels in the lake were shown to be controlled by the mass flow from the tributaries rendering in lake nitrogen generation insignificant the lake receives elevated nitrogen loading over the winter to early spring as seen in the two modeled years 2019 and 2020 fig 2 the model results showed exceptional agreement with observed in for both the surface and bottom layers in the lake table 1 to account for the capacity of cyanobacteria to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere the effect of in limitation on the chl a growth process in the model was lessened thus chl a levels in the lake were observed to rise even when overall nitrogen concentrations decreased given an increase in tp the model findings demonstrated that chl a levels are positively correlated with tp this is consistent with previous research studies that emphasize phosphorus as the most significant limiting nutrient xie et al 2011 schindler et al 2016 li et al 2018 payen et al 2021 according to sensitivity analysis tp internal loading had the major impact on chl a levels section 4 supplementary document on the other hand chl a was also noticed to be negatively correlated with in fig 2 and fig 3 but this was attributed to the seasonal variation of in mass flow from the tributaries under future conditions the biomass of cyanobacteria represented by chl a concentration was shown to increase even without any increase of nutrient loadings from the catchment higher chl a concentrations were found in all seasons because of increased lake temperatures as well as the increase in tp content in the lake from internal loading because of the lower chl a levels in winter and autumn in the baseline scenario the relative seasonal rise in chl a was more pronounced in these seasons compared to spring and summer table 2 in general this projected increase was consistent with other research on the influence of climate change on cyanobacterial proliferation in another part of sweden markensten et al 2010 new zealand trolle et al 2011 and china yindong et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to model nutrients and cyanobacteria conditions in lake vomb moreover this study reports a further development of water quality modeling focusing on the release of phosphorus from sediments to improve the simulation of the internal loading the next step would be to collect data on resuspension of phosphorus from sediments furthermore the lack of water quality data prevented extending the model outside of the simulated periods the sources of uncertainty in the model are the accuracy of the water quality measurements the manual calibration method used in this work as well as the relative simplicity of the water quality module in further work modules that include zooplankton different phytoplankton groups and other variables e g iron silica phosphorus fractions can be tested to expand and enhance the model the current model can assist water managers to plan mitigation strategies for the lake the model can also be coupled with a hydrological water quality model of the catchment making it possible to examine socioeconomic projections by simulating future nutrient loading scenarios finally while ecological models are typically developed using area specific parameterization anagnostou et al 2017 the major findings of this model agreed with those of other models from different regions indicating a wider applicability of the model following proper calibration 5 conclusions a 3d hydrodynamic and eutrophication model was used in this study to reproduce algal blooms in lake vomb seen in the baseline year 2019 as well as to estimate eutrophication conditions in the year 2050 under two climate change scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the hydrodynamic model was shown to be effective in recreating lake water temperature the model showed that lake vomb did not undergo stratification in 2019 whereas future scenarios predicted stronger vertical gradients in water temperature the eutrophication model was adapted by modeling nutrients dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand processes cyanobacteria were successfully modeled in the lake represented by chlorophyll a the model suggested that nitrogen levels in the lake were highly driven by external loading but phosphorus levels in the lake were heavily impacted by internal loading via sediment release according to future water quality predictions chlorophyll a level is expected to rise up to 12 under warmer temperature conditions regardless of external nutrient loading finally uncertainties in the model range from the simplified description of processes to data availability and assumptions this was the initial eutrophication model in lake vomb and therefore requires further improvement nonetheless the findings show that if no preventive management measures are taken the lake will be susceptible to increasing harmful algal blooms in the future credit authorship
